Some weights of the model checkpoint at allenai/longformer-base-4096 were not used when initializing LongformerForSequenceClassification: ['lm_head.decoder.weight', 'lm_head.layer_norm.weight', 'lm_head.dense.bias', 'lm_head.bias', 'lm_head.layer_norm.bias', 'lm_head.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing LongformerForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing LongformerForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of LongformerForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at allenai/longformer-base-4096 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
There are 3 GPU(s) available.
We will use the GPU: Tesla T4
