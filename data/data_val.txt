Hi,

	Being a Electronic Engineering Student with only Electronic II under
my belt, I find myself *needing* to build a moderate wattage Audio Amp. So, 
I'll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the 'net'! Please Explain how Watts are calculated in Audio Amp circuits. No,
Not P=I*E, Just how it relates to one of the following:

	Ai [Current Gain]
	Av [Voltage Gain]
	Ap [Power Gain]
	or whatever. cheap I.E <$20 schematic for a 20W amp, but
I would like to Cross/improve the circuit. The problem is that the parts
list has IC1 and IC2 as NEC70001AB amplifiers. This schematic was published in a 1991 mag
so it may be non-existant now. Anyway, I tried looking up a replacement in
the latest Digi-key Cat and found it  not listed 8(. The closes I could
figure was a 9 pin SIP as TDA1520BU. I thought, hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using 741 opamp 
models. But, I guess the 741 wasn't made for High
power amps. As a result, I got a Voltage gain of ~15mV/V. Worse than
I started with 8(... Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yet
good gain? How about some models for some of the chips listed in this 
E-mail? Any ASCII Chip info you guys can send me? I'm open to Suggestions/Ideas/Comments/Help! Please E-mail since I have little time to search the News... 
And I'll post if there's and interest! John

This is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this 
doctrine:


                        THE DOCTRINE OF GOD


I.   THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD
     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most
     important. The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. I
     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in
     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each
     possessing the same divine attributes. They are also
     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17. THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD. A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for
         Himself: Jehovah. He is the living God, eternal, and
         unchanging. He is without beginning, and without
         ending. As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,
         patient, and full of lovingkindness. Psa 89:1,2;
         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7. He is absolutely
         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of
         sinning in though, word, or action. God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power. A.  In creation
          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in
          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining
          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs
          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end
          of time. B.  In salvation
         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is
         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,
         active in salvation. God, the Father
             Salvation originated with God. b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the
                  Father had chosen. The
                  work of salvation will be completed for us when
                  the Lord returns. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-
                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2. The Holy Spirit
             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is
             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is
             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the
             following ways:
             a.   He convicts of sin. John 16:7-11
             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new
                  birth). c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work
                  of sanctification. d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making 
                  salvation secure. e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of
                  Christ. 12:13
             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of
                  Scripture. g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of 
                  God for ministry. 1 Cor 12
             h.   He restrains sin. i.   He empowers for living and for service. Acts 1:8

          Hints and Tips for the Adaptec 1540/1542 SCSI adapter


     This document contains hints and tips for getting the Adaptec
1540/1542 SCSI adapter to work with various hardware and software
packages. They are based upon my experiences with an Adaptec 1542A
controller, and will, hopefully, help others. This document may be freely
copied for personal use only, and may not be reprinted in a for-profit
publication without the consent of the author. If it's not, it's
probably because:

     1. Congratulations -- this appears to be a
	winning solution. On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would
   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting
   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my
   C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted). For me, these crashes
   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE
   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is
   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1. * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0
	for MSDOS. Note that the documentation and driver are stored in
	different directories. However, because these parity errors occur only during disk
accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the
parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off
timing for certain disk transfers might cause this). I've run various
memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no
problems. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors. Normally, while doing a tape backup
or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with
only an occasional pause. This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer
than necessary. Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by
starving memory refresh. Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered
that using a different floppy controller solves it. I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542. On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to
the 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different
controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my
1542. I don't know what the cause really is;
however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider
trying a new floppy controller. Although the QEMM
  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that
  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM
  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install
  program -- I haven't tested any other version). * Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one
  gigabyte in size. * To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and
  some drivers. driver package, which is made by the
	same people that make CorelDRAW! Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large
	number of SCSI tape drives. It comes with SCSI drivers
	(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup. does not come with, but
	requires, ASPI4DOS. * I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:

	I think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general. The
processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the
computer is used in its designed purpose. Comparing processor speed is
pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed
to increase speed among other things. I mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without 
giving is operational conditions? Can you say the same when 
you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions. Knowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to 
its FPU and 486 does, can you say that 040 is still faster? Anyway, I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers
is good or not solely on its processor. Or how fast a processor is
based on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to a
processor to speed it up. But if we restrict our arguements to, for example, pure
processor architectural issues. Or how one processor will work
well and another will not based on its design, then we can get
somewhere with our discussions. - Chung Yang

This is a two-sided problem. Unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time. The "breeding" of these low-life's is getting worse; our justice system is at best
extremely weak to handle these problems. That is why low-abiding citizens should have
the power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary 
anywhere a threat is imminent. My Camaro (my pride and joy) got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back. The persons that did that were eventually caught (lucky for me!) On another occasion, on my way from Texas to Florida, I had stopped in a small motel
for the night in a small town somewhere in Florida. About 5 youths were disturbing my
car, setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out. When I and another tenant
walked out with a 357 Magnum and a 45 automatic respectively, they vanished. Needless to say, I immediately packed-up and left. Watch out for car-jacking and staged accidents.

descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions
of It. This is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle, and,

My girlfriend just started taking Imitrex for her migraine headaches. Her
neurologist diagnosed her as having depression and suffering from rebound
headaches due to daily doses of analgesics. She stopped taking all
analgesics and caffine as of last Thursday (4/15). The weekend was pretty
bad, but she made it through with the help of Imitrex about every 18 hours. Her third injection of Imitrex, during the worst of the withdrawl on
Friday and six hours after the first of the day, left her very sick. Skin
was flushed, sweating, vomiting and had severe headache pain. Since then, she has been taking Imitrex as needed to
control the pain. Immediately after taking it, she has increased head pain
for ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains. A friend
of hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of Imitrex because it had caused
heart attacks in several people. Apparently the mild chest pains were
common in these other people prior to there attacks. My girlfriend also has Mitral
Valve Prolapse. Opinions are mine or others but definately not MDA's! Lauger@ssdgwy.mdc.com

As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of  
late. It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  
day. The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  
can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  
application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  
that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  
need to re-boot. Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS. When I  
first got it it had 4Mg of memory. It ran windows fine (not too many  
GPF's). Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  
(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS. The Leading edge  
machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  
the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  
the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  
was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  
board. The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  
SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  
fine by the BIOS RAM check. The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  
rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  
the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  
these GPF are not reproducible at will. I have gone through and entire  
day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  
in the sppace of 20 minutes? This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  
diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  
problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  
Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or  
gdi.exe. Any help is truly appreciated.....

|Question #2

|As I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns. |Is there any way to get around this provision? Oak Park also has an illegal handgun
ban as well, but does allow those with a "collectors FFL" to possess
("collectible?") |What would the penalty if you were found out be? |What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment 
|there? How would the city law apply to your impending 
|trial for the shooting? There was an actual incident
in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a
handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand,
a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend
himself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA
Director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided
not to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs
has it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his
house, and told him: "this is stepping over the line; this could get
dangerous for you." Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers
watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief
and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family. |Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons? Short barreled
|shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, 
|either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin). L.V. Cipriani states that the "Any other weapon" category is allowed,
but the exact relationship between an Ithaca Auto-burgular, which I
believe is in the "Any other weapon" category and a chopped barrel
H&K HK-94 (Class 3 for sure) is not clear to me...

|One more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being
|rich or famous or related to the mayor? As long as Democrats reign in Chicago, Illinois
residents will always be disarmed and helpless in the streets. Politicians
get around this by provisions in the law that allow them to carry
concealed weapons. Voters in Chicago are too stupid to vote these a**holes
out of office; because the Dems are always in power, the Illinois 
Supreme Court is always tilted to the Democratic Party's views on guns. [All candidates supported by political consultant David Axelrod are
anti-gun, which explains anti-RKBA Crook County States Attorney 
Jack(ass) O'Malley being a so-called "Republican."] Get rid of the Chicago Democrats, get rid of their members on the IL
Judiciary, and you got a fighting chance of a preemption law and a CCW
law...

anything else"
It bothers me that I cannot seem to find a satisfactory

>  NOW WHERE DID I LEAVE THOSE PLIERS? When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56
 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers
 lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB. The tool survived
 the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot
 altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC. NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,

    "It's been a long time since something like this happened. We've
 lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this." The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a
 Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on
 April 2nd. Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the
 report and Discovery was launched with its "extra payload". NASA
 officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th
 launch date. The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB
 technician. When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,
 its 18-inch long rope was still attached. The pliers were found in a
 part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad. note:  naaahhh,  just too easy)

    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that
 the Shuttle processor will take "appropriate action". Thiokol is a
 subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch. _________________________________________________________

Hi! If you create a new floppy for your a: drive (that is the 5 1/4"), turn on
the "modify" switch of vga-copy. When you boot using this diskette, a message appears:

This is no system disk, you can
1) replace disk with another,
2) boot from Harddisk or
3) switch drives and reboot (that is, a: becomes b:, b: becomes a:)
Type your choice:

When you select the third item, you can boot from b: which is now called a: . Seems to work very good, for example booting drdos6 from the installation disks
in 3.5" format was no problem for a friend of mine (I have only a 3.5" a: drive)

Hope that helps

In a previous article, dleonar@andy.bgsu.edu (Pixie) says:

>     Do the words "Question Authority" mean anything to you? Well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes. You have to be very careful about what you mean by "question authority". That which is authoratative is authoratative,
and to say "I question to word of this authority" is ridiculous. If it is 
open to question, it isn't an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly
reasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase
here should be "authenticate authority." Once you have authenticated
your authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as
an authority. The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You 
can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency
in what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of
discourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in
inself, accredit it. ( Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and 
other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.) I cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, 
because if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don't need an 
authority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which
I cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must
do it by some means other than by examining its teachings. In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't
have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist
woring today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts
of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to 
verify for himself. In spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source 
ofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. ( I am
a Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem
the strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for
belief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do). The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a
reasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty. If you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of
every receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly
change. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific. To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to deny
God's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very
nature, prove anything. --

My wife has one of these. I have not had much chance to fiddle with

complains that the print is too light for her taste. The difference
is quite apparent even when the print setting on the Select 310 is
adjusted to the darkest possible level. I don't find it
objectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that some

Well I think it in 1969 the Montreal Canadians finished 1st (although
there was no President's cup in those days) and missed the playoffs 
in 1970. I do recall that the 1970 playoff picture wasn't decided until
the final day, when the NY Rangers defeated the RedWings. The tie-breaker was
the number of goals for (if I remember correctly), so the Rangers played
with an empty net for the entire game. Some Hab loyalists accused 
the Wings of 'throwing' the game to keep them out, but as I recall, 
Gordie and Delvecchio had the flu, so coach Sid Abel sat them out,
and the Rangers swarmed the RedWings most of the night.

I have a question regarding sending a NULL character across ethernet

the NULL character for setting a mark and unfortunately we don't know
how to sent that from IBM PCs across ethernet. I am wondering if anyboy

I just mailed this:

I noticed a 2-3in long cut in the tread of the rear tire on my VFR. The cut is only about as deep as the tread block, and looks like it
only scratched the rubber at the base, but the weird thing is, it's
way over on the edge where I haven't scuffed the tire in yet. How dangerous is this, should I replace the tire right away? If I should, since the cut is on the unscuffed portion and the
tire only has about 330 mi on it, what do you think my chances of
getting it replaced under warranty are? To the nedod mailing list, and Jack Tavares suggested I check out
how old the tire is as one tactic for getting it replaced. Does
anyone have the file on how to read the date codes handy? Thanks,

To all hardware and firmware gurus:

My current home project is to build a huge paddle keyboard for a 
physically handicapped relative of mine. My goal is for this keyboard
to look exactly like an AT sytle keyboard to its host system. This will be a highly endowed keyboard with a Little PCL from Z World
at its heart. The only thing I lack is detailed information on the
hardware signaling that the 486 (with  Windows 3.1  and DOS 5.0) will be 
expecting. My project is independant of Windows, my hope is that some of
you fellow Window's users/programmers will recognize what I need and be 
willing to point me in the right direction. I have The Winn L. Rosch Hardware Bible (2nd edition). The HB gives
most (if not all) of the information I will need concerning scan codes 
and even a wire diagram for the PS/2 style connector I will need, but it 
leaves a number of important questions unanswered. Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication? I'm
    guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock. In either
    event, how is the data framed? I'm guessing half-duplex
    since the host can turn LEDs on and off. Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the "AT
    keyboard standard" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)? If anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source of
information) on the above, please advise me at gamet@erg.sri.com. Whatever I do it must be safe for I cannot afford to replace the 486 in
the event of a booboo. Thomas Gamet (gamet@erg.sri.com)

No, it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid
which is an excitatory neurotransmitter. There is also evidence that
excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain
conditions like stroke, drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease, just to name a few. This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid

Pierre,
For purposes of the tie breaker, you only count the first three games in
each city. Therefore, Quebec cannot possibly be ahead of Montreal 4-3,
and there's probably only one game that counts remaining between Boston
and Quebec, which means Boston has probably already won.

Hello,

I am testing a port of X11R5 to Coherent, a unix clone OS for Intel architecture
machines. I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple
terminal emulator program). The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the
server for display, one at a time. The characters appear to be too closely
spaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the 
rightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the 
rightmost edge of the second character, and so on. It looks like there is an
invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous
character. There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns
a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual
characters. If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where I should look to
find it, it would be much appreciated. --

                 |
                ---
                GND

All resistors are equal-value. When the analog switch is closed,
the amp is inverting-gain-of-one. With the switch open, it is
non-inverting-gain-of-one. You can clean up the circuit to trim
out input offset current if this hurts the balance (this would show
up as carrier feed-through). For high frequencies, the slew-rate of the opamp might cause problems,
especially if it isn't symmetrical (and it usually isn't). --

as by Josh McDowell, about whom I have no comment, having never read his
work.) Anyone who thinks that C. S. Lewis was self-righteous ought to read his
introduction to The Problem of Pain, which is his theodicy. In it, he
explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously. Although he
believed in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to
presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own
suffering. He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself
as some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what
he considered himself to be -- "a great coward." OFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be
embarrassed by Lewis' liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is
part of a *much* bigger discourse.) I would just like to add that, far from
being embarrassed by Lewis, I am in a state of continual amazement at the

I had a similar reaction to Chinese food but came to a completly different
conclusion. I've eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems. I went
with some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest. and they ordered
lots of stuff I had never seen before. The only thing I can remember of that
meal was the first course, scallops served in the shell with a soy-type sauce. I thought, "Well, I've only had scallops once and I was sick after but that
could have been a coincidence". That night as I sat on the bathroom floor,
sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way, I decided I would never touch
another scallop. I may not be allergic but I don't want to take the chance.

This list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing
acronyms in the space-related newsgroups. If I forgot or botched your
favorite acronym, please let me know! Also, if there's an acronym *not*
on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure
it out, I'll add it to the list. Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*
acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic. If I incorporated
every acronym I ever saw, I'd soon run out of disk space! :-)

The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days. All
comments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu. Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your
own for figuring out what they *mean*! Note also that the total number of
acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that
are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted. Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of
the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply
different ways of referring to the same thing. Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of
the list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),
who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in
character than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),
who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and
terms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately). Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA
Reference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and
Associated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly
mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs. At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program

Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X

lightweight Objects, such as Interviews Glyphs
Structured Graphics
Resolution independence
Natural C++ programming interface
edit-in-place embedding
distributed user interface components
Multithreading

Seminary in Pasadena, CA. I've been working long and hard to try to
get in there and have said many hours of prayer. I'm very excited for
this opportunity, but also very nervous about it. I'd appreciate the prayers of the readers of this group for my preparation
for school this summer and for my career as a graduate student. I'd also
appreciate any information any of the readers of this group might have 
about Fuller, Pasadena, or California in general, like good places to
have fun, good churches to check out, or anything else that might be
good for me to know. Also, if anyone knows of any foundations that 
might have funding or scholarship money available, please let me know! Of course, if you wish to make a personal contribution.....:)

The contract for my current job is over at the end of April. I'll be
taking a couple classes at UT this summer and then I'll be moving to
Pasadena. Hopefully, I'll be able to get net.access next fall, although
Fuller doesn't have it itself. I've enjoyed the interesting discussions and I commend everyone for their

Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart. Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhat
shaky) innings giving up just one run. Three
picthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inning
and blew the save opportunity. Despite their problems in the pen, I think the Rockies are a team that wont
be taken lightly. Going into today's game, the had the league's leading

It is silly to make this statement. Fifteen minutes after the fire

that the DV's committed suicide. It would seem logical that the

Us easterners who have newspapers with editors
unsympathetic to playoff pools, often don't get
summaries from west coast games since they
finish too late at night for the morning edition. I (and I'm sure others too) would greatly appreciate
it if scoring summaries of west coast playoff games
could be posted to this group right away. basically, all we need are goal scorers and assists,
don't bother with times, penalties, shots etc...

this would make a lot of pool-obsessed people very
happy. I guess with the Senators out golfing now, the 
local papers have lost interest.

another company. Ah, well, I guess that's what I get when I assume the

It might pay to start looking at what this proposal might mean to a
police agency. It just might be a bad idea for them, too. OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone. They
need a warrant, just like the old days. But unlike the old days, they
now need to 

   (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of
       the key. Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses? Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit. State
and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics,
while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost,
statutes of limitations run out, etc. Not to mention: a moderately
clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying
new phones faster than tap requests can be processed. [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting
without a dialing license?] There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house, 
how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated? Put in enough
safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and 
it might take a LONG time to get that key. [Even when a request is approved, 
how is the key going to be disclosed? Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type
chip for transmission? In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal
Government, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of
the projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links. How many of 
these kinds of problems will be open for public or "expert" scrutiny?] Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around, 
even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue. This would be 
an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a 
key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political 
embarassment. So, the Feds implement it this way:
 
   (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and
       turns the results over to the NY State Police. But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton
Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal. Or there just happens to be a turf war
going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case. Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an
extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another
bargaining chit. I understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain. +========================================================================+

   Well, here it is, NHL in the year 2000. I got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and 
although I initially thought I had just been taking too many too strong 
drugs now it seems the realization has really begun...  You can see the 
league has already started to move to this direction. *The Walt Disney Conference*
Anaheim Mighty Chipmunks    -Franchise name to be changed after each new 
LA Kings                      hockey movie         
LA Flames                   -We've seen some of that
San Jose Sharks
San Diego Bruins
Tijuana Red Wings   -Detroit's hockey team will follow its car industry...
Dallas Stars           
Houston Oilers
Texas Rangers
Seattle Canucks

   *The Norm Green Conference*
Alabama White Hawks
Biloxi Blues
Tampa Bay Lightning
Miami Blades
Helsinki Jets        -You've heard them starting getting used to the anthem
Montreal Quebecois (sp?) -There will be no 'Canada'
Atlanta Devils
Orlando Penquins
Key West Islanders
Hartford Whalers                        The Whalers will never move, huh? Palm Beach Capitals

  Now that the Anahaim team is becomming real I'm really beginning to believe
the rest of the 'message'. I'm sure the future will turn you into believers 
too. After 2000 the NHL will abandond ice-rinks. It's so expensive to cool 
down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is 
anyway. NHL will become a roller skating hockey league. That way it can 
create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the 
game in their back yards ! There won't REALLY be a Disney team in Anaheim, will there?

True 914 enthusiasts will be able to give you a better answer then this
but I'll dump my impressions. I've wanted to own a 914 for about 10 years
now; came close once but I ended up buying a Fiero instead (biggest mistake
of my life!) Anyway, for $4000 you should be able to get a nice car but your also set
in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit. The most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the
engine and passenger compartment. Also look for chassis welded together
here. Oh yeah, the price range you are talking about must be the 4 banger;
a 6 (if you could find one) would be mucho more bucks. Parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by (for an old car) and you
can even locate crude in the JC Whitney catalog if you have too. The machine itself is pretty simple (they use the spare tire for windshild
washer instead of a pump fer chris sake!) so getting it fixed by a good
bug/porsche mechanic would be easy. Since it is mid-engine you may spend
more on labor for any mechanical work. --

His designated point-getter remarks were not only meant for Lemieux,

and as the Leafs started their second half roll, and before
Gilmour's great season was being recognized by many people.

TRANSLATION

 The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material
nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free
from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be
established in the self. PURPORT

 All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three
modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which
cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive
activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of
sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,
as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to
the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the
beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme
transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are
struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of
the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get
rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense
gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the
chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the
Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a
part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the
beginning of transcendental life. As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in
the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities
such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating
such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This
transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one
is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.

Anyone out there have a Sony 1304S? I have one, and it's very nice, however - If I run it in 16" mode, the

go very big. I end up with about 1" gap either side, and .5" top &
bottom. I suspect
an internal adjustment would fix this. Another problem is sub-brightness: Areas that are meant to be black (or
off the main
raster) are not very black. The real raster is quite visible when the
screen is blanked. This is not too severe, but it is just not as good as other Trini screens
I have
used. If I turn the brightness/contrast down so that the raster is not
visible, the
real image virtually disappears! The raster size is just right if I use 1024*768, but 100dpi+ is a bit too

If I recall correctly, the bill would provide for concealed carry if
the person takes a 15-hr DPS safety course in firearms and pays a $150

but LtGov Bullock has said it will never come to the floor of the

I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've 
transcribed some of my notes below. Since my note taking ability is by no means
infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine. Permission is 
granted to copy this without restriction. The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3
scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO. The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale 
experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and
determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements. While I don't think the details
of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope
they aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will
be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples. The
main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs. I assume that
this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I
did not verify that. The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in 
mid-flight. Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down. Mr Nelson
showed the following plot of acceleration vs time:

As mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below
3. Initially, all eight engines are started. As the vehicle  burns fuel the
accelleration increases. As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are 
throtled back. However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it
soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether. This causes the dip in 
accelleration at about 100 seconds. Eventually the remaining sustainer engines
bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut
out entirely. The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit. Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given. He also apparently had a good 
    propulsion example, but was told not to use it. My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting
national security or MD protecting their own interests? The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch
up maneuver. The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and 
the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange. He showed graphs
of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,
and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate. The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have
about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about 
60 degrees south latitude. --

  cursor). I don't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem. Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions: a remove-
  for-draw, which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove-
  unconditionally. Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem? - The VESA driver does not support the 640x480x16M TrueColor mode. ( Universal

Politics is of course Dirty Pool, old man, and here we have a classic
example: the NSA and the administration have been working on this for
a *long* time, and in parallel with the announcement to us techies, we
see they're hitting the press with propoganda. It's my bet the big magazines - Byte, Scientific American, et all - will
be ready to run with a pre-written government-slanted story on this in
the next issue. ('Just keep us some pages spare boys, we'll give you
the copy in time for the presses')

We *must* get big names in the industry to write well argued pieces against
this proposal (can you call it that when it's a de facto announcement?) and
get them into the big magazines before too much damage is done. It would be well worth folks archiving all the discussions from here since
the day of the announcement to keep all the arguments at our fingertips. I
think between us we could write quite a good piece. Now, who among us carries enough clout to guarantee publication?

Subject: When is a couple married...
Organization: University of Alaska
Lines: 31


     I used to be a marriage commissioner for the Alaska Court
System (sort of a justice of the peace). I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse
bathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples
would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and
divine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realize
that marriage is God's institution, not the state's. Gradually,
however, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a
strictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both
the state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was
really conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no
greater moral or religious implications than if I had been
conducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony,
to "please hurry it up" may have helped me to this conclusion). I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp
distinction between marriage before God, and "marriage" before
the state, until I had to deal with my own divorce. Keeping
Matthew 19:6 in mind, I felt that the state had no business
dissolving my marriage established before God, but of course it
assumed jurisdiction nonetheless. I would ask those of you proposing answers to this
question to consider this issue's logical extension: If
intercourse, or the mental intent of the parties, or the
ceremony of the church, or any combination thereof, establishes
marriage, then at what moment is it dissolved? Karl Thoennes III

Are breathable liquids possible? I remember seeing an old Nova or The Nature of Things where this idea was
touched upon (it might have been some other TV show). If nothing else, I know
such liquids ARE possible because...

They showed a large glass full of this liquid, and put a white mouse (rat?) Since the liquid was not dense, the mouse would float, so it was held down
by tongs clutching its tail. The thing struggled quite a bit, but it was
certainly held down long enough so that it was breathing the liquid. It never
did slow down in its frantic attempts to swim to the top. Now, this may not have been the most humane of demonstrations, but it certainly
shows breathable liquids can be made. --

AFTER FOREVER

Have you ever thought about your soul--
     can it be saved? Or perhaps you think that when you're dead
     you just stay in you grave. Is God just a thought within you read in a book
     when you were at school? When you think about death 
     Do you lose your breath
     Or do you keep your cool? Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope? Yes I have seen the light
     and I've changed my ways. And I'll be prepared 
     When you're lonely and scared
     at the end of your days. Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believed in God above? They should realize before they criticise
That God is the only way to love. Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run? Will you still sneer when death is near
And say they may as well worship the sun? I think it was true -it was people like you
     that crucified Christ. I think it is sad the opinion you had
     was the only one voiced. Will you be so sure when your day is near
     to say you don't believe? You had the chance but you turned it down
     now you can't retrieve. Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead & gone
Open your eyes, just realize that He is the one. The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate. LORD OF THIS WORLD

You're searching for your mind don't know where to start. Can't find the key to fit the lock on your heart. You think you know but you are never quite sure
Your soul is ill but you will not find a cure. Your world was made for you by someone above
But you choose evil ways instead of love. You made me master of the world where you exist
The soul I took from you was not even missed. Lord of the world,
Evil Possessor,
Lord of this world,
He's now your confessor! You think you're innocent -you've nothing to fear
You don't know me, you say, but isn't it clear? You turned to me in all your worldly
    greed and pride. But will you turn to me when it your turn to die?

Subject: EC BHP limit vetoed
Lines: 12

According to BBC Radio this morning, UK, Denmark, Portugal & a few
others have vetoed a proposal to limit EC-sold bikes to 100 BHP. The
reason is that such a limit is not supported by accident statistics - a
rare example of governmental wisdom. The limit has a five year
moratorium on it, and "specialist" manufacturers will be exempt anyway. Any suspicion that this is a crafty trick to restrict that end of the
market in Europe to Triumph, Norton (who? :-)), BMW, Cagiva & Ducati is
the sort of dangerous rubbish which stalls GATT talks. Bill @ Univ Edinburgh, replete with 12 hp and a healthy blue exhaust.

"objective morality" to look very "relative." After all, that was the
point of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out
Christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own
principles? If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this
apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:

If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then
He has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick
physically, emotionally, etc. That is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or
detrimental to) the creature He created. Galatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in
	Christ Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared
	beforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them. However, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees
of the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list
of rules and regulations. To some extent, every activity of a
person's life creates a new situation to which morality must be
applied. There never could be enough volumes to codify God's
"objective" morality for us. Throughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of
rules (objectivity, if you please.) In the Old Testament, we have
both principles and specific rules. By the time of Jesus, most of the
principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules. Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the
application of the principles. We [mankind] weren't comfortable with
the "subjectivity" of principles. For reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference
	between the Law and the principles of the Law. For example, in
	verses 21-22:  "You have heard that the ancients were told,
	'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall
	be liable to the court.' But I say to you that everyone who is
	angry with his brother shall be liable to the court..."

The "objective morality" of God gets blurred by our inept
interpretation of it. We [Christians] have made our biggest errors
when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY
what God intended for us. If we [Christians] would stay committed to
seeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all
figured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's
"objective morality" for themselves. If Jesus is who he said he
was/is (and that's the fundamental question,) then HE IS "objective
morality."

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to
have a "dirty" amp. It is very unlikely, however,
   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car. You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for
just the amplifier. It is possible that a 100 watt
   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet 
   away. Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding. If you experience the problem frequently, it may be 
   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station
   nearby. The interference may have been caused by a radio 
   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,
   etc. If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are
   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter. The interference is probably
   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can
   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them). Good instructions are included with the chokes. There are things
   a radio operator can do to reduce interference. And please remember to be friendly when approaching your
local radio operator. This person may or may not be the 
cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation
and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most
are). It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes
dealt with as I grew up. We were blamed for skip (ghost
pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b. interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it. BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or
not he or she is directly responsible. It is part of
being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it. Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers
to take any precautions. Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB. Ham operators are
required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more
than 10). So if you hear "This is WA1QT" or some other call starting
with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham. CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required
to) and fire/police have other private ids. --

the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the
Hojali disaster. " I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to
be alive." Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity
for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12
days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the
2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the
edge of Karabakh. Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction
of  the  attack. To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam
about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,
until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two
Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak. "None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by
a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening
fire," Mr Sadikov said. Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward
to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts
were mostly  in vain. Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his
group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman
son. Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his
67-year-old elder brother. "I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"
he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. " We
have never got any of the bodies back." The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he
struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's
crossing, Mr Sadikov said. As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was
little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was
soon to flee. "The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian
rocket attack. Some people just  kept going," Mr Sadikov said. " I
had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the

I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world
if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population. It is rather a ridiculous question in some ways, I know, but my newsreader is
down so I am not getting any new postings for a bit, so I figure I might as
well post something new myself. Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a
higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking. The
typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the
same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the
other, qualitatively. But then again a measuring stick must be drawn
somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core,
than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it
expresses its own selfishness. Idle thoughts...

	Two thoughts. - I think that psychologically it will be easier for the next 
generation to accept genetic manipulation. It seems that people frown
upon 'messing with Nature', ignoring our eons-old practice of doing just that. Any new human intervention is 'arrogance and hubris' and manipulation
we routinely do is 'natural' and certainly 'not a big deal'. - Most interesting human traits will probably be massively
polygenetic and be full of trade-offs. In addition, without a positive
social environment for the cultivation of genetic gifts, having them won't
be the advantage it's made out to be. Some people will certainly pursue it
as if it is the Grail, but we know how most of those quests turn out.

Subject: Q: Colormaps with dialog shells
Organization: MIT Media Laboratory
Lines: 17


I have an applicationShell which uses a colormap created with
XCreateColormap() and uses all of the colors available for my 8-bit
display. When I move the cursor over the window I get the "Technicolor
Effect" - which is fine. My problem/question is: When I popup a dialogShell to prompt the user for
some input I want the XmNdialogStyle to be set to
XmDIALOG_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_MODAL. The result is that if my cursor is
over the dialogShell I get my colormap, but if the cursor is over the
applicationShell (or any window other than the dialogShell) I get the
default colormap. But I'd like it so that if my cursor is over _any_
window of my application, I get my colormap.

We recently got an NCD X-terminal to evaluate. This is running XRemote over
a serial line. I wanted to get some measurement of response time, so I wrote a small Xlib
program which simply creates a window, maps it and sends the first Expose 
event to itself. The program times the delay from sending the event, to 
receiving it. I thought this was the simplest way to test client/X-server 
round-trip delays. It's a similar concept to the ping(8C) program. I've also tried the xbench program, available
from ftp.uu.net, which bombards the server with graphics operations, but I 
just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is "acceptable" interactive 
response time. Has anyone got any ideas on this subject ? afielden@mlsma.att.com)

      | "Oh, yes, I just remembered. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were 
walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls. There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps. Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her 
forehead, and on her lips . . . She wanted to tell me 
something, but she couldn't. And then she says,
"Maybe it'll be too late." She 
says, "I don't know anything, leave me alone." I 
don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. The way he cried "Mamma" made my skin crawl. It wasn't even a day, of those several 
hours. The women were afraid to go because they thought
that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become
so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide. We heard those 
people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. I 
had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, "Lyuda, your 
Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are 
alive and well and that you're here." One of the guys said 
that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front
of the Kosmos movie theater. They say that they lost the list of the dead. They told him that the list had disappeared and they
should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over
again. One of them
is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. They beat her father, he was holding 
the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and 
when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her 
braid. I know which building he lived in and I know his 
sisters' faces. It was only then
that I saw the way they had left our apartment. That's 
enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't
even know anything about books. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our 
apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina
because he was in the apartment the whole time. I didn't see the woman because 
people were clinging to the podium like flies. She was there with her father, for some reason she 
doesn't have a mother. They called the school board director
and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to 
escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. The 
Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went 
with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found 
Azerbaijani corpses. It should be said
that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments
received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans 
will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the 
Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-
tion.

i have a question for you all related to this. jesus condemns divorce
several times in the new testament, and i have a hard time with this. the catholic church (as far as i can tell) does grant annulments with
the statement that the marriage never really existed in God's eyes. (please, if i am mistinterpreting, correct me.) however, i have
witnessed marriages where two people were very much in love but
recognized that they were destroying themselves and each other by
staying in a marriage, and that the problems were due to personal
childhood issues that had never been resolved. i ask you, is divorce
justified in such a case? they knew who they were, what they were
doing, they were deeply in love, but in the end, it did not work out. i must admit that i don't see jesus forcing them to live together, or
even condemning that they go and seek happiness with someone else
later on. vera

[This is a commonly discussed question, though it's been long enough
that I'll allow it to be asked. As you might expect, there is a range
of answers. Catholics and some others will say that divorce is never
justified. (By the way, in situations where someone is being abused,
or for other serious cause, separation is allowed by all traditions
that I know. No one should be forced to stay in a situation where
they are in danger.) Others see it as a last resort in situations
that have fallen apart badly enough that the best we can hope for is
to choose the lesser of evils. In some sense the difficult legal
question turns out not to be divorce, but remarriage. That's because
of Jesus' statement in Mark 10:11-12 and par. As with so many other
things, this turns on your approach to the Bible. Conservative
Protestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions. More liberal ones are willing to make allowances for situations where
a literal interpretation would lead to painful results. (It is noted
that at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almost
on a whim. Thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach is
that Jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing, not
to establish an absolute rule to which there could never be
exceptions.) Catholics, as is typical with Catholic ethics, take a
theoretical hard line, but allow for exceptions in practice through
the process of anullment. In the last discussion most of our
non-Catholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance that
in some cases there might be no good alternative, but there was a
feeling that the church should often be doing a better job of
helping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems that
come up during it, and that in a properly run church, divorce
should not be necessary.

CONSTANTS AND EQUATIONS FOR CALCULATIONS

    This list was originally compiled by Dale Greer. Numbers in parentheses are approximations that will serve for most
    blue-skying purposes. Unix systems provide the 'units' program, useful in converting
    between different systems (metric/English, etc.) Ref: J.R Williams, "The Energy Level
	of Things", Air Force Special Weapons Center (ARDC), Kirtland Air
	Force Base, New Mexico, 1963. Also see "The Effects of Nuclear
	Weapons", compiled by S. Glasstone and P.J. Dolan, published by the
	US Department of Defense (obtain from the GPO). EQUATIONS

	Where d is distance, v is velocity, a is acceleration, t is time. Additional more specialized equations are available from:

	    ames.arc.nasa.gov:pub/SPACE/FAQ/MoreEquations


	For constant acceleration
	    d = d0 + vt + .5at^2
	    v = v0 + at
	  v^2 = 2ad

	Acceleration on a cylinder (space colony, etc.) Change in velocity required for a plane change of angle phi in a
	circular orbit:

	    delta V = 2 sqrt(GM/r) sin (phi/2)

	Energy to put mass m into a circular orbit (ignores rotational
	velocity, which reduces the energy a bit). GMm (1/Re - 1/2Rcirc)
	    Re = radius of the earth
	    Rcirc = radius of the circular orbit. This fits fairly well except for Neptune. Basic rocketry numbers & equations
	Aerodynamical stuff
	Energy to put a pound into orbit or accelerate to interstellar
	    velocities.

   Although I realize that principle is not one of your strongest

fixation on Israel must stop. You might have to start asking the
same sort of questions of Arab countries as well. You realize it
would not work, as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the
last several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel would
begin to look like the biased attack that it is. Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for
Policy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot
who hates Israel. Why don't you try being honest about your hatred of Israel? I
have heard that your family once lived in Israel, but the members
of your family could not cut the competition there. Is this actually not
about Israel, but is really a personal vendetta? Why are you not
the least bit objective about Israel? Do you think that the name
of your phony-baloney center hides your bias in the least? Haven't you realized yet that when you post
such stupidity in this group, you are going to incur answers from
people who are armed with the truth? Haven't you realized that a
piece of selective data here and a piece there does not make up a

people who read this group are not as stupid as you would hope or
need them to be. This is not the place for such pseudo-analysis. You will be continually ripped to shreds, until you start to show
some regard for objectivity. Or you can continue to show what an
anti-Israel zealot you are, trying to disguise your bias behind a
pompous name like the 'Center for Policy Research.' You ought to
know that you are a laughing stock, your 'Center' is considered a
joke, and until you either go away, or make at least some attempt
to be objective, you will have a place of honor among the clowns,
bigots, and idiots of Usenet.

with the ground connected to the neutral. For 99.9% of the things you

WHile we are on the subject of the shuttle software. what ever happened to the hypothesis  that the shuttle flight software
was a major factor in the loss of 51-L.  to wit,  that during the
wind shear event,  the Flight control software  indicated a series
of very violent engine movements that shocked and set upa harmonic
resonance  leading to an overstress of the struts.

  There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the
X11R5 distribution. Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program...
(take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using
on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep
it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they
were just about equal. The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous
sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your
application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when
debugging SHM apps). Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.
Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be
attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes
XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24
bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to
support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using
pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to
use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one
copies the info three times per redraw instead of one). In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a
Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick
whatever feels fastest. (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)

Therein lies the rub. The HD slash cut, or baloney cuts as some call

What they would need to do, though, is make sure that nobody has
access to decent crypto in the first place. They probably can't
tell Clippered voice from Clippered triple-DESed voice until they
get their copy of your key. Any criminal who's going to use
encryption will do it under cover of Clipper. The only way to avoid
this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption. I probably shouldn't say this, but they could try to detect the use
of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical
properties of the plaintext. An old-fashioned wiretap could then
detect the use of pre-encryption, which would drastically increase
the measured entropy of the input. A countermeasure to this would
be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice. You can tell if the NSA built this feature in: blow on the mike, and
observe whether a band of thugs comes through your ceiling. PGP 2 key by finger or e-mail

DEPOSITION OF LYUDMILA GRIGOREVNA M.

   Born 1959
   Teacher
   Sumgait Secondary School No. We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the
price was too great! My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought
that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all
our family survived. But Mother was detached, pale, as 
though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door
to the bedroom was only open a crack. They 
were mostly young people, under 30. They twisted his arms and took 
him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there,
because he was already unable to walk. She said, "Come on, let's straighten this out, without 
emotions. They did what they would do every day if they 
weren't afraid of the authorities. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that
they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up
with their hands, I was up in the air. And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a
couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to 
kill her, his very own sister. I heard about it all from the neighbor 
from the Melkumians' landing. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I had heard a lot 
about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too
much. I don't know his last name, his first name is 
Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure,
she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she 
didn't want to endanger him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was
told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album. She says, "I realized that my death would come from that 
person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing." I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to 
take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he
had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. That's just what he said, "those Azerbaijanis," as though he himself were not 
Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, "I'll drive
them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails
and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41." He threw it over my shoulders, I
was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. They talked among 
themselves and smoked. All these years I've been living in God-awful places." Then they 
said, "Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause.

I have to disagree with this. I have a 92 Z28 with a 350 and a 4-speed auto
w/ overdrive, and it is really better that way. Chevy autos are reknowned
for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power. I live 
in the Dallas area, and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic 
here. Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to, a manual would be
more fun. Safety-wise, an auto is less distracting...I would hate to have to be    
shifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here. Performance-wise, I can hold my own against any stock 5.0 Mustang or 5.0
Camaro w/ a five speed. All of this IMHO... :)

s.r.c.b-s. I will make the case here though and try to help you out:

8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it
is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. Yes, it is by God's grace and our faith that we are saved. However,

15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. Keeping Christ's commandments is a "work" per se, and a demonstration of
our love for him. Also,

6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his
vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years
I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why
cumbereth it the ground? 8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I
shall dig about it, and dung it:
9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it
down. Again,

16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye
should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that
whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being
love, joy, peace, patience, etc. All of these are things that are manifest
in the actions that we carry out. If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things
Christ commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith. Asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade
on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your
pants is more important. Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith. To have faith,
true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands. The parable
above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit. Christs
commands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit,
then we shall be uprooted just like the tree. It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it. Actions
prove our faith and show the genuineness of it. I can sit and talk for
days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a
building and not hit the ground. In other words, I can sit and tell you
all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly. I really don't have
that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the
test. I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but
this should be sufficient. Jon

objective ADJ. Of or having to do with a material object as

Ben,

Since you're obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works,
the only thing short of repairing it that I can think of is a thorough
cleaning of all the parts, and then checking for the proper placement of
the little blue rollers. Since they aren't fixed in position on their
stainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different
position. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of
contact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing
the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the
ball, not the center cylindrical area. I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but
needs to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our
office's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one
could still adjust the roller slightly. I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If
you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl 
alcohol. If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see
if it is actually causing the axle to spin. If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-( It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be
necessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that
dirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction. Hope this helps,

Murray

From where I come from in Canada, Borshevsky sounds more Canadian than
Smith! -) Anyways, crawl back into the hole you crawled out of...the NBA doesn't
care where they get basketball players from, major league baseball
doesn't give a damn where they get baseball players from (except Cuba,
that is). Canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary 
supplier of players...Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia
are all relatively small countries, and cannot really produce players
at a greater rate than they are already producing them, and the
potential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely blunted
because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and
will take a decade or two, to recover and become a real threat, and
the US will just maintain its slow increase. Canada should continue
to supply 60% plus of the top hockey players in the world for the
forseeable future. Besides we need the European hockey market if hockey is to take
its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world
sports...and since soccer is essentially boring, unlike hockey. >    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about "Pavel Bure, the

Canadians are under no threat...the European numbers will soon saturate,
if they haven't already...and by the time Russia comes online again,
the NHL should be a world league, and there will be many more teams
to stock and many more jobs for Canadian hockey players. In the near
team, the percentage of Canadians will mostly decline because of 
Americans, not because of Europeans. >    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures

                         April 9 - 15, 1993

SPACECRAFT

1. On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire
celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)
swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities. On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked
to the spacecraft without incident. This sequence covers spacecraft activity
from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay
Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993. The command loss timer was set to
11 days as a part of this sequence memory load. On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss
timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase. On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments. Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly. On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify
the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment
data; long term trend analysis is continuing. On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the
optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps. Preliminary
analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation
index is near the optimal level. On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster
flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed
during the activity. Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal. The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant
changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period. The AC measurement reads
19 DN (4.3 volts). The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts). These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special
anomaly team. Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test
for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21
(Compatibility Test Area 21). The purpose of this test was to verify
the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller
(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA). The TGC/TCA is the replacement
for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA). Seven different telemetry
rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry
Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps. The
10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was
not metering the data correctly. Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS
data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of
the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993. TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows:

	Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)
	Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)
	Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km
	Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds


SPECIAL TOPIC

1. As of April 15, 1993, a total of 70184 real-time commands have been
transmitted to Galileo since Launch. Of these, 65076  were initiated in the
sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process. In the past week, 7 real time commands were transmitted: 6 were initiated in
the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process. Major command activities included commands to reacquire celestial reference,
uplink the EJ-1 sequence memory load, and reset the command loss timer. ___    _____     ___

I don't think the 550 sold very well - most North Americans who ride a standard

materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids
and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low
grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, 
and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat 
sink capacity could offer some military utility for "high ground" military
weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space 
travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as 
Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor 
activity in the global scope of things. It's likely too low to prevent
calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's
too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories
that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna
has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital
sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers
a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,
and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and
heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity
wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them. We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually
ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to
deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more
expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the
easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few
centuries, if not much longer. Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio
astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site
of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for
defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is
unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good
enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for
conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a
bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Gary

Printer model and specification:

Canon CLC 500 (Color Laser Copier)
ps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit)


Hello,

We have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier/printer. We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network. The 
copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface. I have configured the
printer with the "lp" system using the parallel interface and can print 
postscript files to the printer. I can also print rgb files, but these are in 
turn converted to postscript by an internal filter. The Canon CLC 500 is a 
publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts 
are less than acceptable. We create the postscript files with a variaty of 
programs, such as showcase, xv, and tops. When we convert to postscript 
with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 
rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that 
acceptable. Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format
and translating the image into postscript. We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality 
pictures. We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the 
SCSI port. To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a 
warranty. The management here does not want to spend this much money without 
some assurance that the product will work. Here my questions:

If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or 
parallel port? Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts? What is the
limiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on 
the printer? The Big question:

Where can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer? Please email directly to me, I don't not read news on a regular basis. --

You might visit some congregations of Christians, who happen to be homosexuals,
that are spirit-filled believers, not MCC'rs; before you go lumping us all
together with Troy Perry. The Lord IS working in our community (the homosexual community, that is). He's
not asking us to change our sexual nature, but He is calling us to practice
the morality that He established from the beginning. Isn't Satan having a hayday pitting Christian against Christian over any issue
he can, especially homosexuality. Let's not try to change them, just need to bring them to Christ. If He
doesn't want them to be gay, He can change that. If they are living a moral
life, committed to someone of the same sex, and God is moving in their lives,
who are we to tell them they have to change?

Subject: Jose Canseco's Swing - 1992 vs. 1986. Organization: Julio Machado Candlelight Vigil Society
Distribution: na
Lines: 50

Was going over some videos last night.....

Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very
interesting. Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,
circa June 1986. He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,
    not gain more bulk. Conservatively, I'd say he's
    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed. Note that he acts sort of like
    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is
    released. Downing could do this without significant head movement -
    Canseco can't. Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his
    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,
    they're fully closed. Without a good starting point, it's hard
    to make adjustments in your swing. Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,
so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing. First, minimize movement before the swing. Close and widen the stance,
and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing. Hopefully, this
will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move
the bathead more freely. Will cost some power, but until I can find
my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling
the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives. His strength
 is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of
the park. If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back
problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years. --

  Proceedings of the First International 
  Conference on Intelligent Systems for 
  Molecular Biology (eds. L. Hunter, 
  D. Searls, and J. Shavlik) AAAI/MIT
  Press, Menlo Park CA, 1993. Copies will be distributed at the conference to registered 
attendees, and will be available for purchase from the publisher 
afterwards. Material covered will include structural and informational 
molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic 
material, the "central dogma" of gene expression, and selected 
other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as 
relates to current computational approaches. Dr. Noordewier has 
appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and 
has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition 
to his current work in computational biology. 12:00-2:45pm "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for 
 Biologists"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)

An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be 
presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological 
applications. Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming 
languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as 
selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge 
representation, inference, and machine learning. The intended 
audience includes biologists with some computational background, 
but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence. Dr. 
Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has 
worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to 
biological problems in both academia and industry. 3:00-5:45pm "Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory 
 in Biological Sequence Analysis" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos 
 National Laboratory) 

This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of 
intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine 
learning techniques applied to sequence analysis. Closely 
interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical 
neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general 
characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such 
approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic 
views of sequence data. Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical 
Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such 
techniques in this domain. 3:00-5:45pm "Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming" 
 Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)

The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly 
non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally 
inspired by a biological metaphor. This tutorial will cover both 
the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and 
characteristics of the algorithm. Genetic Programming, an 
extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size 
and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will 
also be addressed. Particular attention will be paid to 
biological applications, and to identifying resources and software 
that will permit attendees to begin using the methods. Dr. Koza, 
a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught 
this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in 
the field. 3:00-5:45pm "Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis" 
 Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) 
 & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)

Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies 
are increasingly in evidence. These involve the adaptation of 
tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic 
pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of 
genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the 
identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes 
in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and 
functional relatedness. Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty 
appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, 
represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order 
syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski 
has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area 
of word-based analyses. ORGANIZING COMMITTEE

-> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!! Perhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the
"well regulated malitia." Here is what is says about its character:

	 To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes
	 of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through
	 military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to
	 acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the
	 character of a well-regulated militia, 

It also talks about the "well regulated militia" having a nationally
uniform in structure and disipline. But, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large
group of poeple twice a year. Just to try to get the same people
every year, provide a basic training to new people so they can
be integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it 
requires a continually standing committee of organizers. But I will concide 
a "well organized militia" is not necessarily a "well regulated militia." This deos define the militia, but were is the adjective "well regulated." 10 USC 311 does not define a "well regualed militia" in any way, shape, 
or form. In the same paragraph quoted above, it
talk above "disciplining all the militia of the United States" so they
fit the "character of a well-regulated militia." Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is:
James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the "General Welfare" clause): 
	"Nothing is more natural nor common than first
	to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a
	recital of particulars." 3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:
	   explain an error
The second phrase clearly does not "explain" the first, therefore
the second phrase must "qualify" the first. The definition given
for "qualify" is:
	1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities
	   of; characterize. 2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or 
	   task. 3) To give legal power to; make legally capable. 4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions. 5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate
	6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)
Since "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and
it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task. By process of elimination it must fall into definition #3. And since
#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it
must be the correct definition in this case. I thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more 
evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the 
people's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little 
about the right of an untrained person to "keep and bear" a .50 caliber
machine gun. -> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy
-> our Liberties and Rights. I mean "to destory our Liberties and Rights." So in effort not to force my views and not "to destory our Liberties and
Rights,"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in
the matter of "Liberties and Rights" is the final word. For I am only
one person among many and the final word on "Liberties and Rights" cleary

FAQ for sci.crypt, part 3: Basic Cryptology

This is the third of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are
mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part. * What references can I start with to learn cryptology? * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance? * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it
  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are
  relatively easy to break? So he replaced every A
  by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. The original message is called a plaintext. Encryption means any procedure to convert
  plaintext into ciphertext. A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The
  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,
  Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different
  values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is
  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up
  to the mid-60's. Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or
  Sinkov [SIN66]. The
  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range
  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,
  access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments
  apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89]. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in
  the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of
  DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses
  of many classical cryptosystems. These are not the traditional fare
  of the cryptanalyst. Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered
  practical. The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key
  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret. A
  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect. If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily
  strong? Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical
  cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your
  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same
  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus
  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he
  doesn't have a chance. Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused.

As opposed to Israel's many ways of death. Using bombers and artillery
against Lebanese towns and villages. Using fire arms and lethal
variants of tear gas and *rubber coated* bullets against stone
throwers. Using tanks and anti-tank missiles against homes after a 5
minute evacuation warning. Using Shin Bit's "reasonable" physical
pressure in interrogation. Not counting of course past 
practices such as the bombardment of Beirut in 1982, the bombing of the 
Egyptian school of Bahr-El-Bakar and the Abu-Za'bal factory in 1978,
the downing of the Libyan airliner full of Egyptian passengers near
the same time. Overseeing the Maronite massacre in Sabra and Shatilla. That is of course besides numerous massacres by Irgun and other gangs
during the British mandate period. Ironically the same Op-Ed page in the NYT times from which the Naftaly
copied this article was running another article next to it by A.M.
Rosenthall blaming Bosnian Muslims for their own genocide by effectively
saying that it is stupid to seek independence if independence will bring

who never wasted a chance to bash Arabs or Muslims.

souls. Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be

in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give
all verses of the Qur'an equal priority. That is because, according to
Muslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact,
denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be
considered a disbeliever in Islam. Look, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and
thought. It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the
Quran's message. In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly
answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings
it can guide you. I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals
of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that
since women can clearly be "forgiven" and "rewarded" they _must_ have
souls (from the above verse).

Q: Some people say that the Palestinian revolution has many times changed
   its strategies and tactics, something which has left its imprint on the
   Palestinian problem and on the Palestinian Liberation Front. The
   [strategies and tactics] have not been clear. The question is, is the
   direction of the Palestinian problem clear? The Palestinian leadership
   has stopped, or at least this is what has been said in the media, this
   happened on the way to the dialogue with the United States, the PLO
   recognized something called "Israel"...

A: No, no, no! We said
   "recognition" -- when a Palestinian state is established. It will then
   decide if to recognize Israel or not. When it is established, its
   parliament will convene and decide. >policies which it can justify through occupation. Because of this,

it leads to a reduction in deaths. The second is that it should not

arabs to think they can get what they want by killing Jews. The only
way Israel should pull out of Gaza is at the end of negotiations. These negotiations should lead to a mutually agreeable solution with
security guarantees for both sides. Until arabs are ready to sit down at the table and talk again,
they should not expect, or recieve more concessions. Adam

1) The next time you get stoped by a cop, never never never admit to anything. 3) When a retoracle question is ask by the cop, like "...it <looked> like you were going kinda fast coming down highway 12. You <must have> been going at least 70 or 75?" -- This technique is employed by police to help establish guilt, especially when (9 times out of 10) he/she is not sure who was doing the speeding.

Heh, heh, heh, heh....I laugh because I have the same damn TV, and it
did the same thing! Actually it is a Goldstar, but it's essentially the
same TV and electronics--just a different face plate and name. I'd think the TV mfrs want
to make this possibility remote as possible. If at all, they'll 
*implode* and the glass that blows out would be the result of the
glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion. #2  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics. It turned
out to be a blown 2W resistor feeding the flyback transformer. I guess
the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it
created, burning itself out. I checked to make sure the flyback wasn't
shorted or anything first! Oh, luckily, I had a resistor handy lying
around that had just the right value for what I needed. I can't see it
being more than 50 cents!. Well, needless to say, the TV still works today. So go get a set of
schematics and have some fun...just don't get shocked poking around
the flyback.

   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION
   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners. What
   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet. [Reproduced without permission]

	   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,
	where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under
	the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,
	presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if
	a person simply consumed sugar. When researchers asked a group
	of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and
	sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after
	drinking the artificially sweetened beverage. The study received widespread media attention and stirred a
	good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public. However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers
	did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did
	actually translate into an increase in eating. The two do not
	necessarily go hand in hand. In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining
	the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted. And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the
	Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins
	University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-
	sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in
	the amount of food eaten afterward. One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing
	cancer is aspartame. But it most certainly has been blamed for a
	host of other ills. Since its introduction in 1981, the government
	has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing
	everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety. Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and
	after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm
	that it can bring about adverse health effects. That's why the
	Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with
	monitoring public health), the American Medical Association's
	Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration
	have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a
	clean bill of health. Granted, the FDA has set forth an "acceptable daily intake" of
	50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight. To exceed
	the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take
	in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of
	aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,
	or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...
	A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams
	of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups
	of yogurt -- to go over the limit. [chart with aspartame content
	of selected foods omitted]
	   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away
	from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called
	phenylketonuria, or PKU. The estimated one person in every 12,000
	to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential
	amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine. Once a child
	consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause
	such severe problems as mental retardation. To help people with
	PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other
	aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning "Phenylketonurics:
	Contains Phenylalanine." -Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)

To clarify:  

VC++ *is* considered an upgrade for C7. There will be no product
called C 8.0 (although the command-line compiler of VC++ lists its
version as 8.00). C7 is not a "DOS"-only product -- it is a C/C++
compiler capable of producing executables for DOS or Windows, as is
VC++ (Pro. The (significant) difference is that VC++ comes with
many Windows-hosted tools (ide, etc) which assist developers in
creating Windows executables much more quickly (basically by
automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code). Initial
impressions have been very favorable. Everyone who is a registered user of C7 should have received a
considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of C7. If you
haven't, call Microsoft and I'm sure they'd be happy to send you some! -Jefrem Iwaniw

   WASHINGTON, April 19  -- A symposium on the Dead Sea 
Scrolls will be held at the Library of Congress on Wednesday,
April 21, and Thursday, April 22. The two-day program, cosponsored
by the library and Baltimore Hebrew University, with additional
support from the Project Judaica Foundation, will be held in the
library's Mumford Room, sixth floor, Madison Building. Seating is limited, and admission to any session of the symposium
must be requested in writing (see Note A). The symposium will be held one week before the public opening of a
major exhibition, "Scrolls from the Dead Sea: The Ancient Library of
Qumran and Modern Scholarship," that opens at the Library of Congress
on April 29. On view will be fragmentary scrolls and archaeological
artifacts excavated at Qumran, on loan from the Israel Antiquities
Authority. Approximately 50 items from Library of Congress special
collections will augment these materials. The exhibition, on view in
the Madison Gallery, through Aug. 1, is made possible by a generous
gift from the Project Judaica Foundation of Washington, D.C.
   The Dead Sea Scrolls have been the focus of public and scholarly
interest since 1947, when they were discovered in the desert 13 miles
east of Jerusalem. The symposium will explore the origin and meaning
of the scrolls and current scholarship. Scholars from diverse
academic backgrounds and religious affiliations, will offer their
disparate views, ensuring a lively discussion. The symposium schedule includes opening remarks on April 21, at
2 p.m., by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington, and by
Dr. Norma Furst, president, Baltimore Hebrew University. Co-chairing
the symposium are Joseph Baumgarten, professor of Rabbinic Literature
and Institutions, Baltimore Hebrew University and Michael Grunberger,
head, Hebraic Section, Library of Congress. Geza Vermes, professor emeritus of Jewish studies, Oxford
University, will give the keynote address on the current state of
scroll research, focusing on where we stand today. On the second
day, the closing address will be given by Shmaryahu Talmon, who will
propose a research agenda, picking up the theme of how the Qumran
studies might proceed. On Wednesday, April 21, other speakers will include:

   -- Eugene Ulrich, professor of Hebrew Scriptures, University of
Notre Dame and chief editor, Biblical Scrolls from Qumran, on "The
Bible at Qumran;"
   -- Michael Stone, National Endowment for the Humanities
distinguished visiting professor of religious studies, University of
Richmond, on "The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Pseudepigrapha." -- From 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. a special preview of the exhibition
will be given to symposium participants and guests. The Thursday afternoon sessions, at 1:30 p.m., include:

   -- Devorah Dimant, associate professor of Bible and Ancient Jewish
Thought, University of Haifa, on "Qumran Manuscripts: Library of a
Jewish Community;"
   -- Norman Golb, Rosenberger professor of Jewish history and
civilization, Oriental Institute, University of Chicago, on "The
Current Status of the Jerusalem Origin of the Scrolls;"
   -- Shmaryahu Talmon, J.L. Magnas professor emeritus of Biblical
studies, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, on "The Essential 'Commune of
the Renewed Covenant': How Should Qumran Studies Proceed?" There will be ample time for question and answer periods at the
end of each session. Also on Wednesday, April 21, at 11 a.m.:
   The Library of Congress and The Israel Antiquities Authority
will hold a lecture by Esther Boyd-Alkalay, consulting conservator,
Israel Antiquities Authority, on "Preserving the Dead Sea Scrolls"
in the Mumford Room, LM-649, James Madison Memorial Building, The
Library of Congress, 101 Independence Ave., S.E., Washington, D.C.

  The Blues scored two power-play goals in 17 seconds in the third period
and the beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 Sunday afternoon at Chicago Stadium. Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17
seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals. Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good
goaltending from Ed Belfour. After
the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks
10-9 in the first period. Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on
the left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead. Janney set up McRae for
the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards
to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith
was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07. Janney found Hull in the slot,
and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and
passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp
angle. Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the
slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,
totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent
in the game. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in
the league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play. The best-of-seven series continues Wednesday in Chicago and Friday and Sunday
in St. Louis. Box score

"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed

don't and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not

A verrrrrry long time, like on the order of days. I had the pleasure of
doing that once (playing with the speedo cable) and with my B&D heavy duty at
full speed (600 rpm) all the speedo ever got up to was 30 MPH. Now if you go

it. Anyways, to roll a 100000 Mile

apart. BTW, all this info was obtained legally  :-)

in general extended warranties are a ripoff. this 6yr/60k is really only
3yr/24k because you get the 3yr/36k one *free* with the car. also, is there
perhaps a deductible you pay each and every time you use the warranty? also, are certain items excluded from coverage on the extended warranty? and if you use it at year 4 for some 60 buck job and pay a 50 deduct and then
you have used it so no refund ever! again, extended warranties are ripoff, high profit items for the dealer.

We have plenty of computer labs where the computers are left on all the
time. I don't see any shorter lifespan than the ones we have in the
offices which does get turned off at the end of the day. In fact, some
of the computers in the labs have outlived some of the same ones in the
offices. But it goes both ways so can't conclude anything.

Do you consider Neo-Nazis and white supremists to be Christian? By the persecution of Jews, they are violating
all the precepts of what Christ died for. They are in direct violation of
the teachings of Christ. Even Jesus who was crucified by the Jewish leaders
of that time, loved His enemies by asking the Father for forgiveness of their
sins. I am a Christian and I bear no animosity towards Jews or any one else.

>being perverted into something dangerous. Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since
respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations. This
doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in
the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it. Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should
address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity. Like
it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,
and isn't. I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has
forgotten. This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we
have something to learn from the pagan movement. Christianity has a long history of
oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to
live in a non-sexist manner. The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ 
could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great
deal of resistance. This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the 
male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have
had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches. Second, paganism respects the physical world. This is an idea with great
ramifications. One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings
and our world. Christianity has a long
tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress
and deny their sexuality. This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human
experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option. Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism
is an attractive option. I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of
sexuality. Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated
sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God. Alan Terlep				    "Incestuous vituperousness"

I bought a 386DX33 system a little over 2 years ago, and was satisfied with
everything about Zeos. That computer went off to grad school with my son and
I replaced it with a 486DX2/66 pkg 4 (345 MBHD, 16MB ram) with Diamond Viper,
128K level 2 cache, and tower upgrades, delete the CTX monitor. I got a
17" HP D1193A monitor employee purchase. This is a *great* system, fast,
quiet, solidly built, not a single glitch bringing it up. Tech support seems 
busier now than 2 years ago. I called with a configuration question, and
they called back 4 hours later with the right answer. I think there's a
slight premium over Gateway prices, but IMHO Zeos is worth it. BTW they 
have enough 800 lines that I've never gotten a busy signal calling sales,
customer service, or tech support. Now, you usually wait 5 or 10 minutes to
talk to someone, but at least you get in the queue and wait on their dime.

the firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per
seconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the
signal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit
convertor is more then sufficient. AC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases
you are not interested in the DC level. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. If
the cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly
distorted. But even that normally does not matter since it is the
occurrence of the spike that is important. However, I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start
battling with the toolbox to get it going. As yet I have no clue were

      Well, I dropped by the library yesterday, and picked up back copies
of the National Crime Survey (1986-1990) in an effort to examine what
it said about self-defense with a firearm. I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple
of things jumped out at me. First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of
weapon used in self defense. 1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to "weapon." The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun
defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%. Unless there's an explanation for
this, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going 
ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time. Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and
not just a reporting difference? The survey doesn't appear to have
changed significantly between 1986 and 1987. ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In previous postings by Hellman, Bellovin, etal it was
reported the Big Brother (Clipper) chip will encrypt plaintext in
64 bit blocks as is done with DES. The users key K which can be
derived from RSA, Diffy-Hellman, etc. is used to encrypt
plaintext M and is then used to form a "three part message". This three part message consists of E[M; K], K encrypted
with some other key, and the chip serial number. This three part
message is then encrypted by still another key. For example, say we are dealing with an encrypted digitized
voice application. The speech waveform is sampled and digitized
and then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block. This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-secure
communications link. Is something appended to
each 64 bit block? Is a header sent at the beginning of the
session? If the header is sent at the beginning of the session, how
do they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip does
just that? Can just anyone manufacture products using the chip? Is a facility clearance required to manufacture?

that recently many messages were posted from that address. Each of these

	I'm looking for a program that will let me use a windows
common dialog box to select a file to use when running a DOS app. Basically, I have several DOS apps that I use now and then
with different files. They all accept a file as a command line 
parameter, but the only way (at least that I know of) to do this
easily when running them from windows is to set up the PIF file so
that it prompts me for additional parameters (at which point I type 
in the file name). Problems are:

	1) Sometimes I can't remember where the file is exactly located and it
would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the
file manager. and 2) I'm lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried 
several directory levels deep. If anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some
other way to handle this, I'd appreciate it. Thanks,

Tim

Based on my experience with a '79 FJ40 ( the hard-top jeep-style model ) I 
would definitely give a new model consideration if I were in the market. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would
assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some
if not all of the qualities of their ancestors. Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study. My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have
independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and
more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The
independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy
the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second
difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm
not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive
system. The older Landcruisers have a "lock-up" type. Both have their
advantages and disadvantages. Paul Hovnanian	hovnania@atc.boeing.com

The multi-lingual archives at The Computing Research Labs, New Mexico

archives are being put under control of the Consortium for Lexical
Research. The new ftp address will be: clr.nmsu.edu (the current IP address
is 128.123.1.12 but may change, so use clr.nmsu.edu whenever
possible). Please note that there is a difference between ftp sites crl.nmsu.edu and
clr.nmsu.edu. The crl.nmsu.edu site will be our ftp site for items
not related to the Consortium for Lexical Research. The Arabic, Chinese, French, Italian, Indian, Japanese, Korean,
Tibetan, and Vietnamese archives will all be moved. We will announce the new locations of the relevant directories once
the archives have been moved. Please be patient if you discover directories missing when you ftp to
either crl.nmsu.edu or clr.nmsu.edu. It will take a few days to move
everything. If you are not familiar with our multi-lingual archives, we have been
slowly collecting various software, fonts, and text for different
languages over the past 2 years. Most of the software is currently
Unix oriented. We would also like to encourage people to continue to
contribute items to the archives to help improve the quality and

couple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750
GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that
most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-
order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily
by law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep 
them honest about acquiring parts. For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a
HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily. Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are
not as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the 
plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy,
then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it
on a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts,
more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable. Mike

If a person gives a well-balanced reasoned argument, Tammy, then all are
happy to discuss it with him. If he makes astounding claims, which are not
backed up with any evidence then he must be expected to substantiate them. If the original author had said that everything was his own opinion and not
supportable then people would have simply ignored him. He
claimed many things and his logic was seriously flawed. His argument was for
christianity in an effort to try to convince atheists like myself to believe
him and his message. If you told me

Lines: 19

Hi everyone. Just the other day, I ordered a VRAM chip for my new LCIII from
Mac Connection. They sent it overnight (very nice) and I got it installed,
and we found that it didn't work properly. When you put the computer in 
thousands mode, the bottom of the screen (using the new chip) is all flickering
and fuzzy. So I called them up and I'm going to return it for a new one. My question is, how often does such a thing happen with SIMM chips in general? Do you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad? This is the first chip I've ordered so I have no other experience
in this area. I'm just curious if anyone else has had the same type of
experience. Please email me, and if people want, I can post a summary. --

Norway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having

the basic knowlege of the structure of American government to

Regarding "Jesus only" believers, our moderator writes:

   [There may be some misunderstanding over terms here...]

I agree. These are folks who
   believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only
   Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. I'm not the
   right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be
   several, including what would classically be called monophysite or
   Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs
   that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won't
   use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply
   because it is not Biblical. What then can they make of the end of Matthew? And remember, I am with you always, to the end
of the age." { Do other texts
contradict this regarding Baptism? Or is a misunderstanding of the
Trinity the most likely explanation after all? But maybe I simply misunderstand their views. (Is anyone else out there
forced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged
dictionary?? Christianity really is an education in itself.) --

|David R. Tucker		KG2S		     drt@athena.mit.edu|
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Arrgggghhhh. Obviously the three-fold
baptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out. (I normally use the
term "three-fold" in referring to Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine. Indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do
not believe in the Trinity.) The disagreement over baptismal formulae
occurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in
the name of Jesus. (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as
well.) This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat. to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus. "Jesus only" groups baptize in the name of Jesus. They consider this
consistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. I'm not the right one to
ask to explain what this means. (It is also an odd way of
dealing with the idiomatic phrase "in the name of".) I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that "in the name
of" need not be a verbal formula. context, it contrasts Christian baptism
with the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism. Of course there's a
certain parallelism between these passages. That suggests that we
could just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific
three-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes
baptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. So long as we consider following Jesus to
be the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great
damage would be done by such a difference. This does *not* mean that
I think we should go back to using both formulae. But as I've said before, I'm
not the one to explain what their doctrine is.

Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window, or
dreaming, or having a fantasy,  or watching an apple fall (Newton), or
sitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of
intense scientific thinking done beforehand. Letting one's mind roam
freely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming
up with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis
of the problem first. Scientific intuition is not something one is born with. Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned,
but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the 
key elements in developing it. Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new
scientific ideas. One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalistic
studies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the 
theory of evolution. This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes
empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal
exploration as important scientific work. I agree that mere speculation
does not deserve to be called science. I also think that mere empirical
studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very
poor kind of science. In article <1qk92lINNl55@im4u.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu

     What kind of brainless clod doesn't understand the difference 
     between a "PROPOSED BILL, BLOCKED IN CONGRESS" and an "EXECUTIVE
     ORDER, ISSUED BY CLINTON, AND CRAMMED DOWN OUR THROATS". Here, let me give a remedial course in thinking:

     In order to create the appearance of low interest rates, Uncle Sam
     has shifted his debt from long-term to short-term securities. In effect, Uncle Sam has transformed the Federal Goverment into
     one giant S&L, waiting to blow. Short-term rates rise --->  Interest payments on Deficit rise --->
     Uncle Sammy has to borrow more ---->  Causing Short-term rates to rise. Uncle Sammy gets caught in a positive feedback loop. His options:

       i) Raise taxes a truly unimaginable amount
       ii)  Make truly unimaginable spending cuts

    Results of i):  large numbers of pissed-off citizens
    Results of ii): large numbers of pissed-off citizens


    Uncle Sammy has thoughtfully taken the initiative to pre-empt the use
    of communication newtworks to foster a nation-wide, grassroots
    uprising.

one of the following:
a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. There are two such organizations: 
The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction
and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own. The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any 
organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions 
to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:
- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the
location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft
within the operating radius around the launch site. Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)
are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the
western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular
since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground). Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is
from 50 to 500 or more feet. By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an "F" motor are exempt from
most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to

> Need more specifics to answer your question!! :-) As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer
the circuit with the contacts. The noise you hear is due to the momentary
opening and closing of the path. The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit. In high
impedance audio circuits a resistive "T" is constructed close to characteristic
impedance of the circuit. Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers
the audio. In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are
shorted out or grounded. Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic
impedance. Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used
to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time. Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc. A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive "optical isolator".. It consists
of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube. When the lamp is
off the cell is high resistance. Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers
passing the audio. Once again this device in a "T" switches the audio. Varying
the lamp resistance give a remote volume control. Use 2 variable resisters and
you have a mixer! --

As far as I have read WIN NT will be supported on Intel, DEC ALPHA and the MIPS R4000
series of processors only. I do remember though reading a rumour about Sparc support
sometime in the future. I am not sure what you mean by running "unix applications". You would have to have SAS for WIN NT (or maybe SAS for WIN16 etc). I have read 
that MS will anounce avalaibility of WIN NT by end of May 93 (Comdex Spring). Rajiev Gupta

One can postulate numerous reasons for this. For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful. For a
significant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in
the sciences. So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is
completely absurd. You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history
shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be
other reasons for this situation. Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent

The purpose of buying the land was to provide space and jobs for 
Jewish immigrants. In any case, no matter what the purpose, 
the sales were legal, so I really don't see any grounds for 
contesting them.

Any suggestions as to what a better solution might be? I realize the
off-hand nature of the numbers I used. And I can't answer as to what
an acceptable loss rate is. However,  as I said in another post,  I
despise the idea of supporting criminals for life. It's the economics
of the situation that concern me most. The money spent feeding, clothing,
housing and taking care of people who have demonstrated that they are
unfit to live in society could go to a number of places,  all of which
I, and probably others,  would consider far more worthwhile and which
would enrish the lives of all Americans. Give people jobs,  give the
homeless shelter. Clyde

What do you mean "more comfortable putting it up to." Stare straight Point with both hands together and clasp so that only the
pointer fingers are pointing straight forward to a a spot on the wall about
eight feet away. First stare at the spot with both eyes open. If the image jumped more when you closed your right eye, you are right

I was a cryptologic tech in the US Navy (CTRSN, nothing big). All 'spooks'
in the Navy are required to know the "gist" of "USSID 18", the Navy-way of
naming a particular Presidential "Executive Order". It outlines what spooks
can and can't do with respect to the privacy of US nationals. The following information is (of course) UNCLASSIFIED. The whole issue hangs about what you mean by "wiretap". If the signal can
be detected by "non-intrusive" means (like radio listening), then it may be
recorded and it may be "analyzed". "Analyzed" means that it may be either
deciphered and/or radio-location may be used to locate the transmitter. The catch is this:  Any and all record of the signal and its derivatives
may only be kept for a maximum of 90 days, after which they are destroyed
unless permission is obtained from the US Attorney General to keep them. Didn't you ever wonder how Coast Guard cutters *find* those drug-runners

the place where it is on the machine the app was compiled on. Is there any
way to read the XKeysymDB manually with an X/Xt call so that additions to
the XKeysymDB can be distributed with the application ? I have used trace(1)

WDVE(102.5 fm). WDVE will carry 12 games, starting with tonight's

station for the Pens. The Penguins and KBL have struck a new 
deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games. It seems
more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next 
season. KBL will carry 62 games on tv,  with 17 of the games to be 
simulcast on KDKA-TV. The remaining 22 games, as well as some of the 
early round playoff games, will be available by "subscription tv" only. To receive the games, you'll have to pay a one time hook up fee, and
then a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars. Also, under the new deal, there will no longer be radio/tv 
simulcasts. There will be a TV broadcast team, and a radio
broadcast team. Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald
are both under contract with KDKA, but their contracts expire at the
end of this season. KBL President Bill Craig said he'd like to hire
Lange and Steigerwald. Lori

Interestingly enough, in designing the escrow, we may want to use some
rather unusual technology, such as sealed boxes of paper, or
destructive read memory, rather than typical computer databases, which
is fun for a database of hundreds of millions of keys. The greatest danger of the escrow database, if it were kept on disk,
would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out. You
can design lots of protection, but with enough corruption a complete
copy is always possible. Storing it on paper or something very hard
to copy at once may actually make sense. Or a medium that can't be
copied -- for example, something with very slow access times or which
leaves a destructive trail if it is even read. However, I think the consequences
of no backup -- the data is not there when a warrant comes -- are worse
than the consequences of a secret backup. An audit trail that reveals when data has been access, that *can't* be
erased by the humans involved, is also necessary. --

The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm. An option
in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats
a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics. Typing a <RET> while
the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be "Tek-term") is
active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus
to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the 
Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of
Xterm. If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.) The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it. Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics 
highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move 
the Tek-term to the top. If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve 
screen space, it stays an icon. The desired behavior: one of two options - 

    1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the 
       inactive one. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon
       but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher 
       level than the Xterm. What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will
be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term. These commands, would, I'd guess, need to be in the Fortran or in the 
command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term. Other information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb 
X-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif. If you've got any words of wisdom (other than 
"give up" ;-), please send email to

You're using drivers version 2.02 or earlier. The latest is 2.03, available

of following: I talked to their tech support a few days ago and was told

However, I have a problem when switching back from a DOS session in standard

why anybody would want to use standard mode at all. It's a great card for the price, at least when I bought it.

	Then let me ask you for a "workable" solution. We have a name
here that implies certain things to many people. Rather than trying
to educate each and every person that comes to the group -- is there
some "name" that would imply what this group was originally
intended for? My dad was a lawyer -- as such I grew up with being a stickler
for "meaning". In my "reality", psychoactives *technically* could 
range from caffeine to datura to the drugs you mention to more
standard recreational drugs. In practice I had hoped to see it
limited to those that were above some psychoactive level -- like
some of the drugs you mention, but also possibly including *some*
recreational drugs -- but with conversation limited to their psychoactive 
effects -- the recent query about "bong water", I thought was a bit
off topic -- so I just hit "k". But back to the original question -- what is a workable solution --
what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to
discuss? It sounds like there should be a alt.smartdrugs, or something
similar -- I don't feel psychoactives would generally be used to
describe alot of those drugs. There is a big difference between a
drug that if taken in "certain doses, over a period of days may have
a psychoactive effect in some people", vs. many of the drugs in
PIHKAH which *are* psychoactive. wm

because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not 
the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time 
before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, 
Professor of English at Brigham Young University. Mr. England wrote the 
following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring 
1993 edition):

  "I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--
  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other 
  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian 
  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^). When we are tempted to draw a circle around
  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude
  those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central
  defining characteristic of a good American might be "one who doesn't draw
  exclusive circles" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the 
  central American ideal is by excluding others. And when we are tempted to
  draw a circle around "Mormon" or "Christian," to decide who is "orthodox"
  and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider
  that the central pillar of Christ's "orthodoxy" is our ability to love
  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family. "I recently spent some time in a "Christian" bookstore in California. The
  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and
  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural
  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons. But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking 
  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American
  culture, or other religions. A whole section was devoted to "Cults and the
  Occult," and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same
  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism. And I found
  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers
  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous
  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations
  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s). "It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to
  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety ("Perfect
  love casteth out fear," I John 4:18). I have always been pleased that the
  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a 
  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the
  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive
  action---as the "religious right wing" has launched this year against the
  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like. It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the
  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,
  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of
  others they believe to be evil." The above "sermon" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe
to This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who
rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His
arms. Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles 
of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim 
perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do 
now lead the Church. I, for one, do not wish to be labelled "Christian", if 
those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are 
intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical 
scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication 
than mainstream Christianity would give it. Once again, being in the 
majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective 
voice is louder. That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand
on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter 
the LDS Church' interpretation! Using someone elses biased research of truths 
and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to 
disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. Let us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion 
and conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.

Subject: Radar detector DETECTORS? Organization: Virginia's Public Education Network (Richmond)
Lines: 50

Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or
contribution to:

In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period. If
you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will
not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle
(even if it is not on) is $250.00. Sorry, tourist, ignorance of
the law is no excuse - they will get you too! It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for
an officer to actually see the radar detector. Many
law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF
from the radar detector itself. But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police
are writing citations right and left for people using radar
detectors. One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had
found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,
and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was
there. This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest. Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or
near the speed limit. I do not need a radar detector to keep me
from getting a speeding ticket. But, I do like to know when my
speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning. My radar
detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which
is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to
obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal. For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only
works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters. So, the questions are -
  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect? Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by
  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector
  antenna? ==============================================================================

    Just a few comments about the feasability of zipping up a bunch of miles
on your electronic odometer with an oscillator....

    I wouldn't expect to be able to do this. Not because the engineers at BMW are
putting in anti-fraud logic, but just because an automobile is a noisy, hostile
environment for electronics, and I would expect the software to be conservative. If I were to design a microprocessor-based odometer/speedometer program,
it would have the following features ( just off the top of my head ):

         * Debouncing/deglitching  ( Is this a real pulse, or just a glitch? ) * Smoothing:  The rate-of-change of speed cannot be too high:
                                This is a car, not an electron. *  Top speed limit:  Anything above 200MPH is ridiculous: must be
                                        electrical noise or contact bounce

    As for getting in and presetting the pins:  if this is the circuit board out of
a BMW dashboard, I seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the
middle of the card. I wouldn't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter:  remember, it's
probably damped so it can't move too fast, and is probably protected. After all,
a car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics;  there used to be an
app note in the National Semiconductor Linear Databook that went into this
in good detail. - Jerry Kaidor ( tr2!jerry@dragoman.com, jkaidor@synoptics.com )

Beleive it or not:  NY state once considered eliminating tolls for motor-
cycles based simply on the fact that motos clog up toll booths. But then
Mario realized the foolishness of trading a few hundred K $`s a year for
some relief in traffic congestion. Too bad he won`t take that Sumpreme Court Justice job - I thought we might

I don't claim to be a crypto analyist... there isn't a whole lot of good
literature on the subject, and the best people don't seem to publish
their work :)  but I rather doubt the approach such folks use is brute
force (sorry to have implied that in my previous post). The history
of these things is folks find clever ways of limiting the search and
bang from there. I guess my real problem with Skipjack is I can not believe NSA would
make publicly available a system they couldn't break if they wanted...
it just isn't in their charter. And the Walker spy case
shows for some of the systems, the KGB didn't need them either.] --

Mr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) those

cited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff. Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in the
show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that
an individual has to file a return. Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast
the next morning. Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to
people who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer
for Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and
so Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000. So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against a
claim on the $100,000 reward. However, his win had nothing to do with
the tax code.

The XView version 3 source distribution included in the contrib section 
of X11R5 included the source to the textedit program. I'd like to take 
the sources and modify them to add support for a ToolTalk-like message 
server, and maybe for ToolTalk while I'm at it, since the Sun-supplied
textedit binary doesn't seem to speak tooltalk. However, the sources in the R5 contrib area seem to be for an older
version of textedit than the version shipped with OpenWindows 3. For
example, the OWN 3.0 textedit includes drag and drop support and a 
dropsite in the main control area, while the source in contrib/xview
knows nothing about drag and drop. The textedit.c included in the xview sources says it's version 15.50,
dated 5/22/90, while doing a 'what textedit' on the OWN 3.0 binary says:

        textedit.c 2.62 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro
        dragdrop.c 1.26 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro

a couple of things:  blowing a hose doesn't speak of engine reliability, and 
while it is true that quad4's have a problem with head gasket leaks, that was
a design flaw in the gasket and has been corrected. also i know pontiac is
replacing head gaskets that leak for free for 6year/60k miles. other than
that i have found my quad4 to be completely solid and the direct ignition 
system means no wires/rotor/rotor-cap to ever deal with. also hydrolic lifters

Is this the joke of the month? Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people
between 1914 and 1920. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the
European Jewry during WWII. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children
and elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last 
four years. The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the 
Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians. For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people 
lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the 
oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions
culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried 
out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks 
and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their 
homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands 
were empty of Turks and Kurds. The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye. Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia. Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated 
by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity. x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide 
against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations 
to the Turks and Kurds. Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine 
their own future as a nation in their own homeland. During the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate the
unity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkish
and Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle
for that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds. Today, we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United

Events, be they cultural, political or religious. Serdar Argic

I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin. I'm
hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various
switches and jumbers are used for. Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although
I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected
to anything. It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding
connecters labeled COM1 - COM4. There is also an external female connector
with 37 pins. There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and
7 jumpers. I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that
SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of
the COM ports. SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4]
are for IRQ5. The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow. The only identification printed on the board is "MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD"

Tony-

I read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other
typical"Christian" anti-gay sentimental literature. Gay people are and will
con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates. We usually think of the KKK in these instances,
but there are many other groups. Of course, the vast majority of the public
scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case. There was
even a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased. In fact, until laws
were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty
much legal to discriminate against them. I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free
form discrimination. You may think that I have been deceived or something,
that is your perogative. We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation
and making disciples. I really like my church for last reason the most. Many were even killed and
treated as runaway slaves for being "nigger-lovers" and such. I guess I've
decided the challenge is worth it. In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic
story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight
who have been hurt in the process, etc. after they
began to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG. I'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0
raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values
Coalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner
support within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more
oppressive legisation against gays. Perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will. The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the
final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a
"conditional" love for gays. that
need to be changed through some sort of therapy. But then there are things
like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is
going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to "other
people's expectations." This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change. Another interesting thing happened recently. This had apparently
been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were
voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that
was how they managed to downplay it in the media. One of my friends
recently told me he was "approached" by someone who is going through the
reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for
dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry. This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are
embracing. We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression
towards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from
organizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good
purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of
excluding people. The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to "include"
people. I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful,
especially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto
itself.

Mr. Ward, before you start blathering about your skill "interpreting"
the Constitution, it might be helpful to learn to read. After a review
with a high school English teacher emphasizing participial phrases, you
might start with the Second Amendment, and follow it up with:

 97th Congress, 2nd Session, Committee Print, *The Right To Keep and
 Bear Arms*, of the Subcomittee on the Constitution of the Committee on
 the Judiciary, United States Senate, 97th Congress, Second Session,
 February, 1982. 88-618-O

This authoritative, heavily researched and annotated document clearly
turns your "interpretation" into specious claptrap, which is a polite
way of saying utter bullshit. In spite of your false assertion to the
contrary, the Second Amendment DOES protect the right of the individual
citizen, in his capacity as an individual, to keep and bear arms. And, Mr. Holland, IMHO, blatantly and harmfully false information,
asserted as fact and globally distributed, deserves globally
distributed rebuttal in the forum in which it is posted. (And besides, this site doesn't carry t.p.g...:-)

[I think the original claim may have been somewhat more limited than
this. It was an answer to the claim that the witnesses couldn't
be lying because they were willign to suffer for their beliefs. Thus it's not necessary to show that no Christian ever suffered
for believing in the Resurrection. Rather the issue is whether
those who witnessed it did. I do agree that the posting you're responding to shows that there

According to the official documentation, failure to use the IIfx terminator

problems with my IIfx since I bought it. ( I cannot connect more than three

then I would try to format it on your system with no externals. If this

I need to find a UART that will interface to an 8051 and do the following:
	-250k baud, 8 data bits, 2 stop bits, no parity
	-ability to do BREAK detect (IRQ or output pin)
	-IRQ on character received

I'm using a Dallas DS2250 at 16 Mhz (8051 clone), but it won't do 
break detect. I've looked at the 6850, 8251, 7201, 2661, etc...

Hi,
I've got a Multi I/O card (IDE controller + serial/parallel
interface) and two floppy drives (5 1/4, 3 1/2) and a
Quantum ProDrive 80AT connected to it. I was able to format the hard disk, but I could not boot from
it. I can boot from drive A: (which disk drive does not matter)
but if I remove the disk from drive A and press the reset switch,
the LED of drive A: continues to glow, and the hard disk is
not accessed at all. I guess this must be a problem of either the Multi I/o card
or floppy disk drive settings (jumper configuration?) Does someone have any hint what could be the reason for it.

that someone edited the copy, saw "inject" and thought it was a typo and

The stragegy of the government is interesting. The real fear comes from
them doing more than this. This is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on
the surface. Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one. They are
pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they
get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market. It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have
registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for
most phone companies. You see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any
cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow
the standard. AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryption
product. The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to
use these chips. If they get enough market share, they will rule. And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be
tapped by the police. The public isn't that concerned about it now,
after all. They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen
to today! They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure
them only from the police. Well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with
other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones
expensive. Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them
cheap, only the Mob will buy them. And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of
better encryption phones, because "the only reason a person would want
one is to evade the police." --

A 1 of 4 decoder need not be the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer, although
many commercial SSI implementations allow you to use one as such. Strictly,
a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change
state, according to the inputs. A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which
of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable
input, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all
outputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output
will be low). An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to
select which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your
aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note
that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since
you have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left
once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose. A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus
a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use
the fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the
four enable lines. Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the
four final stage decoders. Please give me the credit when you submit your homework. JohnH

Mark,

  47k is not too many miles on a VFR750. I sold my (well maintained)
'87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition. All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings
and seals. The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers
to look at the top end, do a compression check etc. As for price, $4500 seems a little steep. I bought my '90 with 12k
miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800. There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price. I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range. They all
said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them. A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain
it at all. One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end. If my
VFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot. Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up. Good luck,

Just a quick summary of recent findings re. Top three
contenders seem to be AT&T Paradyne, ZyXEL, and US Robotics. ZyXEL has the
biggest "cult following", and can be had for under $300, but I ignored it
because I need something with Mac software, which will work without any
tweaking. The AT&T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. They are
backordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in
effect until May. Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two
modems. WARNING: AT&T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit (cables &
all), and has lifetime warranty. This applies *only* when you order
directly from Paradyne! I called ElekTek (one of the distributors), and
they wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty...

USR Sportster for the Mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended;
it's only $250 from ClubMac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable
and don't care about the FAXstf software, you can get the generic model
from PC outlets for $190. All this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle, and can't afford a
Motorola Codex...  :-(    I ended up ordering the Dataport; we'll see how
it works in two weeks or so. --

historical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem. When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948,
the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit
religious shrines. This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan,
who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control. The
Jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city. They turned a
Jewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in their
latrines. Israel has allowed individuals of all religions into
Jerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness to
control the city. Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered in
Jerusalem, but has holy sites there. The home of Islam is Mecca,
where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj). Unlike Israeli
Jerusalem, Jews and Christians are not allowed in Saudi Mecca. Adam

Which works fine until you end up in the hospital because you were hit on the
head and your wallet, with your insurance card, is stolen. This happened to 
me, and it took six months to sort the mess out. These sorts of plans sound

whether or not they were stolen. STOLEN GUNS WILL BE RETURNED TO THEIR

Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have
affected the AHL this year. ST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS
The St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by
problems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but
off ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the
leafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of
the seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played "home" games in places
like Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and
rocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium. Despite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs
will return to St John's once the strike ends. ===================================================
SENATORS SOLD
The New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to
the Ottawa Senators NHL organization. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL
head office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting
in May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it 
clear the league was more interested in the stability of the 
AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining
the 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown
New Brunswick and are expected to move there. ==================================================
DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON
After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out
of Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing
their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they
wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining
6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks
in the New Brunswick city. The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if
the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200
Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion
frnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble. =========================================================
CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE
Despite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore
Skipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,
announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates. There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced
a limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players
including 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited
farm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders. ======================================================
AHL GAME OF THE WEEK
In early January, the AHL started a game of the week. I am not
sure if playoff games will be covered. =====================================================
UTICA GONE? There were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next
season. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern
city and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them. =====================================================

Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team. And that is
simply because there are not enough solid two-way players to go 
around. Who would you rather have as your "checking" centre? For that matter I would take either Gretzky
or Mario as my "checking" centres. Do you think Gretzky could cover
Bob Gainey? The Selke is designed to acknowledge their

best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger. If 
Gilmour does the best defensive job in the league I don't see why he 
should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen-
sively. If you think that I have likened the Selke to the Nobel
prize then I suggest that you had best "settle down". And if you are
going to try to put words in my mouth, let me suggest that you "settle

I see some irony here. Jesus was willing to go through torture to free
you from the definite promise of hell (based on Adam/Eve's fall from grace)
but rather than allow him to stand in your place, you would give up
your redemption to stand with those who do not accept his grace. God would rather have none in hell, which seems to put the burden of 
choice on us. Of course, this is all fictional anyway since you reject him
also. My former sociology professor once told us at the beginning
of our term, "you all start out with an A...what you do with that during
the course of this term is up to you". In the beginning...Adam and Eve
were given an A.

million) to the Armenian terrorist organization ASALA which have
murdered several Turkish diplomats abroad... 

Experts on international terrorism assert that the Armenian terrorists
use proceeds from drug trafficking (and from the Armenian Foundation)
to fund their deadly enterprises. The deadliest of terrorist assassins,
Carlos, proclaimed on Spanish television that his organization had
entered into a working relationship with Armenian terrorists and they
are using drug trafficking to raise money 'to continue' to slaughter
innocent people. Now, what is your personal and organizational role 
in this scheme? Recent reports which have been confirmed by the U.S. Administration, 
indicate that Armenian terrorist organizations are collaborating with 
those who are responsible for the bombing of the United States Marine 
barracks in Beirut. You won't be able to get away with your crimes 
forever; the justice is long overdue. As for the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people between 
1914 and 1920:

I don't know the exact coverage in the states. In Canada it is covered
by TSN, so maybe ESPN will grab their coverage! As for the picks
Ottawa picks #1 which means it is almost 100% that Alexander Daigle will 
go #1. He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec. He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in
the World Championships. Daigle didn't show this for his junior team.

I went back and checked the article again; The SHO Wagon is quicker
than the SHO automatic, but significantly slower than the REAL SHO. Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is
beyond me; if you can't handle a stick, you should stick with a
regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers. That is not to
say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick (eg
disabled persons), but they aren't in any position to use an
SHO anyway. I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
transmissions from all "performance-type" cars (like the 5.0l
Mustangs, Camaros, and the like) we'd cut down on the number of
accidents each year. Autos are fine for sedate little sedans,
but they have no business in performance cars, IMHO. James

I participated a promotion by a company called Visual Images. They sent me a award certificate three months ago and asked 
me to buy their promotion package in order to receive the major
award. They mislabled my address and I did not receive my package
until one month ago. I was mad and angry about how it took them
so long to get my package. So I wrote them a letter and requested
for a refund. I was lucky enough to
find out their telephone number through operator and received the
package. I immediately returned the package and wrote them another
letter to ask for refund. The package was returned because they
address they put on the package was incorrect. I attempted to 
call them and learnd that they have changed their telephone number. It took me at least 10 phone calls to find out their new number,
but they refused to take any responsibility. I spoke to their
manager and she said she would call me back, but she has not call
yet. But I was able to get their address from their front desk. Should I just go ahead and send the package? Or should I waite until
they call me back? I know there are several people on the net has experience with the
same company. I would like to know how they got their money back. If you have similar experience, please advise me. Thanks in advance,

The rumour was basically everywhere in Toronto based on reports

There is no such thing as "X Windows" or "X Window", despite the repeated

about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME
of the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have 
to say? With regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several. You can
buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both 
GraphOn and NCD. (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11
over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.) NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is
NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's. There may be other such 
software packages available. X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running
X11 over low-speed connections. It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and 
is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote. It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there
will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various 
sorts of hardware. Followups directed to comp.windows.x

     Hello, 

   Let me introduce a problem:

   When I measure a sinusoidal wave (voltage) with a digital voltmeter, using 
AC mode, my output is an rms value (a peak value over 2 squared). / When I measure a square wave in the same mode (AC), my output is equal 
to a peak value, actually, to the upper flat boundary of the wave. I assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the 
input value, and divides it over the wave period. / Right?/
   Now, I used it to measure the same  square wave as above, but distorted 
by high-frequency harmonics. Ideally, output should be the same, but...
The output value was only about 10% of the previous one! What does the voltmeter 
actually measure? Related question (less important to me):
   What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with 
analog ones? Thank you for your attention, you could mail me your opinion at
avm1993@zeus.tamu.edu or open a discussion here. Alexander V. Mamishev

The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was
reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times
required using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual
EVA tasks on previous missions. "Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is
to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the
dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks," Mission Director Randy Brinkley said. "It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added
flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations." In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the
spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays
and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective
Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives
during the mission. "When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through
lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,
WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each
spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate," said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight
Director for the mission. While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two
alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than
previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs. "We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous
spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,"
Heflin said. "In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to
formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible
to accomplish the mission objectives." Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions
that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated
simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours. In addition, many stand alone
underwater training "runs" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk. Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be
made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the
mission. Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight
will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques. Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include
spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission. The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the
actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at
the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,
Huntsville, Ala.

	Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining
further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the
experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and
trainers. Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with
grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures. The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990. At that
time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in
1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have
become necessary. - end -

It would also be great for another reason - when not docked, it could serve
as an ARA server to the large internal HD, your corporate email, etc. In
a pinch, you would also have two machines, instead of 1.5. If they could couple that thought with RocketShare, and let you use both the
'030 on the PB and the '040 on the dock, it would be a mighty powerful dock. --

I was worried about someone stealing my oil once also. I finally

In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find arrogant about
Christians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their
beliefs and doctrines. That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have
made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying
that they are infallible. Impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will
probably agree. So long as your own brain is involved,
there is a possibility for error. Someone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but
he did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase
Sartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument
leads to relativism. As I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false
because you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because
you dislike them. `REXLEX' wrote:

>  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is

written does not constitute a refutation. All he has said is that he does
not like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it. I do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience. However, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about
them, we are on much shakier ground. Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted
in very limited circumstances. >  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute

not have any record that he elaborated on the words. Was he thinking of
Tran- or Con- substatiation? (This
is something that most of us have direct experience of. So, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is
that Jesus said "This is my body." Beyond that, once we start making up
doctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we
get into trouble. The non-Christians around us know
that human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it. They do not
believe we are infallible, any more than we do. Witnessing is
hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you
are either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying
to cover them up. For example, we might say that we
know our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience. But
other things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical
thinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are
very confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning. But, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting
as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous. *

`REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by
Francis Schaeffer. I didn't think very highly of it, but I think that
Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians. Somebody
else might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it. If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, by
Ludwig Wittgenstein.

Here's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumped
myself and a few others:

What does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a large
cache set (through control panel) in your SIMMs? EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don't
rob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?). Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the
cache card? Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache
between the card and the SIMM's? Or does it still speed things up by
providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into
the SIMM RAM cache? I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to
really do any good compared to what you can set yourself. Yet, Daystar
FastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some
operations. Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM
accesses? Please help, I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci
system described in the EX above.

Rob Butera asks about a book called THE LOST YEARS OF JESUS, by
Elizabeth Clare Prophet. However, Miss Prophet is the leader of a
group (The Church Universal and Triumphant) derived from the I AM
group founded by a Mr. Ballard who began his mission in the 1930's
(I am writing this from memory and may not have all the details
straight -- for an old account, check your library for a bnook by
Marcus Bach) after an eighteenth-century Frenchman appeared, tapped
him on the shoulder, and offered him a cup of "cosmic essence." A
major tenet of the movement is that there is a monastery in the
mountains of Tibet from which a monk descends to the lower altitudes
every few centuries to preach, and that all major religions have
been founded by monks from this monastery. Typically, the Ballard
family and their successors, the Prophet family (related by
marriage, if I remember aright), base almost all their teachings on
messages they have allegedly received by telepathy from Tibet. I
should be surprised if the book you mention has any scholarly basis.

Subject: Hitler was an atheist! Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief
wrong. It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed 
to believe in God. Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books. Response:

This argument is known as Pascal's Wager. So sadly the
argument is only likely to convince those who believe already. Statement 1 indicates one has no
information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information
can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God. That is, if you can explain something without supposing
the existence of some entity, then do so. ------------------------------

Subject: Why I know that God exists

Typical posting:

I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists. Response:

Einstein did once comment that "God does not play dice [with the universe]". Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's
refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an
objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random
events and which would not be dependent upon the observer. So far no such better theory has been found,
and much evidence suggests that it never will be. For a doctrine
   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,
   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm
   to human progress. In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers
   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal
   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past
   placed such vast power in the hands of priests. This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably
   more worthy task..."

Einstein has also said:

  "It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,
   a lie which is being systematically repeated. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the
   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our
   science can reveal it." Response:

This is known as the Argument From Design. Furthermore, there is much evidence,
observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the

existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist
position. but with the addition of spiralling 
improbability. Firstly, a watchmaker creates 
watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have 
created the universe from nothing. ------------------------------

Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true

Typical posting:

The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary
evidence. The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims
that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to
prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation. This concerned a
lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School
District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to
pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as "one nation under God"
(Bush's phrase). Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?" Response:

There are several towns called "Hell" in various countries around the
world, including Norway and the USA. Response:

Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear
that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.

Subject: Hits Stolen -- Second Base 1992
Summary: Stolen Hits for all second basemen
Keywords: second defense
Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. Urbana, IL
Lines: 117

Disclaimer -- This is for fun. In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called
"stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not
make with average effort." Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted
by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats
for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays Kurt
Stillwell would not have made." Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,
fluke shots, and a monster park factor. But let's put it this way:  If we
replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out
making ability, how many extra hits would go by? To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net
Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league
average fielder would make. By the same method I've calculated Net Double
Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by). Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or
DCON :->. Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which
should represent the player's total contribution to the team. The formula for DCON appears at the end of this
article. The short version -- definition of terms
HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell
NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder
NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder
NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder
DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate. DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution. Basically, it's designed to be added into the
OPS, with the idea that "a run prevented is as important as a run scored". The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are 
factored into SLG. That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors. For more discussion see the post on Hits Stolen -- First Base 1992

To Andi,

I have to disagree with you about the value of Israeli news sources. If you
want to know about events in Palestine it makes more sense to get the news
directly from the source. EVERY news source is inherently biased to some
extent and for various reasons, both intentional and otherwise. However, 
the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the "truth" and to discern 
the bias. You will learn more news and more
opinion about Israel and Palestine by doing so. Then you can form your own
opinions and hopefully they will be more informed even if your views don't 
change. EDU)

	To all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three
homer games ina career, the answer is Johnny Mize in his career with the 
Cards and the Yanks. In
case anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe
Ruth and is 72. Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan
Gonzalez. He has at least three games with three and maybe 4. I know that 
he had at least two last year and one as a rookie. I don't have any record
books at college for me to check on though. Please let me know, okay, if I 
am wrong. Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news? I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I
can't get McPaper consistently around here. comment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals
that brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres. It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann. Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could 
hit with the power of 91 but with a lower average. Bell always could finish
with .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers. I get on base 29% of the time if I'm 
lucky at leadoff? Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though? I
haven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores. Anyway unless you are going
to use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn. He at lesat gets on base and this
year is stealing bases. Sheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing. Witness Phillips batting .500+ currently. But does Sheffield have an injury,
or anythingelse wrong with him. Andy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91? or is 
this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then? Has anyone 
seen him pitch the two good games? score for today, Sunday april 18:  Padres 10, St Louis 6. Padres sweep the
Cardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer. Sheffield and Tueful also homer
in a winning cause. Thanks for listening-reading

Dear Netters:

A new religious newsgroup "soc.religion.islam.ahmadiyya" was pro-
posed  on  Oct  16,  1992. The discussion about this new proposed
newsgroup went on in various related groups. The  proposal,  was
supposed to enter a vote during the last week of November 92. Due
to a false Call For Votes, by some opponent, the voting had to be
canceled. I  quote  here  a  statement  from  the  moderator  of
new.announce.newgroups:


"The current Call For Votes (CFV) for an Ahmadiyya newsgroup
 is being canceled. A lot of confusion arose among the netter as  to  whom  to  vote. Therefore  it was decided to give a cool down period, so that all
confusions are over. It has been over 4 months  of  that  instant
and now we are again attempting to create this newsgroup. take part in  the  discussion
under the same  title heading  and in  "news.groups"  or at least
cross-post it to "news.groups". ****************************************************************

                REQUEST  FOR  DISCUSSION

****************************************************************



NAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP: 
==========================

     soc.religion.islam.ahmadiyya


CHARTER: 
=======

     A religious newsgroup, which would mainly  discuss  the  be-
liefs,  teachings,  philosophy  and ideologies of all major reli-
gions of the world as  they  exist  to  foster  better  religious
knowledge  and  understanding among followers of all religions as
they share common basis. This newsgroup will be devoted to  build
a  peaceful  mutual  understanding  of  the  Ahmadiyya  branch of
Islam, its peacefull beliefs, ideology and philosophy and how  it
is  different  from  other  branches  of Islam in fostering world
peace and developing better understanding among religious people. It may also be used to post important religious events within the
World Wide Ahmadiyya Islamic Community in general. PURPOSE OF THE GROUP: 
====================

     The following are some of the main purposes this group will
     achieve:

     i)   To discuss the common beliefs of all major religions as
          they relate to Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. iii) To examine Islamic teachings and beliefs in general  in
          light  of the Quran  and established Islamic traditions
          of 15 centuries from Ahmadiyya perspective. vii) To exchange important news and views about the Ahmadiyya
          Muslim Community and other Religions. viii)To add diversity in the religious newsgroups present
          on Usenet. x)   To discuss the contributions of founders of  all  reli-
          gions and their  people for humanity, society and world 
          peace in general and by the International Ahmadiyya Mus
          -lim Community in particular. The moderation will NOT prevent disagreement or dissent to
beliefs, but will mainly be used  to  prevent  derogatory/squalid
use  of  dialect  and irrelevant issues. The following
moderators have been proposed and agreed upon:

Moderator:     Nabeel A. Rana  (rana@rintintin.colorado.edu)  
Co-Moderator:  Dr. Tahir Ijaz  (ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca)



A BRIEF DESCRIPTION ABOUT AHMADIYYA/ISLAM:
=========================================


        The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, an international organi-
sation, was founder in 1989 in Qadian, India. Such opposition is often wit-
nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect
is being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes. Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many
adherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who
come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background. The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about
a better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-
gions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-
erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi
Muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-
cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism. Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-
tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-
ics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed
by  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's
internal resources. If
the group gets 2/3rd majority AND  100  more  "YES/Create"  votes
than  "NO/don't  create"  votes;  the group shall be created. Any
questions or comments  may  be  included  in  the  discussion  or
directly sent to: rana@rintintin.colorado.edu

already check for a mouse driver (using the code in Microsoft's Mouse
book). But there is no guarantee that the driver is loaded when my
program runs, or that they ever load the driver. Since I am interested in what hardware is attached to the machine, how
do I detect is a mouse is attached? I know it can be done because the
mouse driver can do it. Thanks in advance,

  Daulton doesn't strike me as all that strange. He's a little bit quiet at 
the plate but, like Franco, gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level
plane. The first time I watched Julio Franco, I didn't think *anyone* could
hit like that. Now I marvel at how easy he makes it look; every time he makes
contact, it's *solid*. He's got good power to all fields and rarely is he
caught not ready for a pitch. I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to
practice his swing while 'on the throne'? :-) Sure looks like it :-) 

  How 'bout one to add to your list: Travis Fryman? The guy plants his front
foot and seems to swing *across* his body. He generates a lot of power, but
I keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot
out of his hips. >Gary's list of "I'd give Dave Kirsch's kidneys to have a swing like that." Well, they're already spoken for (by several people), but .. 

  I'd add Robbie Alomar's name to the list, among others. I really like Dean

>with Troy Neel's. A thought about May: It looks like they've taught him to turn on the ball. IMHO, he's going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling
off the ball to the point that he's going to see *lots* of sinkers/sliders
low and away. Unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left 
and left-center, IMHO you're going to see a good number of weak grounders to 
the right side of the infield in the next month. --

Unfortunately, if you launch this from the US (or are a US citizen),
you will need a launch permit from the Office of Commercial Space

an antisatellite weapon... :-)

(probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not
spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft. In order to turn the
spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be
available, or you need to retrain a new team. Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed. Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA 
series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set. Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a "standby" mode for
use in an emergency. In that case, however, the same ops team is still
required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is
relatively cheap. Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance
to stay under control) is also right on the mark. I suggested a spin-
stabilized control mode because it would require little power or 
maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time
to time. In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),
but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.

elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them
did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal
Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue
and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that
some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs. Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively
swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., This is not the same thing as saying that the
syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The
disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers
on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include:
psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most --
maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental
toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of
these. There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try
different things, some of which seem to help. Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days. Post your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts. Note: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable)
diseases that look like CFIDS. Make sure these get ruled-out by a good
doc.

same belief in different words. Great
scisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has
been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal
agreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs
are equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict
some other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations
of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have
been stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must,
**necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical
to say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct, 
but if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long
as we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other 
as in error. --

1. It is an excellent absorber of excrement. I use it to line

My thoughts on why the algorithm is secret :

   The chip is (regretably) likely to become a standard. There will
   be many applications where economic factors dictate use of this
   chip, like it or not. If the alrogithm is public, and the code is as secure (absent the 
   access to escrowed keys) as represented, an enterprising sort 
   would make "compatible crypto chips for which no key had been
   escrowed". This is likely what the release was refering to when 
   they refered to the secrecy of the algorithm protecting the
   security of the escrow system.

I've got two lines coming into my apartment. When I ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another 4
wire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. So I
have one line on red & green and the other on yellow & black. Today I was monitoring the voltage on both lines. I had a voltmeter across
the red and green and read back 52 volts. I then lifted up the receiver on my
second line.(black & yellow wires) The voltage dropped to 31 volts on the first
line. ( red & green wires) I repeated this experiment with the second
line(monitoring black & yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the
red and green line.) Next I went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in
from the telco cable. I then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and
went back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements.

Subject: Re: What WAS the immaculate conception
Organization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA

Biblical basis for the Immaculate Conception:

1) "I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and
between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crush
your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel." -Genesis 3.15

2) "He who commits sin is of the devil ..."
    -1 John 3.8

3) "Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with thee ..."
    -Luke 1.28

   From the above, we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is the
first promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles of
Satan. "[ Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in
the truth because there is no truth in him." Now the
proto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and "the
woman", and enmity between Satan and "her seed." Now the woman is both
Eve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. "Her seed" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the
same way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan. Thus, knowing as
we do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that
Mary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmity
with the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her
sinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, as
would God's veracity. For God promised an enmity between Mary and the
serpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved. Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the
Archangle Gabriel "full of grace." As I pointed out above this is from
the Greek word "Kecharitomene" which means not just full of grace, but a
plenitude or perfection of grace. The sense of it is best grasped by
the footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, "Hail you who have been and reamin
filled with grace." But that is a little to long to say, so it is
reduced to full of grace. And as it says, "you who have been" Mary had
always been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which
was also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later. It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done
what the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do. And if
God could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his
Mother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the
Fathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo
, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of
Christian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on
the matter in "Ineffibilus Deus."

If we do not trust the NSA to be a registrar of Clipper Chip key halves,
I would not trust Mitre either. Mitre does lots of work for NSA, at least
in the Trusted Product Evaluation Program (evaluation of commercial off the
shelf software for its efficacy in safeguarding classified information), and
I assume in other, less open, programs. There are at least two other FFRDCs (Federally Funded Research and Development
Corporations) that work for NSA: Aerospace Corporation and the Institute for
Defense Analysis. Now, if NSA were to be untrustworthy (a position that I
am neutral about, for purposes of this posting), it would be in a position to
exert economic pressure upon Mitre to release key halves on demand. It could
just say, "If you don't cooperate with us, we'll place all our evaluation
contracts with Aerospace and IDA." I am not saying that people at NSA, Mitre, Aerospace, or IDA are dishonest
folk. But since they are people, and people occasionally go bad, the
system works better if organizations that you are depending upon to be
independent really are. And, of course, I speak for myself, not my employer.

on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while
Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next
best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at
.238. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team
is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game
and giving up 6.6/game. Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should
come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave
the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, 
Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be
successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either
held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,
the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen
is a big question mark. In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William
Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's game
with California was cancelled.

(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMAD SAW)       
(SAW: PEACE AND BLESSINGS BE UPON HIM)

In His Name (ALLAH) , Be He (ALLAH) Glorified! There is Nothing But Glorifies His (ALLAH's) Praise. In The Name Of  Allah, The Compassionate, The Merciful

   "He is who has sent His Messenger with
guidance and the religion of truth  to make it
supreme over all religion:  and sufficient is Allah
as a Witness. Muhammad is the Messenger of
Allah, and those who are with him are firm
against the unbelievers and merciful among
each other. You will see them bowing and
prostrating  themselves, seeking Allah's grace
and His pleasure. Their mark is on their face
the sing of prostrafion; this is their similitude in
the Torah and Indgil." [ the Our'an 48:28-29]

   Since the Nineteenth and Thirhy-first Words
concerning the mission of Muhammad (SAW) prove his
prophethood with decisive evidences, we assign the
verification of that subject to those Words. As a supplement to them, we will merely show here
in Nineteen Signs, some  of the flashes of that great
truth. FIRST SIGN:  The Owner and Master of this universe
does everything with knowledge, disposes every affair
with wisdom, directs everything all-seeingly, treats
everything all-knowingly, and arranges in everything with
His will and wisdom such causes, purposes and uses that
are apparent to us. Since the One who creates knows,
surely the One who knows will speak, since He will
speak, surely He will speak to those who have
consciousness, thought, and speech. Since He will speak
to those who have thought, surely He will speak to
humankind, whose make-up and awareness are more
comprehensive of all conscious beings. Certainly, He will speak to Muhammad (SAW),
and Indeed He has done so;  He will make him the
Messenger, and Indeed He has done so; He will make
him the guide for the rest of humanity, and Indeed He
has done so. -----------------------------------------------------------------

It isn't that rare, actually. Many cases that are called Parkinson's
Disease turn out on autopsy to be SND. It should be suspected in any
case of Parkinsonism without tremor and which does not respond to
L-dopa therapy. I don't believe pallidotomy will do much for SND. --

Here's what I (think) have figured out. All I need to do is install
the R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines,
and all the new libraries, utils, etc., will be installed and my old
server from r4 will still work. This will allow me to run Xview 3.0,
and have X11r5 up and running. Does the server interface remain the
same with all changes made only to the libs? Another question: Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support
that the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public? It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the
benefit of those of us with smaller budgets. :) --

I am interfacing some simple circuits that run on 9V to my
cpu board which runs at 5-6V.  The optoisolator is a 4N35. On the led side, I put the signal I want through a 10k resistor
to the base of a 2N2222. On the transistor side, I tie my
cpu input line to the collector which has a pull-up resistor
of 47k. I can detect pulses
that occur at about 2kHz, but not much faster. Isn't the
rise/fall time of this device, something like 5uS? I should
be able to detect my target of 40kHz, but I can't get 16kHz. This is done using wire-wrap and the wires going to the cpu
and to the test pin are about 8 inches long, but I'm not
doing anything high-speed. In the Art of Electronics, it mentions tying the base of the
phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the
speed. --

I  have one of the original Powerbook 170's (with 4Mb of Ram) and find
that 4Mb is a drag when trying to do my work. So, what is the best way
to get the maximum RAM for this unit, and what's it going to cost me? I'm hoping I can get the latest and best info from real users by posting 
to this group.

Algorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normals:
---------------------------------------------------
First, mark all faces as UNKNOWN. Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the
faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing
the two shared vertices). Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE. Using the edge
dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of
this face. And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently
orienting the entire surface. Find the average of the vertices in this surface. Using that point,
calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's
orientation. If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces
are oriented correctly. If it is negative, reverse their orientations
(mark them CLOCKWISE). If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face
and go through the algorithm again. At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed
before facet normals are found. (Note: if you are running on Silicon Graphics machines and buy the
IRIS Inventor 3D toolkit developers package you have the source to
this algorithm-- see /usr/src/Inventor/tools/ivnorm/.  If you're
not... sorry, I can't give out the source, and even if I could it
relies heavily on Inventor). --

Golly, I love stupid people. :-) And in the NHL,
there exist these things called "ties". A tie occurs when a game ends
with the score for each team equal. There also exits these things called "wins". A win is when one team has a
higher score than the opponent. (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other
at a time, so I can say "the opponent".) So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10
ties. Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties. The
first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points. The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86
points. They *both* have the same number of points, but the number
of wins is different! So,
Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then
that's what it means. In our example, the second team would win the
tiebreaker and therefore have the "better" record, even though both teams
had the same number of points. If you didn't understand this post, Rex,
maybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly. :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)

just a suggestion:
take a motorola mc14536B set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten
secs with either a RC or xtal clock input. then feed to a MC14521B as clock
input and decode output for 1,209,600 sec output ,might have to add a few 'and'
gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the'521 to restart
cycle... Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge ;the one shot then
goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher..
these ckts require uAmps of current,between 5 - 15 volts, so a 12 volt
gel cell of a few Amphours would last the six weeks. Then take the ckt board & battery wrap in 3" or 4" of foam or build a box
of out of the stuff...with plywood or metal exterior...
build a small heater out of 10-50 Watt resistors in series to keep the battery
and ckts warm. 2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger. Insolate-insolate.......even though the chips state that the - AL
rated devices are good to -55 C.. The batteries have a considerable reduction
in capacity...oh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage..

hope this helps

Sorry for asking a question that's not entirely based on the
technical aspects of space, but I couldn't find the
answer on the FAQs ! I'm currently in the UK, which makes seeing a Space Shuttle
launch a little difficult.....

However, I have been selected to be an exchange student
at Louisiana State Uni. from August, and I am absolutely
determined to get to see a Space Shuttle launch sometime
during the year at which I will be in America. I hear there's a bit of a long mailing list, so if someone
can tell me how to get tickets and where to get them from, then
please E-mail me ! Thanks very much for your patience....

(And if anyone else wants to know, tell me and I'll summarize
for you - just to save all those poor people who have to

Fellow netters,

I just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out
there (even outside of Iowa). I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting
space, but I thought you might want some relief from the "So-and-so is a thief"
posts. Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be
nice to hear some good news once in a while. After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a
request for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS. He suggested a price of $50
in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping. That sounded
more than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a
message from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed
the money order). After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and
assured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for. He
sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a
transfer of license. This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him
to fill out one of their forms. It took three times
to get it to the right address (my fault). Anyway, he mailed me the form for
my signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the
deal. Again, he apologized for not sending it before. I now have the world's
best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good
ones left. I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat
you may want, give him a call. If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my
software from him.

You realize, of course, that inevitably some anal retentive moron is
going to come along and wag his fingers and his jowls in outrage that
personal politics are more important than [SMCAP][BOLD][Font:God
999pt.]The Law[smcap][bold][font]. But that's irrelevant to the problem here. Windows came with my
system, but on 5.25" disks. I hate using 5.25" disks, so I copied
them over to high density 3.5"'s using xcopy. In
fact, for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much
that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk. Not only can you
copy them over with one disk per directory, but if you want to, you
can simply copy them all into one directory. Makes it a lot nicer
when you're switching printer emulations around. Norton 6.0 I don't have much experience with, but when a friend's
system crashed, we restored from a backup rather than from the
originals, and it worked fine. This would imply that arj a -r norton
c:\nu would create a workable backup, and if you did a full install
the first time, you've got the whole thing. Never played with WP for Windows; I'm not too big of a fan of anything
from Utah. Good luck....

The MAXIMUM number of allocated cells is given by DefaultCells(mydisplay,

I had exactly the same problem with a 1981 Horizon. I sold that car quite a few years back but the memory of that tranny
sticks with me. It also had a clutch chatter in first that the dealer
could not fix. If the lemon law had been in place then, that car
would have been covered. I have had several Jap cars since then (figuring the Horizon was my
contribution to the American Auto Companies), and have never seen any
bad behavior with the exception of a Toyota Tercel with a bit of
clutch chatter that they did fix on the first try. Anyway, from that day forward, I have sworn that I would never
purchase another American car with a standard. American manufacturers
don't have a clue on how to manufacture five speed transmissions and
have been doing the automatics much longer and on many more cars. However, I hate automatics, so I am still buying Jap cars. Not sure this is any help, but other cars do this too. Cheers, Larry

1. The Magellan mission at Venus continues normally, gathering gravity
data which provides measurement of density variations in the upper
mantle which can be correlated to surface topography. Magellan has completed 7225 orbits of Venus and is now 39 days from
the end of Cycle-4 and the start of the Transition Experiment. No significant activities are expected next week, as preparations
for aerobraking continue on schedule. On Monday morning, April 19, the moon will occult Venus and
interrupt the tracking of Magellan for about 68 minutes. ___    _____     ___

Does anyone know if a source for the TCM3105 modem chips (as used in the

hobbyists:  small quantity, mail order, etc. For years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the
hundreds for PMP kits. But orders have dropped to the point where we can
no longer afford to offer this service. And all of the distributors I've
checked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so). I'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits. --

The book says that Muhammad was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a 
modern day Mad Mahdi) or he was actually who he said he was. Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows. Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar? People 
gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing 
how his son-in-law made the sun stand still. Call me a fool, but I believe 
he did make the sun stand still. Would more than an entire nation be drawn 
to someone who was crazy. For example 
anyone who is drawn to the Mad Mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see 
this right away. Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the

the evidence for the resurrection is quite good as these things
go. It is not entirely fair to claim that you can only take
the resurrection on faith. There are reasons to believe it

Very interesting, but I also believe that you have presented a
misleading argument. Christianity is not the cause of the massacres
and horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault
of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify
it to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their
ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in
the New Testament. With every truthful and good message that
carries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable
fact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted
way, with inevitable consequences. The Bible's message is that we are to love all people, and
that all people are redeemable. It preaches a message of
repentance, and of giving. Unfortunately, all people have
deceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message
around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways. This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine. One of the problems is that you look at the world through
the eyes of Western history. I think that you will find
many, many cases of massacres that were instigated by
people who never claimed they were Christian. I am not saying
this to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely
pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already. I doubt that we
would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we
live, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ. Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion
(I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which
would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such
subjects. Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for
power, greed and hatred. Please don't point the blame at
a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in
love for others. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented
is, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian. Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour
of the world, and especially Christians. I praise God for
Jesus Christ, and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs
and still come back to God and be forgiven, time and time
again.

In the Bible, there are a lot of instances where God speaks
to people, where a person just "came to know" some piece
of information, where a person walks off into the desert
for "40 days", etc. With all of God's power He certainly can
do whatever He wants when He wants it. The Bible "ends"
with the book of Revelations. So who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer
happening or still happening ? 8-)
With the cold response I've gotten from the past from this
group, it's very hard to get the point across. I'll only
go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look
at documents stored somewhere. I've cited the uncorrupted
bodies of saints before. That was
the spinning/descending of the sun. Currently,
images of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa
are showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under
investigation by the Church. But realize that investigations
take decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come
in ten days, that's a bit too late, isn't it 8-). Non-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I'm sure. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M
or God will call me home). Find out why they're
happening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody
can figure this out, tell us ! If you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned. We are scared to death sometimes although we're told not to. And that is why "not everything
is in the Bible". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told
to read the Bible. As far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned...
In the end, God's churches will unite. --

Well, as funny as your little comment may seem, it has very little to

everyone, and everyone's personal key is divided into two segments
and stored at two separate, albeit easy to find places, and that key is
only 80 bits to begin with, we are screwed (pardon the allusion to the 
affore-mentioned article)! the gov, I believe, as do many others probably already have the cracking chips
for this Clipper Chip made. Hell, they probably based the encoder on the 
chip that cracks it, that way it's easier to break the code, but since it is a 
classified algorythm, no one knows that they can crack it so easily. I, for one, and quite scared of this kind of thing, and plan to support 
organizations (and even disorganizations) who are fighting against this
Clipper Chip in any way that I can. I do not want the government to be able to have access, even with a search

misunderstood what you said. Also, my math is frequently noted for
being wrong, so you'll better check the calculations yourself. So if we assume one start and
one stopbit, and no protocol overhead, the effective number of bytes
per second is 1.44K.

Let's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in
stereo, so that you can send 1,440 samples/sec. This corresponds to a
Nyquist frequency of 720 Hz, which should be too low, especially if
you think about the 8-bit low quality sound. Furthermore, your D/A
converter will probably not present you with a signal that has been
cut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higher
frequencies. (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcome
that problem.) On the other hand, speech should be easily compressible. For example,
you could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter and
then linearize the fourier transforms. It won't be CD quality sound,
but it'll be discernible. The power spectrum method is very good in
that respect. I have once programmed such a software compressor, and
compression rates of 90% with relative errors due to linearization of
less than 5% were common. Although I must say that these were musical
sounds, not speech. --

Just a little something I found while reading the Village Voice, which
is not noted for its sports coverage, but occasionally the print some
interesting features. This year, the predictions/team analyses for
the 1993 season were presented in the form of Bob Dylan lyrics. I
don't have the article in front of me, so I'll only give the memorable
ones here that I remember and know the melody to. I could dig up more
if there is interest. Yankess (to the tune of "Subterranean Homesick Blues")

Howe is in the basement, mixing up the medicine. George is on the pavement thinking 'bout the government. Wade Boggs in a trench coat, bat out, paid off,
Says he's got a bad back, wants to get it laid off. Don't know when, but it's Columbus again. Mets (to the tune of "Like a Rolling Stone")

Once upon a time you played so fine
you threw away Dykstra before his prime, didn't you? People said "Beware Cone, he's bound to roam"

[No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God. However Paul was
writing for a largely Gentile audience. The issue that the Church had to
face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to
follow Christ. It simply acknowledged that fact that it
didn't apply to Gentiles. Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5. I think we can reasonably assume that
Mat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience. The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke
7) suggest that he was a "God-fearer", i.e. a Gentile who followed
God, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law. He was commended by
Jewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such. At least as I
read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a
certain sense superceded. Again, this issue isn't one of the
abolition of the Law. But the interesting thing to notice is that
even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law. For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's
important that it not be relaxed. The
quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest
of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the
Law. He is quite
concerned about maintaining moral standards. The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being
superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe
they are talking about different aspects of the Law. Paul is
embroiled in arguments about circumcision. On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems
to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and
human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later
to give Paul so much trouble. Look at the
way terms like "family values" take on special meaning from the
current context.

Hi. I am trying to set up a Conner 3184 and a Quantum 80AT drive. I have
the conner set to the master, and the quantum set to the slave (doesn't work
the other way around). I am able to access both drives if I boot from a 
floppy, but the drives will not boot themselves. I am running MSDOS 6, and
have the Conner partitioned as Primary Dos, and is formatted with system
files. I have tried all different types of setups, and even changed IDE
controller cards. If I boot from a floppy, everything works great (except
the booting part :)). The system doesn't report an error message or anything,
just hangs there. Does anyone have any suggestions, or has somebody else
run into a similar problem? I was thinking that I might have to update the bios
on one of the drives (is this possible?). Any suggestions/answers would be
greatly appreciated. Please reply to:

  Here's how I talk to non-Christians who are complaining about Hell. ME:	"Do you believe you're going to Heaven?" ME:	"But since there isn't a Heaven, you're not going there, are you?" The point is that Heaven is based on faith--if you don't believe in heaven,
there's no way you're going to be in it. Of course, the next step is, "I don't believe in Hell either, so why will I
be there?" It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from God. Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever, and never
see God--so they do, in fact, believe that they're going to Hell. Hell doesn't have to be worse than earth to be Hell--because it's eternal, 
and it's a lot worse than Heaven. Alan Terlep				    "Incestuous vituperousness"

Here in the UK, the bandwidth restriction apparently only apply to 
local lines.. ie those used by the average domestic client. Private
lines which are run from the local exchange to the leasing client are 
usually capable of a higher bandwidth if the exchange is digital. Don't quote me on that..... But I think I remember a BT engineer

The IIvx...LCIII performance at a Centris 610 price. The only reason
to get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep 
in mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet. This lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards. And unless
you're running FPU-intensive software, the 610 will blow the doors off the
LCIII and the IIvx. The LCIII, on the other hand, is sufficient for most
people and has a great price. If you haven't guessed, I find halving the bus clock (the IIvx 32MHz uP vs.
16MHz bus) a throughly bad thing and I hope Apple never does it again. --

The people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly,
too arrogant, or too apathetic to discuss this issue since I have yet to
see any discussion grace my computer screen. While it holds PARTICULAR
interest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain
from discussing it. As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity
has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental
hold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. This was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in
slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners. It
wasn't enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your
GOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be
worshipped with great pride. But how culturally & biblically accurate are
these icons? Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in
European countries, as that of a Black Madonna. But what about Biblical
physical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,
His feet to that of brass? And think about the area of the world where all
Biblical actions took place. I welcome all intelligent commentary on this
important topic; flamers need not reply. Sherlette 

P.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn't matter what
color His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts." But He walked the earth for 3
decades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me. And as for
saying that "it doesn't matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipated
people who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT
MATTERS. [The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified. There has been discussion of this issue in the past. We can't discuss
everything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn't been
discussed recently shouldn't be taken as a sign of general cowardice,
arrogance or apathy. In past discussions no one has been outraged by
suggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a
few scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic. As you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in
art tends to show him as one of the people. Thus you wouldn't be
surprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art
showing him as oriental. There are good reasons relating to Christian
devotion to think of him in such a way. It's also good now and then
to have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member
of XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.

From the credulous side: [Stanway, Andrew, _Alternative Medicine: A Guide

p211, p188. A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32

  1950s. Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'
  their subjects, they photographed them. They found
  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead
  and living objects. Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones
  were subject to changes. The object's life activity was also visible in
  highly variable colour patterns. High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in
  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up
  seriously. Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers
  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and
  spotty. The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose
  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method. They claim to be able to
  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase. But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is
  the phantom effect. During high frequency photography of a leaf from
  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the
  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly. The important thing
  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern
  can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would
  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished. The energy grid
  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than
  the actual object itself. [...]

  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer
  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...

  study, making grand discoveries in his basement. Many paranormal
  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for
  instance. If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will
  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and
  hobbyists for a century. It took a lone basement crank to declare that
  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura. Their conclusion: The
  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on
  the surface of the body and not to mysterious "auras" or even
  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state. Nevertheless,
  television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous

Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card

Several problems:

1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB
   of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED
   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K
   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB
   VRAM. 2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:

   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an
      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often
      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to
      be. b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the
      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you
      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK). 3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development
   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger
   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the
   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed
   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The
   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled. Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen
   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter
   "R". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it
   does this satisfactorily. The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive
   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with
   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles
   the VGA mode. The same bug shows up when I use
   another monitor in place of my usual one. I still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be
remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).

Hi! A while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the IWII

was that the IWII would not work there. As I will be moving there this summer,
I called Apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the IWII (as bought
in the U.S.) will definitely run on 50 Hz AC current (as long as a step-down
converter is employed if 240 V current is used). The same info, turns out, can
be found in the IWII manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but I didn't really
trust that. Does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary?

One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG
channels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate. If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be
sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per
channel sampling rate.) That level of analog multiplexing should
be rather easy to accomplish. Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without
generating intermodulation. A system to be carried by a runner is
in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to
keep balanced. A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with
a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth. Obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws
govern the use of transeivers in your location. --

Organization: chevron
Lines: 51


 I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway. About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes
 under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement
 of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of
 the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced
 the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor 
 suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue. While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being 
 manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently
 increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (
 palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part
 the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had
 been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the
 pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is 
 persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3
 and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides
 minor reductions in pain and is only short term. My questions are: 

     Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the
     levels of pain? Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced? Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored? Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated. Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group. If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup
  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated. --

  What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the
10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings. I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz. They are essentially
double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz. The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used
previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham
Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook. The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used
at these speeds. There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design
of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly). While using this would have let me reduce the "external" IF count on
receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I
didn't bother with it. The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2
MHz channel but later reduced to half that. These 256 kbps radios
actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and
speed is pretty much a function of filter design. Handling the data
stream is another matter entirely. Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a
"beacon" test mode. While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow
due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO
also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn. Even
though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes
of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of
a second. I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in
and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland
IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the
proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running
low on resources of time, money and energy. If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW
ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma
Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley). I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly
approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and
you might want to carefully consider your "target". If you can't
arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think
you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by
multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS. I'm currently working on a spread
spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems. I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems. 73

While not exactly a service incident, I had a similar experience recently  
when I bought a new truck. I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we  
agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax
and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck. When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  
get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  
started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  
miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  
another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  
their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  
brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  
reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  
treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  
deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  
snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  
the turn of events. Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  
to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  
asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  
that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  
that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  
and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  
pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  
lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  
him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else. A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  
apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  
knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  
it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  
and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....

I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  
decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  
back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  
truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  
incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  
there in my new truck in about 30 mins. So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  
have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  
person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  
sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  
dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee. I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.

	Is life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on a
curve? I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to
know what some of you people think. Specifically, are there an
infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that
he/she deserves? Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we "graded" by those around us, or has there always
been some unchanging method? Is the person's childhood taken
into account? I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to
most of you, but I figure that you're the experts. -Quinn

[Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree. I suspect
that's because our primary source of information is prophets and
visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic. However
both Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation
to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and
eternal death. On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that
imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of
similar passages where Jesus says things like "even XXX will be better
off than you in the judgement." Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who
gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were. But these
passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,
so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or
hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that). The only
Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the
Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far
enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian). Their
ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition
to the Bible and "Holy Tradition" of a more generic Christian sort. Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of
associating grading with God. The whole point of Christ was to free
us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass. If you
like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale,
but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that
was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to
see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading. While there are
differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all
agree that in one way or another, God cheats. I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly
how far God's cheating extends. Will he accept people who don't
explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their
hearts? Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in
principle, but certainly not all do. Jesus provided us with a clear
description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he
provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing
line. Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether
other individuals are saved or not.

 Well, I'm a Wings fan and I think the FIRST thing that you should do is to
get the opponent's line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone
with them. There is no Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert line, except for maybe on a
powerplay. These three players usually play on three different lines. Which would mean that Toronto's checking line would have to pull a triple
shift. The Wings' lines usually look like this:

Say, you bought your Saturn at $13k, with a dealer profit of $2k. If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for
the same car. Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000, 
then their cars will be even better deals. Say, if the price of a Saturn was
already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they
reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average. It will:

1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY. 2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive. Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even 
the buyers for other cars will pay less.

I have a .BAT file that I run under a Windows Icon. I have set up a PIF
file to run the BAT file in exclusive mode and to use the entire screen. The first line of the BAT file sets an environment variable. My problem is that on some of our machines (running MS-DOS 5.0 and Windows
3.1 in enhanced mode), the SET command in the BAT file fails with the
OUT OF ENVIRONMENT SPACE error. I have raised the amount of environment 
space to 2048 bytes using the SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS so I know that
I am nowhere near to running out. If I just click on the MS-DOS icon,
I can create a bunch of environment varibles from the DOS shell. The problem
is that on some machines, setting the value of an environment variable in

Yeah - they also gave it their "Editor's Choice" in the run-down of

I bought (and then returned) mine. The only conclusion I can come up with

I wouldn't call it "vague." All "regulation" is 
not necessarily the same. By opposing all government regulation, some 
libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that
regulate relatively free markets as identical. That's one reason
many of the rest of us find their analysis to be simplistic. jsh

I'm working upon a game using an isometric perspective, similar to
that used in Populous. Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded
for a particular vantage. In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope
of 1/4. ( I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this
before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:

1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a
packed->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the "jaggies." I'm
now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary). Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,
thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden? 2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort
the original. I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed. Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared
shape? Currently I take:

  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48
 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64

and produce:
            
             1  2  3  4
33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8
49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12
            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16
                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32
                                    61 62 63 64

Line 1 follows the slope. Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels. This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels. Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap
already skewed? Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective? I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering. [*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)
*are* parallel with its bottom lines. This is why there appears to
be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside
of a cube, depending on your mood). This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to
change size as they move about in the room). I've decided that this
approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough
distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in
a real perspective drawing. Hopefully the "context" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches
hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity. --

>So why do I read in the papers that the Qumram texts had "different

the world. Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of
religion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a "real"
story (that is, a bigger headline). At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the
various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the
Septuagint, the ancient greek translation. The Masoretic text is the
standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary. In some places it has
obvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and
to the Septuagint. Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:
first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are
variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to "fixing"/predating
the various corrupted passages). It must be emphasized that, to the best of
my knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and
have little theological import. The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of
Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books. There
is also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no
sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the
septuagint). As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations
between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions. These tend to reflect the
septuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error. Again, though, the
differences (thus far) are not significant theologically. There is this big
expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the
material, but so far this hasn't happened. The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the
OT, unlike for the NT. --

Subject: Re: SSPX schism ? And I pared down the rest to what was relevant. If this were so, as was noted at the
beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American
bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a
decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not
constitute schism but disobedience. The Catholic Encyclopedia
explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to
intend "to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies." The Archbishop made
his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: "We pray
for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations
last June 30. We recognize in John Paul II
the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he
is a heretical Pope. The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. In the 1917
Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see
Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Lefebvre
as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,
that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the
illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise
an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the
bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of
jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of
ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and
also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way
the gravity of the step take by Mgr. It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics
that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican
has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression. There is not
so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The
first part deals with "Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the
Church" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense
of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable
smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly
justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate
parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had
been convicted of first degree murder. It would be hard to
imagine a more authoritative opinion. One deals with offenses
    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are
    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a
    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the
    exercise of a specific ministry. ....

It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating
bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least
intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and
will never be a schismatic. Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce
Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he
knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no
greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. A quotation from a
statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February
1989 Remnant merits careful study:

    In retrospect, the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June
    appears more paved with grave Roman (and, unfortunately, also
    papal) omissions than with Lefebvrist "obstinancies." Lefebvre has "an
    erroneous concept of Tradition."

This may be a stupid question, but how does the government know which keys

(the National Health Care ID, perhaps) be required when purchasing a
Clipper-equipted phone? Or will each chip transmit identifying information at the start of
a conversation? Identification which could be used to automatically
log who calls whom? (The _phone_ company keeps records, but this 
information would be accessable by a well-placed van near a microwave

an eavesdropper?

   It was good to see the Wings play, but lets not give ESPN too much credit. There weren't any other late baseball games on so they didn't have another
option.

Well, my 14inch VGA 1024x758-interlacing 2.5 year old no brand monitor just
bit the bullet. I pressed the power switch and a few seconds later, the power
light went out with a POP. I think the problem with my monitor is
the power switch... but the image was getting pretty dim anyway (I needed to
have my contrast all the way to the max...). And the screen did flicker from
time to time. Is this normal (hehehe) or do I just have the worst of luck??? Save up for a
*really* good one and get by with a cheap EGA monitor for now? I rather save
my money to upgrade my 386SX to 486-66 though...

Thanks! --

There's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid. I thought
I'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant. I splurged
and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; the
highest-paid player is Frank Thomas, at $900K.  I cut some players, like
Kenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunch
of pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a
cost of $1 million for the lot of them. The total team salary is 
$7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300K a player. If that's too steep,
you can dump Thomas and Bagwell, replacing them with Paul Sorrento and
a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have one
of the best teams in the majors. standard disclaimers      |                    -- James Donald, in misc.legal

	Hi,

	I have a problem, I hope some of the 'gurus' can help me solve. Background of the problem:
	I have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e  the mesh is a 
	mapping of a 3d Bezier patch into 2d. The area in this domain
	which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. The trimming
	loop is a set of 2d Bezier curve segments. For the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells. My problem is this :
	The trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller
	cells bounded by the trimming curve segments. If a cell
	is wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole ,
	else it is trivially rejected. Does any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo. --

A while ago I installed SPSS for Windows as part of an evaluation. Once
the evaluation was complete I duly deleted the software from my PC. Unfortunately there is still a "ghost" of SPSS left: when I run
something like "Write" and go to embed an object then "SPSS Chart"
appears on the list of objects I'm offered. I looked around all
the obvious "INI" files without success. The next thing I tried
was looking for the string "SPSS Chart" in every file in the 
Windows directory. It turned up in a file called REQ.DAT (or
REG.DAT). Unfortunately the file was binary and so I didn't feel
inclined to edit it. I'd welcome a solution for removing SPSS from the list of OLE servers.

H E L P ! I have  a problem in which I'm getting increasing frustrated every day...

Some background about my PC:

- American Megatrend BIOS (clone 386 SX) with 32M of RAM
- config.sys file:

	device=c:\dos\himem.sys
	dos=high,umb
	device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems
	files=30
	buffers=30
	stack=9,256

- autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c
- CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram. The problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31

I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place
for windows. Ok, I then proceed to install Norton Desktop
for Windows version 2.0. I also
allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:). The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running
and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse)
from the desktop. First of all, I always get the application error screen followed by
another application error screen with various different messages. The
following are some of them:

- Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some
  number. ( TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture)
- General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address
- Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address

Some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the
TSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help. Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling
WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing
memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running. Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. --------------

would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how
society has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They 
support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum
who have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society

I remember an article of about a year ago which stated that besides his wife,
Saddam also has a mistress. Assad's brother has a wife and *several*
mistresses, and those 'emirs' in the Gulf have, within their lifetimes,
wives in the double digitas (only they manage to keep four at a time). It takes a *lot* more than infidelity to make these

	[Prof. Denning's description of SkipJack mostly omitted]

	CHIP STRUCTURE
	The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption
	algorithm called "Skipjack." The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared
	with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16
	for the DES). It supports all 4 DES modes of operation. F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
	N, a 30-bit serial number
	U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted
		 with the chip
	The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then
	fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:

  	   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
	   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block. Three questions:
1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:
		E[M;K] = 64 bits
		E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits
		E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits
   Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,
   or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning? All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications
   like cellular phones (or even regular phones over 

2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output? Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,
   or also to the wiretap block? Or, if the wiretap block is only
   transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into
   everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode? 3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself? Does the block have to be present at all? Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,
   it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's 
   limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,
   and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness
   (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets
   it recognize a valid E[K;U].) In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT
   wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention? (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.) Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;
   paranoid people can use someone else's serial number. On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,
   presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,
   like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ? --

1. IF YES, you wouldn't have posted such drivel. The "Lord, Liar
    or Lunatic" argument is a false trilemma. Even if you disprove
    Liar and Lunatic (which you haven't), you have not eliminated
    the other possibilities, such as Mistaken, Misdirected, or
    Misunderstood. You have arbitrarily set up three and only
    three possibilities without considering others. Read a good book on rhetoric and critical thinking. If
    you think the "Lord, Liar, or Lunatic" discussion is an
    example of a good argument, you are in need of learning. Read the FAQs again, especially "Constructing a Logical

OK Phil, you're right. So far the "evidence" suggests that Nixon was a victim
of overzealous underlings and Kennedy was a womanizing disgust-o-blob with
a dash of megalomania. After crushing the CIA and FBI who's to say Kennedy 
wouldn't have created his own version of American Friendly Fascism? Unfortunately however, we don't have all the evidence. So far this nation's
citizens have been privy to about 12 hours of the total 4,000 hours of Nixon's
tapes. Some archivists have alluded that
there is "evidence" to suggest that Nixon and his cronies, including George
Bush, were aware of the plot to murder Kennedy before he was shot in Dallas. Ask your local D.A. what the charges are for the above crime. And so I must ask you, Phil me putz, when all this shit finally comes out

fine, only to compress C: to have the thing choke, spit out an unintelligable

and config.sys. Calls to Microsoft only met with busy signals. After reformatting
the drive, I'm not sure if he had the guts to reinstall 6.0 or stay with a known
entity. The other may have been a marginal drive, however, his upgrade failed,
he had to format a floppy disk at 6.0, format the drive, and then reinstall. I make now claims since I was not driving at the time, however, be careful
and make sure you back important things up. I am interested in any other people with similar or success stories.....

  Damn right you can't provide any evidence for it. Rarely are any widespread social phenomenon reducible to such a
  simple premise. If they were, psychology would be a hard science
  with roughly the same mathematical soundness as physics. It is much more likely, however,
  that it reflects your socialization and religious background, as

This might a real wierd idea or maybe not..

I have seen where people have blown up ballons then sprayed material into them
that then drys and makes hard walls...

Why not do the same thing for a space station..

Fly up the docking rings and baloon materials and such, blow up the baloons,
spin then around (I know a problem in micro gravity) let them dry/cure/harden? and cut a hole for the docking/attaching ring and bingo a space station..

Of course the ballons would have to be foil covered or someother radiation
protective covering/heat shield(?) and the material used to make the wals would
have to meet the out gasing and other specs or atleast the paint/covering of
the inner wall would have to be human safe.. Maybe a special congrete or maybe
the same material as makes caplets but with some changes (saw where someone
instea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture, got a mix that was just as
strong as congret but easier to carry around and such..)

Sorry for any spelling errors, I missed school today.. (grin)..

Why musta  space station be so difficult?? why be
confined to earth based ideas, lets think new ideas, after all space is not
earth, why be limited by earth based ideas?? ==

       The Republicans are, in general, fighting any tax increase. There is also worry that a VAT would be far too easy to increase
incrementally. (BTW, what is different between Canada's tax and most of
Europe's that makes it "visible?") >and

tax rates. However, this is something that bothers me. We're always talking

consumption provide a disincentive to spend money? ------------------------------------------------------------------------

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a muslim (spelled sometimes as Moslem) I must say that Muslims strong
ly believe in Jesus. Refered in islamic text as eesau(as)

         Jesus ==>  J - esu  - s    ===> esu (pronounced eee-saw)

Yah we knew him well. And even in
a time of war, our goal is peace. We should try to refrain from viloating
the peace of others as then if we do violate, we will not have peace in
ourselves. I don't like this war eaither,  It is a conflict of territory. Croats, Muslims, and Serbs lived together before in peace. And Im sure that there is a General out there who wouldn't
mind being a president. --

[From a Christian perspective, Moslem ideas about Jesus look rather
seriously erroneous. I've generally tried to avoid discussions of
Islam in this group, since soc.religion.islam is the right place for
that. Thus I don't much want to go into detail. I will simply note
that Moslems reject most of what Christians regard as the most
essential facts about Jesus. So at least from a Christian perspective
Moslems don't know Jesus. Again, this is no justification for
Christians to hate Moslems or to kill them. I agree with you that
this war should never be.

I just had my 41 Chrysler painted. I was told to refrain from waxing it and
to leave it out in the sun!! Supposedly this let's the volatiles escape from
the paint over a month or so (I can smell it 15 feet away on a hot day) and
lets any slight irregularites in the surface flow out, as the paint remains
a little soft for a while.

First, let me offer you my condolences. I've had kidney stones 4 times 
and I know the pain she is going through. First, it is best that she see 
a doctor. However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and the
only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a
urinary tract infection. The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones
are extremely painful. My stones were judged passable, so we just waited it
out. However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun. Anyway, if she
absolutely won't see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps
an over the counter sleeping pill. But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctor. Kidney stones are not something to fool around with. She should be x-rayed 
to make sure there is not a serious problem.

I know someone had long talks about Solar Sails early this year and late last
year..Also about Solar Sailing. Not sure who captured it if possible..

I think it was one of the regulars who had most or all the data? I think I started the latest round or the late last year round.. But the topic

Los Angeles Times, Tuesday, April 13, 1993. In
reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and
amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40
years. From police sources he
obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people. And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government
to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills. These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former
Los Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with
police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide
intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League. They
have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz. On one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a
pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa,
Israel. The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil
rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on
groups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. In their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation
League has collected information on political activists in the Los
Angeles area for more than 30 years. Bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy
drama. Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by
the ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities. Officially, I'm only
a contract worker with Bruce Hochman. That way, the league would not
be officially connected with me." Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists
to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own
name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink. In the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a
synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and
matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by
police. Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups. Bullock also gave the trash to
Gerard for Gerard to examine. Gerard would later return the trash to
Bullock." From a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876
individuals and more than 950 political groups. Gerard, whose files
contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people. In 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of
information to the South African government. Bullock tells of
meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels
and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100
bills. Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled
only from public sources. For example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records
and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of
the confidential police data found in his computer. "For a short time, it was
wonderful," he told police. Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he
attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a
rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for
Holocaust Studies. Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the
probe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation. Unlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the
investigation. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment. --

Summary: Part 5 of 10 of the sci.crypt FAQ, Product Ciphers. The parts are
mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part. The Cryptography 
FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers
every 21 days. * Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication? * How was NSA involved in the design of DES? * What are "ECB", "CBC", "CFB", and "OFB" encryption? Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show
  that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number
  of rounds. If
  for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers
  are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by
  random boolean functions. See the question about "ECB" below for more details. This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985
  "Financial Institution Key Management" and is intended for use in
  encrypting DES keys and IVs for "Automated Key Distribution". That standard says (section 7.2.1): "Key encrypting keys may be a single
  DEA key or a DEA key pair. A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a
  single key." One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form
  E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance
  has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on
  sci.crypt. Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say
  that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence
  of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.'' The NSA did not
  dictate a single wire!'' ...
  Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in
  compliance with this standard." Despite this, software
  implementations abound, and are used by government agencies. Cryptech CRY12C102: 22.5Mbit/s according to Data Sheet, with 32 Bit
  interface. INFOSYS DES Chip (Germany):
  S-Boxes must be loaded by software. Call
  Newbridge Microsystems, Ottawa, (613) 592-0714. (... there are no
  import/export issues with Canada and the US). C[n]	The n'th block of ciphertext, output from encryption, input to
  	decryption. IV	A 64-bit "initialization vector", a secret value which, along with
  	the key, is shared by both encryptor and decryptor. R[n]	The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes. Electronic Code Book (ECB):

  	  P[n] and C[n] are each 64-bits long. Encryption:			Decryption:
  	  I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV
  (n>0)	  I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | R[n-1]	I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | R[n-1]	
  (all n) R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)		R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)
  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n]

  	  Note that for k==64, this reduces to:

  	  I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV
  (n>0)	  I[n] = R[n-1]			I[n] = R[n-1]	
  (all n) R[n] = E(I[n])		R[n] = E(I[n])
  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n]

  OFB notes: encryption and decryption are identical.

     What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away? Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution,
crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution. Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are
   quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by? Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges? Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the
gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that
GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population
(within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic
halo. ( Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)
(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was
probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)
	As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo
population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is
ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you
have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism
of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start
to see for example the Andromeda's bursters. The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution
(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with
the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence
isotropy) and the edge is "the edge of the Universe" ;-)
If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)
and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star
colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting
the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable. If we know anything about physics at that level,
the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic
strings, wrong spectrum for one thing. The situation is further complicated by recent claims that
there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS
they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the
NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]

   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering
   hyperspace :-)

   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they
   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered
   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in. If you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...

Today I recieved a in-warranty replacement for my
Diamond Speedstar 24X.  On the card I've noticed a few
changes; mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP5. (The card is revision 5A)

My detective work has shown that this jumper simply
connects/disconnects the BALE line on the 64-pin part
of the ISA bus. The question I have is simple:
To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X,
what does the manual claim that this jumper does? To anyone with an ISA-reference, what is the function of the
BALE line? On a related note:
Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to
the ISA bus? My motherboard manual has a simple pin-to-signal-name
chart, but that is it. -Douglas

Fellow netters,

I'm in the market for a hand scanner. However, I don't know anyone who has
one. Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90. It includes GrayWorks
software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think). The OCR software
Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also. Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales
(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi. It is available for $169
mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE. I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics. It
is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400
dpi) and price ($149). Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy. I have heard that
Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners. Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP
LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)? I am leaning toward the
Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of
prices. If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would
recommend it. Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range
(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me. Any and all help
would be greatly appreciated.

If you get the Centris 650 with CD configuration, you are getting a Mac with
a 68RC040 processor that has built-in math coprocessor support. My 
understanding is that the "optional fpu" refers to your option of purchasing
the Centris 650 4/80 without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU. Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU
system. And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system
(a 68LC040) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor. Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610, which ONLY
comes with a non-FPU 68LC040 processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU -
the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot
swap one for another (again, according to Apple's memo). Kevin Lohman

   There's only one way I know of to tell an AR-15 from an M-16. Pick it up, hold it about a foot from your face and look closely
   at the saftey lever. If it has two positions, its an AR-15, if
   it has three, its an M-16. There are numerous internal differences
   as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see
   them, they are not valid in this discussion. So, in conclusion,
   there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15
   from an M-16 except at close (very close) range. David Bixler

Greetings,
    I have an Epson HI-80 4 pen plotter forsale. It emulates an HP 7570
or 7574 - I'm not sure which. It has an option board on it that does
the emulation. It has a serial interface with Hardware handshake. I
also have 340 Pens for it as follows:  10 packs of 4 Black Oil based, 16
packs of 4 Red,Green, Blue, and Black pens, 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black,
7 packs of 4 Aqueous R,G,Blue,Black,  1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color
pens,  and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored. I have tested it using the Windows drivers for
HP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine. I figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth at
least another $200 more..  One thing is certain, you won't need to
purchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens were
sealed so they are all still fresh. The rest were capped and seem to
function as well. I'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in
just them. I'm selling it because I got a HP LaserJet and I don't need color. I'd like $350 or best offer...

second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still

You say this as if it were surprising,  yet in fact a necessary consequence

The idea that such programs as Social Security or AFDC should be considered
"defense" (an idea which has been advanced in ths and other newsgroups) is
so absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration. I don't want to seem patronizing,  but you still seem to be laboring
under the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably
intelligent and honest persons (like yourself) who make the decisions. I feel any third party added to a transaction is every bit as likely to be
ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller. I don't expect you to agree

As one who was born in Quebec and worked in Montreal, I feel I must
defend the reputation of McGill University. It is a fine, old,
creditable institution of higher learning. Thus, I can only assume that some under graduate student left his/her

Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think
it's great! However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers
to the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why? Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive. Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and
what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller
card on my ISA 486-50. I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)
about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit). I believe I'm getting
something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU). How would this
number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and
the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system? Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook
up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and
own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).

I'm assuming that the cabling tells the Mac, at startup, what kind of

magazines for products (I'm not sure if it's just a monitor, just a
video card, or a package of both) that allow you to change resolutions
on the fly (w/o restarting the Mac). If you were to buy a 1304, would it be possible to switch back and

Mac? Is this strictly a hardware startup function, or can software
intervene, or does the Mac hardware occasionally probe the cable
setting and switch automatically?

(forties? when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing. The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max
Friz's famous design, but with an overhead "point cam" (see below for
more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground
clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so
that the ground clearance was substantially increased:


      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)
                 Viking motor (front) ->   \=@=/

This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved
around a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn
in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting
rods to accomodate the stroke. The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still
unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and
and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was
required to drive both overhead valves. Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a
pressurized stream of oil to power the "waterwheel" which kept the lobe
spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal
engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to
normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,
resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a
little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the
beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to
pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,
uses an electric oil pump. Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively
firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily
lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even
higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This
was feasible because it was a racing engine. The bore curve would start
                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in
                             this diagram


The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of
the day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of
finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it
worked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary
technology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that
racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines
were raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate
(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two
Springers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and
down that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as
twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern
record of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle
historians discount this story. Ryan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride

Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder. It is 
disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich
or any other act of terrorism or mrder. This exercise is aimed 
solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth. I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of

we are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists. Most of the 
people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily
business, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are
older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee. Even the inhabitants of the village do not 
know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often
suspect who they are and what they are up to. These young men are
supported financially by Iran most of the time. Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured
by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians. Once they
are back they announce that they bombed a "terrorist  hideout" where
an 8 year old girl just happened to be. We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is 
the Israeli way of telling us that "if you're gonna hurt our soldiers
you're gonna pay the price". We accept this as a price we have to pay
to free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting
the resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather
just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young 
men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are
taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers. Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that
we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance
on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING 
ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real 
leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw. The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a 
regular basis. If Israel insists that
the so called "Security Zone" is necessary for the protection of 
Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation
with the blood of its soldiers. If Israel is interested in peace,
than it should withdraw from OUR land. In fact it has caused much more
Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel
would have resulted in. If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw 
unilaterally from the so-called "Security Zone" before the conclusion
of the peace talks. I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing
CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make

 From the README file of version 4.99c:

 This is the PLPLOT distribution. PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for
 many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike. Despite its small size
 and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard
 x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,
 bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)
 may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph. Different
 line styles, widths and colors are supported. A virtually infinite number of
 distinct area fill patterns may be used. There are almost 1000 characters in
 the extended character set. This includes four different fonts, the Greek
 alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols. The fonts
 can be scaled to any size for various effects. The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain. The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly
 granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without
 consent of the authors. You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT
 object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it
 is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely
 available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed
 somewhere in the documentation for the package. We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of
 user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes. There is great interest
 in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only
 afford to work on it part time. Improvements will necessarily focus on
 those which help us get our work done. PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically
 without modification. Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub
 routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any
 modification of the user program. Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to
 the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained
 there. Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes. CREDITS

Well Bruins fans it's playoff time again. It looks like the B's have peaked at the right time. Getting out of the Adams is going to be a cat fight to the end. After what they did to Montreal and Quebec, these teams will be out for
revenge. If Neely can stay healthy, and both Bourque and Moog stay sharp,
we should get to see Neely finally take out two years of frustration 
on Ulf (I don't fight) Samuelson. I don't agree with fighting in the NHL,
but if there is one guy who deserves to be taken out good, it's him. This is going to be a good series, Go Bruins!!!!
A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a
high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Each
option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,
operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research
operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds. Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA
budget for the President's new technology investment. As a result,
station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting
reductions in the rest of the NASA budget. For example, a space station
option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA
budget over the next 5 years. Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of
the advisory committee. Generally, the members-designate focused upon
administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the
Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory
committee to consider. Gibbons also announced that the United States and its
international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have
decided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use of
Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process. To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the
redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign
team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR
and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of
the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. The
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing
station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving
that goal. Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to the
redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the
science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program
represents. However, he also is committed to a space station that is well
managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should
be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation." NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian
participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science
Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald
Sagdeev.

Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the 
significant drop in price year after year. The link I want to use 
though (ISDN 64K) is costly and the bandwidth limited. That's why my
interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic 
goes through it. >Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding

I think it'd help if we got a couple good atheists (or even some good,
steadfast agnostics) in some high political offices. When was the last
time we had an (openly) atheist president? (I don't
actually know; these aren't rhetorical questions.) One thing that really ticked me off a while ago was an ad for a news
program on a local station...The promo said something like "Who are
these cults, and why do they prey on the young?" If that isn't preying on the young, I don't know what
is...

I used to be (ack, barf) a Catholic, and was even confirmed...Shortly
thereafter I decided it was a load of BS. My mom, who really insisted
that I continue to go to church, felt it was her duty (!) That was one of the more presumptuous things I've heard
in my life. I suggested we go talk to the priest, and she agreed. The
priest was amazingly cool about it...He basically said that if I didn't
believe it, there was no good in forcing it on me. Actually, I guess he
wasn't amazingly cool about it--His response is what you'd hope for
(indeed, expect) from a human being. I s'pose I just _didn't_ expect
it...  

I find it absurd that religion exists; Yet, I can also see its
usefulness to people. Facing up to the fact that you're just going to
be worm food in a few decades, and that there isn't some cosmic purpose
to humanity and the universe, can be pretty difficult for some people. Having a readily-available, pre-digested solution to this is pretty
attractive, if you're either a) gullible enough, b) willing to suspend
your reasoning abilities for the piece of mind, or c) have had the stuff
rammed down your throat for as long as you can remember. Religion in
general provides a nice patch for some human weaknesses; Organized
religion provides a nice way to keep a population under control. Chris

You say that you were a "catholic," but if you do not believe in the Christian
God (I suppose that means the God of the Bible) and publicly state this,   
you are in all probability not a Roman Catholic. "Public heretics, even
those who err in good faith (material heretics), do not belong to the body
of the Church" (Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, 1960, Ludwig Ott, p. 311). All is not lost, however, as you still might belong spiritually to the
Church by your desire to belong to it. As you said, only God can judge
the condition of a man's soul. About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul 
1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians. Following the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider   
returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob. Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic,
that is true. As I have posted before, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium, II,   
n. 16) teaches: "Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know
the Gospel of Christ or His Chruch, but who nevertheless seek God with a
sincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His will
as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may
achieve eternal salvation." Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processes
of God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture. Scripture is one
of the best sources for learning what can be known about God. --

  UPI Washington DC, Update Desk			4/15/93

  For the past several months the Clinton administration has been
  stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy. While most
  leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the 
  economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area
  of jobs creation. The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark. last month,
  in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed
  a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting
  economic signals. This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore. Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion. "It's the guns" Vice President Gore said. Apparently NRA members, and other
  "gun-nuts" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the
  economy out of the recession. "Their buying them five times faster than
  ever before, and stockpiling left and right", the Vice President said. However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have
  been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several
  declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have
  not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand. "We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people", said
  the President of Colt industries. "As long as Clinton is in office, we
  suspect it will", he added. In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new
  Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session. It's 
  called the "Ban-One-A-Month" Gun Control Bill. Under the terms of this law,
  every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index 
  cards. The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw
  one card every month. Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any
  further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the
  politically connected and to members of the National Police Force. The President said, "This law will benefit America two ways. In addition,
  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the
  street." He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee
  this program, citing her "Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject
  of gun control". Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an
  amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing
  caliber designations for all know ammunitions. "Their stockpiling,
  stockpiling, stockpiling" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference
  at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.

  Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment
  that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been
  drawn from the hat. Senator Simon was quoted as saying, "First we'll
  fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning", during a press
  conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate
  building. He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow
  the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require
  the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,
  after all of the cards have been drawn. The head of the BATF responded by saying, "We will have to see if this
  thing in Waco is over by then. We may be too busy to seize all those
  guns". US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado
  declared this proposed law as being "reasonable gun control which won't
  affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns". - end article -

often used than my horn. At speeds below 40mph on the interstates,
quite common in mountains with trucks, some states require flashers. In rural areas, flashers let the guy behind you know there is a tractor
with a rather large implement behind it in the way. Use them whenever 
you need to communicate that things will deviate from the norm. >--

	Is that ZX-11 painted green? Since the green Triumph 650 that
a friend owned was sold off, her name is now free for adoption. How
does the name "Thunderpickle" grab you? < Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >

   Just what do gay people do that straight people don't? I'm a VERY straight(as an arrow), 17-year old male that is involved in the BSA. I don't care what gay people do among each other, as long as they don't make
passes at me or anything. At my summer camp where I work, my boss is gay. Not in a 'pansy' way of gay (I know a few), but just 'one of the guys'. He doesn't push anything on me, and we give him the same respect back, due
to his position. If anything, the BSA has taught me, I don't know, tolerance or something. Before I met this guy, I thought all gays were 'faries'. So, the BSA HAS
taught me to be an antibigot. Basically, It comes down to this: What you do among yourself is your own
business. No one else has the right to tell you otherwise, unless it
violates someone else's civil rights.

 Well I don't want my tax dollars going to that kind of philosophy. maybe if the good folks you are talking about are people like you 
 than I might be inclined to accept it. Why don't we have a bureau for militant, paranoid, freedom killers 
 like yourself. People like you are more dangerous than alcohol, 
 tobacco and firearms. >With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with

 to you, do you realize that there were  24 children KILLED!!! They will never get to fall in love, they won't see another sunrise, 
 no prom, no first date, no football, baseball no NOTHING. Why doesn't 
 some people think first before they let everyone know how narrow they 
 are.

One more time...

    If they released the algorithm, it would be possible for someone
    to come up with an implementation which was identical, but
    lacking an escrowed key. Note that the press announcement mentioned that the algorithm was
    being kept secret for security of the key escrow system. In this
    case security means "an escrowed key for EVERY clipper chip". Assuming you believed all that is said about the effective of
    the algorithm, and the escrow system, which would you buy :

     (a)  Chip from firm A with the escrowed key
     (b)  Second source chip from reputable firm B with no key
          in government escrow. There would obviously be powerful economic incentives for a second
    source, non escrowed, vendor.

   Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of

   this group, from code to hardware to algorithms. I just think making 5
   different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts
   a week per group. I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum
   for discussing all aspects of graphics. You could learn the same amount by reading all the

Salutations! I don't usually subscribe to these newsgroups so I would really
appreciate it if someone could possibly e-mail me the answer to my problem. I have been using Windows 3.1 since buying it last winter but I have just
now come across an annoying bug. I now have about 8 different groups in
program manager but it seems that everytime I install something new that
makes a new group, it promptly disappears after I turn of windows! This happened when I installed Excel and WinFax Pro v.3. They both created
their own groups but when I turned off windows and reran them, they were
gone. I had to manually pull them up as new items and put them in a
previously existing group as all new gropus disappear as soon as I turn
off windows. my set up:

insurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like
socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary
insurance and/or copayments. France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition
has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,
including a sample chart of copayment percentages. For 1-30 days,
you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward. With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and
be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate. The
public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount
for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or
according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of
French have some form of extra private insurance. So, 30% of health
costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other
taxes. The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures
for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure
for the U.S.

That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund
is to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back
in Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health
insurance -- which actually it is). The new Reform Party, a breakoff
of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian"
faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that
just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average
Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American
counterparts on issues like these). I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about
leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian
newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100%
insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know
it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American
conservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who
seriously call it that). Canadians aren't worried about the
Americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans
who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that
shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for
insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc. The reason that
the Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite
being open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to
spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a
different culture. >Like the play or pay model, managed competition leaves in place two

and Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says
of HMO/NHS approaches, "We left that behind with East Germany!"). Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling
doctors with budget strings. In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France
and Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public
hospitals. The divisions
are different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked
"sickness funds" over a century old while Canada divides by their
provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the
doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.) With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to
the U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The
French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations
in more compact geography to improve scales of economy. gld

Subject: * REPORT ON PRIVACY-PROTECTING OFF-LINE CASH AVAILABLE *
Organization: CWI, Amsterdam
Lines: 60

I recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash
system as a technical report at CWI. Being a PhD-student at David
Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research
in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems. Z, contains 77 pages, and can be
retrieved from

ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)

from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters. ====================================================================
ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash
system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which
little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the
first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms. Using the
representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are
introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and
payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier
systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in
both computation and communication complexity than any such system
proposed previously. Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be
mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we
make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the
ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the
Diffie-Hellman problem. Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in
previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these
is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be
incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has
the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the
first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender
after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the
most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,
which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have
negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by
a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that
previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system
can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while
retaining its computational efficiency. ====================================================================

Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system! I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as
possible. Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to
me and I will try to reply as good as I can. Stefan Brands,

Yes, but... shouldn't size of newsgroup be an issue? Sorry if this
has been covered before, but comp.grahpics.animation get how much 
traffic per day? I've been following this group for about four months now, and I don't
recall ever seeing such a flood of posts that a split would be warranted. Just my 2 cents,

   As I live in Sweden I remember the day perfectly well. We changed

it was in the night. ( in the 'big' cities like Stockholm & Gothenburg
all trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole
weekend.) The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before. Before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and
after it was the white one that matters. The signs with arrows on was
prepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to
reveal the new right mode arrow. About cars: Before the H-day (H as in "Hoegertrafik". " hoeger" is
Swedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had their
steering wheels on the left side. Even the imported cars from UK had
the wheel on 'the right side'. At last we have cars with the wheels on
the right side. :-) More contries that uses the left side is:

Japan
Tanzania (I think)
New Zeeland
How about South Africa? Some sais that the left side is the right side because Ivanhoe
and other knights meet at the left when they fight in tournaments. :-) ...deleted lines...

     I am so tired about all this debate on how many gays there

really matter if it were millions of people who are regularly
denied access to housing, employment, and personal security or
even only one? As for death threats, I happen to know from personal
experience that gay people are far more likely to receive
them based on political veiws or even personal philosophies
related to the issue of sexual orientation than are heterosex
uals. Not a week goes by that I personally or one of my friends
is not physically or verbally harrassed for even appearing to
be gay. Everyone is garaunteed certain unalienable rights under
our current form of government in theory, yet every day 
gay people are victimized by their local governments, by
the police force, and by (for the most part) an uninformed
and ignorant public. A society's sense of justice is judged on the basis of
the treatment of the people who make up that society. And yes, that includes gays, lesbians,

Ten Questions about arab countries

I would be thankful if any of you who live in arab countries could
help to provide accurate answers to the following specific questions. These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and
again by people around me. Is it true that many arab countries don't recognize
Israeli nationality ? That people with Israeli stamps on their
passports can't enter arabic countries? Is it true that arabic countries such as Jordan and Syria
have undefined borders and that arab governments from 1948 until today
have refused to state where the ultimate borders of their states
should be? Is it true that arab countires refused to sign the Chemical
weapon convention treaty in Paris in 1993? Is it true that in arab prisons there are a number of
individuals which were tried in secret and for which their
identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are
state secrets ? Is it true that some arab countries, like Syria, harbor Nazi
war criminals, and refuse to extradite them? Is it true that some arab countries, like Saudi Arabia,
prohibit women from driving cars? Is it true that Jews who reside in the Muslim
countries are subject to different laws than Muslims? Is it true that arab countries confiscated the property of
entire Jewish communites forced to flee by anti-Jewish riots? Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed
a chemical weapons treaty that no arab nation was willing to sign? Is it true that Syrian Jews are required to leave a $10,000
deposit before leaving the country, and are no longer allowed to
emmigrate, despite promises made by Hafez Assad to George Bush? Is it true that Jews in Muslim lands are required to pay a
special tax, for being Jews? Is it true that Intercontinental Hotel in Jerusalem was built
on a Jewish cemetary, with roads being paved over grave sites, and
gravestones being used in Jordanian latrines? Is it really cheesy and inappropriate to post lists of biased
leading questions? Is it less appropriate if information implied in Mr.
Davidsson's questions is highly misleading? Adam

I agree, there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief. The Qur'an makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience. Public
or private disavowal of Islam or conversion to another faith is not
punishable (there are some jurists who have gone against this

      AH! But what, exactly, is "inherently abhorrent" and WHY is it so? What you're saying is, in effect, "I think some things are repulsive,
and I know a whole bunch of other people who agree with me, so they
should be deemed absolutely immoral now and forever, period". Which in and of itself is nice enough; to some extent I agree with

the reason can even theoretically change, then so can the label. [...]

      No it doesn't. Humans are to some extent similar, because we all

Yes, I agree. What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith
(i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced
of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal
revelation. And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those
beliefs with others. And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to
accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself. Where I think the
conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs
arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God 
must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would 
honestly agree. I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone 
who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are 
rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient 
for them, or because they wish to spurn God. I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one 
holds are universal and absolute. And the problem I see with this is 
that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with
God. This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas
of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or 
revealed that truth. --

Alright GM!!!! Finally my wishes have come true, Moby Dick with a Corvette

about the lousy build/quality/design of their bigger selling cars? This is
another example of why GM is in so much trouble. If you're going to stick
the LT-1 or ZR-1 engine in a car, at least make it a nice looking one.

I am asking you to believe in things not visible. I don't know if this is
believeing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do
not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions
from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on
the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any
possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the
rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere
is not self explanatory). Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, 
which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence
is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The 
evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning
on the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason
of the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly
consistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the
evidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself
to us. It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come
through this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones
providing evidence of non-physical realities. ( There may, of course, be
physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for
all we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for
reason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired
in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,
belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind. >You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything. However, if

Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source 
of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings
have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and
similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by
faith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use
reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding
of the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be
the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity
claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the
best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man. If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while
and you will see rational debate aplenty. --

As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms. "multi-headed"
tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even
multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg,
a Sun with a cg4 display). "multi-screen" and "multi-display" would,
if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning
of "multi-display" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and
pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing
"multi-screen" would: a system that provides multiple Screens. "zaphod" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the
pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the
screen. > Is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle

What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular
implementation (probably the MIT one). If it claimed there was a limit
of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing

Never. I don't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such an 
index or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentioned 
and advised by Toynbee. If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude 
of the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians, by massacring an alien
population under their rule which constituted about 40% of their total
population and they did it only within a time period of a little over
two years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population. Now I would like to ask you:

  Is there any other genocide in the history of mankind similar to 
  this one? And again I would like to ask you:

  Whether the silent and unmourned martyrdom of these hundreds of thousands
  of Turks of the Republic of Armenia who were exterminated as a "Final
  Solution" to Turco-Tartar problems in Armenia is similar or not
  to the martyrdom of six million Jews in Europe as a final solution to
  Jewish problems? Serdar Argic

IBM 370/168	1973	208		420Kb

accounted for a mere 0.2% of all instructions executed. The uVAX 32
subsetted the architecture onto a single chip and used a software

only ranm 20% faster. CPU		Chips	Microcode	Transistors

ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far
as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within
a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the
center. (These measurements are statistical, and you can
always hide a sufficiently small number of a different
type of GRB with a different origin in the data. I am assuming
that there is only one population of GRBs). The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center
of the distribution. The only things the Earth is at the exact center
of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets
way beyond Pluto) and the Universe. Cosmological theories, placing
GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to
be released over a timescale of milliseconds. Oort cloud models
tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics. If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)
you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of
the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center
(for a spherical 'halo' population). We don't see this, so if they
are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in
radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda
Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.) For comparison, the
Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy. >my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering

I think the other replies sum up the fact that you can place a hard drive

more stable. Because I've been running a Maxtor 1/3 ht
120 LPS on both its side and flat for about a year and I've had no

When I first setup windows using the self load mode It grabbed about
20 megs of swap file space, my 120 meg HD was nearly empty at that time. I deleted windows for a time and recently reloaded, now my HD is nearly full
and windows just took 4 megs. I have read somewhere that the best rule of thumb is have your
permanent swap file the same size as your regular RAM size. I have 4 megs
of RAM and windows took 4 meg perm swap file. In fact with my available HD space, about 20 megs it won't let me make
the swap file any bigger. You should change your virtual mem swap file to 8 megs I think
that is what you said your RAM was. C-ya..... /\/\artin

We have recently purchased a Tektronix xterminal, and I'm having
a problem with it. We have a graphics widget that we wrote to
display waveforms, and it doesn't work on the xterminal. the buttons,
etc, all show up, and it seems to take the 'right' amount of time to
draw, but nothing is visible in the graphics window. I
have no clue as to where to start looking: the program works fine
on all our suns (3s and 4s, color and B&W). could anyone suggest a
line of attack for this problem? TekXpress XP380 color xterminal running 6.0.0. host is a Sun IPX
running SunOS 4.1.3 and X11R5, PL17. --

I found an oddity with our SGI Indigo (MIPS R3000 chip). When xlock +nolock is running, and I am working remotely
or in batch (at) mode, the runtime of my programs (as timed
by using clock() in the code itself) is ~25% slower than if
xlock is NOT running. No other processes seem to affect my

Distribution: usa

Secrecy in Clipper Chip

The serial number of the clipper chip is encrypted with the system key and
transmitted as one part of a three part message. Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential
analysis). Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip
and its communications channel. The purpose of this chip is twofold:
    
	1) Transmit Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with
	    a secondary keying variable. This renders the serial number
	    unrecoverable with just the system key

	2) Recieve Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number
	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number
	    is necessary for local operation). This has the net result of hiding the serial number. This gets more
interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large,
making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and
a spoofed serial number. Without knowing the system key, you could
lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie. IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could
successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the
format of your own serial number. Makes you wonder whats being hidden here? Seems  like the secrecy is
to prevent you from lying about who you are.

Frequently Asked Questions file, which I'll excerpt. WORLD SPACE FOUNDATION - has been designing and building a solar-sail
    spacecraft for longer than any similar group; many JPL employees lend
    their talents to this project. WSF also provides partial funding for the
    Palomar Sky Survey, an extremely successful search for near-Earth

WSF put together a little paperback anthology of fiction and
nonfiction about solar sails: *Project Solar Sail*. I think Robert
Staehle, David Brin,  or Arthur Clarke may be listed as editor. Also there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman,
a technical one by a guy whose name escapes me (help me out, Josh),
and I would expect that Greg Matloff and Eugene Mallove have something
to say about the subject in *The Starflight Handbook*, as well as
quite a few references. Check the following articles in *Journal of the British Interplanetary
Society*:

V36 p. 201-209 (1983)
V36 p. 483-489 (1983)
V37 p. 135-141 (1984)
V37 p. 491-494 (1984)
V38 p. 113-119 (1984)
V38 p. 133-136 (1984)

(Can you guess that Matloff visited Fermilab and gave me a bunch of
reprints? And K. Eric Drexler's paper "High Performance Solar Sails and Related
Reflecting Devices," AIAA paper 79-1418, probably in a book called
*Space Manufacturing*, maybe the proceedings of the Second (?) Submarines, flying boats, robots, talking         Bill Higgins

of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of
Mazinkert. After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter
of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto
the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle
should be quite obvious to any student of history. The sack of
Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along. For if the Greeks
had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the
Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd
Crusades? Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they
considered heretics, even though those "heretics" were fighting for the
cause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish
hordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some
hordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of

I just installed a DX2-66 CPU in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a CPU

to dislodge the CPU from its mount. It ended up bending a few pins
on the CPU, but luckily the power was not on yet. I ended up
pressing the CPU deeply into its socket and then putting the CPU
cooler back on. How do you ensure that the weight of
the CPU fan and heatsink do not eventually work the CPU out of its

Allan, I know the circumstances of several of your falls. On the ride when you fell while I was next behind you,
you made an error of judgement by riding too fast when
you knew the road was damp, and you reacted badly when
you were surprised by an oncoming car. That crash was
due to factors that were subject to your control. I won't deny that there's a combination of luck and skill
involved for each of us, but it seems that you're blaming
bad luck for more of your own pain than is warranted. --

Summary: Help with changing Startup logo


I know this is probably a FAQ, but...

I installed the s/w for my ATI graphics card, and it bashed my Windows
logo files. When I start Windows now, it has the 3.0 logo instead of
the 3.1 logo. I thought the files that controlled this were

\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\VGALOGO.RLE
\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\VGALOGO.LGO	

I restored these files, but it didn't change the logo. --

Peanut butter was definitely my favorite. I don't think I ever took a second bite
of the strawberry. I recently joined Nutri-System and their "Chewy Fudge Bar" is very reminicent of
the chocolate Space Food. This is the only thing I can find that even comes close
the taste. It takes you back... your taste-buds are happy and your
intestines are in knots... joy! --

 I was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car I saw
the other day. It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/
early 70s. In addition,
the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years
of production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you
have on this funky looking car, please e-mail. Thanks,

Hi,

I just inherited an NCR 1204 external floppy. This thing has every port known to man on the back. The question is: Does anyone know how to connect this thing to a PC.

item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care
of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the
Window is mapped. The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window
is visible and mapped. Do you know the best way to "tickle" a window so
that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item?
