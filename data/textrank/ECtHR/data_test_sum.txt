as to the scope of that duty, the city court held: “the obligation to make a statement is, however, limited to the contact with the defendant as a source and not her communication with possible other unknown sources with whom she has been in contact and who may be protected by the protection of sources.” 14.  the prosecutor then stated, according to the hearing protocol, “that he would not ask for postponement of the case as the prosecuting authority considers the case to be sufficiently disclosed (“tilstrekkelig opplyst”) even without the statement of the witness [the applicant]”.no motion for extension was made (pending a final decision) as according to the prosecutor the case was sufficiently disclosed (tilstrekkelig opplyst) even without the statement by [the applicant] and this was used as a basis by the court.” 17.  on 28 march 2011 mr x appealed to the borgarting high court (lagmannsrett) against the city court’s assessment of the evidence and application of the law in relation to the issue of guilt, its procedure and the sentence (see paragraphs 34-36 below).33.  the prosecutor had argued that mr x had used the applicant as a tool to commit serious crimes, and this would have constituted a relevant argument, had the case been one concerning a possible individual exception to the right to non-disclosure of sources made under the third paragraph of article 125. however, the prosecutor had not relied on that paragraph of the provision, and the source’s motive could not render the principle of source protection as such inapplicable.in determining whether a legitimate interest in a disclosure falling within the scope of article 10, paragraph 2 of the convention outweighs the public interest in not disclosing information identifying a source, competent authorities of member states shall pay particular regard to the importance of the right of non-disclosure and the pre-eminence given to it in the case-law of the european court of human rights, and may only order a disclosure if, subject to paragraph b, there exists an overriding requirement in the public interest and if circumstances are of a sufficiently vital and serious nature.the legitimate interest in the disclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in the non-disclosure, bearing in mind that: - an overriding requirement of the need for disclosure is proved, - the circumstances are of a sufficiently vital and serious nature, - the necessity of the disclosure is identified as responding to a pressing social need, and - member states enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing this need, but this margin goes hand in hand with the supervision by the european court of human rights.
6.  at the time of the events the applicant was the director general of a joint venture v. (“company v.”), which had its office in the premises belonging to a joint stock company y.the new management questioned the legality of the use of its premises by company v. more specifically, they challenged the lease contract of 12 january 1999 in respect of those premises, which had been signed by the applicant, on the one side, and n., the chairman of the board of directors of company y. at the time, on the other side.11.  on 8 october 2001 the odesa prymorskyy district prosecutor’s office (“the prymorskyy prosecutor’s office”) issued a warrant for seizure of fifteen documents relevant for the investigation, such as the original of the lease contract itself, related correspondence and several statements of acceptance of the services indicated in the contract (see paragraph 7 above).the applicant did not specify in the domestic proceedings, or in the present proceedings, how the seizure of the documents had taken place.although a forensic expert examination had established that the signatures on the impugned contract had been antedated (namely, it was established that they had been made no earlier than in february 2001), the official approval of the technical methods used by the expert was previewed only for the autumn of 2002.
7.  on 29 march 2013 the plzeň regional court (krajský soud) dismissed a complaint lodged by the applicant against the decision of the plzeň regional office.8.  on 31 july 2013 the supreme administrative court (nejvyšší správní soud) dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant.it held that as the supreme administrative court’s decision had been served on him on 28 august 2013, the last day of the two-month time-limit for lodging a constitutional appeal was 28 october 2013.12.  by a letter of 11 april 2014 the registrar (generální sekretář) of the constitutional court acknowledged that the judge-rapporteur had undoubtedly overlooked the fact that the time-limit had been complied with.however, as the constitutional court did not have the power to set aside its own decision, he advised the applicant to lodge an application with the european court of human rights.
accordingly, the applicant requested the appellate court to quash the first‑instance court’s judgment and to pronounce a new one, acquitting him for the lack of the constituent elements of a crime in his actions.10.  on 10 february 2005 the dniprovskyy court sent a letter to the kyiv city court of appeal (“the court of appeal”) stating as follows: “the [dniprovskyy court] is sending you the criminal case regarding [the applicant] convicted under article 366 § 1 of the criminal code of ukraine [forgery in office], for the appellate examination at 10.35 a.m. on 17 march 2005.” 11.  in addition to the president of the court of appeal, the above letter was also addressed to the prosecutor, the applicant and his lawyer.12.  on 17 march 2005, following a hearing held with the prosecutor’s participation, but in the absence of both the applicant and his lawyer, the appellate court rejected the applicant’s appeal.it delivered its ruling “having heard the report of the judge-rapporteur of the appellate court and the explanations of the prosecutor, the latter considering the judgment lawful and [the applicant’s] appeal groundless, having checked the case-file materials and having discussed the arguments advanced in the appeal”.the issue of the applicant’s and his lawyer’s absence from the hearing was not mentioned in the appellate court’s ruling.
6.  the applicant was driving his car along a road in the region of varna on the evening of 10 march 2014. as established subsequently by the prosecution and the domestic courts in criminal proceedings opened into the incident that took place that evening, his car was weaving in an unsteady manner and he was spotted by patrolling police officers parked on the side of the road.the report indicated that in a conversation with the applicant conducted during that visit, the latter had told the officer that he could not remember the events in detail, but that he was certain that after the car chase two police officers had beaten and then handcuffed him before taking him to the police station.16.  the two police officers involved in the car chase and the arrest also gave written statements on 11 march 2014. in addition to the description above (see paragraph 9), the officers stated that once the applicant had been handcuffed and put inside the police car, he had leaned on one of them and moaned.the brother and his friend stated that the applicant had not told them anything about the circumstances of his arrest and that the brother had learned that the applicant had been beaten by the police from the doctors at the hospital.in addition, when on 6 october 2014 the investigator had handed the investigation file over to the applicant, he had signed the related acknowledgement, indicating that he did not wish to acquaint himself with the evidence, read the documents in the file, which was voluminous, and that he had no requests, comments or objections to the investigation.
14.  the decision to impose the dangerous detainee regime on the applicant was subsequently upheld, inter alia, by decisions of the lublin remand centre penitentiary commission of 10 december 2009; of 4 march, 2 june, 2 september and 2 december 2010; of 2 march, 2 june, 1 september and 1 december 2011; and of 1 march, 30 may, 29 august and 28 november 2012. the reasoning of all these decisions was similar and read as follows: “the commission, having noted the proposals made by the head of the protection division (kierownik działu ochrony) and the head of the penitentiary division (kierownik działu penitencjarnego) and having heard the applicant held, in his presence, that the reasons justifying his classification as a dangerous detainee have not ceased to exist.it has been unanimously decided to extend the applicant’s classification for further three months because he still poses a danger to the security of the society and the prison.” 15.  the applicant appealed against most of the decisions issued in 2010 and 2011. the appeals were dismissed by the lublin regional court on 9 april and 15 october 2010, and on 28 february and 27 april 2011.on 9 july 2013 the lublin regional court upheld the commission’s decision holding that the extension of the dangerous detainee regime was justified by the applicant’s unpredictable behaviour, his interference with the peaceful functioning of the penitentiary unit, acts of self-mutilation and refusal to accept meals.it also referred to the request for an extension of the regime made by the director of the remand centre, who relied on the fact that in february 2013 the applicant had been punished for destroying some objects in the penitentiary unit and that his behavior was still unpredictable.in the decision of 13 august 2013 the commission relied on the request made by the director of the remand centre of 12 august 2013, according to which the applicant had been disciplinary punished on 4, 18 and 28 june 2013. in the decision of 13 november the commission made reference to the request of 12 november 2013 which was justified by the applicant’s “emotional instability” and “unpredictable behaviour”.
12.  in the following years the applicant was interviewed as a witness five more times: on 21 january and 14 december 1999, 13 february 2002, and 6 january and 11 november 2004. her rights and obligations as a witness – as well as the fact that she would render herself criminally liable if she refused to testify or gave false testimony – were explained to her (reference was made to article 53 of the criminal procedure code, see paragraph 24 below); no mention of any right to legal assistance was made.she agreed that she had annulled three cash transactions and made three cash withdrawals in the amount of lvl 1,228 (approximately eur 1,747), but stated that she had done so at the request of the chief accountant and the deputy head of the company with a view to paying out salaries.in setting the sentence the court took into account her state of health, the fact that she had partly compensated the company for the damage in question, and the fact that she had committed the crime nine years previously and that since then she had not committed any other crimes.in setting the sentence the court took into account the significantly lower number of episodes for which the applicant had been convicted, the fact that a particularly long period of time had elapsed since the commission of the crime, and the fact that there was no indication that she had committed any other crimes since then.the senate indicated that the former criminal procedure code (which had been in force in january 2005, when the charges had been brought against the applicant) had not excluded that a person could have the procedural status of a witness while a pre-trial investigation was in progress and could only be officially charged once there was sufficient evidence concerning that person’s guilt.
the applicant’s submissions as to the overall surface area in those cells as well as the size of the sanitary facilities were consistent with the government’s submissions (see paragraph 13 below).20.  over the course of two years (2012-14) the applicant lodged some twenty‑five handwritten complaints with various institutions (the management of brasa prison, the prisons administration, the ministry of justice and the ministry of the interior).21.  he informed the authorities that he had been deaf and mute since birth and complained as follows: 1)  he had communication problems and conflicts with other inmates (he referred to “conflicts”, having been “influenced”, “offended” and “laughed about” by other inmates); 2)  he wished to be transferred to a single or dual-occupancy cell; 3)  he wished to be transferred to another prison; 4)  he wished to have his prison regime changed; 5)  his conditions of detention were inadequate and 6)  his medical care was inadequate.taking into account that the applicant’s state of health had permitted his placement in any prison, there had been no grounds to transfer him to another prison; he had had to continue serving his sentence in brasa prison.24.  on 1 october 2012 a judge of a first-instance court refused to allow the applicant’s application to be transferred to another prison and to have his prison regime changed to a more restrictive one, a request made by the applicant in order to allow him to be held in a cell with a smaller number of inmates.
8.  on 2 july 1996 the i̇zmir administrative court dismissed a case brought before it for the annulment of the permit of 19 october 1994. on 13 may 1997 the supreme administrative court quashed the first-instance judgment and decided that the permit should be annulled.it referred to the state’s obligation to protect the right to life and to a healthy environment and assessed the physical, ecological, aesthetic, social and cultural effects of the mining activity in question as described in the environmental impact report and the various expert reports which had been submitted to it.it concluded that operations at the mine could be authorised, having regard to the additional measures taken by the company, the conclusions of a report by the turkish institute of scientific and technical research (“tübi̇tak”), the ministry of the environment’s favourable opinion and an opinion of the president’s administration, which had emphasised the economic importance of an investment of that type.notwithstanding the measures taken by the company, the court held that judicial decisions which had become final had found that the “risk and threat” in question resulted from the use of sodium cyanide in the gold mine and that it was impossible to conclude that those risks could be avoided by implementing new measures.in particular, it considered that the risks highlighted in the judgment of 13 may 1997 were, inter alia, linked to the use of sodium cyanide in the gold mine and to the climatic conditions and features of the region, which was situated in an earthquake zone.
8.  subsequently, the applicant brought a case before the menderes civil court of first instance and sought pecuniary damages from the treasury under article 1007 of the civil code which provided for the state’s responsibility for any damage resulting from the keeping of the land registry records.10.  on 7 february 2006 the fourth civil division of the court of cassation quashed the judgment of the menderes civil court of first instance on the ground that there was no illegal act or action on the part of the land registry officials that might have had a causal link with the applicant’s loss.11.  on 6 july 2006 the applicant submitted a further petition to the menderes civil court of first instance and indicated that there was a decision of the first civil division of the court of cassation which was in contradiction with the decision of the fourth civil division.12.  on 20 october 2006 the menderes civil court of first instance followed the decision of the fourth civil division of the court of cassation and dismissed the applicant’s claim.15.  in their decisions, neither the menderes civil court of first instance nor the fourth civil division of the court of cassation expressed any reason about why they had reached a different conclusion from the first civil division of the court of cassation.
6.  on 17 january 2009 the investigating judge at the istanbul assize court, after questioning the applicant, ordered his pre-trial detention.8.  the trial commenced before the istanbul assize court and the first preparatory hearing was held on 4 november 2009.9.  in the subsequent hearings held between 17 february 2010 and 3 november 2010, the applicant appeared before the court and the judges ordered his continued detention.10.  the applicant filed an objection against the decision of 3 november 2010. on 29 november 2010 the 12th chamber of the istanbul assize court dismissed this objection without holding an oral hearing, and based on the public prosecutor’s written opinion, which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative.12.  according to the latest information in the case-file, the proceedings against the applicant are still pending before the first-instance court.
8.  on 3 december 2004 the malatya public prosecutor filed an indictment with the malatya assize court, charging the applicant under article 125 of the former criminal code with seeking to destroy the constitutional order and unity of the turkish state and to remove part of the country from the state’s control.stated on page 52 of his police statement that the members of the [illegal] organisation [pkk] with the code names ‘zana’ and ‘fırat’, who had been acting under the leadership of a member with the code name ‘dilhas’, had infiltrated the security forces’ cordon in may 2003 around the ziyaret river at güleç village in malazgirt.stated on page forty-four of his statement that the attack on the public-order commando unit at the location known as göktepe in malazgirt province in may 2003, that resulted in two soldiers being killed, had been carried out by the members of the [illegal] organisation [pkk] with the code names ‘zana’ and ‘fırat’, who were acting under the leadership of ... ‘dilhas’.d.t., who was being tried for the offence of membership of an illegal armed organisation, stated on page 15 of his police statement that the decision to attack the military unit had been taken in october or november 2003 and that the mines had been placed and set off ... by suat daştan [the applicant], who had the code name ‘zafer’.d.t., who gave evidence as a witness before the kırklareli assize court, acting on letters of request, stated that his pre-trial statements had been correct and that he had knowledge concerning [the applicant]’s actions [under the code name “zafer”] in ovacık province and at the guard post and that he had received that information from ... ‘serhildan’.

it appeared that in the domestic criminal proceedings the proximity of the relationships between the victims and the deceased had not been fully ascertained, and, as noted in the musayev and others judgment, no single list existed of the victims and the people who had been granted victim status in the proceedings (ibid., §§ 74, 80, 162).12.  on the basis of the parties’ submissions and inferences drawn by the court, it was established that on 5 february 2000 eleven relatives of the applicants had been killed by state servicemen in the novye aldy settlement on the outskirts of grozny, during a special operation (a “sweeping” operation) carried out by, amongst others, servicemen from the police special task unit (отдел милиции особого назначения (омон)) from st petersburg (hereinafter the st petersburg omon).18.  the deaths of eleven people were found to be in breach of article 2 of the convention in the musayev and others judgment (cited above), and the family members of five of those people are applicants in the present complaint (see appendix).30.  in june 2010 the investigator in charge sought similar information from another military unit (the 15th motorised rifle regiment), including the names of the unit commanders who had taken part in the operation on 5 february 2000. in particular, the letter referred to the commander of company no.33.  in may 2011 the investigator in charge informed the military prosecutor of the southern military circuit that the special operation on 5 february 2000 in the south of grozny had been under the command of colonel ye.k., the head of the operative headquarters of the internal troops of the ministry of the interior.

according to the indictment, certain passages of the article depicted the pkk[1] as part of the kurdish intellectual movement and hence constituted propaganda of the organisation, known for employing violence and terror.the political nature of the 20th century, the existence and rise of national liberation movements, the emergence of modern currents in kurdish politics and, most importantly, the creation of a mass movement, served as the basis for the birth of the kurdish intellectual.from this point of view, through political and thoughtful analysis, while being free from the system and alienation, and bearing within it its own cultural identity based on the impoverished kurdish rustics, [the pkk] allowed the beginning of a permanent and stable political enlightenment process.yet, the progress of the movement was accompanied by the downfall of the level of quality.” 9.  the court considered that the aforementioned passages and the article in its entirety constituted propaganda in favour of the pkk.taking into account his good behaviour during the trial and his character, the court suspended the pronouncement of his conviction on condition that he did not commit another intentional offence for a period of five years, under article 231 of the code of criminal procedure (hükmün açıklanmasının geri bırakılması).
6.  on 6 september 2003 the applicant lodged an application with the commission for restitution (komisija za restituciju nepokretnosti) in berane requesting restitution of the property expropriated from his father in 1969.7.  following the adoption of a new restitution act (zakon o povraćaju oduzetih imovinskih prava i obeštećenju), on 28 december 2005, the applicant submitted another application to the newly established commission for restitution and compensation in berane (komisija za povraćaj oduzetih imovinskih prava i obeštećenja) requesting compensation.due to the location of the expropriated property, the applicant’s request was assigned to the commission with its seat in bijelo polje (hereinafter “the commission”).12.  on 23 october 2009 and 5 december 2013 the applicant filed complaints with the ministry of finance and the administrative court, respectively, about the appeals commission’s inactivity.13.  on 24 december 2013 the appeals commission ordered the commission to decide on the applicant’s request within a period of 30 days.

9.  on 2 february 2001, the main shareholder of demirbank, namely cıngıllı holding a.ş., brought administrative proceedings against the banking regulation and supervision agency (bankalar düzenleme ve denetleme kurumu – hereinafter “the agency”) before the ankara administrative court, seeking a ruling setting aside the decision of 6 december 2000 to transfer demirbank to the fund.however, the administrative courts dismissed the applicants’ cases as out of time on the ground that they should have initiated proceedings at the latest within sixty days following 31 january 2001, the date on which demirbank’s equities had been transferred to the fund’s account at the stock exchange.13.  following the annulment of the decision concerning the transfer of demirbank to the fund by the domestic courts in 2005, the applicants applied to the administrative courts.the supreme administrative court held that the judgment regarding the annulment of the board’s decision of 6 december 2000 could be secured by the return of the supervisory and executive rights to demirbank’s shareholders, and did not require the restitution of the actual shares.the istanbul administrative court dismissed the applicants’ compensation claims for being out of time on the ground that they should have brought their claims within sixty-day statutory time-limit after demirbank’s equities had been transferred to the fund’s account at the stock exchange on 31 january 2001. the decisions of the administrative courts were upheld, and the applicants’ requests for rectification of the decision were rejected.
in the first applicant’s case, the court of appeal found as follows: “having examined the arguments of the defence that the alternative labour service in armenia does not comply with european standards, is of a military nature and is supervised by the military, the court of appeal finds that [the state] ... is taking appropriate measures in respect of the obligations assumed before the council of europe as regards, in particular, the enactment and continuous improvement of the legislation concerning alternative service.[citation of sections 17 and 18(3) of the act (see paragraph 28 below)] based on an analysis of the above-mentioned provisions, the court of appeal finds it necessary to point out that the fact that the head of the institution [where alternative service is performed] notifies [the local military commissariat] regarding the alternative labour service to be performed by the serviceman, the fact that the serviceman can be transferred to another institution or place and the fact that alternative labour servicemen are discharged from service to the reserve and are registered in the reserve in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law, are not sufficient to conclude that the alternative labour service in armenia is of a military nature, since ... the type, procedures and conditions of such labour are determined by the heads of the relevant institutions without any interference by the military authorities or their representatives.... in the light of the above, the court of appeal, based on the concrete facts of the case, namely that [the first applicant] has categorically refused to be conscripted to perform alternative labour service, concludes that he has been found criminally liable and sentenced in a justified and fair manner for such actions, and this fact does not contradict ... the case-law of the european court regarding article 9 of the convention.” in the second applicant’s case, the court of appeal found that his conviction had been lawful, well-founded and reasoned.the court shall discontinue any criminal proceedings and exempt the person concerned from serving the remainder of the sentence, provided that he applies for alternative service before 1 august 2013 and the authorised body decides to grant the application in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the alternative service act.” 33.  pursuant to paragraph 2(b), alternative labour servicemen were to perform their service in various institutions under the authority of the ministry of health and the ministry of labour and social affairs, such as orphanages, retirement homes, mental health institutions, institutions for disabled persons and hospitals.37.  for the purpose of supervising the work discipline of persons conscripted to perform alternative labour service, the military commissar of armenia and the head of the military police division of the ministry of defence were ordered: (a) to carry out weekly joint spot checks to verify the presence of persons performing alternative labour service at the institutions located within the territory of the regional military commissariats and their sub-divisions; (b) to report the results of such checks to the head of the general staff at the end of each month; and (c) to report immediately to the head of the general staff in the event that any alternative labour servicemen were absent and to take necessary measures to find them.

one of the experts clarified that, in assessing the possible risk of the applicant committing criminal offences, she had relied on the initial diagnosis and his lifestyle (his multiple convictions and the fact that he was young and single with no children).with reference to the discrepancies between the two expert opinions, the court held that the pruszków opinion concerned the applicant’s capacity tempore criminis, while the lubliniec opinion related to his general progress in treatment and his future prognosis.38.  the katowice court of appeal examined the applicant’s appeal at two hearings: on 21 january and 11 march 2014. on the latter date, relying on the evidence gathered by the regional court, it upheld the decision of 8 november 2013 (see paragraph 36 above).42.  on 15 may 2014 the katowice regional court appointed a new defence lawyer for the applicant, to replace the one who had resigned, and set a hearing date for 28 may 2014. on the latter date it heard evidence from the experts from the toszek hospital.47.  during a hearing on 14 january 2015 the court heard evidence from the cracow hospital experts who had prepared the opinion of 27 august 2013. as indicated in paragraph 33 above, they confirmed that the applicant had not been suffering from a mental illness, but had a personality disorder.

the domestic court considered that the applicant company, which had based the impugned passage of the book on, inter alia, an internal report of the federal office of criminal investigations (bundeskriminalamt), had not complied with its duty to carry out thorough research and had seriously interfered with the personality rights of the person referred to.in addition, the court held, the publication had not made it clear that the pizza restaurant “da bruno”, in which the murders had been perpetrated, was not identical to the pizza restaurant of the same name in which the plaintiff had worked as a pizza baker many years prior to those deeds.rather, the court continued, the interplay of the many individual statements in the book created the impression that there was a very strong suspicion that the plaintiff was a member of the ‘ndrangheta.it expressly conceded to the applicant company that there was great public interest in obtaining information about criminal organisations and “that the motivation of the author and of the defendant [in the instant case: applicant company] for informing the public on the activities pursued by the ‘ndrangheta in germany was commendable and honest”.it had been grossly negligent on the part of the applicant company to disseminate an allegation based on a suspicion which seriously interfered with the plaintiff’s personality right in spite of the fact that the plaintiff had obviously not been given an opportunity to be heard and that the allegation had been disseminated without including the necessary information that the murder investigation addressed by the book subsequently had been discontinued.
15.  the domestic courts examined witnesses and a court-appointed psychologist who said that the applicant had been traumatised by the experience and suffered from anxiety, that his personality had been “permanently altered”, that he had difficulties communicating with others, and that his family ties had been “irreparably damaged”.16.  in a judgment of 2 may 2006 the sofia city court (hereinafter “the city court”) allowed the claim in part, finding that the applicant had been detained for nine months and twenty-nine days in excess of his sentence and awarding him bgn 10,000 for non-pecuniary damage.17.  in accordance with the applicable provisions of domestic law, the city court ordered the applicant to pay bgn 2,040 (the equivalent of 1,040 euros – eur) in court fees, calculated as a pro rata percentage of the part of his claim that had been dismissed.18.  the judgment was upheld on 18 june 2007 by the sofia court of appeal (hereinafter “the court of appeal”), which specified that the prosecution authorities were also liable to pay default interest on the above amount, calculated from 18 september 2003.it justified the reduction by referring to the “nature of the offences” the applicant had been convicted for, the “regime under which the sentence had been served” and the “socially acceptable criteria for justice”.
12.  on the same day the nasimi district court, relying on the charges brought against the applicant and an application from the prosecutor to apply the preventive measure of remanding the applicant in custody, ordered his detention pending trial for a period of two months.the court justified the application of the preventive custodial measure by the gravity of the offences imputed to him, the risk of his reoffending and the likelihood that he might abscond if released.13.  on 12 january 2011 the applicant appealed against that decision, stating that there was no justification for the application of the preventive measure of remand in custody and that the court had failed to substantiate the necessity for his detention pending trial.15.  on 2 march 2011 the prosecutor in charge of the criminal case applied to the court for an extension of the applicant’s pre-trial detention for a period of one month.16.  on 3 march 2011 the nasimi district court extended the applicant’s detention pending trial by one month, until 8 april 2011. the court justified its decision by the need for more time to carry out further investigative actions, the complexity of the criminal case and the likelihood that the applicant might abscond and obstruct the investigation if released.
with regard to the differences in surface areas the judgment stated: “the court, in deciding, assessed the arguments of the [solicitor general] put forward in the claim, but it did not accept them as bases to decide differently, because none of the conditions under [section] 267 of the administrative procedure act for declaring the order null and void had been fulfilled.” 23.  on 14 january 2009 the restitution commission, acting on its own motion (по службена должност) and relying on section 267(1)(3) of the administrative procedure act, found that the restitution order was unenforceable and declared it null and void in full (“the nullity decision”).in the present case there is no such situation and therefore it cannot be considered that section 2 of the restitution act has been breached ... this is so because the evidence admitted in the course of the proceedings provides a certain basis for the court to conclude that in the present case the restitution order ... was adopted in accordance with the restitution act, which had been preceded by a correct and full establishment of the facts, thereby leading to the conclusion that in that case all statutory conditions had been fulfilled for [the return of] the property concerned.however, that does not mean that those persons will be deprived of the right to protect their rights and interests ... a possibility remains for them to establish their rights by lodging a civil claim before a competent court within five years of the finalisation of the restitution order (section 63, paragraph 2 of the act), against the persons to whom possession was restored or compensation was paid in accordance with the provisions of the act.” 30.  on 3 and 4 august 2010 the solicitor general and the third persons respectively appealed against that judgment before the supreme court, which had in the meantime become competent to act upon appeals against judgments of the administrative court.... [t]he conclusion is correct that in the present case, with the restitution order, the property registered as property of the state was restored contrary to the conditions specified in the restitution act, sections 1 and 2. since the state organs established that part of the concerned property was not in possession of the legal predecessor [of the applicants], there is a legal obstacle for the exercise of a restitution right over that part of the property.hence, such an order cannot be enforced, which is grounds for the application of paragraph 1 subparagraph 3 of section 267 of the administrative procedure act, meaning that the decision is null and void (ништовно) ... ... in respect of the third persons, or the interested persons, the restitution act excludes the possibility for them to appear as parties to the restitution proceedings, but what remains for them is the possibility to claim their rights in a civil suit before a competent court within five years after the finalisation of the restitution order (section 63 paragraph 2 of the act), against the persons to whom possession was restored or compensation was paid in accordance with the provisions of this act.” 32.  this decision was served on the applicants on 24 december 2010 and 25 january 2011 respectively.
federal prosecutors, who opened their case in the wake of a number of private lawsuits challenging the legitimacy of the license award, have been examining documents for nearly a year, and the exact status of the investigation is not clear.” 10.  on 28 may 2001, before publication of the article, the journalist had notified the applicant, via an email to one of his employees, of the planned publication and had asked several questions.the düsseldorf court of appeal confirmed that decision by its judgment dated 30 december 2008. on 2 march 2010 the federal court of justice quashed the part of the decision regarding the applicant’s claim for an injunction against the challenged statements in the online version of the article and referred that part of the action back to the court of appeal.the court of appeal held that german law was applicable with regard to the online publication, as the article was accessible in germany via the internet and therefore the alleged violation of the applicant’s reputation had at least occurred in germany.on the other hand, continued the court, the interference with the rights of personality associated with such reporting required higher standards of care for newspaper reporting, because even if the investigation was later discontinued, “something of the accusation might stick to the person affected”.16.  as regards the statements at issue, the court of appeal held that there was a great informational interest on the part of the public in the reporting that the applicant, as a german businessman internationally active in the media sector, was suspected by the secret service of being involved in gold smuggling, embezzlement and organised crime.
the krasnogvardeyskiy district court, however, granted the applicant’s father’s appeal against that decision, finding that the decision, the administrative-offence record and other material lacked any evidence of the applicant’s father’s failure to properly raise the applicant, and that, on the contrary, all his children had been well cared for, had studied hard at school, and the family was well thought of.14.  in an additional opinion of 2 december 2003 the forensic medical expert stated that the fracture of the branches of the hyoid bone, the oedema and the abrasions on the neck could have been caused on 4 november 2003 by pressure from fingers, and had resulted in harm to the applicant’s health lasting up to twenty-one days, that is, minor harm to his health.17.  in a decision of 27 february 2004, setting aside the refusal of 7 february 2004, a senior prosecutor from the adygeya republic prosecutor’s office held that, in the course of an additional inquiry, the investigator should establish exactly what each of the police officers had done when restraining the applicant and placing him in their car, in particular if the injury had been inflicted by seizing the applicant by his neck.that he had seen the police stopping the motorcycle at the petrol station, that he had been invited to act as an attesting witness and sign a record of the motorcycle’s seizure which the police had drawn up on the spot, and that the applicant’s brother had refused to sign the record and receive a copy of it.on 31 january 2006 the adygeya republic supreme court quashed the decision, noting that the district court should not have examined the application, as the applicant’s mother had lacked authority to act on the applicant’s behalf, and should not have examined the lawfulness of the police officers’ actions in its review under article 125 of the ccrp (which concerned the lawfulness of investigators’ decisions).
6.  the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.8.  on 9 december 2009 the applicant was placed in detention on remand by the judge at the istanbul assize court on suspicion of committing crimes on behalf of an illegal terrorist organisation, disseminating propaganda for the same organisation, storage of hazardous materials, and damage to public property.at the end of the hearing the court ordered the continuation of his detention in the presence of the applicant.in delivering its decision, the court took into consideration the written opinion of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative.13.  at the time when the application was lodged, the proceedings against the applicant were still pending before the first-instance court.
5.  the applicant is a teacher in primary school and at the material time she was a member and secretary of the local branch of the trade union of education and science workers (eğitim ve bilim emekçileri sendikası).6.  on 28 november 2008 the applicant participated in a demonstration organised by the above mentioned trade union on the theme “no to violence against women”.7.  on 29 june 2009 the district directorate of national education imposed a disciplinary sanction in the form of a reprimand on the applicant for her participation in the aforementioned demonstration under article 125 of the law no.8.  on 10 july 2009 the applicant objected to this decision and requested its annulment.9.  on 29 july 2009 the disciplinary board of the yenişehir district governor dismissed the applicant’s objection considering that the contested decision was in accordance with law and there were no grounds for its annulment.
9584/02 and 7 others, §§ 134-40, 29 april 2014), that the mechanism established by the new law offered a range of effective remedies that needed to be exhausted by those claimants whose complaints referred to one of the following situations: the existence of concurrent titles to property with respect to the same plot of agricultural land; the annulment of such title to property without any compensation; the delivery of a final judgment confirming the right to compensation in respect of the unlawful seizure by the state of any type of immovable property, without fixing the amount; the failure to pay such compensation awarded in a final judgment; and the prolonged failure to give a decision on a restitution claim.the court held that the immovable property had been nationalised unlawfully, since the applicant’s predecessors had not belonged to any of the social categories covered by the nationalisation decree and thus their right of property had been valid and continuous, being transferred as heritage to the applicant; the state could not therefore claim a valid title to the property.22.  the final judgment of 7 february 2002 given by the bucharest court of appeal dismissed the claim in respect of the first-floor flat, holding that the applicant did not have legal standing to ask for the rescission of the sale contract, in so far as she had not been a party thereto.23.  in its final judgment of 14 october 2003, the bucharest court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s claim in respect of the ground-floor flat, holding that the buyer had acted in good faith and had thus acquired a valid title to the property, in accordance with the provisions of law no.30. they claimed that the confiscation of the property had been unlawful, as on the one hand it had been in breach of the constitution in force at the time, and on the other hand, they had not been notified of the administrative decision to confiscate it.
the dgaspc recommended that the applicants take the following measures: “ –  provide [their children] with an appropriate level of physical cleanliness and clean clothes, [and guarantee the cleanliness] of the house and a proper diet; –  sign up all the children with a family doctor, have them vaccinated and follow any recommended treatment; –  enrol the children aged from three to seven years in a nursery school; –  allow the children to create relationships with [the other children/] ([through] walks, games); –  refrain from subjecting the children to physical and/or verbal violence and from giving them emotionally traumatising messages (do not create [feelings of] fear, isolation, [do not create in them a] lack of confidence).” 14.  in the same letter, the dgaspc informed the applicants: “the manner in which you fulfil these obligations will be monitored by ... the dgaspc.it added that the children’s return to their family in the near future was not to be ruled out; in its view, however, given the need to improve certain conditions so as to ensure their safety, the applicants’ fluctuating attitude in their communication with the authorities and the applicants’ difficulties in grasping and responding to the children’s needs, the placement measure ought to be maintained for the time being.it held: “the conditions for the children’s reintegration [into the family] have not been met, given that the other criteria laid down by the dgaspc to ensure the children’s safety are not fulfilled: [namely,] the parents’ involvement and cooperation...; the repair of the roof; registration of the [second] applicant’s home in mănăstirea in order to be able to receive welfare payments; maintenance of links with the children by increasing the regularity of visits; acceptance of their parental responsibilities (registering the children with a doctor, enrolling them in primary and nursery school); the fact of finding employment; improved relations with the other members of the community; undergoing the psychological tests proposed by the dgaspc’s specialists to ascertain their level of parental skills, so as to be able to include them, if appropriate, in a parental support programme and thus develop and consolidate their parental skills; the prevention of major risks to the underage children by accepting monitoring by the mănăstirea spas.in addition, no evidence has been submitted proving that the applicants have received additional income through day-work carried out in the municipality by the second applicant ....” 54.  the appeal court concluded that, in any event, the improvements in the applicants’ living conditions noted in the social inquiry report which had been added to the case file (see paragraph 42 above) was not the only condition that the applicants had to fulfil before being able to request their children’s return.272/2004 sought to protect the best interests of the child and that the public authorities were required to help ensure that children developed and were raised within their families, and explained: “... although the provision of a certain level of material comfort is an essential element for minors’ development, [it is nevertheless the case that] an inadequate income does not in itself represent an insurmountable obstacle to the children’s return to their family, provided that the parents show a genuine interest in raising the children themselves...”.
4.  the applicant was born in 1958 and lives in antalya.at the material time he was a member of the local branch of the trade union of education and science workers (eğitim ve bilim emekçileri sendikası).6.  in may 2009, disciplinary proceedings were instituted against the applicant for putting up a notice encouraging the participation in a press statement published by his union on the notice board that was set aside for that particular purpose in their office, and for distributing it in one of the common areas at school.7.  on 30 september 2009 the district directorate of national education imposed a disciplinary sanction in the form of a reprimand on him, for putting up and distributing notices produced by the trade union, of which he was a member, under article 125 of the law no.9.  on 15 october 2009 the disciplinary board of the kepez district governor dismissed the applicant’s objection considering that the contested decision was in accordance with law and there were no grounds for its annulment.
as to the events leading to the death, the police report summarised the statements given by the intervention team and stated that mr štefančič had resisted the police officers who had tried to take him to the psychiatric hospital, whereupon physical force had been used on him.31.  these included contusions on the outer edge of the shoulder blade, the left of the back and the back of the right thigh, swelling on the right of the hairline and the squamous part of the temporal bone, contusions on the inside of the upper right arm and left forearm and on the front of the left thigh.in the present case it was not possible, once the deceased lost consciousness, to apply those methods and to suck the gastric contents from the respiratory passages and alveoli; considering the quantity and force of the aspiration of gastric contents, medical assistance probably would not have saved the life of [mr štefančič].” 36.  on 18 september 2008 the investigating judge of the nova gorica district court sent the statements of the persons involved in the incident, a record of the examination of the scene, the order for a forensic examination of mr štefančič’s body and the forensic report to the state prosecutor’s office.39.  after having reviewed the nova gorica state prosecutor’s office’s case file, on 2 june 2009 a state prosecutor from the group of state prosecutors for special matters (skupina državnih tožilcev za posebne zadeve – hereinafter “the special matters group”), which had exclusive jurisdiction over the prosecution of criminal offences committed by police officers, rejected both criminal complaints on the basis of the police and forensic reports and the media reports from the press conference on mr štefančič’s death.moreover, as regards the anonymous criminal complaint, the state prosecutor established that, according to the reports in the media, the head of the nova gorica uniformed police unit had stated neither that mr štefančič had died as a result of being administered sedatives, nor that the medical team had immediately begun resuscitation after his condition had deteriorated.
5.  the applicants were civil servants for tax offices attached to the ministry of finance in mersin and diyarbakır.at the material time they were members of the local branch of the trade union büro emekçileri, which is affiliated to trades union confederation of public employees (kamu emekçileri sendikaları konfederasyonu-“kesk”).6.  in march and april 2009, the applicants were informed of the disciplinary investigations that were initiated against them for having participated in a statement to the press organised by the trade union of which they were members and were invited to send their defence submissions.7.   subsequently, the disciplinary sanctions of warning and reprimand were imposed on the applicants for their participation in the aforementioned trade union activities under section 125 of the law no.9.  in may 2009 the disciplinary board of the tax offices dismissed the applicants’ objections considering that the contested decisions were in accordance with law and there were no grounds for annulment.
20.  on 4 july 2005, the expert submitted a supplement to his report, in which he corrected his findings concerning the rest periods in the light of the applicants’ objection and calculated the hours they had worked as twenty-four in the course of a twenty-four-hour shift.27.  the defendant employer appealed, arguing that the presumption established in the case-law of the court of cassation that a person could not work more than fourteen hours in the course of a twenty-four-hour shift should be applied to the facts of the dispute.the court of cassation then quashed the first-instance judgment on 28 october 2008 and remitted the case on the following grounds: “it can be seen from the case file that during the summer months [the applicants] worked for 24 hours and subsequently rested for 24 hours; and in the winter months they worked for 24 hours and subsequently rested for 48 hours.however, as determined by the well-established case-law of the grand chamber of the court of cassation’s civil division, in workplaces where there are 24-hour shifts, after the deduction of time spent on certain activities such as resting, eating and fulfilling other needs, a person can only work for 14 hours a day ... this approach must also be followed in the present case.” 28.  in the resumed proceedings, the i̇zmir labour court decided to follow the decision of the court of cassation and another expert report was drawn up for that purpose.29.  on 25 january 2010 the applicants appealed against the decision and maintained that the fact that they had worked continuously for twenty-four hours had already been confirmed by the legal records of the ministry of labour, both parties’ witness statements and other evidence in the file, including the expert reports overturned by the court of cassation.
18.  the government submitted that the applicant had been kept in a permanently locked up cell in bobov dol prison, in strict compliance with the relevant legal provisions and in particular section 71(2) of the execution of punishments and pre-trial detention act.20.  the applicant was sentenced for a number of offences and was given a total sentence of whole-life imprisonment in 2000. he complained that his sentence had amounted, from the time of its imposition, to inhuman and degrading punishment, in breach of article 3 of the convention and that he did not have an effective remedy in this connection.this was upheld on appeal by the sofia appellate court in a final decision of 9 february 2011. the applicant has been serving his sentence under the “special regime” since 18 february 2011. he is kept in a permanently locked cell in vratsa prison, in the high-security wing, in accordance with applicable rules for life prisoners under the execution of punishments and pre-trial detention act.the government pointed out that the applicant left his cell for an hour in the morning and for an hour in the afternoon every day for exercise and to spend time in the open air.the government further clarified that the applicant’s regime had been changed to “strict” in 2015 but he had continued to be in the high-security wing; according to the government, he had repeatedly stated that he had not wished to be placed together with other prisoners.
the applicants put forward several examples: the different statutory time-limit for divorce versus the time-limit for dissolution of a registered partnership in the event of an irretrievable breakdown (unheilbare zerrüttung) of the relationship; the alimony payment obligations following a divorce/dissolution where blame could be placed on one spouse/partner; the obligations conferred by the respective legal institutions, in particular as regards trust, faithfulness and contributions to the household; and the consequences of a declaration of the death of a spouse/partner.as the [convention] has to be read as a whole and its articles have to be construed in harmony with one another, and as article 12 of the [convention] does not grant different-sex couples, in addition to the right to marry, a right to enter into a registered partnership, the prohibition of discrimination pursuant to article 14 taken in conjunction with article 8 of the [convention], a provision of more general purpose and scope, cannot be interpreted as imposing such an obligation beyond the scope of article 12 of the [convention] either (see, concerning the correlating question of the right of same-sex couples to marry, which cannot be derived from article 14 of the [convention] either, echr, case of schalk and kopf, § 101).... [a]s the austrian legislator has provided for the possibility of legal recognition for same-sex couples by introducing the registered partnership, people may rely on the prohibition of discrimination provided for by article 14 of the [convention] ... the court has also stated, however, in the case of schalk and kopf, that the legislator may restrict access to marriage to different-sex couples because it has a certain margin of appreciation as regards the exact status conferred by alternative means of recognition.given that persons of different sex have access to marriage (see the [explanatory report on the draft law]); the registered partnership was introduced only to counter discrimination against same-sex couples; [the registered partnership] should, in substance, have the same effects as marriage; different-sex couples are not a group (historically) discriminated against; and there is no european consensus on this matter, it does not amount to a violation of article 14 taken in conjunction with article 8 of the [convention] if the austrian legislator does not grant different-sex couples access to the registered partnership.... the constitutional court is not called upon to examine whether the particular differences between these legal institutions, as regards the legal consequences and dissolution options, comply with the principle of equality [gleichheitssatz] and the prohibition of discrimination pursuant to article 14 taken in conjunction with article 8 of the [convention], since the only question to be examined is whether different-sex couples have a constitutional right to access to the registered partnership.” 11.  on 27 february 2013 the administrative court dismissed the applicants’ complaint (see paragraph 9 above) as unfounded.
21.  a criminal investigation into the impugned treatment was launched in 2005. it was initiated when it emerged, in the context of covert surveillance in an operation to investigate drug smuggling in the asti correctional facility, that a number of the prison officers had discussed the ill-treatment inflicted on the applicants.25.  as to the establishment of the facts concerning the ill-treatment, the court found that the evidence gathered during the investigation and produced at the trial showed that the events had occurred in the manner described by the victims in their submissions during the trial.when conducting its assessment, the court relied on the conclusion that the primary purpose of the impugned treatment was to punish the applicants, to “maintain order” in the correctional facility, and to convey a clear message to the other detainees.the prosecutor contended that the most appropriate offence for the purposes of classification of the conduct in question would have been aggravated ill‑treatment under article 572 of the italian criminal code ‒ as initially identified in the bill of indictment ‒ in conjunction with article 608 of the criminal code.45.  according to a document issued by the staff director of the prison administration department of the ministry of justice on 12 october 2015, and furnished by the government, the four prison officers were not suspended from duty (sospensione precauzionale dal servizio) during the course of the investigation or the trial.
the charges against the applicant were as follows: “first charge misconduct (articles 153 § 7 (4) and 157 § 3 of the constitution) particulars while you exercised the duties of president of the industrial disputes court you repeatedly displayed oppressive, disparaging, scornful and, more generally, insulting behaviour towards the lay members of the court, both inside and outside the courtroom and, at the same time, in the course of proceedings you sometimes ignored them, sometimes did not allow them to put questions and sometimes did not allow them to ask for clarification on the matters at issue.following a request by the applicant’s lawyer, the scj also held on the same day that in view of the defence’s line of argument all the files of the proceedings in which the witnesses had sat as members of the idc, from the applicant’s appointment as president of the idc onwards, should be brought before it.it is unfounded for the reasons which we explained above, and unjustifiable because it conflicts with what the lawyer said to us at the beginning of the proceedings, when he ... spoke in praise of the powers invested by the constitution in the supreme council of judicature, describing its work as difficult and important [in those instances] when it is called upon to decide whether a judge displayed misconduct and is obliged, again in accordance with the constitution, to terminate the latter’s services in the event of conviction.the competence of the supreme council of judicature is only to decide whether the charges of improper behaviour (misconduct) are proved, which [behaviour] in the case we are examining and according to the particulars of the charges, is continuous (κατά συρροή, διαρκής) and directly refers to the function of mr kamenos as the president of the industrial disputes court.of course, the charge sheet does not extend to those cases and does not concern the issue of interventions as such ... the core of the charge is the conduct attributed to mr kamenos at the expense of lay members of the court, lawyers, litigants and witnesses, and it is in the light of such considerations that i shall go on to examine the evidence adduced.” 33.  the applicant continued to receive all the benefits that came with his post during the proceedings.
14.  on 29 may 2009 the supreme court upheld the vilnius regional court’s decision of 4 january 2007. the court found that the applicant had purchased the plot of land of 0.2 hectares in 1993. the lawfulness of the purchase agreement had been proven by the domestic courts (see paragraph 17 below).15.  in october 2007 the prosecutor’s office started court proceedings and asked the domestic courts to annul the decisions of the national authorities and the purchase agreement that had entitled the applicant to 0.05 hectares of land, to apply restitution, to return the plot of land of 0.05 hectares to the state and to pay the applicant 15 lithuanian litai (ltl, approximately 4.34 euros (eur)) in compensation.the applicant was ordered to return the plot to the state, with the state having to repay him the ltl 15. the parts of the order allocating the additional plot of 0.05 hectares to the applicant and the relevant part of the purchase agreement were annulled.the court held that the additional plot of 0.05 hectares had been allocated to the applicant in breach of the requirements of domestic law and that by holding that the rights of the applicant’s neighbours had not been breached and that the applicant had been a bona fide party to the purchase agreement, the vilnius regional court had made a clear mistake in the application of the law.the supreme court dismissed the first one as not raising important legal issues but merely disputing the facts established by the lower courts on 22 february 2013. the second appeal on points of law was dismissed on 26 april 2013. the supreme court accepted that if a person’s appeal was dismissed as not raising important legal issues, he or she could, within the time-limit prescribed by law, submit another appeal on points of law having corrected the deficiencies.
9.  on 9 and 14 february 2005 the division for the investigation of organised crime and terrorism from the bacău prosecutor’s office (“the prosecutor”) issued orders authorising the seizure of the suspicious envelopes under the urgent procedure provided for by article 98 § 12 of the code of criminal procedure (hereinafter “the urgent procedure” and “the ccp” – see paragraph 26 below).17.  the applicant contested the lawfulness of the interception of his correspondence before the bacău county court and argued that the prosecutor had not obtained authorisation from the court to seize it, as required by the relevant provision of the ccp.it therefore sent the case back to the county court and recommended that the court check whether the prosecutor’s orders had been sent as information to the court and to examine the accusation in the light of all the evidence in the file.it also relied on transcripts of the audio and video-surveillance in the post office and of the applicant’s telephone; statements by seven pharmacists that they had sold the medicine in question to the applicant without prescription; and testimony by two doctors who had been asked by the applicant or pharmacists to write prescriptions to cover up for the medicine sold without prescription.the court further relied on the results of checks on the addresses abroad used by the applicant; interpol information about the recipients of the envelopes; and police reports about checks on the two pharmacies used by the applicant, notably concerning bills and permits for selling prescription medicine which constituted drugs (see paragraph 14 above).
9.  on 28 march 2003 the second applicant initiated proceedings for judicial review before the supreme court of the federation of bosnia and herzegovina (“the supreme court”).11.  on 22 november 2006 the supreme court quashed the decisions of 21 october 2002 and 28 february 2003 (see paragraphs 7-8 above) on procedural grounds, and remitted the case to the directorate.14.  on 8 november 2007 the second applicant complained to the administrative inspectorate of the federal ministry of justice about the inaction of the administration.18.  on 6 january 2010 the applicant submitted a request for an extraordinary review of the decision of 27 november 2009 with the supreme court, which request was rejected as unfounded on 12 may 2010. that decision was served on the second applicant on 9 july 2010.19.  on 6 september 2010 the second applicant lodged a constitutional appeal before the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina (“the constitutional court”) complaining, notably, about the length of the above administrative proceedings.
an offence report drafted by the officer stated that the applicant had failed to declare two silver ingots of 1 kg each and had thereby breached the provisions of article 653 (a) of the customs regulations (see paragraph 12 below).9.  the applicant lodged an administrative complaint with the albiţa customs office, asking for the annulment of the offence report of 28 october 2008 and the restitution of the confiscated goods.the passengers had not been allowed to get off the bus before the customs officers had got on and he had wished to avoid saying what he was carrying in front of the other passengers.based on the elements in the case file, the court observed that the customs officer had asked the applicant whether he had anything to declare and the applicant had said no.707/2006, are as follows: article 156 “(1) a written customs declaration shall be submitted for the following goods: .... c) objects made of precious metals, with or without precious stones, which exceed the purposes of personal use as set forth in legal provisions; (2) for the goods listed in paragraph (1) travellers shall submit the written customs declaration on standard forms which are made available free of charge, upon request, by customs offices.” article 653 “the following is considered an offence and shall be sanctioned with a fine between 3,000 and 8,000 lei: a) concealing from customs any goods or merchandise which should be placed under a customs regime.
the prosecutor observed that the applicant had been suspected of the former offence and that he had been granted victim status in respect of the latter offence, and the prosecutor considered that one person could not have dual status in the same investigation.the court concluded: “as the facts laid out in the letter are consistent and objective, there are no grounds to doubt the truthfulness of the contents of the letter; the statement in the letter that [d.a.]for personal gain while they were in a helpless state – has been proved by a series of pieces of indirect evidence collected in the case and adequately assessed in the [first‑instance] judgment, as well as one of the main pieces of direct evidence ‑ d.a.’s letter to [the applicant], allowing [the court] to make well-founded conclusions regarding the nature of the convicted individual’s actions and the form of his guilt.... it is underlined that the principal statements of the letter, assessed together with the other evidence collected in the case, correspond to the events which took place at that time ... the chamber concludes that the facts indicated in d.a.’s letter are not made up, he refers to actual events which took place in his life, and there is no indication that he intended to threaten [the applicant] with that letter to make the latter pay him money.” 24.  as to the applicant’s appeal, the court stated: “contrary to what is alleged in [the applicant’s] appeal, the first-instance court, while examining the evidence related to [d.a.’s] guilt in respect of the murder of r.ž.only that investigation can determine [the applicant’s] guilt in respect of the criminal offence of which he is suspected ... [the applicant] essentially contests his guilt in respect of the part of the judgment in which he does not have the status of either convicted individual or victim ... and his request goes beyond his procedural rights as a witness ... [the applicant’s appeal] is thereby dismissed.” 25.  d.a.
8.  on 21 february 2005 the celje regional unit of the pension and disability insurance institute of slovenia (hereinafter “the regional zpiz”) granted the applicant a so-called “allowance for the period of waiting to be reassigned to or employed in a different appropriate position of employment” (hereinafter “waiting period allowance”) from 8 october 2004. though the sums appear to be lower during the first few months, he had been subsequently receiving around 390 euros (eur) per month in waiting period allowance.the regional zpiz noted in its decision that the applicant had not been insured under the compulsory insurance scheme at the onset of his disability, but had been registered as unemployed on 3 march 2003 within thirty days of the final decision on his disability, as required by section 97 of the 1999 act.the regional zpiz found that, pursuant to section 94(1)(1) and (3)(1) of the 1999 act, he should receive a benefit in the form of disability allowance, which in his case amounted to eur 192.91. it drew the applicant’s attention to section 185 of the 1999 act, which required beneficiaries to inform the zpiz of any change in circumstances which could affect their rights under that act (see paragraph 26 below).it explained that while recipients of disability-related rights under the 1992 act retained their acquired rights after the date set out in section 446 of the 1999 act, in the applicant’s case a reassessment of his disability had been carried out on 2 february 2011 due to a worsening of his condition (see paragraph 10 above), which had resulted in further workplace limitations and his rights being consequently determined anew.16.  on 21 june 2012 the higher labour and social court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, confirming the position of the lower court that the applicant’s case concerned a change in the level of disability, which had required a fresh determination of his disability benefit.
9.  the applicant eventually signed the record of the questioning, which stated that the questioning had taken place between 5.51 a.m. and 6.33 a.m. 10.  later that morning, at about 6 a.m., the applicant was allegedly escorted to the toilet, where he said the officers had again started hitting and kicking him.at 7.34 p.m. he was issued with a medical certificate, for which he paid the fee due, stating that he had bruises on the forehead, the nose and the left shoulder and an abrasion on the right hip; both his hands and arms were swollen and hyperaemic; and the rear surface of both thighs, as well as the soles of his feet, were swollen, red and sore.the prosecutor emphasised the fact that since the applicant had been apprehended just after he had committed the crime in question (and still in possession of the proceeds of that crime), coercive interrogation by police officers with the intention of extracting his confession to the offence in question seemed pointless and thus hardly plausible.the prosecutor also found it material that the applicant had been uncertain of the identities of the alleged perpetrators when shown photos of the gyöngyös police officers; that he had contradicted himself on several occasions; and that he had complained about the alleged incident only on 27 september 2010, not before.according to the reasoning of the judgment, the court relied on documentary evidence relating to the applicant’s apprehension and questioning, documents relating to the service particulars of the officers involved, the testimony of the applicant, medical documentation, and the testimony of the officers.
12.  on 20 december 2004, at the request of the applicant, the high court gave a default judgment against the fifth and sixth defendants (mr q and his company), holding them liable to the applicant in damages and for costs.the high court’s ruling, given on 20 march 2013, therefore only considered the claims against homebond and mr q. the judge ruled that homebond was liable to the applicant under the terms of the guarantee.although the guarantee set an upper limit of iep 30,000 (approximately 38,100 euros), the judge considered that in the circumstances of the case it was justified to award the full amount of the estimate for repairs, approximately 51,000 euros.33.  the appeal was transferred to the court of appeal, which indicated on 19 november 2014 that it would first consider the issue of the liability of the first and second defendants, and set a short deadline for the parties’ submissions on this.34.  the hearing took place on 9 march 2015. the court of appeal set aside the judgment of the high court, holding that as a matter of law mr and mrs f were not liable to the applicant for the defects in the house since they had simply sold her the land and were not themselves party to the building agreement.
7.  on 13 november 2002 the supreme court of the sakha (yakutiya) republic overruled the refusal and remitted the case for a new examination, as the action included a new co-defendant, and, therefore, it could not be said that the dispute was among the same parties.13.  on 29 august 2003 the district court examined the case, ordered the administration to pay the applicant 800,000 russian roubles (rub) in respect of the flat’s market value and dismissed the remainder of the claims.19.  on 29 september 2005, upon the applicant’s extraordinary appeal, the presidium of the supreme court of sakha (yakutiya) quashed the judgment of 29 august 2003 and the decision of 20 october 2003 and remitted the case for a fresh examination.23.  on 16 february 2006 the district court joined, at the defendant’s request, the ministry of finance as co-defendant in the proceedings and suspended the examination of the case on account of b.’s poor state of health.26.  on 4 june 2007 the supreme court of sakha (yakutiya) upheld the judgment on appeal except for the parts concerning the eviction of s. and b., reimbursement of the rent, payments for utility services, a commission fee, and recovering of the cost of the apartment.
the fence divided the two plots of land and made it impossible for them to access one plot from the other.12.  on 27 june 2011 the court of first instance (osnovni sud) in kotor ruled in favour of the applicants and ordered b.ć.the court was satisfied that the applicants had lodged their claim in time, given that the deadline for initiating proceedings was 30 days from the day on which they had noticed the trespass, taking into account that 13 and 14 july were national holidays.13.  on 20 december 2011 the high court (viši sud) in podgorica, ruling on an appeal lodged by b.ć., quashed the previous judgment and rejected the applicants’ claim (tužba se odbacuje) as submitted out of time.it considered, however, that the 30-day period within which the applicants could institute proceedings was mandatory “[in which case] there could be no shifting of the time-limit when its last day fell on a day when the courts [did] not sit”.
7.  on 22 august 2002 the novosibirsk regional court authorised for 180 days the interception and recording of the applicant’s telephone conversations, interception of postal communications and the collection of data from technical channels of communication.according to operative information, there are good reasons to suspect [the applicant], deputy head of the omsk regional department for the execution of sentences, of arranging for, and systematically receiving, unlawful payments from confidants of the convicts serving their sentences in omsk penal institutions in exchange for granting them various privileges (such as a prison leave, improved conditions of detention or transfer to another penal institution within the omsk region, which was for some reason preferred by the convict in question).given that [the applicant’s] actions contain elements of criminal offences under article 290 § 4 of the criminal code [bribe-taking], classified as a serious offence, and under article 285 § 1 of the criminal code [abuse of power], it is necessary to perform a combination of operational-search measures (interception and recording of telephone conversations, monitoring of correspondence and collection of data from technical channels of communication) in order to collect evidence of his criminal activities, and to receive information about the bribe‑givers and the payment mechanisms used.” 8.  on 18 february 2003 the novosibirsk regional court authorised “audio surveillance” of the applicant’s office for 180 days.he also learnt that a recording of his telephone conversation with ms l., a sister of a convict detained in a penal institution under his supervision, formed the basis for the charge of disclosure of state secrets.in particular, the interception of the applicant’s telephone conversations had been authorised by a court on the grounds that he was suspected of the serious criminal offence of bribe‑taking.
6.  between 21 and 27 december 1989 many people including the applicants and/or their close relatives involved in this case took part in the anti-communist demonstrations in bucharest, timișoara, brașov, reșița and craiova which led to the fall of the communist regime.7.  in 1990 following the overthrow of the communist regime, the military prosecutor’s office opened investigations into the armed crackdown on the demonstrations.the main criminal investigation into the use of violence, particularly against civilian demonstrators, during the events of december 1989 in bucharest and other cities has been contained in file no.those decisions were taken between 1990 and 2007. it results from the documents submitted by the parties that, after the adoption of those decisions, the prosecutor continued to examine the circumstances of these cases in the main criminal investigation – object of file no.10.  following the entry into force of the new code of criminal procedure in february 2014, jurisdiction over the case was relinquished in favour of the military prosecutor’s office.
the applicant further requested that the statement “fuck you rapist bastard” be declared null and void and that x be ordered to pay him 1,000,000 icelandic krónur (isk; approximately 8,800 euros (eur)) in non-pecuniary damages under the tort liability act, plus interest, isk 150,000 (approximately 1,300 eur) for publishing the judgment in the media under article 241 of the penal code, and the applicant’s legal costs.16.  furthermore, the judgment contained the following reasons: “[x] claims that his act of uploading the altered picture onto the picture-sharing application in question did not constitute the publication of the picture within the meaning of article 236(2) of the penal code no 19/1940, as he had believed that only a limited number of people would have access to it.this cannot be accepted, as the act of making something accessible in electronic format to such a large number of people as stated above, irrespective of whether the persons in question are the friends and acquaintances of the person doing so, [...], is considered to be a publication according to the traditional definition of the term.the appealed judgment describes in detail that, before the complaints of sexual offences against him as described above had been reported, [the applicant] had been a well-known person, not least for his performance in public under the names of gillz or gillzenegger, the names under which he wrote on internet, published books and pictures and presented himself in the media.if the altered picture and the comment ‘fuck you rapist bastard’ are taken as a whole – as the parties agree should be the case – the supreme court agrees with the district court that this was a case of invective on the part of [x] against the [applicant] in a ruthless public debate, which the latter, as stated previously, had instigated.
5.  considering these benefits insufficient, the applicants together with other 482 people, sued the russian ministry of finance for additional compensation corresponding to non-pecuniary damage suffered as a result of their participation in the operation.6.  on different dates in january and april 2011 the nalchik town court of kabardino-balkaria (“the town court”) allowed their claims in part and awarded each claimant, including the applicants, compensation ranging between 1,100,000 russian roubles (rub) and rub 1,800,000 for non‑pecuniary damage.8.  on different dates in 2012 and 2013 the domestic courts granted the defendant authority’s request to extend the time-limit for appeal essentially on the ground that the defendant authority had not been served with the impugned judgments.subsequently the regional supreme court quashed the judgments delivered in the applicants’ favour on the grounds that they had been based on retrospective application of the law.10.  between june and august 2013 the presidium of the regional supreme court partially quashed the appeal judgments as regards the applicants’ obligation to reimburse the sums paid.
on 3 july 2008 the district court quashed the decision and remitted the case to the first instance.10.  on 30 september 2010 the court of appeals in belgrade quashed the decision and remitted the case to the court of first instance for a re-trial.11.  in the meantime, on 22 december 2009, the applicant lodged an appeal with the constitutional court complaining under article 32 of the constitution (a provision which corresponds to article 6 of the convention) about the overall fairness of domestic proceedings and their length.12.  due to applicant’s change to the value of the dispute (vrednost spora), on 31 october 2010 the court of first instance ruled that it had no further jurisdiction to examine the applicant’s complaint.13.  on 20 june 2013 the high court adopted a partial judgment against which the applicant and the defendant appealed to the court of appeals in belgrade.
having examined the forensic medical documents and the statements made by the police officers, the first applicant and the witnesses, the police investigator concluded that the first applicant might have sustained injuries as a result of the force used by the police officers in response to his unlawful actions.the investigator also accepted that, as of the morning of 9 august 2003, the first applicant had bruises on the right cheek, the back and the left shin.he also noted that a number of the first applicant’s neighbours had not confirmed that the latter had had any injuries on him on 9 august 2003. as regards the statements made to the contrary by the other neighbours, the investigator found them to be unsubstantiated.he noted, inter alia, that the investigator had failed (1) to establish what each of the police officers had done once they had pulled over the first applicant’s car; (2) to check whether any of the police officers had had a machine gun as claimed by the first applicant; and (3) to establish the reasons why the witnesses who had initially claimed that they had seen the police officers beating the first applicant had revoked their statements.26.  on 1 march 2011 the senior investigator with the district investigative committee dismissed the first applicant’s accusations against the police officers duplicating the findings summed up in the earlier decisions on the matter.
6.  at the relevant time the applicant was a member of the ivanovo region electoral commission.7.  on 23 october 2003 a deputy head of the ivanovo region department of internal affairs ordered audio-visual “surveillance” (“наблюдение”) of the applicant’s office.11.  on 27 september 2004 the leninskiy district court of ivanovo convicted the applicant of abuse of power and sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment, suspended for two years.the court relied on statements by several witnesses, physical evidence, expert reports and the video recordings of the applicant’s telephone conversations.the court held that the district court had correctly declared the video recordings admissible as evidence because they had been obtained in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law.
5.  in 1999 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against his employer, the local police, seeking his reinstatement and damages.6.  the first-instance judgment was rendered by the sarajevo municipal court on 17 april 2006.8.  the third-instance judgment was rendered by the supreme court of the federation of bosnia and herzegovina on 26 january 2010.9.  on 19 april 2010 the applicant filed a constitutional appeal with the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina complaining under article 6 § 1 of the convention and article 1 of protocol no.10.  on 10 april 2013 the constitutional court found a breach of the applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time and rejected the remainder of the case.
the decision read in its entirety as follows: “[the internal security department] has received operative information that [the applicant], a senior police officer with the economic crimes department of the department of the interior of the krasnoyarsk region, is extorting money in the amount of 200,000 roubles from [p.], the director of limited liability company [the company name], for assisting him in obtaining a licence for the retail sale of alcoholic beverages.[the applicant’s] actions contain elements of a criminal offence under article 290 § 2 of the criminal code [bribe-taking] ... it is necessary to perform the operational-search measure ‘interception of telephone communications’ with the aims of documenting [the applicant’s] criminal activities in a thorough and objective way, collecting evidence and uncovering other participants in criminal offences.” 10.  on 1 august 2008 the acting head of the internal security department sent a letter to the deputy president of the tsentralnyy district court of krasnoyarsk, informing her that on 31 july and 1 august 2008 the applicant’s telephone had been tapped in accordance with the urgent procedure provided for by section 8(3) of the osaa.13.  on 28 october 2008, in reply to a request from the applicant for an expert examination of the recordings of his telephone conversations and the video recordings of his meeting with mr p., the investigator in charge of the case held, in so far as relevant, as follows: “... [the applicant’s] guilt for the criminal offence under article 159 § 3 ... is completely proven by the preponderance of evidence collected.” 14.  identical statements were made by the investigator in his decisions of 7 november and 12 december 2008 and 1 april 2009 rejecting various complaints lodged by the applicant.in the court’s opinion, for ordering operational-search measures it is sufficient that there be some elements of a criminal offence, rather than the entire corpus delicti, permitting [the police] to make a preliminary rather than definitive classification of the offence ... the court is not convinced by [the applicant’s] arguments that the interception of his telephone communications was unlawful because the case file does not contain a judicial decision authorising this operational-search measure.the court based its judgment on the statements of numerous witnesses, material evidence, expert opinions, and the audio and video recordings made on 31 july and 1 august 2008. it found that the recordings were authentic and had been obtained in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, repeating the reasoning set out in the decision of 7 december 2009 on the admissibility of evidence.
the accompanying letter, which the government presented to the court, stated that the audio and video recordings had been obtained in the course of covert “operational-search” measures (“оперативно-розыскные мероприятия”) authorised by the president of the novgorod regional court on 19 july and 31 august 2000 and 17 and 27 february 2001.20.  the criminal case file also contained a letter of 21 october 2004 from the federal security service to the local prosecutor stating that the audio recordings had been obtained in the course of covert operational‑search measures authorised by the tver regional court in its decisions nos.the court rejected the applicant’s argument that the audio recordings were inadmissible as evidence, finding that “the examination of the material in the case file [had] permitted [the court] to establish that the evidence [had been] obtained in accordance with the code of criminal procedure and the operational-search activities act”.he submitted that the refusal to give him a copy of the interception authorisation had frustrated him in the exercise of his defence rights and deprived him of an effective remedy against an interference with his rights guaranteed by articles 23 and 24 of the constitution and article 8 of the convention.relying on section 12 of the operational-search activities act (see paragraph 49 below), the court held that the judicial decision authorising operational-search measures and the material that served as a basis for that decision were to be held in the exclusive possession of the state agency performing such measures.
4.  between 1986 and 1987 the applicants took part in the clean-up operation at the chernobyl nuclear disaster site.5.  considering these benefits insufficient, the applicants together with other 482 people, sued the russian ministry of finance for additional compensation corresponding to non-pecuniary damage suffered as a result of their participation in the operation.6.  on different dates in january and april 2011 the nalchik town court of kabardino-balkaria (“the town court”) allowed their claims in part and awarded each claimant, including the applicants, compensation ranging between 1,200,000 russian roubles (rub) and rub 1,600,000 for non‑pecuniary damage.8.  on different dates the town court granted the defendant authority’s request to extend the time-limit for appeal on the grounds that the authorities had not received a copy of the judgment in due course.subsequently the regional supreme court quashed the judgments delivered in the applicants’ favour on the grounds that they had been based on retrospective application of the law.
in view of the above and given that it seems impossible to obtain the information necessary to expose [the applicant’s] unlawful activities by overt investigation, the court, on the basis of article 23 of the russian constitution and article 186 § 2 of [the code of criminal procedure] decides to authorise for 180 days the interception of [the applicant’s] telephone communications on his mobile telephone number ...-15.” 8.  on 24 and 25 december 2003 the police intercepted the applicant’s conversations with an accomplice, m. 9.  on 25 december 2003 two of the applicant’s accomplices, m. and s., were arrested.operational-search measures have revealed that [the applicant] uses mobile phone number ...-49. in view of the above and given that it seems impossible to obtain the information necessary to expose [the applicant’s] unlawful activities by overt investigation, the court, on the basis of article 23 of the russian constitution and article 186 § 2 of [the code of criminal procedure] decides to authorise for 180 days the interception of [the applicant’s] telephone communications on his mobile telephone number ...-49.” 12.  on 26 and 27 december 2003 the police intercepted conversations between the applicant and g. 13.  on 27 december 2003 the applicant was arrested.17.  on 24 august 2004 the investigator appointed legal aid counsel for the applicant, noting that he had refused to choose replacement counsel and had insisted on being represented by g. 18.  on 30 august 2004 the investigator decided to remove g. as counsel for the applicant, finding that it was necessary to question him about his telephone conversations with the applicant on 26 and 27 december 2003. he noted that at the time, g. had not yet been the applicant’s counsel.he had also informed him about the course of the criminal proceedings, which had become known to him as at the time he had been representing the applicant’s accomplices, s. and m. when the police had tried to force the applicant’s door, the applicant had summoned g., who had said that he could not come and offered to send another lawyer.the court does not have any reason to believe that the information obtained as a result of [intercepting the applicant’s] telephone communications with [g.] cannot be used as evidence, given that the information in question has not become known to [g.] as a result of providing legal assistance to [the applicant].” 37.  the applicant appealed against the conviction, claiming that the regional court had erred in its assessment of the evidence, that the transcripts of his telephone conversations with his co-defendant m. and counsel g. had been unlawfully used as evidence in the criminal proceedings, that g. had been unlawfully removed as counsel from his case, and that the authorities had refused to allow his brother to act as his legal representative.
relying on articles 246 and 318 of the code of criminal procedure (ccrp; kriminaalmenetluse seadustik), the court found that the applicants had not been parties to the court proceedings and did not, therefore, have the right to appeal (see paragraph 29 below).19.  at a public hearing on 5 april 2011 the tallinn court of appeal examined the appeal in the presence of j. and his counsel, the prosecutor and the applicants’ counsel.at the hearing, the prosecutor firstly noted that the applicants had not submitted any documents concerning their claim for legal costs, despite the fact that they had had a week after the settlement to do so.20.  by a decision of 13 april 2011, the tallinn court of appeal dismissed the applicants’ appeal and upheld the harju county court’s decision of 23 march 2011. it referred to article 243 of the ccrp, under which the victim was not entitled to revoke his or her consent to the application of the settlement procedure, and to article 246 of the code, which provided that the victim did not have to be summoned to a court hearing in settlement proceedings (see paragraphs 28 and 29 below).the court noted that according to article 245 of the ccrp, the settlement agreement did not necessarily have to address matters dealing with the costs of criminal procedure or cover the extent of granting the civil claim or of compensating for the damage caused by the criminal offence.
8.  on 3 may 2011 the applicant was charged in absentia in tajikistan with participating in an extremist religious movement, the islamic movement of uzbekistan, and an international search and arrest warrant was issued in his name.10.  on 4 december 2013 the tajik prosecution authorities requested the applicant’s extradition on the basis of the above charges.12.  an appeal by the applicant of 16 december 2013 was dismissed by the moscow city court (“the city court”) on 3 february 2014.15.  on 9 october 2014 the applicant’s extradition was refused by the deputy prosecutor general of the russian federation, owing to the absence of culpable actions under russian criminal law.the district court assessing the risks stated that “[t]he claims of the representative ... are of a speculative nature and not confirmed by the case materials” 19.  the above judgment was upheld on appeal by the city court on 24 october 2014. claims by the applicant under article 3 of the convention were dismissed with reference to the district court’s assessment of the case, which took into consideration “...the nature of the administrative offence, the character of the accused [who was criminally convicted in russia]... the length of his stay in russia and other circumstances of the case”.

subsequently, complaining about the decrease in the market value of the land and the long-term uncertainty about the fate of their plots of land, the applicants initiated compensation proceedings before the civil courts.6.  during the proceedings relating to their land, the applicants submitted the decision given by the plenary chamber of the court of cassation (civil divisions, numbered e.2004/5-555 k.2005/17) to the domestic courts and asserted that according to this decision their compensation claims had to be accepted.7.  on various dates between 2007 and 2010, the applicants’ respective claims for compensation were dismissed by the domestic courts on the ground that their plots of land were not actually seized by the authorities.in their decisions, neither the courts of first instance nor fifth civil division of the court of cassation, which examined the applicants’ claims on cassation, expressed any reason as to why they had reached a different conclusion from the plenary court of cassation.8.  the details of the proceedings may be found in the appended table.

the nurse stated, in particular, that the fact that only the injection of relanium and not the one of magnesium had been mentioned in the ambulance visit record could possibly be explained by her having forgotten to remind the doctor about the injection of magnesium.89) produced on 14 january 2008, the injection of relanium 2 mg and magnesium 3 g by the ambulance crew had been correct at the given moment, taking into account the patient’s condition − that is to say convulsion syndrome − and the injection of the given quantity of those substances was not contra-indicated.3.  in the case in question the medical assistance provided by the ambulance crew and in hospital was appropriate and sufficient, without omissions, which is substantiated by the data contained in the medical documents and by the evidentiary material in the case file.21.  on the same day the investigator lodged a request with the director of the “emergency medical service” state close joint stock company of the yerevan municipality (“the emergency medical service”) seeking to impose an appropriate penalty on the ambulance crew.as regards the late arrival of the ambulance, incorrect completion of the visit record and the doctor’s failure to sit beside the patient during the journey to the hospital, the district court referred to the fact that a.g. had been reprimanded for poor performance of her duties.
the investigating judge ordered that an autopsy be conducted by a sworn and judicially certified expert (beeideter und gerichtlich zertifizierter sachverständiger); the autopsy was conducted on 5 october 2005. on the same day, the investigating judge, in response to a request made by the public prosecutor, delivered a decision ordering the seizure of the blood samples taken from y.c., together with the pertinent examination report.25.  on 24 october 2005 the investigating judge complied with a request lodged by the public prosecutor for the inclusion in the case file of the results of the investigation up until that date, as well as for y.c.’s medical history to be obtained from the detention centre, and for these documents to be transmitted to the expert dr h. it was further decided that the scale used to weigh y.c.rather, it was more likely that a shift in the electrolyte system had commenced over a period of several days, as indicated by the results of the blood test conducted by linz general hospital on 4 october 2005. a post-mortem examination of y.c.’s blood (conducted in the course of the autopsy) had shown that he had been a carrier of sickle cell trait (sichelzellanlage).34.  on 12 october 2005 the public prosecutor made a note in the criminal file (aktenvermerk) about a conversation with dr h. the doctor had expressed the opinion that with hindsight y.c.’s extraordinarily aggressive behaviour at the hospital on the day of his death had resembled a delirious state caused by advanced dehydration and the consequent disintegration of his blood cells.41.  one of the police doctors, dr f.g., gave evidence regarding, inter alia, the reason why the calculation of the critical weight of a detainee on hunger strike was based on his or her weight at the outset of the hunger strike, and not the weight recorded upon admission to the detention centre.
he noted that the government had taken a decision to ‘punish and frighten’ him, and that there were several reasons for that: firstly, the applicant’s blog posting of 28 january 2013, which had revealed facts embarrassing the government; secondly, the fact that real had raised a public debate on the june 2012 legislative amendments aimed at keeping secret information concerning shareholders in companies, creating ‘a more clandestine environment for stealing the oil money’; thirdly, the applicant’s earlier criticism of the national assembly, in which he compared it to ‘a zoo’, following enactment of the legislation placing ‘severe limitations on the freedom of assembly’ by ‘introducing unjustifiably high monetary penalties for attending unauthorised demonstrations’; and lastly, the real movement’s ‘quickly accumulating strength’ prior to the presidential election, becoming a ‘serious barrier in the eyes of the traditional [political] players’ and threatening ‘to spoil the repeat of the election farce performed year after year’.” 13.  on 4 february 2013 the prosecutor general’s office charged the applicant with criminal offences under articles 233 (organising or actively participating in actions causing a breach of public order) and 315.2 (resistance to or violence against public officials, posing a threat to their life or health) of the criminal code, in connection with his alleged involvement in a riot in the town of ismayilli on 24 january 2013. on 30 april 2013 the applicant was charged under articles 220.1 (mass disorder) and 315.2 of the criminal code, thereby replacing the original charges.and others, who had gathered at the square near the administrative building of the regional education department located on the nariman narimanov street opposite to the administrative building of [the idea], [to do the following:] [i]  to enter in masses into the area in front of the building of [the idea], which is the competent body of the executive power of the republic of azerbaijan, and by doing so to create difficulties for the movement of traffic and pedestrians, [ii]  to disobey the lawful demands to disperse, made by government officials wanting to stop their illegal behaviour, [iii]  to resist uniformed police officers protecting the public order, by way of committing violent acts posing danger to [police officers’] life and health, using various objects, [iv]  to disrupt the normal functioning of [the idea], state enterprises, bodies and organisations, as well as public-catering, commercial and public-service facilities, by way of refusing to leave, for a long period of time, the areas where the acts seriously breaching the public order were being committed, and [v]  to stop the movement of traffic, by way of blocking the central avenue and the nariman narimanov street, and was finally able to achieve that, at around 5 p.m. of the same day in the town of ismayilli, a group of persons consisting of [e.i.17.  in that judgment, the court found that, during the pre-trial period, the applicant had been deprived of his liberty without a “reasonable suspicion” of having committed a criminal offence, in breach of the requirements of article 5 § 1 (c) of the convention (ibid., §§ 87-101), that he had not been afforded a proper judicial review of the lawfulness of his detention in breach of article 5 § 4 of the convention (ibid., §§ 111-19), that his right to presumption of innocence under article 6 § 2 of the convention had been breached owing to the prosecuting authorities’ prejudicial statements made before he had been proved guilty according to law (ibid., §§ 125-28), and that the restriction of the applicant’s liberty had been applied for purposes other than bringing him before a competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence, constituting a breach of article 18 of the convention taken in conjunction with article 5 of the convention (ibid., §§ 137-44).24.  the defence then applied to the court with the following requests: (a)  that the applicant be released from detention, with reference to article 5 of the convention and various provisions of the domestic law; (b)  that the proceedings against the applicant be discontinued owing to the absence of corpus delicti and on the grounds that the charges against him were false; and (c)  that the evidence against the applicant obtained at the pre-trial stage, including statements by a number of prosecution witnesses (including those mentioned in paragraphs 48 and 52-56 below), be declared inadmissible on the grounds that it had been unlawfully obtained, and that letters from the ismayilli region police department (“the ismayilli rpd”) and the ministry of national security (“the mns”) (see paragraph 73 below) also be declared inadmissible on the grounds that they contained information that had not been verified independently by the prosecution authorities.according to letter of 6/2274 of the ministry of national security dated 20 april 2013, on 24 january 2013 [tofiq yaqublu and the applicant] were in ismayilli and called on residents to resist the police, to block roads ... and to commit other similar acts aimed at disturbing social and political stability.” 74.  on 18 november 2013 the applicant’s lawyers applied to the trial court with a number of requests, in particular: (a)  that the applicant be released from pre-trial detention, with reference to article 5 of the convention and various provisions of domestic law (this request was similar to the one lodged at the preliminary hearing); (b)  that various pieces of evidence against the applicant obtained at the pre-trial stage be declared inadmissible, including statements by a number of prosecution witnesses (including those mentioned in paragraphs 48 and 52-56 above) on the grounds that they had been unlawfully obtained, and the letters from the ismayilli rpd and the mns (see paragraph 73 above) on the grounds that they contained information that had not been verified independently by the prosecution authorities (this request was also similar to the one lodged at the preliminary hearing); (c)  that additional witnesses for the defence be heard (including i.a., r.c., and e.m. (see paragraphs 59 and 62-63 above)) and other additional evidence (inter alia, contemporaneous media reports concerning the events of 24 january 2013) be examined; and (d)  that the hearings be held in a larger courtroom which could accommodate media representatives.
had only handed it over to the commission’s archives; (b)  the applicant association had been founded formally on 1 september 2004. on 25 december 2003, the date to which the commission referred in its decision, the applicant association had only appointed the members of its holy synod; (c)  the applicant association was a new religious community that had no connection with, let alone stemmed from, the moc, which, in any event, had not been recognised by any orthodox church; (d)  the fact that the moc had sought to have the bureau add “ohrid archdiocese” to its name was irrelevant, since no such name existed in the commission’s records; (e)  the applicant association had denied that it had been set up by a foreign church or a foreign state.neither has it jurisdiction to decide as a hierarchically superior court and examine the lawfulness and constitutionality of decisions adopted by competent administrative bodies ... the complainant refers to the non-registration as an action, but such an action ... stems from an individual decision which this court is not competent to examine ... the registration of ... a religious community or a group does not determine the religious beliefs and internal religious belief of a person, since expression of beliefs is an individual act, the registration procedure does not affect personal religious belief and rituals, and the court has not been presented with any evidence that they have been violated at any point.” 22.  the court also held that the appeal had been submitted outside the two-month time-limit specified in the rules of the constitutional court (see paragraph 52 below), calculated since 9 november 2005, the date of the supreme court’s decision (see paragraph 18 above).if registration was granted “it would operate in the territory of the respondent state as part of a foreign orthodox church ... it would operate and be managed autonomously within the canonical jurisdiction of the peć patriarchy, notably (the soc) ... which had no canonical or any other jurisdiction over (the moc) or in the territory of (the respondent state).” that was in violation of article 1 of the un declaration on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief, article 18 of the un universal declaration of human rights and article 9 of the convention; (d)  the founding decision had specified only the temporary place of registration of the applicant association, without specifying “a specific seat and address” (точно одредено седиште и адреса), as required under section 13 § 1 (2) of the 2007 act; and (e)  bishop d. was nominated to act on behalf (застапува) of the applicant association, but not to represent (претставува) it, as required under section 12 § 2 (5) of the 2007 act.consequently, those names were never registered as trademarks, nor were trademark certificates ever issued; (iv) the applicant association was set up by three founding members who had signed the minutes of the constituent assembly held on 27 april 2009. consequently, the court had been wrong to hold that the founding decision had been rendered by the applicant association’s holy synod, as that body had no legal capacity to act before the applicant association was registered; (v) no reasonable explanation had been given as to why the applicant association’s intended name did not imply that it concerned a religious organisation; (vi) the court’s interpretation that the expression “greek” was an english translation of “orthodox church” was wrong; (vii) the intended name of the applicant association was different from the name of any registered religious organisation, including the name of the moc to which “ohrid archdiocese” had been unlawfully added.this clearly suggests that the court would refuse to register [the applicant association] under any name”; (viii) the registration court had given unsubstantiated explanations of a theological and historical nature favourable to the moc; (ix) the applicable legislation did not preclude a religious community from being in canonical union with other churches in the world; (x) the refusal to register the applicant association violated the freedom of religion of the orthodox greeks and serbs in the respondent state, as the intended name suggested that it represented those communities; and (xii) lastly, the applicant association reiterated that it was ready to rectify any error the registration court might ask it to.
having said that, the case has a number of disturbing features: (1) the autopsy was grossly inadequate, and even if signs of homicide had been present, they would have been missed; (2) the face was of normal colour – neither congested nor pale; this argues for death before hanging; (3) there was no accumulation of blood in the lower extremities – this absence argues against hanging altogether; (4) the furrow around the neck is in a position more often seen in strangulation than suicide; (5) none of the normal scratch marks normally seen outside of the neck when individuals hang themselves were evident.25.  as third evidence the applicants submitted a letter dated 15 june 2010 written by the president of the committee on institutions and transparency of the greek parliament and addressed to the public prosecutor at the court of cassation in which the former expressed the view that there had not been sufficient investigation of the relationship between the death of costas tsalikidis and the wiretapping affair.they requested in particular that the following investigative measures be implemented: phone operator v. to be ordered to provide the minutes of the meeting that took place the day before mr tsalikidis was found dead, representatives of v. to confirm officially that mr tsalikidis was the person responsible for accepting on behalf of their company the legal software provided by company e. which was used to activate the program of wiretapping, a forensic examination of the place of death and a reconstruction of the circumstances of the death to be conducted, exhumation and new toxicology tests to be run, a cross‑examination of the applicants’ technical advisors together with coroners g.d.l.28.  on 20 april 2012 the public prosecutor at the athens court of first instance ordered the exhumation of mr tsalikidis’ body, the conduct of a new forensic autopsy and the execution of all laboratory tests to be carried out in a laboratory in the presence of the technical advisors appointed by the applicants.33.  on 16 june 2014 the public prosecutor at the athens court of first instance, with the approval of the public prosecutor at the court of appeal, closed the supplementary investigation, concluding that the above‑mentioned reports, considered in conjunction with the evidence gathered during the main investigation, were sufficient to allow the case file to be archived, thereby upholding the conclusions of order 80/06 issued by the public prosecutor at the athens court of first instance (order no.
had still been in a highly agitated state, lying face down in the van, with the police officers restraining him: one either sitting or kneeling on the victim’s buttocks, and the other holding his legs; his hands were outstretched and fastened by several handcuffs to the back seat of the van; the victim’s head was on the driver’s side, and his right cheek face down on the floor.the death is due to natural causes.” 35.  on 10 december 2010 dr t. and dr f. produced their anatomopathological expert report after examining a copy of the autopsy report of 16 november 2009, a copy of the interviews with the members of the police patrol team who had arrested m.b., a copy of the record of examination of two witnesses, various sealed samples collected both by dr h. and by professor l. and dr r.: “[m.b] died suddenly of cardiac rhythm disorders owing to a coronary spasm triggered by a context of intense and prolonged emotional and physical stress.the superficial injuries observed, during the autopsy, to the right-hand side of the face and the front of the knees [appear to him] compatible with immobilisation on the floor of the van and the petechial injuries to the upper abdomen and the left abdominal region are compatible with punches administered as described in the autopsy report.” 39.  on 25 november 2011 the ombudsman, an institution independent of the state, having the task, inter alia, of ensuring compliance by the police with their code of professional ethics, to whom a member of parliament had submitted the case, produced a report.on 16 october 2013 the investigation division of the besançon court of appeal upheld the decision finding no case to answer on the following grounds: “[m.b.’s death was due] according to the forensic doctor who carried out the initial autopsy ... to heart failure in circumstances of stress and effort acting on a predisposed heart condition; the second forensic report supported the finding of cutaneous injuries that could not have been a contributory cause of death and ruled out death due to chest compression; the experts indicated that the death of [m.b.]on 18 november 2014 the court of cassation dismissed their appeal on the following grounds: “ ... the court of cassation is satisfied on the basis of the grounds of the judgment being appealed that in upholding the decision finding no case to answer the investigation division, after analysing all the facts referred to it and addressing the main grounds in the statement of appeal, gave sufficient and coherent reasons for their finding that the investigation had been thorough and that there was insufficient evidence on which to convict the persons charged with of manslaughter or any other offence ...” ...
7.  in 2004 the applicant company published a series of articles commenting on the professional activity of y.l., the then head of the kstovo district administration (“the district administration”).8.  in an article published in issue 11 (400) dated 6 march 2004 and entitled “success has turned his head” (“головокружение от успехов”), n.g., a member of a local council, contested the validity of the district administration’s policy concerning spending and property management in respect of 2003 in the following terms: “... i do not object for the sake of objecting, y.l.in the article ‘the golden grin awards’ the defendant placed the claimant’s photograph in a photo collage with a muslim turban and a beard, having added to the portrait the following text in bold ‘we could blow anything up....” 12.  the court declared the information in question erroneous and defamatory, and ordered the applicant company to pay an amount of a symbolic value to the claimant in damages and publish a retraction phrased in the following terms: “the editorial board of the [applicant company] offers its apologies to the head of the kstovo district administration, y.l., for the unethical comparison of [his] actions with the actions of the marmoset, called a ‘fool’, ... as well as for the photo collage of y.l ... the editorial board recognises that the photo collage is unfounded, incorrect and injurious, and once again offers its apologies to y.l.” 13.  the applicant company appealed against the judgment of 31 august 2004, relying on, among other things, the case-law of the court and the failure of the kstovo city court to draw a distinction between statements of facts and value judgments, and the statements of politicians and those of the general public.it held as follows: “having examined the case-file, the text of the publication [...] the [first instance] court rightly concluded that the information at issue defamed the honour, dignity and business reputation of y.l.
20.  on 25 january 2011 the st petersburg city court quashed the decision of 3 november 2010 and dismissed the first applicant’s complaint against the decision of the fms of 25 january 2010. the court held, in particular, that between 2003 and 2010 the first applicant had not tried to contest the refusals of the fms of 8 november 2001, 20 february and 8 may 2003 to re-establish her forced migrant status, which showed that she had lost interest in having that status.the court held, that the decision of 25 january 2010 had been based on section 5 (4), of the federal law on forced migrants, which provided that the extension of the status of forced migrants could be granted only at their request (see relevant domestic law below).[the first applicant] lost her forced migrant status in 2001, her minor son has never had such a status, and therefore the court comes to the conclusion that the respondents unlawfully occupy the disputed housing and should be evicted without the provision of any alternative accommodation ...” 25.  the applicants lodged an appeal against the eviction order, submitting that their eviction was disproportionate since the court had not taken their arguments into account.the housing stock aimed at providing forced migrants with temporary housing is for a strictly designated use – the provision with housing of individuals who have been legally acknowledged to be forced migrants and their family members; the loss or deprivation of the status of forced migrant implies the loss of the right to live in the housing, termination of the social tenancy agreement and the obligation to vacate the occupied accommodation ...” 27.  the applicants did not lodge a cassation appeal against the above decisions.35.  according to the information provided by the government, in 2016 the administration of the primorskiy district of st petersburg prepared a draft order for the removal of the second applicant from the waiting list of persons eligible for social housing.
given the fact that the mother had not been identified as the recipient and that the applicant had not been provisionally entrusted with the care of the children, the order could not be enforced.he referred to the shortcomings in the order as identified by the enforcement courts and asked the court to specify to whom the order had been directed and to provide a time frame for the return of the children.21.  the constitutional court found that the regional court’s decision had been taken on purely formal grounds and had been arbitrary and in contravention of the code of civil procedure, the brussels ii bis regulation, the hague convention and the constitution.having regard to the sensitive nature of the matter and its importance for the applicant’s enjoyment of his parental rights, the constitutional court found that the district court had proceeded with the matter over a long time (for more than four years) and inefficiently (it had stayed the proceedings, delivered an arbitrary enforcement decision on the first occasion, and had taken lengthy procedural steps).30.  after the enforcement proceedings had been completed by a final and binding decision and before the second constitutional judgment had been issued, the applicant applied to the constitutional court a third time on 14 october 2016. he relied on that occasion on article 6 (fairness and length) in conjunction with articles 13 and 8 (family life) of the convention and challenged the decisions of 15 april and 3 august 2016 (see paragraphs 26 and 27 above) on their merits.
7.  on 30 july 2010 the appeal judgment was quashed by way of a supervisory review (on grounds not related to the applicant’s article 6 complaints in respect of the 2005 proceedings) as the applicant’s right to defence had been breached during the appeal hearing.in his appeal statements the applicant analysed the case materials in detail, referred extensively to all the main items of evidence, including expert opinions and witness testimony, and referred to exact pages in the case file.9.  the applicant’s case was examined by the supreme court of russia (“the supreme court”) over four hearings, three of which (21 october, 30 november and 16 december 2010), according to the trial record and the court’s procedural decisions, were held in camera.the case file did not contain any formal decision by the supreme court to close the hearings to the public.10.  on 16 december 2010 the supreme court upheld the judgment of 21 april 2005. the supreme court’s judgment was delivered to the remand prison, where the applicant was still being detained, on 11 january 2011 (“the 2010 proceedings”).
24.  the investigating authorities interviewed mr k., who confirmed his statements, and ms i., the head of the tuberculosis unit responsible for mr kaimov’s treatment in 2009 and 2010. the doctor stated that the patient had received tuberculosis treatment until late may 2010, when he had refused to take any drugs.27.  the investigator again refused to open a criminal case on 5 january 2011. that decision was annulled by the higher-ranking authority on 15 march 2011 for want of necessary investigative measures, in view of the investigator’s failure to rectify the shortcomings already identified in the previous review decisions.relying on the above statements and mr kaimov’s medical history, he found that the latter’s death had resulted from his own careless decision in not taking the prescribed drugs, and that the medical authorities had taken all reasonable steps to convince him to re-initiate the treatment.32.  the first applicant appealed against the decision of 29 may 2011. her appeal was rejected, in the final instance, by the supreme court of the tatarstan republic on 11 october 2011. the courts concluded that the investigation into mr kaimov’s death had been thorough and comprehensive.the decision refusing the institution of criminal proceedings had been based on the examination of the medical file and statements by a number of witnesses, including the medical personnel of the prison hospital.
5.  on 16 august 2004 he was charged with fraud in armenia and the kentron and nork-marash district court in yerevan issued an arrest warrant.7.  on an application a district prosecutor in ufa, on 27 december 2006 the kirovskiy district court in ufa remanded the applicant in custody, without setting a time-limit for his detention.on 13 february 2007 the supreme court of bashkortostan upheld the detention order on appeal.8.  on 23 march 2007 a deputy prosecutor general granted the extradition request; on 17 july 2007 the supreme court of russia upheld that decision in final instance.10.  on 16 february 2008, when attempting to return to russia, the applicant was detained by the russian border control and held in custody until 22 february 2008. the parties did not produce a record of the applicant’s arrest or any judicial decision authorising his detention.
on 6 june 2008 the court found in his favour and obliged the respondent to the action to pay him a severance payment, outstanding wages, a lump sum in compensation, and default interest.8.  in an order of 2 june 2010 the supreme court forwarded the respondent’s petition to the applicant and informed him that, within eight days of receiving the order, he could file comments on the respondent’s petition and/or request an oral hearing.9.  on 7 june 2010 the applicant received the order, and on 14 june 2010 he dispatched his comments on the petition for review.10.  meanwhile, on 16 june 2010 the supreme court, sitting as a review court, had given a judgment in which it had reversed the previous decisions and dismissed the applicant’s action.the court stated that the applicant had not filed any comments on the petition for review.
6.  on 14 august 2012 the oktyabrskiy district court of groznyy found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment.7.  on 14 november 2012 the supreme court of the chechen republic quashed the conviction and ordered a retrial.9.  on 24 june 2013 counsel for the applicant asked the director of the remand prison to release the applicant since he had already served the one-year sentence.on the same day a judge of the district court faxed a letter to the director, informing him that the applicant should not be released until the supreme court had examined the matter on appeal since the district court ordered the preventive measure to remain unchanged.10.  on 3 july 2013 the supreme court upheld the conviction and the applicant was released.
against the applicant to have had a “basis in law and [to have been] justified” 16.  on 3 january 2013 the head of the zagreb police sent the case file concerning the internal police investigation to the internal control service of the ministry of the interior.17.  on the instructions of the head of the zagreb police, on 5 february 2013 the iv police station in zagreb sent a report on the events at issue together with the applicant’s medical report to the zmsao.18.  on 6 february 2013, upon a request by the applicant’s lawyer, the head of the iv police station in zagreb shortly informed the applicant’s lawyer that the force used against the applicant by the two police officers had had a basis in law and had been justified.19.  on 15 may 2013 the head of iv police station in zagreb compiled a report for the legal, financial and technical tasks division of the zagreb police, where he described in detail the events at issue and the results of the internal police investigation with a final conclusion that the use of force against the applicant had had a basis in law and had been justified.28.  on 13 january 2016 the zmsao interviewed b.z., a witness to the applicant’s arrest, who said that the applicant had attempted to run from the police and had fallen and that he had not seen any police officers hitting or kicking the applicant.
10.  the judgment of 25 september 2007 was altered on appeal on 21 january 2008. the prison sentence for the offences committed in 2005 was reduced to ten years, but the total sentence to be served remained unchanged at thirty years.on 11 november 2008 the public defender sent a report on the meeting to the prison governor and requested news of the applicant’s state of health.20.  on 29 december 2008 the public defender wrote a letter to the minister of justice, the head of the prisons department, and the governor of rustavi prison no.6, challenging the effectiveness of the insurance company with which the ministry of prisons had concluded a contract, on the basis of, inter alia, the applicant’s case.on 23 january 2009 bacteriological tests revealed the presence of tuberculosis bacteria, and the applicant was immediately put on a dots (directly observed treatment, short‑course) programme, the treatment strategy for the detection and cure of tuberculosis, as recommended by the world health organisation.
there was nevertheless specific reason to do so, especially after the meeting on 7 february 2008 between him, ingibjörg sólrún gísladóttur, árni m. mathiesen and the chairman of the board of governors of the central bank of iceland; after his and ingibjörg sólrún gísladóttir’s meeting on 1 april 2008 with the board of governors of the central bank of iceland; and following a declaration to the swedish, danish and norwegian central banks, which was signed on 15 may 2008. the prime minister did not initiate a formal ministerial meeting on the situation nor did he provide the government with a separate report on the problem of the banks or its possible effect on the icelandic state.section 1(2) of the aforementioned act.” 34.  the court went on to make the following remarks about section 8(c) of the ministerial accountability act: “according to section 8(c) of [the act] it is punishable if a minister, apart from the incidents described in points (a) and (b) of the section, ‘by other means personally implements, orders the implementation or allows the implementation of any measure that contravenes the constitution of the republic, or fails to implement any measure prescribed therein, or causes neglect of such implementation’.accordingly, it falls within the conduct description of this provision to fail to comply with the duty, provided for in article 17 of the constitution, to hold ministerial meetings ‘to discuss new legislative proposals and important government matters’.” 35.  in regard to the applicant’s motion to have the whole case dismissed due to the alleged lack of clarity of section 8(c) of the ministerial accountability act, the court of impeachment considered that the words “important government matters” in article 17 of the constitution, to which section 8(c) referred, could easily be understood by a reasonable man in the office held by the applicant and that the provisions contained predictable and reasonable criteria regarding the minister’s discharge of official duties.last but not least it is proven that those two aforesaid documents that were forwarded to foreign authorities [a declaration of 16 may 2008 signed by the defendant, the ministers of foreign affairs and finance and the board of governors of the central bank of iceland to the central banks of sweden, denmark and norway on the completion of currency swap agreements and a letter of 20 august 2008 by the ministry of business affairs to the uk treasury providing answers to certain questions posed by the latter] and contained, on the one hand, obligations, and, on the other, promises, in the name of the government, were not discussed at its meetings.it expressed the following view on the history of articles 16 and 17 of the constitution: “according to the interpretation of article 17 of the constitution related above, the duty to hold ministerial meetings only extended to meetings on matters to be submitted to the state council and matters which individual ministers wished to raise, and the actual practice in respect of the functions of ministerial meetings has been in keeping with this ever since.
assuming that the statement was to be understood in the way set out in the court of appeal’s judgment of 18 april 2012, and noting that the applicant company had not provided evidence as to the truth of the allegation, it found that the article and statement qualified as defamation within the meaning of article 111 § 1 and 2 of the criminal code (strafgesetzbuch).as regards the applicant company’s complaint about the amount of compensation granted, the court of appeal held that it did not even amount to 10% of the maximum compensation permitted by law, and was not excessive in relation to the circulation of the newspaper and the online news portal.20.  the applicant company subsequently lodged an application for renewal of the criminal proceedings (erneuerung des strafverfahrens) under article 363a of the code of criminal procedure (strafprozeßordnung) with the supreme court (oberster gerichtshof), complaining under article 10 of the convention of a violation of its right to freedom of expression.it stated that the court of appeal’s considerations as to the qualification of the statement as a statement of fact did not raise concerns, and held that such statements of fact, which had not been proven to be true and were thus defamatory, were not protected by article 10. it concluded that the interference with the applicant company’s right to freedom of expression had been prescribed by law, had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of others and had been necessary in the circumstances of the case, in particular taking into account the low amount of compensation granted.in particular, a final conviction under section 6 of the media act establishing that a particular media content fulfilled the objective elements of defamation would determine – in a way that was binding and not revisable in the civil proceedings – that the audience understood the media content as defamatory.
as the materials and information available to the police suggest that there is probably cause to believe that zoran grba, a national of bosnia and herzegovina, engages in the offence of currency counterfeiting under article 274 §§ 1 and 2 of the criminal code, and given that, in the view of the investigating judge, the investigation cannot be efficiently carried out by other means, or would be extremely difficult, the well-founded request of the [pula county state attorney’s office] should be granted and the requested measures are hereby ordered with regard to zoran grba as indicated in the operative part of this order.55.  with regard to the applicant’s plea of entrapment, the pazin municipal court observed: “in the case at issue, examination of the audio recordings of the phone taps confirmed the circumstances surrounding the communication between the undercover agents and the accused, in particular the intensity of the telephone communications.first contacted the accused without telling him the reason for the contact, as was established by the first-instance court from the statement of e.k., and the fact that the first meeting took place almost a month later (on 6 august 2008) ‒ when the undercover agent in duga resa bought one 100 euro counterfeit note from the accused for the amount of hrk 300 ‒ cannot be considered as an incitement but was a tactical action aimed at gaining the confidence of the accused and further uttering of counterfeit euros.the fact that the undercover agent succeeded in his task is self‑evident, since the accused continued to sell him larger quantities of counterfeit euros for real euros until he was arrested.” 58.  on 6 november 2010 the applicant filed a request for extraordinary review of a final judgment before the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske), challenging the findings of the pula county court.furthermore, the pula county court had not taken into account the fact that the majority of the contacts with the applicant had been initiated by the undercover agents, and it had not analysed the substance of their discussions, even though they had been duly recorded, as a result of the applicant’s phone having been tapped.
21.  by a letter of 9 january 2007 a prosecutor informed the applicant that a criminal inquiry had established that his son had contracted tuberculosis in early march 2005. the correctional colony had promptly identified the disease and had ensured treatment keeping the disease under control.ms b. stressed that the testing had been complex and that the hospital had only received the test result in august 2005. on 26 august 2005 the doctors had learned that mr r.’s tuberculosis had been drug resistant.24.  having regard to the investigation file, the court noted that the investigating authorities had solicited neither the autopsy report nor medical documents concerning mr r.’s treatment and that they had not interviewed any doctor involved in the treatment.the court found that the documents obtained by the first‑instance court and the statement by ms b. had remedied the alleged shortcomings in the investigation.it concluded that the criminal inquiry had been carried out in compliance with the requirements of the russian code of criminal procedure, and that the impugned decision of 21 october 2006 had been based on sufficient evidence duly assessed by the investigating authorities.
when extending the applicant’s detention, the domestic courts referred to the particular gravity and quantity of the charges against him; complexity of the criminal investigation and difficulties of jury trial; the applicant’s liability to abscond, re-offend and interfere with the course of justice, given his personality and criminal record; significant volume of evidence presented by the defence during the trial.the courts also kept track of the course of the investigation and assessed investigative and operative measures planned by the prosecution, including arrests of the applicant’s accomplices (which were still at liberty or had absconded in breach of the measure of restraint imposed on them and had been put on the wanted persons’ list), complex expert examinations requiring participation of the applicant and the victims and examination of the case-file by the applicant and his accomplices.on his arrival at the airport of yuzhno-sakhalinsk on 13 october 2002 mr l. was met by mr k., one of the applicant’s accomplices, and taken to the applicant’s country house where he was held until 6 november 2002, being subjected to beatings and extortion by the applicant and his gang.having regard to these circumstances, the trial court allowed the prosecution’s request to read out mr l. and mr k.’s statements incriminating the applicant, despite the latter’s objections.13.  the applicant’s lawyer appealed against the judgment of the regional court, complaining, among other matters, about the decision to read out pre-trial statements by mr l., mr p. and mr k. on 14 november 2007 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the judgment of the regional court, noting that it had correctly considered that reasons for the witnesses’ absence had been extraordinary and that it had lawfully read out their pre-trial statements.
8.  on 26 march 1995 the applicant further participated in the reconstruction of the events (olay ve yer gösterme) in the course of which he had confessed, in the absence a lawyer, having carried out an arson attack.the applicant was accused of carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory, proscribed by article 125 of the former criminal code.16.  on 31 march 2005 the diyarbakır assize court convicted the applicant of attempting to undermine the constitutional order, proscribed by article 146 § 1 of the former criminal code, and sentenced him to life imprisonment.17.  on 11 december 2006 the court of cassation quashed the judgment of 31 march 2005 in respect of some of the accused, including the applicant, and remitted the case to the diyarbakır assize court.18.  on 9 november 2007, the diyarbakır assize court convicted the applicant of attempting to undermine the constitutional order, proscribed by article 146 § 1 of the former criminal code, and sentenced him to life imprisonment again.
6.  on 1 february 2011 the dean of the school of mathematics of the university of montenegro (prirodno-matematički fakultet), at a session of the school’s council, informed the professors teaching there, including the applicants, that “video surveillance has been introduced” (da je uveden video nadzor) and that it was in the auditoriums where classes were held.they relied on the personal data protection act (see paragraphs 24‑27 below).the applicants submitted, in particular, that the amphitheatre where they taught was locked both before and after the classes, that the only property there was fixed desks and chairs and a blackboard, that they knew of no reason to fear for anybody’s safety and that, in any event, there were other methods for protecting people and property and monitoring classes.11.  on 28 april 2011, after the applicants’ objection to the report, the agency’s council (savjet agencije za zaštitu ličnih podataka) issued a decision (rješenje) ordering the school of mathematics to remove the cameras from the auditoriums within fifteen days as the video surveillance was not in accordance with the personal data protection act, notably sections 10, 35 and 36 (see paragraphs 24, and 26-27 below).in particular, the council held that the reasons for the introduction of video surveillance provided for by section 36 had not been met, given that there was no evidence that there was any danger to the safety of people and property in the auditoriums, still less to confidential data, and that the surveillance of teaching was not among the legitimate grounds for video surveillance.the high court held in particular that the applicants had not proved that their right to privacy had been violated and found that the first-instance court had “sufficiently related the court’s case-law to the case at issue (dao jasan osvrt na odnos prakse evropskog suda za ljudska prava i konkretnog slučaja) ... the court considered the [applicants’] other arguments and found that they did not justify ruling otherwise in the present case...”.
in these circumstances, the court sees no grounds for the administrative detention of mr timishev.” 8.  subsequent decisions refusing institution of criminal proceedings stated alternatively that it was impossible to establish the time of the applicant’s detention because it had not been recorded in any documents, that the applicant had been detained for disobeying police orders, that he had been actually free to go after 3.15 p.m. but had asked to be taken to the nadterechnyi office to file a complaint there and the police had ensured his safe passage.the court pointed out that it had not been established why the report on the administrative office could not have been drafted at the checkpoint and why it was considered necessary to escort the applicant to goragorsk.it remained unclear what had happened to the report: the investigator had not obtained the forwarding letter or any information about the outcome of the proceedings.10.  the court was not convinced that the applicant had asked the police to take him to the nadterechnyi office to file a complaint.statements by the police officers who stated that the applicant had been “released” were also indicative of the fact that he had been taken to the nadterechnyi office against his will.
by stabbing the first in the neck, on the back of the head and the left side of his chest, the second in the left side of the stomach and the third in the back....” section 340 “(1) in addition to the instances specified in the present act, the record of witnesses’ statements ... can be read out, on the basis of a decision by a panel and only in the following circumstances: (i) if the persons questioned have died, or have been affected by a mental illness, or cannot be found, or are unable to appear in court because of old age, illness or some other weighty reason, or their appearance would involve great difficulty, or if they live abroad and fail to appear at the main hearing despite being duly summoned; (ii) if witnesses or experts refuse to testify at the main hearing without a legal justification.... (4) the reasons for reading out the record shall be indicated in the transcript of the main hearing ...” section 342 “after examining each witness or expert, and after reading each record or other written document, the presiding judge shall ask the parties and the injured person to make comments if they so wish.” section 371 “(1) a substantial violation of the provisions of criminal procedure shall be deemed to exist: ... (viii) if the judgment relies on evidence which was obtained by a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the constitution, or evidence it should not have relied on, in accordance with the provisions of the present act, or evidence which was obtained on the basis of such impermissible evidence; ... (2) a substantial violation of the provisions of criminal procedure shall also be deemed to exist if in preparation for a hearing or in the course of a hearing or in giving judgment the court omitted to apply a provision of this act or applied it incorrectly, or if in the course of the hearing the court violated the rights of the defence, which influenced or might have influenced the legality and regularity of the judgment.” 40.  section 55b, paragraph 2, of the constitutional court act (official gazette no.15/94 with relevant amendments) provides as follows: “(2) a constitutional complaint shall be accepted for consideration: - if there has been a violation of human rights or fundamental freedoms which has had serious consequences for the complainant; or - if it concerns an important constitutional question which exceeds the importance of the particular case in question.” 41.  on 26 june 1997 the slovenian parliament ratified the “treaty between slovenia and the republic of macedonia concerning legal aid in civil and criminal matters”, which entered into force on 5 september 1997. article 3 of the treaty states that legal assistance comprises, among other things, the service of legal documents and the questioning of witnesses.42.  the 1959 council of europe convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters entered into force with respect to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia on 26 october 1999 and with respect to slovenia on 17 october 2001. it provides in articles 8 and 10, respectively, as follows: article 8 “a witness or expert who has failed to answer a summons to appear, service of which has been requested, shall not, even if the summons contains a notice of penalty, be subjected to any punishment or measure of restraint, unless subsequently he voluntarily enters the territory of the requesting party and is there again duly summoned.” article 10 “1 if the requesting party considers the personal appearance of a witness or expert before its judicial authorities especially necessary, it shall so mention in its request for service of the summons and the requested party shall invite the witness or expert to appear.
9.  on 8 february 2006 the applicant company’s president, ü.t., filed a complaint with the mersin public prosecutor’s office, stating that one of the auditors in the commission, m.a.l., had told him that the fine had initially been calculated as try 500,000 and that he had reduced that amount.he noted, inter alia, that after the inspection of the audit commission, he had conducted another inspection with an official from the directorate of land registration, and had calculated that he had trespassed on the neighbouring plots by only 400 metres.13.  in the meantime, on 17 april 2006 the applicant had filed an objection with the tarsus magistrates’ court and requested a stay of execution of the fine.by a subsequent petition dated 5 june 2006, the applicant also requested the court to hold an oral hearing, to carry out an on-site examination, and to hear its witnesses in order to better evaluate the credibility of the inspection report the fine was based on.15.  the applicant objected to that decision, arguing that the fine had been unlawfully imposed on it and that the magistrates’ court had failed to adequately assess the case as it had not held a hearing.
5.  the applicant was born in 1986 in the georgian ssr of the ussr.7.  on 12 january 2012 the police stopped the applicant in the courtyard of his house and charged him with illegal residence in russia.8.  on the following day the kaluzhskiy district court in the kaluga region found the applicant guilty of the administrative offence under article 18.8 § 1 of the code of administrative offences (failure to leave russia upon the expiry of the authorised period of stay and illegal residence) and sentenced him to a fine of 2,500 russian roubles (62 euros) and administrative removal from the russian federation.9.  the applicant asked the district court to postpone the enforcement of the removal order, emphasising that it was currently unenforceable because he had no identity documents and because he was not a georgian national and could not be sent to georgia.10.  the applicant was held in the administrative detention centre operated by the kaluga regional police.
12.  in their submissions dated 18 january 2017, the government submitted that the applicant had been detained in the “custody cell” of the public security branch of the yalova police headquarters.they stated that at the material time the turkish nationals had been kept locked in one of the detention rooms and that the applicant and other foreign nationals had had access at all times to the hall in the centre of the facility − where there were chairs and a table – and to the toilets.15.  the government also submitted custody registers showing the occupation rates at the detention facility for the period between 4 november 2013 and 7 january 2014. according to those documents, the applicant was detained alone for thirty-one days and for thirty days he was detained together with between one and six foreign nationals.as regards the applicant’s complaint that the conditions of his detention at the yalova police headquarters had amounted to ill-treatment, the constitutional court noted that he had complained that his health had worsened as a result of the conditions in which he had been detained.20.  the standards of the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (“the cpt”) concerning the conditions of detention of foreign nationals (see the cpt standards, document no.
moreover, the court emphasised that the applicant posed no threat to public order, that the sentence, one third of which had already been served, was reasonably short and that the applicant’s conduct had been good throughout the criminal proceedings.relying on articles 455 and 453 of the code of criminal procedure (hereafter “the cpp” - see paragraph 34 below), the court of appeal ruled that the interruption of the applicant’s sentence was unjustified provided that his treatment could continue, under guard, in a civil hospital.in a dissenting opinion, one of the judges on the trial bench considered that the sentence should be interrupted on humanitarian grounds; consequently, having regard to the applicant’s condition, he considered that his continued detention was in breach of the proportionality principle and reduced his chances of survival.on the same day, noting the deterioration in the applicant’s general condition, a multidisciplinary team from the târgu ocna prison hospital placed a prisoner on constant standby to assist the applicant in his everyday activities.drawing on the medical files relating to the applicant’s stays in that hospital, he pointed out that on 14 march 2013 the applicant had begun the chemotherapy without having received the radiotherapy recommended by the doctors in his department.

it directed the prosecution to remedy certain defects and extended the authorised period of the applicant’s detention until 22 april 2010.by a supplementary decision taken on the following day in the absence of the applicant and his representatives, the regional court fixed the time-limit for posting bail until 11 may 2010. on 29 april 2010 that decision was sent by fax to the remand prison where the applicant was held.8.  on 12 may 2010 the district court held that the applicant must be re-detained for his failure to comply with the bail conditions.9.  on 2 june 2010 the regional court quashed the detention order, finding that the detention order had lacked a basis in fact.11.  the conditions of the applicant’s detention in remand prison iz-66/1 can be summarised as follows: (a)  cell 622, from january to june 2009, measured 30 square metres and accommodated 20 to 25 persons who took turns to sleep; windows were not glazed; the toilet was not separated from the living area; (b)  cell 129, june and july 2009, 9 square metres and 6 inmates; (c)  cell 407, july 2009, 12 square metres and 12 to 14 inmates; (d)  cell 408, august 2009 to april 2010, same as above; (e)  cell 155, april 2010, 15 square metres; (f)  cell 134, may 2010, 14 square metres for 8 inmates.
9.  on 14 september 2010 the broadcasting council found that the applicant company had breached its obligations under the broadcasting act in that the manner of processing and presenting the content of the commentary had interfered with the dignity of the late polish president, lech kaczynski.10.  the broadcasting council assessed the conflict between the applicant company’s freedom of expression and the protection of the human dignity of the late president.according to the broadcasting council, the degree of sarcasm and irony in the broadcast commentary had been so high that its content and the manner in which the author’s opinion had been presented had been sub‑standard and had dishonoured the late president.13.  the applicant company lodged a complaint before the constitutional court challenging the decisions of the broadcasting council and the supreme court under articles 6 § 1 and 10 of the convention and articles 26 (freedom of expression) and 46 (right to judicial protection) of the constitution.as to the applicant company’s complaint under article 10 of the convention (and article 26 of the constitution), the constitutional court held that a general court could not bear “secondary liability” for a violation of fundamental rights and freedoms of a substantive nature unless there had been a constitutionally relevant violation of procedural rules.
on 4 august 2009 the district court issued a detention order which did not set a time-limit for the applicant’s detention or give any assessment to the existence of a “reasonable suspicion” against the applicant.9.  further extensions of the applicant’s detention were granted by the leninskiy district court on 29 september, 20 october and 2 november 2009. the last extension order was issued in the absence of the parties.10.  on 23 december 2009 the bogdanovichi town court in the sverdlovsk region opened the trial and extended the applicant’s detention.his request to be allowed to attend the funeral was rejected by the governor of the iz-66/1 remand prison and upheld by the courts on the ground that remand prisoners did not have the benefit of a leave of absence under russian law.when his father died on 5 november 2010, the director of the correctional colony in sosnovoborsk in the krasnoyarsk region also refused his request for a short-term absence, on account of the funeral being held outside of the region where the colony was located.
7.  on 24 january 1995 the public prosecutor at the diyarbakır state security court filed a bill of indictment against the applicants (except for eyyup yaşar), charging them under section 125 of the former criminal code with carrying out activities with the aim of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory.8.  on 18 june 1999 the constitution was amended and the military judges sitting on the bench of the state security courts were replaced by civilian judges.9.  on 4 december 2001 the diyarbakır state security court convicted the applicants as charged.10.  on 20 november 2002 the court of cassation quashed the convictions.12.  on 22 february 2007 the diyarbakır assize court again convicted the applicants under section 125 of the criminal code and sentenced them to life imprisonment.
the event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at bolotnaya square which was supposed to end at 7.30 p.m. the march was peaceful and held without any disruptions, but when the marchers arrived at bolotnaya square it turned out that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting.8.  on the same day the moscow city department of the investigative committee of the russian federation opened criminal proceedings to investigate suspected acts of mass disorder and violence against the police (articles 212 § 2 and 318 § 1 of the criminal code).along with the seriousness of the charges, the court based its decision on the findings that “the reasons which had initially warranted the detention have not changed” and that “no other measures of restraint would secure the aims and goals of the judicial proceedings”.20.  on 26 september 2013 the zamoskvoretskiy district court extended the applicant’s house arrest until 2 january 2014. it referred to the seriousness of the charges and considered that as a human-rights activist the applicant could communicate with different authorities and persons and thus obstruct the course of criminal proceedings.26.  the applicant was subsequently examined by a gp on 25 september, 19 october and 26 november 2012, and 24 january, 15 and 25 february, and 15 march 2013. the examinations revealed no negative dynamics in the state of the applicant’s health; the prescriptions for the special diet were renewed each time.
5. the first applicant was the husband and the second applicant was the son of mrs özlem gürakın, who died on 3 september 2001.they were notified that they had to pay 1,683 turkish liras (try) (approximately 870 euros (eur)) in court fees within one month to continue the proceedings and that failure to do so would result in the discontinuation of the proceedings.8.  as the applicants failed to pay the court fees within the time-limit, the i̇zmir administrative court sent a further warning letter to the applicants and ordered them to pay the court fees.10.  on 20 april 2007 the izmir administrative court once again rejected the applicants’ request and granted them one month to pay the court fees.11.  on 12 july 2007 the court decided to discontinue the proceedings, because the applicants had not paid the necessary court fees.
14.  at 12.50 a.m. on 20 june 2006 investigator s. arrested the applicant as a suspect and questioned him between 1 and 1.50 a.m., and then between 11 and 11.15 a.m., in the presence of p., a state-appointed lawyer invited by investigator s. the applicant reiterated his earlier self‑incriminating statements, as well as the statements concerning his ill‑treatment at the severnyy police department.19.  in the most recent refusal of 29 september 2006 to institute criminal proceedings for lack of evidence that the officers of the severnyy police department had committed a crime, the investigator established the facts as follows, relying on the police officers’ statements.21.  on an unspecified date the applicant also complained about the unlawful actions of officers of the sovetskiy police department, explaining that he had blamed the officers of the severnyy police department for all his injuries for fear of reprisals from the officers of the sovetskiy department, in whose hands he had been at the time.22.  in the most recent refusal of 21 september 2006 to institute criminal proceedings for lack of evidence that a crime had been committed, the investigator found, relying on statements by the operative officers of the sovetskiy police department, that the applicant had been taken to the station with his consent and had confessed to the murder of i. he had also shown where he had hidden her body voluntarily, without any coercion.the court based its findings on the self‑incriminating statements given by the applicant in the preliminary investigation, noting that his allegations of ill‑treatment in police custody had been examined and dismissed by the sovetskiy and kominternovskiy district prosecutor’s offices in decisions of 21 and 29 september 2006 respectively.
listing the criminal charges against the applicant, the court stated the following: “in the light of the findings of the psychiatric forensic medical report that n. suffers from chronic paranoid schizophrenia and lacks discernment as regards the offences he committed, and having regard to the recommendations of the [reporting] committee that the preventive detention measure should be imposed on the accused, the court accedes to the [prosecution’s] request and, pursuant to article 114 cp, confirms the provisional medical detention order and informs the bucharest health department of the implementation of that order.” 17. the applicant did not attend the hearing, nor was he represented by a lawyer in court.33.  in july 2007 the competent medical board drew up a report based on the results of an examination of the applicant, the medical documentation transmitted by the psychiatric hospital, the report by his gp, a social welfare inquiry concerning the applicant conducted on 3 may 2006, the 22 april 2002 decision of bucharest district court 6 and the forensic medical report of 2 november 2001. the board found that during his detention the applicant had expressed delusions of grandeur with transient psychotic relapses, had endeavoured to conceal his symptoms, had behaved in a calm, composed manner, had accepted his treatment, had refrained from stirring up trouble with the other patients and had shown little hostility during the treatment.61.  on 12 april 2016 the ifm submitted its expert report, which stated, in particular, that: –  the applicant was suffering from chronic delusional disorder with no prospect of improvement, but rather with future aggravation of the illness due to aging; –  the illness as manifested in the applicant did not point to any risk of a danger to society, but the lack of feasible plans for the future foreshadowed future conflicts, a risk of advanced social deterioration and the impossibility of monitoring the evolution of his illness; –  the applicant lacked any social support from his family or other persons of trust.nevertheless, the director of the establishment [where the applicant is detained] must inform the social welfare services responsible for transferring [the applicant] to a specialised institution capable of providing proper living conditions and treatment.” (b) measures taken by the national administrative and hospital authorities 65.  on 6 september 2016 the director of săpoca hospital invited the directorate general of social assistance and child welfare (“dgaspc”) in bucharest district 6 to adopt welfare measures in respect of the applicant pursuant to the instructions set out in the forensic medical report of 12 april 2016.the report mentioned in particular: –  the existence of a single, strange and systematic delusionary theme concerning the creation of a “united somali state”, which delusion did not however alter his compliance with hospital rules; –  lack of conflict situations and of incidents pointing to potentially aggressive behaviour; –  proper therapeutic cooperation during detention, despite his purely formal acquiescence in the reality of his illness and need for treatment; –  absence of antisocial precedents – apart from the acts noted during his placement in detention – or consumption of psychoactive substances (drugs, alcohol); –  negative effect of the extension of detention for social reasons on the development of the applicant’s illness and physiological state, and –  the guardianship order.
it is also found that satisfactory conditions for the child cannot be created with the mother by means of assistance measures under the act relating to child welfare services, section 4-4 (e.g. relief measures in the home or other parental support measures), due to a lack of trust and a reluctance to accept interference from the authorities – taking the case history into consideration.” 35.  the high court’s conclusions in its judgment of 22 april 2010 was that a care order was necessary and that assistance measures for the mother would not be sufficient to allow the son to stay with her.moreover, the board stated: “in her statement before the county social welfare board, the mother maintained her view that the care order was a conspiracy between the child welfare service, [the parent-child institution] and the foster parents for the purpose of ‘helping a woman who is unable to have children’.both the mother and grandmother stated that it would not be a problem, ‘he just had to be distracted’, and thus gave the impression of not having sympathy with the boy and therefore also being incapable of providing the psychological care he would need in the event of a return.” 42.  in addition, the board had especially noted the conclusions of expert m.s.she had married in august of 2011, her husband had a permanent job and they had a daughter, y. it also noted that the child welfare authorities in the couple’s current municipality were conducting an ongoing inquiry concerning the mother’s ability to care for y. a staff member of the authorities in that new municipality had testified at the oral hearing, stating that they had not received any reports of concern other than that from the authorities in the first applicant’s former municipality.nothing had emerged during the city court’s consideration of the case to indicate that the first applicant had developed a more positive attitude to the child welfare authorities or to the foster mother, beyond a statement made by her to the extent that she was willing to cooperate.
20.  on 25 november 2009 the state prosecution service issued an official report (službena zabilješka) finding that the impugned words of 26 may, as well as those of 9 september 2009, which referred to the use of swords and axes, had not been addressed to either the applicant or anybody close to him, and that the incident of 15 september 2009 could not be considered a threat.it was further held that the applicant had not submitted any evidence in relation to the incident of 22 september 2009, nor had he called the police at the time to come to the scene and “collect the necessary material for further analysis” in order to verify his suspicions.in the course of the proceedings, a medical expert witness submitted that the applicant had a contusion (nagnječenje) on the left part of the back of his head, which would have been classified as a minor physical injury at the time it had been inflicted.30.  the applicant reported the following events to the police, but to no avail: (a) on 6 october 2008 an unknown person had thrown a brick and broken one of the windows of his apartment; (b) on 11 september 2009 s and her husband, z, had tried to hit the applicant’s parked car with their own car; this was confirmed by another neighbour, n.l., who witnessed this event and was interviewed by the police in october 2009 (see paragraph 16 above); (c) on 16 october 2009 s had asked y aloud if he was going to “slaughter” somebody, and he had answered that he was, both of them looking at the applicant; s had said that he would “make [his] car dirty with that man”; (d) on 19 december 2009 an unknown person had fired several shots in front of the applicant’s apartment, below the children’s bedroom; the applicant gave the police eight bullet shells that he had found on the ground; (e) on 1 january 2010, shortly after midnight, x had thrown firecrackers at the applicant’s car and broken its windscreen; he had also thrown a glass bottle at the applicant and a metal bar at his son, swearing profusely and threatening to slaughter them all; this had been followed by gunshots.on 12 august 2010 the applicant filed a private criminal action (optužni predlog) against x, who was acquitted by the court of first instance on 7 june 2011. the court found that x had indeed said the impugned words in front of a witness, and that the words could have made the applicant feel frightened and insecure, but the court could not accept “that [the applicant] had taken those words seriously, especially since the witness, who was the only one who had heard the words, had not taken them seriously, which was why he had informed the applicant about them only two months later”.
5.  on 10 november 2005 the second applicant initiated administrative proceedings in order to obtain recognition of the veteran status of his late father.his request was rejected on 12 december 2005. the second applicant appealed on an unknown date in december 2005 or january 2006.7.  on 21 january 2008 the sarajevo cantonal court quashed the decisions of 12 december 2005 and 26 january 2006, and remitted the case to the first-instance body.the last decision was given by the sarajevo cantonal court on 25 september 2012. it was served on the second applicant on 23 october 2012.8.  in the meantime, on 10 october 2012, the constitutional court found a breach of the second applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time.
9.  in 1992 the slovenian government issued the ordinance on the payment of advances on military pensions (see paragraph 28 below, hereinafter “the ordinance”) which regulated, on a temporary basis, the payment of military pensions to former ypa military personnel residing in the republic of slovenia who had applied for or fulfilled the conditions for retirement under the rules governing the pension and disability insurance of military personnel (hereinafter “the sfry military rules”) by 18 october 1991, the date of withdrawal of the ypa from slovenia (see p.p.10. in 1994 the federal republic of yugoslavia (succeeded in 2006 by serbia) transformed the ypa fund (see paragraph 7 above) into the social insurance fund of military personnel of the federal republic of yugoslavia on the basis of the yugoslav army act.11.  at the inter-state level, however, the question of responsibility for the payment of pensions to military personnel who had acquired or applied for pensions with the ypa fund under the rules governing the pension and disability insurance of military personnel (hereinafter “the sfry military rules”) remained unresolved until the agreement on succession issues entered into force in 2004 (see paragraph 30 below).his advance was suspended as of 31 october 1998. the institute decided that since the applicant had been in active military service in the ypa from 25 june to 18 july 1991 and from 18 july 1991 had been on leave, he did not fulfil the statutory conditions for converting the advance on his military old-age pension into an old-age pension under section 2(1)(4) of the 1998 act.it held that in the period at issue the applicant had not met the requirements of any of the categories of beneficiaries under section 2 of the 1998 act, having applied for the pension under the sfry military rules on 16 july 1991 and having only acquired slovenian citizenship on 1 april 2003.
the court delivered to the accused the audio-recordings and the transcripts from the hearings they had not attended in order to allow them to agree with their defence attorneys on their defence strategy.” 7.  in the context of that trial, the court of bosnia and herzegovina (“the state court”) summoned the applicant, who belonged to the same religious community, to appear as a witness on 10 september 2012. he appeared, as summoned, but refused to remove his skullcap, notwithstanding an order from the president of the trial chamber to do so.in view of that, the court has acquainted the witness with the provisions of rule 20 of the house rules of the judicial institutions of bosnia and herzegovina and the obligations of the parties in the judicial institutions, which ban visitors from entering these buildings in clothing that is not in accordance with the generally accepted dress codes within the professional environment of the judicial institutions.42.  accordingly, as concerns the issue of whether the state court, in adopting the challenged ruling, acted in accordance with the law, the constitutional court observes that the provision of article 242 § 3 of the code of criminal procedure provides that the judge or the presiding judge may order that a party to the proceedings who disrupts order in a courtroom or disobeys court orders be removed from the courtroom and be fined in an amount of up to bam 10,000. the constitutional court also observes that the cited provision, on which the state court relied, does not prescribe a list of all types of conduct which may be regarded as disruption of order in a courtroom, but rather each court, in the circumstances of a given case, decides whether some type of conduct may be considered disruptive or not, which falls within the scope of that court’s margin of discretion (see the constitutional court decision no.considering the position of the european court that in democratic societies in which several religions coexist (as is the case of bosnia and herzegovina) it may be necessary to place restrictions on the freedom of religion (kokkinakis, cited above), in the context of the obligation of an independent judicial institution to support the values that bring people closer, and not those that separate them, the constitutional court holds that the restriction in the present case, which was of a temporary nature, aspired to achieve legitimate aims.46.  finally, as to the question whether the decision was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve one of the legitimate aims under article 9 of the european convention, the constitutional court reiterates that, according to the settled case-law of the european court, the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the existence and extent of the need for interference, but this margin is subject to european supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts (dahlab, cited above).
25.  on 21 december 2006 the urus-martan town court considered the substance of the case and concluded that the evidence submitted by the applicant and adduced during the pending criminal investigation had failed to establish conclusively the implication of state agents in the crime.(a)  destruction of the applicant’s lorry 29.  in the evening of 14 october 2000 the applicant, his wife and aunt travelled in the applicant’s kamaz 53-20 lorry from the village of starye atagi to the chiri-yurt district of grozny, chechnya.37.  on 8 may 2008 the grozny district court refused to consider the applicant’s complaint concerning the ineffectiveness of the investigation, since on 1 may 2008 the latest decision to adjourn the investigation had been quashed.the supreme court pointed out that the case-file material in respect of the pending criminal case, the applicant’s submissions and the evidence produced all pointed to the ministry of defence as the possible tortfeasor.it considered that the district court had failed to elucidate the circumstances of the events in question and to inform the ministry of defence of the hearing of 15 november 2006.
15.  subsequent to the broadcast on 24 september 2008 of the television programme, on 27 october 2008 copenhagen university hospital and s instituted defamation proceedings before the copenhagen city court (københavns byret) against the director of dr and the two applicants, maintaining that the latter, in the programme in question, had made direct and indirect accusations, covered by article 267 of the penal code (straffeloven), against copenhagen university hospital and s, of malpractice regarding certain patients suffering from pleural mesothelioma cancer, allegedly resulting in the patients’ unnecessary death and shortening of life, in the interest of s’s professional prestige and private finances.therefore no trial had been performed of vinorelbine ... he had provided the information included in professor m’s memorandum of 23 september 2008 ...he had talked to [the first applicant] several times and had spent a lot of time and energy on explaining cancer therapy... he had also lost confidence in [the first applicant]...” h stated, among other things: “ ...the approval of alimta by the danish medicines agency for the treatment of mesothelioma only means that a marketing authorisation has been granted for the drug, which means that advertisement of the product is permitted.since no account was given in the programme of the above-mentioned trials and approval process and the terminology applied for that process, the court finds that it would seem to a non-professional viewer that alimta was the only effective drug for mesothelioma, particularly because the programme linked the treatment of two patients with vinorelbine to their death, whereas the prospect of several more years to live was held out to the one patient who had been given alimta therapy in germany.the narrator says, inter alia: ‘tj, who was part of s’s tests with vinorelbine, died on 4 january 2008.’ with these statements, [the applicants] not only passed on assertions by patients, relatives and experts, but also took a stand, so that the programme undisputedly gave the viewers the impression that malpractice has occurred at copenhagen university hospital, in that s has deliberately used medication (vinorelbine), which is not approved for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer, and whose effect has not been substantiated, that the medication in question was part of a test, and that the test medication has resulted in patients dying or having their lives shortened.on the basis of the information in the case, including the research material that the applicants possessed before the broadcast of the programme, in particular the emails from [the medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany and the professor from switzerland], the replies by the minister for internal affairs and health to various questions [posed by members of parliament], and the memorandum of 11 june 2008 produced by copenhagen university hospital [about pleural mesothelioma cancer], it can be established that vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin was standard treatment at copenhagen university hospital, that the european union on 20 september 2004 approved the marketing of alimta in connection with cisplatin for treatment of inoperable patients with pleural mesothelioma cancer, that there was no substantiation or basis for believing that an alimta-based treatment was more efficient than the treatment offered by copenhagen university hospital, that some patients at copenhagen university hospital, who were already about to receive vinorelbine as standard treatment, were chosen and offered the same medicine as part of a test [it is not known for what], and that s did not make any private financial profit from these tests.
one is in .mpg format and bears a time stamp according to which it was last modified at 5.36 p.m. on 17 september ‎2015; and the other is in .mp4 format and bears a time stamp according to which it was last modified at 3.27 p.m. on 15 december 2015. the footage in both files is identical, except that: (a) the faces of the applicants in the first one have been pixelated (whereas in the second they have not); (b) the running time of the first video is one minute and twenty-one seconds (whereas that of the second is one minute and thirty-two seconds, as it continues for another ten seconds); and (c) in the first file the footage is horizontal whereas in the second it is rotated to the right at a ninety-degree angle.18.  in a letter to the government agent, an official from the migration directorate of the ministry of internal affairs in sofia, having compared the video footage with the photographs in the applicants’ migration files, stated that he could confirm that the applicants were indeed the people featured in the video.when hearing that the applicants had not had anything to eat or drink since their arrest, the nurse who came with the ambulance argued with the guards and took the second applicant and her youngest child, the fifth applicant, to a hospital in vidin, where the second applicant was examined by a gynaecologist between 8.05 p.m. and 8.35 p.m., and the fifth applicant was examined by a paediatrician between 8.20 p.m. and 8.40 p.m. two or three hours later they were taken back to the detention facility.in support of their assertion, the government submitted a table setting out the prescribed daily rations for adult and minor detained migrants and a report, drawn up by the head of the bregovo border police department on 1 september 2015, which listed the names of all migrants – including the applicants – which had been detained in the department’s detention facility in vidin during the month of august 2015 and provided with food there.31.  in the meantime, the applicants made their way to switzerland, where they likewise sought international protection on 8 september 2015. on 8 january 2016 the swiss authorities decided not to examine their applications but rather to transfer them back to bulgaria under regulation (eu) no 604/2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member state responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the member states by a third‑country national or a stateless person (“the dublin iii regulation”), which also applies to switzerland (see a.s. v. switzerland, no.

8.  on 31 may 2005 the the second-instance administrative-procedure commission in the area of denationalisation (комисија за решавање во управна постапка во втор степен од областа на денационализацијата – “the second-instance commission”) dismissed the applicants’ appeal finding no grounds to depart from the established facts and the reasons given by the restitution commission.relying on section 10 of the restitution act (see paragraph 15 below), the second-instance commission held that the land in question was of public interest (јавен интерес) and could not be restored to the applicants’ possession, but that compensation should be awarded instead.10.  on 7 february 2008 the administrative court, which had in the meantime become competent to decide administrative-dispute claims, dismissed the applicants’ claim and upheld the findings of the administrative authorities.relying on an on-site inspection of 13 may 2002 and a certificate of 15 september 2002 issued by the competent ministry, it established that the plot in question was located within the boundaries of the campsite; that it had been designated as a public green zone and that pedestrian paths and other similar infrastructure were planned for construction.12.  an appeal by the applicants of 7 april 2004 was dismissed by the second-instance commission on 15 november 2005. the latter held that, inter alia, the findings of the restitution commission had been based on section 10 of the restitution act.
11.  on the basis of an international arrest warrant issued by the mitrovica district court (kosovo) on 26 november 2010 and 6 may 2011, the applicant was apprehended and taken into detention pending extradition by a decision of the vienna regional criminal court (straflandesgericht wien – hereinafter “the criminal court”) of 15 january 2016. on 20 january 2016 the ministry of justice of kosovo requested the applicant’s extradition.concerning the conditions of detention, the court held that the report on kosovo by the committee for the prevention of torture (hereinafter “the cpt”) of 2011 (see paragraph 30 below) did not state that ill-treatment was the rule in kosovo prisons, but that there were merely sporadic incidents of violence.in relation to the material conditions of detention in mitrovica detention centre, where the applicant alleged he would most likely be held if extradited, the court of appeal again quoted the above-mentioned cpt report of 2011, where it was found that inmates were able to move freely within that facility during the day and could exercise outside on a daily basis for three and a half hours, and that fitness and computer rooms have recently been installed.in relation to the alleged violations of articles 2 and 3 of the convention in the event of his extradition, the supreme court found that mere allegations referencing general reports on the human rights situation were not capable of substantiating a real and immediate risk to the applicant under these provisions.lastly, the court of appeal found that despite not being a state party to the convention or the council of europe, article 22 of the constitution of kosovo granted the convention direct effect under and superiority to national law, therefore domestic law equally offered protection from violations of the convention.
in an explanatory note sent to the head of the institute in relation to that check-up the psychologist who had carried out the assessment explained that during his interview with the applicant he had informed the latter of the results of the assessment in a “clement manner”, and that the applicant had been able to pose questions and to comment.14.  an initial refusal to allow him access to the file, signed by the head of the ministry’s human-resources department and dated 2 april 2003, was quashed on 17 november 2003 by the sofia city court, as it had not been ordered by the competent body, namely the minister of the interior.he relied in general terms on the provisions of section 34(3) of the protection of personal data act and section 182(7) of the ministry of the interior act, as in force at the time (see paragraphs 22 and 25 below).16.  this refusal was quashed by a three-member panel of the supreme administrative court on 29 july 2005, on the grounds that it had not been reasoned, as it had merely referred to the provisions restricting access to personal data without explaining how they had been relevant to the circumstances of the case and without accounting for the applicant’s own right to access to data concerning him.he argued that the minister of the interior had not duly taken into account his right to access to information, that there were no legal grounds to consider the information referred to in the decision as classified, and that in any event, seeing that the applicant had left the ministry in 2002 and that the relevant time-limits for keeping classified documents representing official secrets had expired, any such documents in his file had had in the meantime to be declassified.

to refer the patient for outpatient treatment was not appropriate and sufficient from a clinical viewpoint in so far as, in order to prevent a recurrence of the colitis caused by clostridium difficile ..., the patient should have remained in hospital under close medical supervision ... ... hence, the doctor in question did not act with the necessary care and diligence, thereby incurring disciplinary liability on account of his negligent conduct in the medical assistance provided ... in d. ward of the chvng’s medical department between 25 january and 3 february 1998. the medical opinions make no criticisms of the assistance provided in the gastroenterology department of santo antónio general hospital in oporto ...” 48.  in the light of this report the inspector general made an order on 26 july 2006 for the opening of disciplinary proceedings against dr j.v.57.  the disciplinary council observed the following: (i)  meningitis was a complication that could arise in between 0.6% and 1% of cases following a nasal polypectomy; the figures were liable to be higher for a repeat operation, as in the case in question; (ii)  the applicant’s husband had received appropriate treatment during his various hospital stays; (iii)  the patient’s bacterial meningitis (pseudomonas) had been treated properly; (iv)  although the infectious-diseases panel had suggested that the presence of a specialist in that discipline might have enabled a diagnosis to be made sooner, this had not been a decisive factor in the development of the clinical situation; (v)  the perforation of the duodenal ulcer had been the cause of the peritonitis.in fact, it resulted from acute anaemia caused by intestinal bleeding from a duodenal ulcer; ... the decisions to discharge the patient on 13 and 23 december 1997 were appropriate, given that, in the former case, the problem of bacterial meningitis had been resolved, [the patient] had completed the course of antibiotics, he no longer had any symptoms or fever, had a slightly increased white-blood cell count, a falling neutrophil count and normal sedimentation rate, and was not complaining ... and, in the latter case, that is to say, the patient’s hospitalisation from 18 to 23 december 1997, the patient was not complaining of abdominal pain, diarrhoea or bleeding ... with the result that it was possible to continue treating his ulcer with a dietary regime while monitoring him on an outpatient basis ... when the patient was admitted to santo antónio hospital, laboratory tests were carried out for clostridium difficile.74.  during the three hearings the court heard evidence from the following witnesses: (i)  eleven doctors who had been involved in treating the applicant’s husband during his various stays in the chvng and santo antónio hospital; (ii)  the general practitioner of the applicant’s husband; (iii)  two doctors who were friends of the family; (iv)  the inspector who had written the final report on completion of the investigation within the igs; and (v)  the medical experts in gastroenterology and internal medicine whose reports had formed the basis for the last igs decision.... on 6 march 1998 ... nothing had made it possible to predict the gastroduodenal perforation ... the tests carried out that day ... did not confirm the existence of any duodenal perforation such that the situation had to be kept under review; ... it was not until 7 march 1998 that the patient’s acute abdominal syndrome was diagnosed, calling for urgent surgery ... it was only during the operation that the patient was found to be suffering from a duodenal perforation; ... the perforation had occurred 24 hours before surgery.” 77.  the judgment concluded as follows: “ ... in view of the facts that have been established, it is not possible to determine at what point the defendants, by their actions or omissions, breached the rules of good medical practice ... it is considered established that [mr fernandes’s] death was caused by sepsis due to peritonitis resulting from the perforation of his duodenal ulcer... no doubts persisted regarding the diagnosis of meningitis, the procedure adopted, the sequence of treatment and the resolution of the problem, as all the various after‑effects were duly explained.
6.  on 25 october 2002 the military court of the vladikavkaz garrison (“the military court”) ordered, inter alia, the head of the respondent military institute to re-calculate the period of the applicant’s service, applying the favourable terms of such calculation for a specified period of service.9.  on 19 september 2003 the enforcement proceedings were terminated and the writ of execution was returned to the applicant, as the debt could not be recovered.12.  on 18 may 2005 the writ was returned to the applicant on the ground that the judgment obliged an official of an organisation to take certain actions rather than ordered to recover payments from a budgetary organisation.the bailiffs explained that for the applicant to be able to receive the payments under the judgment, he should obtain a writ of execution stating the sum of the debt to be recovered.463, the defendant military institute calculated the amounts due to the applicant as follows: the compensation for the supplementary ration for the period from october 1998 until march 2000 –11,341.85 russian roubles (rub); allowance for special regime of the service in 1998-2002 – rub 2,720.1; and special allowance – rub 327,000. in total: rub 341,061.95.
the government submitted that the first applicant had been placed in division 6 following an order from the head of security at the prison, and that, according to documents submitted to the court, on 1 august 2007 the applicant had been given the option to move to a less secure division, but had refused.in particular he noted that, cumulatively, he had been held in the correctional facility since 13 july 2009 and, since that date, had been forced to live in a cell subject to the following hardships: without adequate drinking water; without clothing to keep him warm throughout winter; being dependent on charitable institutions to obtain clothing; the cell contained a significant quantity of asbestos that was causing him physical harm; the cell was infested with rats and cockroaches; the corradino correctional facility lacked adequate sanitary facilities; the cell only had one small window which could not be opened as it was too high up; during winter he was only given one thin blanket although the facility was cold and it was therefore difficult to sleep; all detainees were allowed to smoke wherever and whenever they wanted and, as a consequence, inmates who, like the applicant, are non-smokers, were being subjected to passive smoking; these conditions amounted to a breach of article 3 of the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and article 36 of the constitution of malta.as regards the structural complaints submitted by the second applicant, the maintenance official submitted the following evidence in summarised form: 36.  the division in which the complainant was held consists of sixty cells, one of which is not currently in use; complainant is housed in a cell on his own; his particular cell is a normal one with a standard window and adequate light – being built the way it is for security reasons – and the lighting in the cell is appropriate; when the cells are open, inmates may freely walk in and out of them whenever they want, except when “under report” (that is to say confined to quarters); the complainant had access to open spaces from 2.00 p.m. to 5.00 p.m. just like all other inmates and when so authorised; the correctional facility conducts a yearly analysis of the water supply to check that it is fit for human consumption, and the most recent report (that of 2015), conducted by a private laboratory, concluded that the water supply is good for drinking and meets the standard for human consumption; the facility provides potable water from the mains for the inmates and that water is supplied free of charge; inmates are allowed to buy bottled water; when inmates enter the facility they are given blankets, sheets, pillows and a mattress; upon request, they are also given extra blankets, however, the complainant had never registered any such request; as regards any infestation of rats and cockroaches, the maintenance official presented a report submitted by a private company on these issues (such inspection is carried out yearly) stating that three rodent control visits were carried out in 2014 and the last visit showed that “everything was under control”.furthermore, upon examining the medical records presented in the case file of the proceedings, no medical or physical deterioration was recorded in the health of the complainant as a result of the passive smoking analysed herein 43.  cell window and consequent availability of adequate light: the cell at issue is a normal division cell furnished with a standard window and occupied only by the complainant.according to the government the third applicant had covered one of the wall vents with a sheet of paper, thereby restricting the amount of ventilation, and the aperture in the cell door had been covered with a piece of cardboard from inside the cell.
15.  according to the government the applicant was admitted to the medical infirmary of the prison at 4.15 p.m. on 12 july 2013 and a referral to the emergency department of the state hospital was made at 5 p.m. the referral note issued by the doctor indicated that the applicant had swelling in the face, a bruise on one loin, and severe swelling with limited movement in his right ankle.according to the case summary the ankle x‑ray revealed a fracture and there was subluxation of the right foot; there was a head injury, specifically a fracture of the orbit and of the maxillary sinus; there were no signs of injury or fluid collection in the internal organs; an ophthalmic review had been carried out and the patient had been discharged from that department as well as from the orthopaedic ward where he had undergone tests and treatment for his bone injuries.the applicant was finally transferred to division 3 on 22 october 2013. according to the government, the applicant had never been kept in solitary confinement, nor had the inmate involved in the argument with the applicant been accommodated in any of the above-mentioned divisions while the applicant was there, except for a short stay in division 6.the applicant was also referred to the ophthalmology department on 5 august 2013. further referrals to hospital were made by the prison medical doctor, but the government claimed they were unrelated to the injuries suffered as a result of the incident on 12 july 2013. one such referral was made on 13 june 2014. an outpatient service appointment record given to the applicant listed appointments scheduled for 18 november 2014 and 6 february 2014 at the medical outpatients’ clinic, which the applicant also attended.25.  from the records of the correspondence sent by the applicant held at the prison authorities and submitted by the government, it is apparent that the applicant sent registered letters to the court on 12 february, 1 april and 3 june 2014 and an unregistered letter on 6 may 2015. no further requests were made by the applicant to send any communication to the court, although letters were sent by the applicant to other addresses on 3 september, 22 september and 7 october 2015, and on 4 february and 6 march 2016.
in support of his account, the applicant submitted copies of his identity card, a court summons of 9 july 2009 and a judgment of 21 july 2009. he explained that the judgment had been sent to his home and that a neighbour had given it to him prior to his departure.moreover, the alleged conduct of the iranian authorities in sending a court summons to the applicant’s home after his escape, rather than going there to arrest him on the spot, was not credible, nor was his submission that the judgment of 21 july 2009 had been sent to his home and given to a neighbour prior to his departure.they also doubted that the applicant’s conversion was genuine and lasting, noting, in particular, that it had occurred after the applicant’s first asylum application had been rejected, that the baptism had taken place in a house church rather than a church recognised by the state, and that the applicant did not base his conversion on the key aspects of christianity, but on the personal relationships he had formed with members of his church community.it considered that a person could only face a real risk of ill-treatment upon return to iran if that person’s christian faith had been manifested in switzerland in such a way as to make it visible to the outside and if it could be assumed that his or her family and acquaintances in iran would learn about that active manifestation of faith, even if it was short of proselytising.he relied on the risks presented by the iranian authorities and non-state actors on account of his conversion and active membership of a christian community in switzerland, as well as his participation in a demonstration in berne in august 2015 against human rights violations and the persecution of christians by the iranian authorities.
in particular, it was important to clarify whether the officer had seen the victim in the state of strangulation, what was the body’s position, where the “noose” had been and who had removed it, and (ii) it was necessary to interview v. who allegedly heard the victim screaming, to interview the victim’s next of kin in relation to the circumstances in which the victim had been apprehended and taken to the police station, and in particular to interview the victim’s wife, who had allegedly seen signs of bleeding around the victim’s wrists resulting from the use of handcuffs.mr v. stated that around 8 p.m. he had been kept in one of the rooms on the fifth floor; he had heard the victim in a neighbouring room speaking indistinctly; there had been no screaming or any suspicious noise ... in view of the above, all possible investigative measures have been completed ... it is not possible to carry out expert examination of samples collected from the balcony or the jacket because [they] were lost ... according to an additional medical report by an expert, a strangulation mark is produced by the pressure of some kind of “noose” on the neck; one can speak about the pressure by a soft “noose”, for instance made by a jacket such as the one given to the expert; in normal circumstances a gas mask the size of a person’s head would not exert excessive pressure on the neck and would not leave a strangulation mark ... according to a further expert report dated 13 september 2010, the absence of macroscopic indications of mechanical asphyxiation in the available material means the cause of death cannot be determined, in particular whether it could have resulted from asphyxia following a hanging or the blocking of the airflow by an object ... furthermore, there were four forensic reports dated 14 december 2002, 17 january 2003, 4 december 2003 and 5 december 2004. none of them indicated any other bodily injuries.this conclusion is based on the facts established in the present case, irrespective of the prosecutor’s office’s findings regarding the place where the body was discovered; the circumstances relating to his presence in the police station (that is his being taken there for questioning as a witness) remain unchanged ... the court therefore finds it established that on 13 september 2002 mr khayrullin sustained injuries in the police station, entailing his death ... the court considers that the grave consequences (mr khayrullin’s death) ensued as a result of unlawful actions on the part of public officials at the police station ... as stated by the european court in the case of sheydayev v. russia (application no.where a person was placed in custody in good health and had injuries when released, the national authorities must provide a plausible explanation for the injuries ... the court accepts the claimant’s argument that the harm was caused by unlawful actions on the part of public officials at the police station ... thus, the court finds it appropriate to grant the claim in respect of non-pecuniary damage ... the matters relating to the unlawful arrest and the ineffective investigation cannot form a basis for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage ... the court has not established that the mere arrest of mr khayrullin on 13 september 2002 entailed a violation of the claimant’s non-material rights or interests; any eventual violation might relate to mr khayrullin ... the court considers that the suspension and resumption of the criminal investigation are legitimate procedural actions and thus, even if multiple, do not entail a conclusion of unlawfulness on the part of public officials ... the prosecution period for the offence under article 286 of the criminal code has not yet expired.the appellate court held as follows: “when granting the claims in relation to the injuries sustained by the victim, the trial court rightly proceeded from the understanding that the injuries had been sustained in the police station on 13 september 2002 because the case file materials confirmed that public officials had committed actions exceeding their powers ... thus, as a result of actions on the part of public officials, the claimant had sustained psychological suffering on account of the death of a person close to her ... when dismissing the remainder of the claim, the trial court rightly proceeded from the understanding that there was no evidence that the claimant had sustained psychological suffering on account of the ineffective investigation ... the investigation is ongoing; at present there is no criminal court judgment in respect of the officials at the police station.
23.  on 18 may 2004 the applicant’s mother lodged a complaint with the inspector general’s service of the ministry of the interior (generalni inspektorat ministarstva unutrašnjih poslova), alleging that her son had been tortured by members of the special anti-terrorist unit and police officers working for the narcotics department of the criminal police directorate (odeljenje za suzbijanje narkomanije uprave kriminalističke policije, also known as the fourth department) in belgrade.29.  on 28 september 2006 the chief of the fourth department of the criminal police directorate in belgrade (načelnik četvrtog odeljenja ukp sup), z.k., gave a statement to the sector for the internal control of the police.32.  on 20 july 2007 the prosecutor’s office opened an official inquiry with requests for the police to provide evidence and the names of those involved in the applicant’s arrest and questioning, and an investigative judge to question the applicant.on 23 july 2013 his constitutional appeal was rejected by the constitutional court, whose decision was served on the applicant on 11 september 2013. the court primarily considered the applicant’s complaints under article 6 of the convention and found them to be manifestly ill-founded.in respect of the other complaints, the constitutional court held, inter alia, that: “it is not enough to allege a violation of one’s rights in a constitutional appeal or list the constitutional rights that are considered to be violated and reasons for their violations based on the appellant’s subjective estimation or evaluation, but to put each mentioned reason into a direct relationship with the allegedly violated constitutional right, and a violation or denial of a certain constitutional right has to be caused by an act or action that occurred before the entry into force of the constitution.
6.  the applicant was kept in solnechnogorsk police’s temporary detention centre in overcrowded cells from 2 to 10 october 2003; 20 to 24 october 2003; 17 to 21 november 2003; 21 to 28 november 2003; 22 to 29 december 2003; 26 to 30 january 2004; 2 and 3 february 2004; 31 march to 2 april 2004 and then on several occasions between april and 22 july 2004. he had to relieve himself in a bucket in the presence of other detainees and it was very difficult to breathe in the cells.7.  the applicant made numerous journeys in 2003-2004 between volokolamsk remand centre and the temporary detention centre in solnechnogorsk, which took three to four hours in an overcrowded van, which was cold in the winter and stuffy in the summer.15.  in december 1992 the municipality allowed the applicant and his son, a minor at the time, to obtain ownership of the flat in solnechnogorsk in which they were living by way of privatisation.16.  after reaching the age of majority, the son sued the father, asserting his right to the flat and seeking an annulment of the above-mentioned certificate.18.  the applicant sought to prove that at the material time the plaintiff had lived in a flat in another town, taganrog, and tried to obtain certificates of his moving in and out of the privatised flat.
6.  on 8 february 2013, after two remittals the first instance court in novi sad, specifically its detached section in bečej, ruled partly in favour of the plaintiffs, ordering their employer to pay each of them specified sums in respect of salary arrears.7.  on 15 april 2013 the court of appeal in novi sad reversed a part of the above judgment, while upholding the remainder.8.  on 29 january 2014 the supreme court dismissed the plaintiffs’ appeal on points of law as the value of their respective claims was below the statutory threshold allowing for this remedy.9.  on 9 april 2013 the plaintiffs lodged the constitutional appeal, complaining of a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time in the impugned proceedings.by its decision of 9 december 2015, the constitutional court found a violation of their right to a hearing within a reasonable time and awarded each of them eur 800 in respect of the non‑pecuniary damage suffered.
after having explained in detail the composition and acts of a criminal organisation, the public prosecutor indicated that the applicant was a member of another organisation, which had threatened and extracted money from i̇.y., a member of the first one.17.  at the second hearing, held on 6 december 2001, the applicant stated before the court that the indictment had not been served on him and that he had not fully understood the charges against him.he stated that the telephones of two of the accused had been intercepted and that the conversations between them and with the applicant had revealed that the latter had threatened i̇.y.21.  at the hearing on 3 september 2002 the istanbul state security court rejected the request, finding that the examination of the witnesses called by the applicant would have no effect on the outcome of the proceedings.22.  the applicant appealed against the judgment, arguing that the court had failed to hear any witnesses on his behalf and that it had restricted his right to defend himself during the course of the proceedings, in that it had not taken account of any of his submissions.
11.  at the request of the applicant, on 5 may 2008 the board of forensic experts of the ministry of justice – having examined him – drew up a medical report (“the 5 may 2008 medical report”), which diagnosed the applicant as suffering from the following: arteritis, occlusion of the arteries in the right shin, stenosis of the arteries in the left shin, artery deficiency in the right lower limb (at stage iv of the disease), necrosis of tissue in the right big toe, cardiac ischaemia, second-degree angina pectoris, second‑degree arterial hypertension, second-degree cardiac insufficiency, and low‑activity chronic hepatitis c. the experts concluded that from a cardiological point of view the applicant’s condition was potentially serious.on the basis of the results of the test the examining doctor concluded that the microcirculation in the lower limbs of the applicant (particularly in the right foot) was very low.19.  on the basis of the 5 may 2008 medical report (see paragraph 11 above), and in view of the fact that his treatment at the prison hospital was producing no results, on 14 may 2008 the applicant applied to the tbilisi city court for his sentence to be suspended on health grounds (under article 607 § 1 (a) of the code of criminal procedure – “the ccp”).21.  on 18 june 2008 the applicant’s lawyer submitted to the court his comments on the record of the hearing of 11 june 2008. the record of the hearing, according to those comments, did not refer to the expert’s opinion in respect of the risk to the applicant’s life.with regard to his arteries, the applicant suffered from buerger’s disease, occlusion of the arteries in the right tibia, stenosis of the arteries in the left tibia, chronic arterial deficiency in the right lower limb at the fourth stage of the disease and gangrene of the tissue in the right big toe.
the relevant extract reads: “‘it is a matter of honour for the general prosecutor’s office and the state tax administration to bring the story of slovyanskyy bank to its logical conclusion,’ said the president of ukraine during his speech at the session ... he stated that the chairs of the bank had turned it into a source of uncontrolled personal income.12.  on 11 january 2001 the nbu issued a resolution “on the liquidation of slovyanskyy commercial joint-stock bank” by which, among other things, (1) the applicant bank’s operating licence was revoked in full; (2) the powers of the board, the council and the general shareholders’ meetings were terminated; and (3) the applicant bank was ordered to be liquidated.by the same resolution the nbu approved the composition of a liquidation commission for the bank, consisting of eleven officials from the regional departments of the nbu and two members of staff from the local tax office.13.  on 5 march 2001 the first applicant, who was in detention at the time, brought a claim under the rules of chapter 31-a of the code of civil procedure of 1963 with the pechersky district court of kyiv, challenging the nbu’s decision.given that a shareholder is not entitled to apply to a court for the examination of such a dispute and that this case is not to be examined in accordance with civil procedure, the decisions adopted in this case should be quashed and the proceedings should be terminated, in accordance with article 136 § 2 (1) and article 227 § 1 of the code of civil procedure ...” 19.  the liquidation process of the applicant bank was completed on 30 november 2012. the bank was removed from the legal entities official database on 4 august 2014.
it found that the centre had offered the applicant another position but that she had rejected this proposal, and that a more experienced person had been appointed as the head of the centre.following an appeal by the applicant, on 7 december 2006 the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal upheld the decision of 24 october 2006. the applicant lodged a further appeal, and on 22 august 2007 the supreme court of ukraine quashed these decisions and remitted the case to the first-instance court for fresh consideration.8.  accordingly, the applicant instituted administrative proceedings before the melitopolskyy court, which, on 21 february 2008, again found against her for reasons similar to those listed in its decision of 24 october 2006. the applicant appealed, and on 16 july 2008 the dnipropetrovsk administrative court of appeal quashed this decision and terminated the proceedings on the grounds that it fell to be examined under the civil justice procedure as the applicant was not a public servant.on 14 april 2011 the same court rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal to the supreme court of ukraine against the decision of 2 march 2011.on 4 august 2011 the melitopolskyy court refused to examine the merits of the applicant’s civil claim as the applicant had sought to have adjourned previous court hearings in respect of her case on numerous occasions without good reason.
according to the search report, signed by the applicant and by her appointed lawyer without any objections, the search started at 6.15 a.m. and lasted until 2 p.m. 8.  immediately after the search and in accordance with the provisions of articles 265-266 of the romanian criminal code of procedure (hereinafter rccp, see paragraph 33 below), namely on the basis of an order to appear before the investigation body, the applicant was taken by police officers to the bucharest police headquarters.10.  the order to appear had been issued by the prosecutor on 3 december 2014. it mentioned that “in the interests of the investigation ongoing in the above-mentioned criminal file [number] concerning money laundering and fiscal fraud, the questioning of [the applicant’s name and identification data] in her capacity of suspect is necessary.the criminal investigation bodies (...) will bring the suspect to the police headquarters on 4 december 2014 for the purpose of making a statement [before the investigating authorities].” 11.  the documents on file show that between 8.40 a.m. on 4 december 2014 and 3 a.m. the next day, the investigating authorities, namely five prosecutors and six judicial police officers, conducted interviews in respect of fourteen witnesses and twenty-five suspects and/or defendants in connection with the criminal investigation involving the applicant.12.  according to the register kept by the police to record third parties entering the police station on a daily basis, the applicant’s appointed lawyer, mr r.-m.s., entered the premises of the police headquarters at 4.10 p.m. the applicant contended that up until that time, her lawyer had been prevented from joining her because he had not submitted a written mandate proving that he lawfully represented her (see also paragraph 22 in fine, below).22.  in the second complaint it is claimed that on 4 december 2014, as of 12.00 p.m. when the search of her home ended, the applicant’s liberty to move around was restricted, as proved by the fact that she had been accompanied by police officers not only to the police station but also to the hospital, where she had been taken under escort to obtain medical assistance.
15.  on 5 august 2011 the prosecutor’s office started court proceedings and asked the domestic courts to revoke the recommendation to grant the first applicant building permission; to annul the building permit and oblige the applicants to demolish the building at the expense of the established guilty parties, that is the applicants, the molėtai municipality, and the utena environmental protection department.the applicants claimed that the appellate court had breached the principle of lex retro non agit by assessing the documents, issued in 2005, in view of the ruling of the constitutional court of 2006. they also claimed that the appellate court had breached their legitimate expectations to execute their proprietary interests in accordance with the domestic regulation in force at the time.as regards the removal of the consequences of illegal construction, the court held that it was crucial to assess the consequences of the illegal construction for the environment and the public interest, the consequences of the demolition of the buildings, the possibility of restoring the environment to its state before the illegal construction, and whether the persons who had acquired property rights had acted in good faith.even if the applicants had misinterpreted the provisions of the regulation, the constitutional court had found the regulation to be inconsistent with the law, and, by extension, with the constitution on 14 march 2006, only three months after the building permit had been issued to the first applicant.22.  on an unspecified date the applicants applied to the utena district court to overrule the bailiff’s refusal to suspend the execution of the judgment and to suspend it until the case had been examined at the european court of human rights.
in april 2008 the prosecutor lodged a claim with the varėna district court and asked it to annul part of the decision of 23 may 1996 (see paragraph 6 above) restoring the property rights of the applicants’ father in respect of 0.4863 hectares of land, and the relevant part of the succession document issued to the applicants.15.  the applicants submitted an appeal on points of law, and on 19 april 2010 the supreme court sent the case back to the court of appeal for fresh examination, stating that the lower courts had not examined the factual circumstances regarding how big the plot of land had to be in order for the buildings to be used.18.  the applicants appealed, and on 24 july 2013 the vilnius regional court upheld the decision of the varėna district court of 20 february 2012. the court held that, although the applicants claimed that j.p.’s house was not a residential building and thus no land for residential purposes could exist, the data from the register of immovable property and the purchase agreements showed that the building was a residential building.20.  on 27 january 2014 the national land service sent a letter to the applicants explaining that the legal registration in respect of their plot of land of 0.4863 hectares had been annulled following the decisions of the domestic courts, and asked them to choose the means by which they wanted their property rights in respect of the plot of land of 0.4863 hectares to be restored.the preliminary estimate as to the value of the plot was also indicated as being eur 217. it appears that the applicants did not reply to this letter, nor did they submit a request for monetary compensation, but the national land service calculated the compensation at eur 433 after having adjusted it in line with the inflation index, and on 12 july 2017 invited the applicants to come and discuss the restoration of their property rights.
11.  in october 2012 the first applicant asked the bailiff to ensure that the police were present during the forced eviction; to ensure that the access to the house was not impeded by the dog; the first applicant also asked the bailiff to get the information from the children’s rights protection service because z.b.the first applicant also asked the police to oblige the residents of the house to terminate their unlawful actions; to oblige them to remove their dog from the area; to warn the unlawful residents of the house of their responsibility for material damage and to fine them.submitted a separate complaint against the decision of the šiauliai district court (see paragraph 15 above), complaining that the court had made a purely formalistic assessment of his minor granddaughter’s living arrangements in the house and that it had not commented on the fact that the bailiff had ignored his wife’s illness.the court thus annulled the bailiff’s order of 16 april 2013 to suspend the eviction and the order of 2 may 2013 by which the bailiff dismissed the first applicant’s complaint (see paragraphs 18 and 21 above).lodged an application for interim measures, asking to prohibit the use of the house and other buildings in the garden and complaining of the result of the auction – the first applicant purchasing the house (see paragraph 5 above) – and asking for the result of the auction and the purchase agreement to be annulled.
the main evidence supporting the fairness of their dismissals was the recordings resulting from the covert surveillance, as well as the witness statements of co-workers dismissed for their involvement in the thefts, the shop manager, the union representative and the company’s legal representative.following this case-law, the employment tribunal, having regard to the evidence before it, found that the employer had had sufficient grounds to conclude that the applicants’ conduct amounted to a “breach of contractual good faith and abuse of trust” and thus declared both dismissals fair in conformity with article 54.2.d of the labour regulations.on 28 january and 24 february 2011 the court upheld both first-instance judgments, referring to the constitutional court’s case-law and endorsing the employment tribunal’s finding that the defendant party had been authorised to carry out the covert video surveillance of the cash desks.while acknowledging that it was possible that the employer could face an administrative sanction for not informing its employees and the staff committee in advance of the installation of the cameras, that fact alone had no relevance from a constitutional point of view, since from that perspective the covert video surveillance had been justified (in that there had been reasonable suspicions of theft), appropriate to the legitimate aim pursued, necessary and proportionate.further evidence as to the lack of any threat or coercion was the fact that other employees in the same situation as the applicants (such as the first and second applicants) had refused to sign the settlement agreements.
11.  in a report dated 10 november 2008 the intercantonal commission found that the applicant represented a danger to the public, and recommended that no adjustments to the conditions of his sentence be ordered and that the appropriate court be asked to review whether the conditions for an (outpatient) therapeutic measure in conjunction with the sentence (vollzugsbegleitende therapeutische massnahme) were satisfied (article 63 of the criminal code).the federal court left open the question of the application of the principle of non-retrospective application to institutional therapeutic measures ordered subsequently, pointing out that although such measures were to be regarded as a penalty within the meaning of article 7 of the convention, the fact that such a measure had been ordered subsequently in the applicant’s case had not resulted in a heavier penalty being imposed on him than the one applicable under the law in force when the criminal acts had been committed, seeing that the measures provided for under the former law (article 43 of the criminal code, in force until 31 december 2006) had been at least as strict as those applicable under the new law; that being so, there had been no breach of the principle of non-retrospective application in the present case.regarding article 5 § 1 (a) of the convention, the federal court noted that although a subsequent order for an institutional therapeutic measure was inherently at variance with the binding nature of the principal judgment, there had to be a sufficient causal link between the judgment and the measure for the subsequent detention ordered in the context of review proceedings to comply with that convention provision.7 to the convention provided for a number of exceptions to that principle, the federal court observed that the review conducted in the present case for the purposes of ordering a subsequent institutional therapeutic measure on the basis of the applicant’s serious mental illness, which had already been present but had not been detected at the time of the initial judgment, did not constitute a second penalty in respect of him.in response to the applicant’s argument that the expert medical opinions no longer reflected his current psychiatric condition, the federal court pointed out that the extremely detailed expert opinion of 24 september 2008 had been supplemented by the report of 30 june 2010 and corroborated by the expert’s oral statements at the hearing on 6 may 2011 concerning the diagnosis and the risk of reoffending.
11.  in august 2006 the authorities replied to the applicant husband’s letter asking why only a plot of land of 0.1007 hectares instead of 0.1638 hectares had been formed near the house, and stated that the plot of land 0.1007 hectares where the premises had been situated, would be divided for several co-owners of the premises and the rest of the land would be returned to the applicant’s husband by the means he chose.however, the calculation of the municipality provided that the market value of the plot was approximately eur 786,029 and the market value of the plot as calculated by the centre of registers was approximately eur 750,313. the court stated that in comparison with these numbers, the value of the plot of land provided by the vilnius county administration (see paragraph 14 above) was 327.5 times lower, and it could not conform to the principle of equal value.19.  after the matter had been resolved by the constitutional court (see paragraph 35 below), the vilnius regional administrative court rejected the applicant’s claim on 4 november 2013. the court analysed the domestic regulation regarding the calculation of the value of the land and observed that this matter had been referred to the constitutional court, which held that the methodology approved by the government setting down the principles of calculation of the value of the land was in accordance with the law.the court also emphasised the argument of the constitutional court that, in calculating the compensation, it was justified to pay heed not only to the market value of the property but also to its value at the time of nationalisation and to the changes in the quality and the value of property.the court held that the applicant had lodged the complaint on 4 november 2009; it had been accepted by the vilnius regional administrative court on 17 november 2009. on 10 february 2010 the vilnius regional administrative court had decided to apply to the constitutional court, which had adopted its decision on 11 september 2013. the proceedings in the administrative case had recommenced on 16 september 2013 and the decision had been adopted on 4 november 2013. given the complexity of the case and referral of the matter to the constitutional court, the length of proceedings had not breached the reasonable time requirement.
the agency observed that the applicant had submitted that he was not sought in morocco, that he had not been involved in any legal proceedings there and that the moroccan authorities had never subjected him to any acts of persecution in the past.11.  as concerned the risk upon return because it was the security service which had requested the expulsion, the migration agency found that the applicant had not made out that he risked persecution upon return on this ground.12.  the migration agency concluded that, even taking into account the applicant’s submissions, it shared the security service’s assessment and considered that there were grounds to expel the applicant with reference to section 1, paragraph 2, of the special controls of aliens act (lagen [1991:572] om särskild utlänningskontroll).the agency maintained its stance and stated, inter alia, that the applicant had not made it probable that he was of interest to the moroccan authorities and there was no concrete information indicating that they should be aware of what had happened to him in sweden.in view of what was known about the applicant’s former activities and other circumstances, the government concluded that it was reasonable to fear that the applicant would commit or participate in committing a terrorist offence which warranted his expulsion in accordance with the special controls of aliens act.
7.  following his dismissal from cyprus airways ltd as a trainee pilot, the applicant on 26 june 1998 brought a civil action before the district court of nicosia for wrongful dismissal and defamation (civil action no.10.  the hearing of the appeal was held on 11 march 2007. on that date the managing partner of the above-mentioned law firm, mr p.g.p., appeared for the defendant company and addressed the supreme court.up until that date, other lawyers from the firm had appeared before the appeal bench on behalf of the defendant company.12.  the applicant submitted that after the judgment of the supreme court was given, he discovered that the son of one of the judges sitting on the bench, judge a.k., and the daughter of mr p.g.p., were married and that both worked at the latter’s law firm.the lawyer representing him in the domestic proceedings had not requested the exemption of the judge in question because he had not had sufficient knowledge of the relevant facts at the time.
4.  the applicant was born in 1974 and at the time of lodging his application he was serving his prison sentence in the bolu f-type prison.5.  on 25 january 2008 the applicant wrote a letter to the ministry of justice, in which he had praised the imprisoned leader of the pkk, abdullah öcalan by using the honorific “sayın”, meaning esteemed.6.  pursuant to the regulations on the administration of penitentiary institutions and the execution of sentences, the applicant was found guilty of breaching a prison order by the bolu f-type prison disciplinary board (referred hereafter as “the board”).7.  on 1 february 2008 the applicant was sentenced to 11 days’ solitary confinement on the orders of the board, on account of his statements in the above-mentioned letter.9.  on 11 march 2008 the bolu assize court upheld the judgment of 26 february 2008.
6.  on 14 december 2012 the case was submitted for trial to the voronezh regional court.7.  on 11 july 2013 the court returned the case to the deputy prosecutor general for remedying certain procedural defects.8.  on 20 september 2013 the investigations department of the federal drug control service received the case file and forwarded it to its regional branch in st petersburg.9.  on 1 november 2013 an investigator asked the st petersburg city court to extend the applicant’s detention for a further four months, until 31 march 2014. on 8 november 2013 the city court granted the application.10.  on 27 november 2013 the st petersburg city court rejected his appeal in a summary fashion, without examining his arguments in detail.
after the event the party published a report on its website, including the following excerpts: “in his speech in front of the thurgau government building [thurgauer regierungsgebäude], b.k., the president of the local branch of the young swiss people’s party [“the jsvp”], emphasised that it was time to stop the expansion of islam.a symbolic sign, such as the prohibition of minarets, would therefore be an expression of the preservation of one’s own identity.” 7.  in response, the applicant posted an entry on its website in the section called “chronology – verbal racism”, entitled “frauenfeld tg, 5 november 2009”, including the following extract: “according to the report of the event, b.k., the president of the local branch of the young swiss people’s party, emphasised that it was time to stop the expansion of islam.not only in the context of the criminal offence of racial discrimination (article 261bis of the criminal code) but more generally, the term in question is, in the eyes of the average reader, capable of deliberately debasing the person whose comments have been classified as ‘verbally racist’, accusing him or her of behaviour which is frowned upon by society in the form of an act which is, at the very least, questionable in constitutional terms (cf.4.1. the case-law on press statements, on which the appellant relies, distinguishes between statements of facts on the one hand and value judgments on the other, and can be summarised as follows: ... 4.2. the appellant assigned the respondent’s statements to the section entitled ‘verbal racism’ ... that was a mixed value judgment.4.4. the statements that led the appellant to conclude that there had been ‘verbal racism’ are the core phrases ‘it is time to stop the spread of islam ... the swiss guiding culture (“schweizerische leitkultur”), based on christianity, cannot let itself be repressed by other cultures ... a symbolic sign, such as the prohibition of minarets, is therefore an expression of the preservation of one’s own identity’.
6.  on 8 july 2011 the district court determined that the case was not ready for trial and returned the file to the prosecutor.7.  on 9 august 2011 the director of the iz-23/2 remand prison where the applicant was held reported to the sochi prosecutor and to the president of the tsentralnyy district court that, in the absence of an order extending the applicant’s detention beyond 10 august, he would need to be released on that date.on the same date the sochi prosecutor replied to him that there were no grounds for releasing the applicant because the date for hearing the prosecutor’s appeal against the district court’s order of 8 july had been fixed for 17 august.he complained about his unlawful detention to the head of the investigations committee and the regional head of the ministry of the interior but did not receive any reply.as regards the custodial measure, it held that no extension had been necessary because by virtue of article 255 § 2 of the code of criminal procedure the applicant could be held in custody for an initial six-month period starting from the date on which the case had been submitted for trial.
however, on 31 march 2010 the supreme court of russia determined that the decision to refer the application to another district court had been invalid, because the city court’s deputy president had decided on the change of venue of his own initiative without hearing what the defendant’s opinion on that issue was.: “the available material indicates that the court considered the challenge for bias in accordance with the established procedure, and upon review of the parties’ arguments found no grounds for the challenge; the stated grounds fall outside of the scope of article 61 of the code of criminal procedure, as they do not indicate the presiding judge’s interest in any predetermined outcome of the case ... in addition, when considering the challenge in respect of the presiding judge, the court had regard to the opinion of the prosecutor, who declared at the hearing on 30 december 2009 that there were no legal grounds for allowing the challenge ... in particular because the hearing did not touch upon the defendant’s guilt; it was not an examination of the merits of the case, but a hearing [on the remand matter].” 11.  on 27 january and 27 february 2010 extension orders were issued by judges of the kalininskiy district court, which had territorial jurisdiction over the area where the applicant was detained.allowed the applicant’s challenge for bias in respect of the entire composition of that court, holding as follows: “it has been established that the injured party in the criminal proceedings [k.] works as an assistant to the vasileostrovskiy district court’s judge [n.], and that her father [judge k.] is a judge of the vasileostrovskiy district court.in order to ensure an impartial examination of the criminal case, the challenge ... must be allowed and the case referred to the president of the st petersburg city court for determination of the territorial jurisdiction.” 13.  continuing the same decision, judge sh.extended the applicant’s detention until 12 may 2010. on the last day of the extended period the presidium of the city court, by way of supervisory review, quashed the decision of 23 march in part in relation to the detention matter, on the grounds that an extension could not have been granted by a judge who had recused himself.
9.  the situation of the applicants is structurally and contextually the same as that of the applicants in bittó and others v. slovakia (no.11.  the property in question was conveyed by the bratislava evangelical church to the old town evangelical church by way of donation on 6 february 2013. on 15 february 2013 the previous owner ceased legally to exist and was legally succeeded by the old town evangelical church and the other two entities.13.  on 6 august 2013 the old town evangelical church applied to the bratislava i district court for an eviction order against the occupants of this flat who had failed to vacate it by the expiry of the twelve‑month notice period.as the occupants eventually vacated the flat on 25 february 2015, the old town evangelical church withdrew its action and the proceedings in respect of it were discontinued on 9 march 2015. until the vacation of the flat, the occupants had paid the old town evangelical church compensation in an amount equal to the regulated rent.9, and in the residential building located on 15 vrbovská cesta st. in piešťany, where the tenant living in the flat no.
18.  on 11 september 2012 the investigating police officers heard evidence from the neighbour’s husband, who declared that when the applicant, “known as a mentally ill person”, had refused, in inappropriate and disrespectful language, to present his identification papers and had attempted to return to his apartment, the police officers had immobilised him on the ground and handcuffed him, without ill-treating him in the process.19.  the officer on duty declared on 3 october 2012 that he had not spoken at all to the applicant on the night in question and had only seen him when the police officers had brought him in to establish his identity; those same officers had subsequently advised him to leave the police station – the officer on duty stated that he had seen the applicant again when he was leaving the building.20.  lastly, the two police officers gave their statements on respectively 4 and 5 october 2012. one of the officers declared that at the time of the events in question, the applicant had been under the influence of alcohol, because he had smelled of alcohol and had displayed a defiant attitude towards the police officers.on the basis of the evidence in the file, attesting, inter alia, to the fact that the applicant was known as a person who engaged in violent behaviour and who was frequently under the influence of alcohol, the prosecutor decided that the injuries suffered by the applicant had been superficial and that the use of force had been proportionate and necessary in order to immobilise him and take him to the police station, as provided for by articles 26 § 1 (2) and article 31 § 1 a) and b) of law no.the court considered that the applicant had not been kept unlawfully in the police station but had been released as soon as his identity had been established, and that the consequences of the police intervention had not been serious enough to constitute the crime of torture, as alleged by the applicant.
5.  the first applicant, habibe i̇ncin, is the wife of kerim i̇ncin; the second to seventh applicants are his children; the eighth applicant is his mother and the remaining seven applicants are the siblings of kerim i̇ncin.during the same period the prosecutor also identified, summoned and questioned a large number of witnesses and members of the military who had lived or worked in the region at the time of the events but who, in the years that had elapsed since the killing, had moved to different parts of the country.a number of witnesses told the prosecutor that they had seen kerim i̇ncin being taken away from the village by the soldiers and added that shortly afterwards a large-scale military operation had been conducted in the area and they had heard that kerim i̇ncin had been killed in the course of that operation.15.  on 25 march 2010 the prosecutor took a decision not to prosecute ten of the suspects who had been working as members of the military at the time of the events, for lack of evidence.− who had been the commander of the geçimli military station where kerim i̇ncin had allegedly been taken at the time of the events − with the offence of murder.
it held that the statement given to the prosecutor, but not maintained before the court – according to which the applicant had asked her to antedate the registration of the applications – was not corroborated by the other pieces of evidence adduced before it.17.  the prosecutor lodged an appeal on points of law, pointing to fundamental factual errors in the decisions of the two lower courts regarding the applicant’s acquittal and claiming that the court had made a superficial assessment of the evidence in the file.19.  on 24 february 2006 the bucharest court of appeal heard submissions from the prosecutor and counsel for the defence and allowed the applicant to address it at the end of the hearing (ultimul cuvânt al inculpatului).however, it did not question the applicant, the co-defendant n.g., or the witnesses, instead merely citing some of the statements they had made before the prosecutor and the first-instance court.to the prosecutor on 19 february and 23 july 2004 and before the district court on 11 march 2005, and to the statements given by the applicant on 27 february and 11 august 2004. having reassessed the facts without rehearing any evidence, it arrived at the conclusion that the applicant had incited n.g.
the applicants had not clearly set out the competences of the association’s constituent bodies and had not made it clear which of the several copies of the articles of association filed with the court, in which differences appeared, had been the ones adopted at the founding meeting.clause 4 spoke of the protection of macedonians subjected to racial and ethnic assimilation by the bulgarian state’s nationalistic policies and demanded that pirin macedonia be given cultural autonomy, that the assimilation of macedonians be stopped, and that macedonian identity, religion, language, traditions and heritage, allegedly being subjected to ethnocide by the bulgarian authorities, be protected.they overtly pitted one group of citizens against another and engendered national and ethnic hatred, contrary to article 44 § 2 of the constitution (see paragraph 22 below) 14.  at the end of its decision, the sofia court of appeal said that it was amenable to appeal on points of law before the supreme court of cassation.15.  on 4 june 2012 the applicants lodged such an appeal, reiterating their earlier arguments and submitting that the refusal to register ilinden had been in breach of their right to freedom of conscience and association and that it had penalised them for advocating views contrary to those held by the majority of the population.however, that was not the case under the 2007 code of civil procedure, which had come into effect on 1 march 2008. the court analysed in detail the relevant provisions of the new code and found that, when properly construed in the light of its overall scheme and the provisions governing similar registration proceedings, the rules governing the manner of appealing against a refusal to register a non-governmental organisation were to be construed as permitting an appeal to a court of appeal against a first-instance decision refusing registration but precluding an appeal on points of law against the court of appeal’s decision.
7.  on 7 may 2007 the applicant was arrested and on 10 may 2007 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan ordered the applicant’s detention for a period of two months, upon an application by the investigator, taking into account the nature and the dangerousness of the imputed offence and the fact that the applicant, if remaining at large, could abscond and obstruct the investigation by exerting unlawful influence on the persons involved in the proceedings.9.  on 24 may 2007 the criminal court of appeal decided to uphold the decision of the district court, finding that the nature and the dangerousness of the imputed offence, the particular circumstances of the case and the possible investigative measures to be carried out gave sufficient reasons to believe that the applicant could obstruct the investigation.10.  on 2 july 2007 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan extended the applicant’s detention by two months, upon an application by the investigator, finding that the applicant, if remaining at large, could obstruct the investigation, abscond, exert unlawful influence on the persons involved in the proceedings and commit another offence.12.  on 24 july 2007 the criminal court of appeal decided to uphold the decision of the district court, finding that the nature and the dangerousness of the imputed offence, the particular circumstances and complexity of the case; the investigative measures to be carried out and the applicant’s behaviour, namely his refusal to give any testimony, which was a factor slowing down the investigation, gave sufficient reasons to believe that the applicant could obstruct the investigation by exerting unlawful influence on the persons involved in the proceedings and also abscond.14.  on 3 september 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal, raising arguments similar to those previously raised 15.  on 6 september 2007 the investigator decided to replace the applicant’s detention with a written undertaking not to leave his residence and to release him in view of the fact that the investigative measures would take some time and it was no longer necessary to keep the applicant in detention.
7.  the background to the banning of the two rallies at issue in the present case has been set out in detail in the judgments in the following cases: stankov and the united macedonian organisation ilinden v. bulgaria, nos.9.  on 15 september 2006 the applicant, acting on behalf of the unregistered organisation the macedonian initiative committee, notified blagoevgrad’s mayor that the committee intended to stage a rally at 4 p.m. on 30 september 2006 in macedonia square to commemorate the eighty-second anniversary of “the day of the genocide of macedonians in bulgaria – 12 september 1924”.on 28 august 2007 ilinden notified the mayor of blagoevgrad of its intention to stage a rally on macedonia square, in front of gotse delchev’s monument, at 4.30 p.m. on 12 september 2007. the event, which was to mark the anniversary of ‘the genocide against the macedonians’, would consist of the laying of a wreath and flowers on the monument and a short speech.in a decision of 30 august 2007 the blagoevgrad administrative court found that under the 1990 meetings and marches act, which was lex specialis in relation to the general rules of administrative procedure, the court competent to examine an application for judicial review of a mayor’s decision to ban a rally was the district court.in others it held that although the mayor’s ban on the rally planned for 12 september 2007 was legally binding, the actions of the members of ilinden on that date had not amounted to the staging of a rally, as they had been too few and had not tried to wave banners and make speeches, but merely to lay flowers on gotse delchev’s monument.
15.  on 2 march, 23 april, 3 and 31 july, 23 november, 23 december 2009, 17 and 18 march and 7 april 2010, upon the applicant’s enquiries concerning the enforcement of the judgment of 30 july 2008, bailiffs informed the applicant that the enforcement of the judgment of 30 july 2008 was in progress and that she would be informed of the results.it reasoned that, by a letter of 17 june 2009 addressed to the applicant, the mayor of yerevan had suggested that the applicant approach the department of management of immovable property of the yerevan mayor’s office for the implementation of the judgment of 30 july 2008, but the applicant had failed to do so.22.  on 27 february 2012 the applicant instituted proceedings in the administrative court against the deja, seeking to declare the decision of 4 august 2011 null and void, as well as to oblige the deja to enforce the judgment of 30 july 2008.26.  on 18 july 2013 the applicant initiated proceedings in the administrative court seeking, inter alia, that the deja reopen the proceedings discontinued on 4 august 2011. on 4 december 2013 the administrative court rejected the applicant’s claim, reasoning that, for the proceedings which had been discontinued on the grounds of impossibility, there were no legal grounds for reopening.27.  on 3 march 2014 the applicant initiated proceedings in the administrative court against the deja, seeking that the decision of the deja of 10 february 2014 refusing to initiate new proceedings be declared invalid, and that the deja be obliged to initiate new proceedings.
the court went on to note that ilinden’s articles of association stated that it would strive for, inter alia, the introduction of the macedonian language in schools, the protection of the right of macedonians to refute propaganda about their history and culture, and the protection of macedonian cultural heritage, which was being “subjected to ethnocide by bulgarian cultural institutions”.according to the articles of association, ilinden was a “macedonian organisation based on a macedonian ethnic foundation and origin within the boundaries of bulgaria”, and it “would remind [people] of the terror perpetrated by bulgaria, of the thousands of macedonians killed, of the violence, the prisons and the deprivation of basic human rights and freedoms of macedonians after 1913, which amounted to crimes under international law”.moreover, the statements, combined with the existence, albeit brief, of a political party called the united macedonian organisation ilinden-pirin, whose re-registration had recently been refused, and with the existence of organisations bearing the same or similar names, led to the conclusion that the intention was to mislead society and to obtain the registration of an organisation pursuing political aims (see paragraphs 18-20 below), or an organisation directed against the unity of the nation.but since by law in registration proceedings the court had to examine the reality of the matter rather than carry out a mere formal check, it had to have regard not just to the aims set out in the articles of association, but to the entirety of the articles, and on that basis ascertain the founders’ real aims and intentions.in doing so, and thus balancing the rights of the founders of the association against the rights of others and the public interest, the court could rely not only on the material in the case file but also on facts which were publicly known and of which it could therefore take judicial notice.
6.  on 2 april 2009 the applicant initiated proceedings in the administrative court against the service seeking to 1) have the decision of 23 february 2009 annulled; 2) be reinstated in her previous position; and 3) recover her average salary starting from the moment of her dismissal until her reinstatement to the previous position.it reasoned its decision, inter alia, by stating that while the service had been under an obligation to offer the applicant another position within the service before deciding to dismiss her, it had failed to do so, even though such a position had existed in the service at the material time.the bailiff reasoned that the service had already paid the applicant amd 1,197,748 while the reinstatement of the applicant in her previous position in the service was impossible because that position was no longer vacant.in particular, the bailiff obliged the service to 1) annul the decision of the head of the service of 23 february 2009; 2) reinstate the applicant to her previous position; and 3) pay her her average monthly salary for the period between her dismissal and her reinstatement to the previous position.in particular, the bailiff reasoned that the service had already paid the applicant amd 1,197,748 as ordered by the judgment of 17 september 2009 while the reinstatement of the applicant in her previous position in the service was impossible because division no.
5.  on 14 january 2010 the applicant lodged a request with the ministry of justice (“the ministry”) in order to be recognised as having the same status as a person who had passed the bar examination (изедначување со правата на лицата кои положиле правосуден испит).the ministry further found that the bachelor’s degree which she had obtained had been awarded by the faculty of security and social defence (факултет за безбедност и општествена самозаштита), and not by a faculty of law, as required.she argued that she met the relevant criteria and that the lower court had failed to properly interpret the procedural and substantive law in the case.the ministry stated in the observations that the right to obtain recognition as having the same status as a person who had passed the bar examination was dependent on having a bachelor’s degree issued by a faculty of law.it restated that the recognition sought by the applicant was dependent on her having a bachelor’s degree issued by a faculty of law, a condition which she had failed to meet.
in the operative part of the judgment, the court indicated that the defendant party had to pay try 16,000 (approximately eur 7,400) for court fees pursuant to the law on charges.on the same day, the court rejected the request on the ground that it was impossible under section 28(1) (a) of the law on charges (law no.9.  at the time when the application was introduced, the applicant had therefore been unable to bring enforcement proceedings in order to have the above-mentioned judgment executed unless she herself was willing to pay the court fees that the defendant party had failed to pay.10.  following the introduction of the present application with the court, the domestic legislation was amended (see paragraphs 11-13 below), and subsequently the judgment in question was served on the applicant.according to the documents in the file, as of 14 april 2017 the debt, which is still not enforced, amounts to try 812,648.94 (approximately eur 193,500) including the initial amount of compensation awarded by the domestic court plus interest running at statutory rate.
during those proceedings and at the company’s request, on 24 february 2005 the timișoara district court ordered the suspension of the enforcement proceedings until a final judgment was given; the suspension was made subject to payment of a deposit of 4,000,000 romanian lei (rol), namely approximately 90 euros (eur).on 21 april 2005 the timișoara district court allowed the request, in so far as the restriction order had been issued subsequent to the suspension of the enforcement proceedings ordered by the court (see paragraph 13 above).21.  in so far as this was the last exchange of information between the applicant and the bailiff concerning the impugned enforcement procedure, and in view of the obligations imposed by law on the creditor, who was required to play a constantly active role throughout the enforcement procedure, on 28 may 2007 the bailiff issued an official report, noting that, under article 389 of the rccp as in force at the time, the procedure had become time-barred (“perimarea executării”; see paragraph 38 below).22.  on 5 may 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint before the timișoara district court seeking to obtain a court order for immediate enforcement of the judgment, pursuant to article 5803 of the rccp as in force at the time (see paragraph 40 below).the court held that the coercive fine had the nature of a civil penalty aimed at securing the enforcement of a personal obligation which could not be otherwise executed, as provided for by article 5803. however, the payment of the company’s debt could be enforced with the assistance of a bailiff; therefore the applicant’s complaint was ill-founded.
6.  on 17 and 18 july 2008, each of the applicants sent a letter to the halfeti (şanlıurfa) public prosecutor`s office which contained the following passage: "if using the word of “sayın” (esteemed) is an offense, then i also say “sayın abdullah öcalan”, i commit this offense and denounce myself."7.  on 19 september 2008, the public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the halfeti magistrates’ court in criminal matters against the applicants.8.  on 9 march 2009 the halfeti magistrates’ court in criminal matters found the applicants guilty of praising the imprisoned leader of the pkk, an illegal armed organisation, on account of their statements in the aforementioned letters and accordingly, sentenced them each to two months and fifteen days’ imprisonment.in accordance with article 50 of the criminal code, this prison sentence was commuted to a fine of 1,500 turkish liras (try).on 20 june 2012 the court of cassation, holding that the amount of the fine that had been imposed on the applicants did not attain the minimum requisite level, dismissed the appeal request.
the request was granted; the decision to issue the warrant read as follows: “the criminal investigation against t. was initiated on 23 october 2008 ... in the course of the investigation it has been established that from march until september 2008, t. extorted and received from d. in several instalments the amount of eur 10,500, [to be given to] the judges who examined d.’s relative’s case, in order to obtain his acquittal or a more lenient sentence.the evidence in the file and the material obtained through the operational investigation allow the well-founded assumption that at [the applicant’s] home, situated at [address], can be found eur 10,500 received from d. and relevant documents, decides to order a search of [the applicant’s] residence, situated at [address], with the aim of finding and seizing eur 10,500 received from d. and documents concerning the criminal case.” 8.  on the same day, a prosecutor lodged a request with the buiucani district court for a warrant to be issued for the search of the applicant’s apartment.the decision read as follows: “the present criminal proceedings were initiated on 23 october 2008 ... against t. after hearing the prosecutor and examining the material, and taking in consideration the fact that that material had been obtained in [a manner] in compliance with the law, the court finds that the request for the authorisation of the search is well founded and should be upheld.on the basis of articles 41, 125, 301, 305 and 306 of the code of criminal procedure, the court: ... 9.  on 10 december 2008 the police searched the applicant’s apartment in the presence of her elderly mother [but not the applicant].on 3 september 2009 the buiucani district investigating judge replied that the case file was held at the [premises of] the investigating authority and that access could only be granted pursuant to the law.
4.  the applicant was born in 1960 and at the time of lodging his application he was serving his prison sentence in the bolu f-type prison.5.  on 3 december 2007 the applicant wrote a letter to the ministry of justice, in which he had praised the imprisoned leader of the pkk, abdullah öcalan by using the honorific “sayın”, meaning esteemed.6.  pursuant to the regulations on the administration of penitentiary institutions and the execution of sentences, the applicant was found guilty of breaching prison order by the bolu f- type prison disciplinary board (referred hereafter as “the board”).7.  on 12 december 2007 the applicant was sentenced to 11 days’ solitary confinement on the orders of the board, on account of his statements in the above mentioned letter.9.  on 15 january 2008 the bolu assize court upheld the judgment of 25 december 2007.
... certainly it has to be taken into account that the freedom of expression of a lawyer in his capacity as defence counsel in criminal proceedings serves the purpose of the defendant’s right to a defence ... the circumstance that a defence counsel in judicial proceedings exercises his right to freedom of expression because and only because he represents a client is of primary importance for the review of the admissibility of the interference with the right of a defence counsel determined in the first paragraph of article 39 of the constitution [freedom of expression], but this cannot entail that because of this circumstance the constitutional court would not review whether the courts’ decisions on punishing the defence counsel violated his right to freedom of expression.the echr protects the freedom of expression in the first paragraph of article 10... ... 12. the duty of the courts in general and the court deciding on the merits of the case is to direct proceedings in such a manner so as to ensure the proper conduct of the parties and above all the fairness of the trial – rather than to examine in a subsequent trial the appropriateness of the party’s statements in the courtroom however, this does not entail that the defence counsel’s freedom of expression in criminal proceedings should be unlimited.u-i-145/03 that the institution of a punishment for insulting submissions is not the primary way to ensure the good reputation and authority of the judiciary, it is, however, an additional (and subordinate) tool which ensures the protection of the good reputation of the courts in situations in which confidence in the work of the judiciary is undermined by degrading criticism and [generalised], and from the viewpoint of the protection of rights in an individual case, unnecessary attacks on the work of the courts.the court found that the following remarks of the applicant, the translation of which has not been disputed by the parties, amounted to contempt of court (taken from the decision): “as regards the state prosecutor: ‘... it can be concluded that someone – a person who was aware of the exculpatory nature of this documentation for the defendant – hid this documentation ...’ ‘... it is permissible for a prosecutor to hide crucial evidence which could release the defendant from his liability ... as regards the expert psychologist ... [j.r.] ... : ‘... he had intentionally overlooked any information pointing to another possibility...’ ‘... on the other hand, i, as a layman, consider this to be a reflection of possible narcissism on the part of the expert himself ...’ as regards the forensic expert psychiatrist ... [v.r] ... : ‘... from the perspective of forensic ethics, by which the forensic expert is bound, such a way of working represents an intentional violation of those ethics, giving statements without any scientifically based value ...’ ‘... could be seen from the qualified (ab)use ((zlo)rabe) of the experiments, which the expert ...’ ‘... as he cannot have the slightest idea (ne more imeti najmanjšega pojma) as to how far normality extends and when pathology starts ...’ ‘... commenting on or describing handwriting analysis amounts to quackery (je na nivoju šarlatanstva) ...’ ‘... the psychiatrist either does not know all this or he is narcissistically ignoring it ...’ ‘... in this case we can talk of a typical abuse of a test, most likely a pirate version.in view of the fact that this abuse of the test took place in proceedings before a court – a judicial institution – this is almost grotesque ...’ ‘... the conclusion is almost dilettantish ...’ ‘... the expert did not show the slightest scientific doubt (niti trohe prisotnosti znanstvenega dvoma), but instead focused all his energy on defending his own infallibility, which is extremely inappropriate for any expert, and for one who is “accepting” the expert skills (“sprejemnika”izvedenske veščine) it is dangerous ...’ as regards the forensic expert ... [j.b.], the head of the forensic medicine institute: ‘... and when such negligence (malomarnost) by experts in preparing their opinions, resulting in a [thirty]-year prison sentence, justifiably upsets me ...’ ‘... that the negligence (šlamparija) of this expert is immense ...’ as regards the court: ‘... the judicial farce referred to is of course not over ...’” of the above, the second of the statements referring to the public prosecutor and the statements referring to expert j.b. were expressed orally at the ljubljana higher court’s session; the remainder were given in writing.
4.  the applicants were born in 1967, 1965 and 1972 respectively and at the time of lodging their applications they were serving their prison sentences in the muş e-type prison.5.  on 6 and 7 march 2006 each applicant sent a letter to the ministry of justice, referring to the imprisoned leader of the pkk, abdullah öcalan, by using the honorific “sayın”, meaning esteemed.6.  pursuant to the regulations on the administration of penitentiary institutions and the execution of sentences, the applicants were found guilty of breaching prison order by the erzurum h- type prison disciplinary board (referred hereafter as “the board”).7.  on 5 april 2006 the applicants were each sentenced to 12 days’ solitary confinement on the orders of the board, on account of the statements in the above mentioned letters.on 21 october 2005 and 14 november 2005, respectively, the erzurum enforcement court and the erzurum assize court rejected the first applicant’s appeal requests.
12.  the applicant provided the court with two reports: the first one of 1 april 1998 prepared by the municipal service for the environment stated that: “prior to the entry into force of the declaration of an acoustically saturated zone, the levels of disturbance by noise during the night exceeded 65 decibels, mainly during the nights from thursdays to sundays from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. in the morning.the constitutional court stated that the judgment issued by the european court of human rights in the case of moreno gomez: “... justifie[d] entirely the reconsideration of the present amparo appeal, in order to ascertain the measure in which it might deal with an analogous case, and to examine whether the objects of analysis of the [strasbourg] court [had been] the same fundamental rights as in this amparo appeal”.the prosecutor considered that moreno gómez and the applicant’s case were similar in terms of the facts as well as in the object and the merits, which was in principle sufficient to deliver a judgment on the merits on the alleged violations of the right to private and family life and to inviolability of the home.23.  in a judgment of 29 september 2011, served on the applicant on 19 october 2011, the plenary of the constitutional court dismissed the amparo appeal, arguing that (1) both cases were not identical, (2) the applicant had not proved that in his particular case the noise at his flat was above the permitted level, (3) that the city council had indeed adopted specific measures to reduce noise pollution at the applicant’s neighbourhood and (4) that he had not proved that his health problems had been directly caused by noise pollution.in particular, the dissenting judges argued that the standard employed by the constitutional court to decide when the right to privacy and family life had been infringed should have been based on the case-law of the court and that prolonged exposure to a high levels of sound that could be qualified as avoidable and unbearable deserved the protection of the courts, given that it impeded him from living a normal life.
is not one of the reasons why we are entering the third millennium with unsolved journalist murders the fact that those who occupy the seat and write the column of çetin emeç at hürriyet, and those who occupy the seat and write the column of abdi i̇pekçi at milliyet, and also the newspaper of the journalist i̇zzet kezer, did not make it their business to reveal the murderers and all those responsible in the first place?had been rendered targets for terrorist organisations: “... it is not possible to reach the light from the darkness without eliminating the eliminators ... and above all, supposing that the protective ring around the former director of i̇stanbul security directorate, o.t., who issued the collective detention order which ended with the death of metin, and around vice-director k.b., who executed this order, would remain in place forever would represent nothing but a lack of faith in all these struggles.the applicants further submitted that the names of the officials had already appeared in the public domain and that the officials, being the director and the vice-director of istanbul security directorate, were already known to the public and thus not in a position to complain about the disclosure of their identities.12.  as regards the content of the article, the applicants observed that the writer of the article had defended the rule of law and the notion of justice and had not incited people to violence or advocated terrorism.13.  the applicants emphasised that the sentence “and above all, assuming that the protective ring around the former director of i̇stanbul security directorate, o.t., who issued the collective detention order which ended with the death of metin, and around vice-director k.b., who executed this order, would remain in place forever, would represent nothing but a lack of faith in all these struggles” had been a reference to the fact that no permission had been given under law no.

20.  on 22 june 2010 the gdańsk court of appeal quashed the decision of the gdańsk regional court of 4 december 2009. the court decided that the irish court had ruled on parental responsibility and that judgment could not be reconciled with the subsequent judgment of the polish court of 18 december 2009 dismissing the applicant’s claim for the child’s return under the hague convention.27.  on 9 september 2011 the high court of ireland gave a judgment superseding the order of 15 september 2009. the court decided to grant joint custody to both parents, but still ordered the child’s return to ireland by 2 november 2011. the court decided that a should finish the school year in ireland and start the next one, from september 2012, in poland.39.  on 7 september 2012 the malbork district court discontinued proceedings for the compulsory execution of the decision by the irish court of 9 september 2011. the court considered that the applicant’s right to demand a’s return to ireland had effectively expired on 31 august 2012 and that, as of that day, there was no executory title which could provide grounds for proceedings to be carried out effectively.the terms of the agreement stated that the applicant would have sole custody of a for the following year, pending review by the court in july 2014. it also set out m.k.’s access rights, which provided that during his visits to ireland he would have to give two weeks’ notice to the applicant and could see the child on saturdays from 1.30 p.m. to 7 p.m. and on sundays from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. access during the school holidays would take place in ireland, but could be for longer periods and on weekdays.53.  on 17 october 2013 the irish liaison judge for the ejn wrote to the polish liaison judge informing him of the custody proceedings in ireland, the agreement of 24 june 2013 made by the parties in relation to custody and access rights and the order of 25 june 2013 of the high court of ireland giving effect to that agreement.
the damages were awarded to the applicant against the national centre for recreation, rehabilitation and sport – ministry of education and science (“the centre”, a state body subsidised by the ministry of education and science and exercising certain functions delegated by the ministry).the ministry then established a state-owned joint‑stock company with part of the centre’s property, including the real estate in which the applicant had carried out the construction works.7.  on 13 may 2005 and 15 march 2007 the applicant was issued with two writs of enforcement for the amounts awarded in the final judgments of 2005 and 2006 (see paragraph 5 above) and on 6 february 2008 she presented the writs to the ministry of education asking it to pay.8.  the ministry replied in writing that it was not the successor to the centre and did not owe payment to the applicant.10.  as of 19 march 2015, the date of the applicant’s last communication to the court, no change in the above circumstances had been reported.
the judge substantiated the necessity for this measure as follows: “taking into account the possibility of the accused’s absconding from the investigation, and the character and gravity of the crime attributed to him, i consider it necessary to apply the preventive measure of remand in custody in respect of him.” 11.  on 27 july 2007 the applicant appealed against the detention order, claiming that there was no risk of his absconding or obstructing the investigation and that the court had failed to take his personal situation into consideration.the relevant part of the decision reads as follows: “the first-instance court, when deciding to apply the preventive measure of remand in custody in respect of mushfig huseynov, has correctly taken into account the character and degree of public dangerousness of the committed crime, the possibility of his absconding from the investigation, and the fact that the sanction provided for the commission of this act is over two years’ imprisonment.14.  on 19 october 2007 the nasimi district court granted the prosecutor’s request by extending the applicant’s detention pending trial by three months, until 24 january 2008. the court substantiated the need for the extension by the necessity of additional time to carry out further investigative actions, as well as by the seriousness of the charge and the likelihood that if released he might abscond.it appears from the transcript of the broadcast that the programme began with a narrated section, the transcript of which reads as follows in its relevant part: “although in the republic of azerbaijan, which has chosen to take a democratic development path, all the legislative guarantees and comprehensive conditions have been established for freedom of speech and of the press, it is still possible to encounter members of the press who violate the requirements, established by the mass media act, prohibiting abuse of the freedom of the press and performance of unlawful actions incompatible with journalistic ethics.one of these undesirable members of the mass media is the editor of the bizim yol newspaper, huseynov mushfiq tofig oglu – who was accused of having committed serious and especially serious crimes and was convicted of libel and defamation under articles 147.2 and 148 of the criminal code of the republic of azerbaijan by the nasimi district court’s judgment of 25 april 2006 – [he] did not draw conclusions from that and committed an even more serious crime, bribe-taking ...” 22.  the programme then showed the video recordings, filmed by the law-enforcement authorities, of the meeting and dialogue between the applicant and r.a., and of the applicant’s arrest by the agents of the mns when he was taking money from r.a. at the end of the programme the narrator stated that the criminal investigation was ongoing and that the public would be informed of further developments.
6.  the sofia municipal council approved the exchange of a municipal flat for a smaller flat owned and occupied by the applicant in december 2005. however, the mayor of sofia did not issue the necessary order and did not sign a contract for the exchange, as provided in the applicable rules.the sofia administrative court quashed the mayor’s tacit refusal in a judgment of 1 april 2010 and instructed the mayor to issue an order for the exchange of the flats.7.  by a decision of 25 march 2010 the sofia municipal council revoked its december 2005 decision approving the exchange of the two properties.following an application by the applicant for judicial review, on 30 march 2012 the supreme administrative court declared that decision null and void as having been issued in breach of the judgment of the sofia administrative court of 1 april 2010. the court also instructed the mayor to issue an order for the conclusion of the exchange agreement.9.  the mayor ordered the flat exchange on 6 march 2013 and the applicant signed a contract for the exchange on 25 june 2013.

details of any disability; specific confirmation of their consent to the sharing of their whereabouts information with other organisations having authority to test them; for each day during the following quarter, the full address of the place where they would be residing (for example, home, temporary lodgings, hotel, and so on); and for each day during the following quarter, the name and address of each location where they would train, work or conduct any other regular activity (for instance, school), as well as the usual time-frames for such regular activities.under heading 11.4 (“availability for testing”), clause 11.4.1 provided as follows: “11.4.1 an athlete in a registered testing pool must specifically be present and available for testing on any given day in the relevant quarter for the 60-minute time slot specified for that day in his/her whereabouts filing, at the location that the athlete has specified for that time slot in such filing.” 53.  the international convention against doping in sport, adopted under the auspices of unesco (hereafter “the unesco convention”) came into force on 1 february 2007. the preamble to this convention reads as follows: “... conscious that sport should play an important role in the protection of health, ... concerned by the use of doping by athletes in sport and the consequences thereof for their health, the principle of fair play, the elimination of cheating and the future of sport, ... mindful also of the influence that elite athletes have on youth, ... aware that public authorities and the organizations responsible for sport have complementary responsibilities to prevent and combat doping in sport, notably to ensure the proper conduct, on the basis of the principle of fair play, of sports events and to protect the health of those that take part in them, ... recognizing that the elimination of doping in sport is dependent in part upon progressive harmonization of anti-doping standards and practices in sport and cooperation at the national and global levels, ...” 54.  as the wadc is not binding on states because the instruments adopted by wada are governed by private law, it was decided to draw up an international convention in order to provide an internationally recognised legal framework allowing states to incorporate the code into their domestic legislation.
10.  the applicant’s statement of claim was served on the defendants in october 2004. dr b entered his defence in february 2005, seeking further and better particulars from the applicant, which the applicant’s solicitor provided in june 2005. the hospital entered its defence in june 2005, and also sought further and better particulars.the judge preferred the evidence given by the witnesses appearing on behalf of the defence, deeming their qualifications to be more relevant to this specialised area than those of the experts retained by the applicant.the judge did not accept that dr b had failed to monitor adequately the effects of the drug on the applicant during the months that she received it.likewise, he rejected the claim that the doctor had failed in his duty of care in the manner in which he had explained the proposed course of treatment to the applicant and the possible side effects.the appeal was filed on 1 july 2010. it remained pending before the supreme court until it was transferred to the newly-established court of appeal on 29 october 2014. the hearing of the appeal took place on 30 july 2015.

9.  during the ensuing criminal proceedings, the espiye criminal court of first instance heard statements from the applicant, the parents of x., the psychiatrist who had interviewed the girl after the incident, and the teachers and personnel at the public education centre and the neighbouring primary school, including the teacher e.u., who was the sole eyewitness to the incident.she explained that the following facts ‒ in particular, the room being dark as a result of the lights having been turned off, the applicant sitting at the desk right next to the door with his legs open with the minor on his lap and the desk in front having been pushed further away, coupled with the fact that he had been caressing the body of the minor and holding her tight around her waist ‒ had led her to conclude that [the applicant] had been attempting to harass her.21.  on 5 july 2006 the supreme disciplinary council issued the following decision in relation to the applicant, in so far as relevant: “upon examination of the file ... and of the defence statement duly taken [from the applicant], the following has been decided: on the basis of the information and documents in the file, the veracity of the act [harassment of x.]section 131 of the same law also provides that the commencement of criminal proceedings against a civil servant shall not suspend disciplinary proceedings arising out of the same facts and that acquittal or conviction in the criminal proceedings shall not prevent the execution of disciplinary sanctions.” [...] although it has been argued that the sole eyewitness’s version of the events cannot be taken as a conclusive basis on which to deem that the applicant committed the act imputed to him, on the basis of the evidence in the case-file and in consideration of the position in which the applicant was found in the classroom, as well as the fact that the classroom’s door had been shut and the lights had been turned off and the room was therefore dark as it was also very early in the morning and it was raining [...], having further regard to the statement by the principal of the neighbouring primary school, a.t., during the criminal proceedings acknowledging that the applicant had apologised to him after the incident and that he had also heard rumours about the applicant’s similar indecent behaviour in other schools where he had previously worked, the applicant’s argument has not been found to be credible.the applicant relied on the espiye criminal court of first instance’s final judgment of 18 december 2008, which acquitted him of the charges of sexual abuse, sexual assault and the unlawful detention of a minor, and argued before the ordu administrative court that his right to the presumption of innocence had been violated in the course of the dismissal proceedings because he had been dismissed on the basis of allegations that he had committed offences in respect of which the criminal proceedings had not yet become final.
7.  on 30 september 1998 police officers at the istanbul security headquarters took a statement from the applicant in the absence of a lawyer, as a result of the restriction stemming from law no.10.  on 7 october 1998 the public prosecutor filed an indictment with the istanbul state security court, charging the applicant under article 125 of the former turkish criminal code with being involved in separatist activities against the republic of turkey.15.  while the criminal proceedings against the applicant were pending, on 18 june 1999 the constitution was amended and the military judge sitting on the bench of the istanbul state security court was replaced by a civilian judge.17.  on 25 april 2001 the public prosecutor read out his observations on the merits (esas hakkında mütalaa) and requested that the applicant be convicted and sentenced under article 125 of the former criminal code.the first-instance court based its decision on several items of evidence, such as the applicant’s statements to the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, documents relating to the organisation which had been found and seized in the course of police operations, and the statements of some co-defendants.
the referendum was initiated by the government and posed the following question: “do you want the european union to be entitled to order the mandatory settlement of non-hungarian citizens in hungary without parliament’s consent?” 7. in the course of the campaign several opposition parties called on voters to boycott the referendum or to cast invalid ballots that would not count in the final tally but could still be interpreted as rejecting the idea of the referendum.the kúria overturned the remainder of the commission’s decision on the infringement of the secrecy of the electoral process and on the discrediting of the work of the electoral bodies.the decision of the kúria declared the applicant’s conduct unlawful and obliged it to pay a fine, it was the applicant who lodged the petition for review with the kúria, thus it was individually concerned in the present case...by making the mobile phone application available the applicant reacted to the spreading of social media communication.by developing the mobile phone application the applicant wanted to enable voters to share photos of ballot papers (or in case of those who absented from the referendum photos of the activities undertaken instead of voting) and other messages in an anonymous way and exercise their right to freedom of expression in a way that the content of the vote could not be linked to the voter.thus, the applicant’s activity, providing a forum for voters to express an opinion is also protected by the article ix (1) of the fundamental law...in the applicant’s opinion, the decision of the the kúria, by invoking voters’ right to freedom of expression, restrained in fact, the applicant’s own conduct of exercising its right to freedom of expression without any constitutional reason.” the applicant further submitted that, as established by the kúria, the mobile phone application had not infringed the secrecy and fairness of the voting procedure and it had also not been capable of doing so, since the content of the ballot papers could not be linked to the voters.
[d]espite the fact that the vaginal examination of the victim did not reveal the presence of any active or passive semen, the victim’s statement that she was menstruating on the night in question and the forensic evidence finding traces of both the applicant’s and s.k.’s dna on the applicant’s underwear and the two napkins found in s.a.’s apartment containing the applicant’s dna, point to the conclusion that the applicant must have ejaculated prematurely before sexual intercourse.... it has been decided unanimously to dismiss the accused from the police force, in accordance with section 8(6) and (7) of the disciplinary regulation of the security forces on the grounds that it has been proven that he has committed the offence of sexual assault and of using his position as a police officer for personal ... advantage.” 27.  on an unspecified date the applicant objected to the supreme disciplinary council’s decision before the ankara administrative court.after examination of the file, it appears that the case concerns the applicant’s dismissal from the police force on the basis of a disciplinary investigation which established that he had intercourse with a woman without her consent on the pretext of calling her a suspect .., by asking her to get into a police car so that he could verify her identity at the police station, although in the end he took her to a piece of empty land and had intercourse with her without her consent.on the basis of the case file, statements, the forensic report and other information, the veracity of the accusation is reinforced and therefore the decision to dismiss the applicant is in accordance with the law.” 29.  on 13 march 2006 the supreme administrative court dismissed the applicant’s appeal by a majority by endorsing the reasons provided by the ankara administrative court.according to the government, the administrative court held that “the decision of the assize court was available on the dates the supreme administrative court examined the applicant’s appellate review and request for rectification of the decision, and that accordingly the court in question made an assessment of the decision rendered by the assize court”.
9.  following some talks with the applicant, on 26 march 2008 helyi téma, at the material time the biggest weekly journal, republished the same story, adding that the late poet’s grandson had dismissed the idea of having a child with the applicant’s sister.12.  according to the witnesses who gave evidence before the first-instance court, the applicant had been truly saddened by the way the article had presented her family plans, especially that her statements had been hurtful to the memory of her late husband.based on the witness statements and the role the plaintiff’s late husband played in public life, the court concluded that the applicant’s idea about childbearing was not contrary to the thinking of györgy faludy...” 13.  the regional court added that both the applicant and her late husband had unusual, provocative personalities and ways of thinking, and the statement according to which she had infringed her late husband’s memory did not correspond to reality and was unjustifiably hurtful.according to the court, the main issue at stake was whether, in the light of the applicant’s own conduct “diverging from the widely‑accepted social and ethical norms”, the statement could be regarded as unreasonably hurtful and humiliating.in a judgment of 12 september 2012, the kúria endorsed the finding of the second-instance court that the headline did not constitute a statement of fact but a value judgment concerning the unusual manner in which the applicant intended to start a family.
8.  the applicants and p.m. (born in 1942), who was the husband of one of the applicants and the father of the others, lived in razbojište, near the larger village of krupa, on the territory of krajina.on 24 november 2003 the third applicant identified the remains as those of her father, p.m. 11.  the police opened an investigation into the circumstances of p.m.’s death after the applicants on 5 september 2005 brought a claim for damages with the state attorney’s office in connection with his killing (see paragraph 20 below).16.  on 14 september 2015 the police interviewed v.g., a captain in the croatian army during operation storm, who had been in command of the zadar military police third company of the 72nd battalion, who said that he had never been to žegar and had never heard of anyone being killed there.19.  on 22 january 2016 the zadar county state attorney’s office informed its counterpart in split county that it had not been able to confirm the allegations made in the anonymous letter of 11 august 2015 as there was no indication that twelve elderly people had been killed in the “milića” cave.during the proceedings information was obtained from the archives of the ministry of defence showing that the croatian army had entered the area in question on 6 august 1995, whereas p.m. had been killed on 5 august 1995. the first-instance court also accepted the statement of the witness o.m., who said that the village of žegar had been shelled on 5 august 1995. the first-instance judgment was upheld by the zagreb county court on 21 september 2010. on 10 june 2014 the supreme court upheld the lower courts’ judgments in respect of the ruling that the applicants’ claim had become statute-barred.
6.  the applicant signed a contract with the then bulgarian ministry of agriculture and forests (hereafter “the ministry”) on 15 july 2004. according to the terms of the contract the applicant undertook to act as a legal representative for the ministry in a case before the international court of arbitration in paris, for which the ministry was to pay him 58,100 bulgarian levs (bgn, about eur 29,600).on 23 february 2006 the court issued the writ on the basis of the contract of 15 july 2004 for the amount of bgn 29,631, comprising bgn 29,050 due on the basis of the contract and bgn 581 for costs related to the enforcement proceedings, plus the legal interest rate for the period from 1 february 2006 until full payment.instead, on 26 july 2006 the ministry brought a civil claim against him in court, seeking damages for his failure to carry out the duties ensuing from the contract of 15 july 2004. the amounts sought in damages were 568,897.90 united states dollars (usd) and bgn 29,500 (approximately eur 15,000), the latter explicitly referred to as corresponding to the first half of the fee due to the applicant which had been paid to him by the ministry upon signing the contract.the penalty agreed in the contract between the ministry and the applicant was payable in the event of the failure of the applicant to comply with his obligations and the ministry did not need to prove that it had incurred any loss as a result of the applicant’s conduct.15.  on 12 july 2011 the applicant again asked the ministry, through a duly served notarial request, to pay to him the amount of bgn 57,964.81, which represented bgn 29,050 (the principal amount, corresponding to the balance of the fee due to him), bgn 12,874.58 (default penalty agreed in the contract in case of the ministry’s failure to fulfil its contractual obligations), bgn 20,143.23 (legal interest rate) and bgn 581 (costs and expenses), minus the 8% default penalty in the amount of bgn 4,648 which the sofia court of appeal had ordered the applicant to pay to the ministry in its judgment.
8.  on 20 july 2012 the munich ii regional court, after taking evidence at seventeen days of hearing, issued a decision limiting the prosecution to charges concerning four incidents which had taken place between 19 and 25 august 2007. the court provisionally discontinued the proceedings in respect of all the other offences the applicant had been charged with (see paragraph 7 above), in accordance with article 154 § 2 of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 17 below), in view of the penalty the applicant could expect for the four remaining incidents.11.  the regional court explained that it had restricted the conviction to the four events that had taken place between 19 and 25 august 2007. it had discontinued the proceedings in respect of the at least 300 further charges under article 154 § 2 of the code of criminal procedure but was convinced that in at least fifty cases there had been incidents comparable to the four of which the applicant was formally convicted.12.  in the impugned passages of the judgment, the regional court found as follows: “the chamber is convinced on the basis of the credible statement by the injured party that in addition to the four cases between january 2001 and october 2007 on which judgment was passed, at least 50 other comparable cases occurred.... on the other hand, the chamber considers as an aggravating element that it is convinced that, in addition to the four incidents in august 2007 which the accused has been convicted of, there have been at least 50 comparable incidents since january 2001. a conviction for those events was only made impossible by the victim’s incapacity to substantiate them in terms of the time and the place where they happened in a manner making it possible to define them as procedural offences (offences in the procedural sense).da sich nicht mehr mit sicherheit aufklären ließ, in welchen fällen der angeklagte die geschädigte durch seine drohung zu einer oralen und in welchen zu einer manuellen befriedigung brachte, geht die kammer insoweit von 50 weiteren fällen der manuellen befriedigung aus.”) 13.  in an appeal on points of law to the federal court of justice, the applicant complained that the regional court had breached the presumption of innocence guaranteed by article 6 § 2 of the convention by taking fifty unproven incidents into account as an aggravating factor meriting a more severe sentence, despite the fact that the proceedings in relation to them had been discontinued under article 154 of the code of criminal procedure.
in describing the applicant’s actus reus, the prosecutor found that he had bypassed the registry of the ministry of justice when accepting the request from naftogaz and issuing his letter in reply; that his conclusion about the existence of exceptional conditions for naftogaz not to pursue a bidding procedure had been in contradiction with the applicable legal provisions; and that he had had no right to put that conclusion on official ministry of justice paper.the arrest report had the following description of the facts giving rise to the prosecution: “... during the period from 5 to 27 february 2009 [the applicant], exceeding his official powers, issued an expert conclusion with knowingly false information, as a result of which considerable damage, amounting to 1,697,600 [ukrainian] hryvnias [equal to about 152,000 euros at the time] was caused to [naftogaz].the necessity of that preventive measure was explained as follows: “having regard to [the applicant’s] role in the commission of the offence and his causing serious damage to state interests, his age, state of health, family and financial situation, and other circumstances characterising him, the investigation has grounds to believe that [the applicant] will try to influence the witnesses in this case given his extensive networks in law-enforcement bodies and among judicial authorities.therefore, the application of any other preventive measure in respect of the accused ... will not be able to ensure his proper procedural conduct and the fulfilment of procedural decisions...” 26.  on the same day the pecherskyy court found that the case file did not contain sufficient information about the applicant in order to take a decision on the investigator’s application.30.  on 13 january 2011 the court of appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal and upheld the findings and reasoning of the pecherskyy court’s decision of 30 december 2010. there was no reference in the ruling to the application by the bar association president.
42.  the relevant provisions of the hague convention of 25 october 1980 on the civil aspects of international child abduction which entered into force on 1 july 1986 with regard to hungary state as follows: “the states signatory to the present convention, firmly convinced that the interests of children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody, desiring to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the state of their habitual residence, as well as to secure protection for rights of access, have resolved to conclude a convention to this effect, and have agreed upon the following provisions – ... article 1 the objects of the present convention are – a) to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any contracting state; and b) to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one contracting state are effectively respected in the other contracting states.if the judicial or administrative authority concerned has not reached a decision within six weeks from the date of commencement of the proceedings, the applicant or the central authority of the requested state, on its own initiative or if asked by the central authority of the requesting state, shall have the right to request a statement of the reasons for the delay.... article 12 where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of article 3 and, at the date of the commencement of the proceedings before the judicial or administrative authority of the contracting state where the child is, a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention, the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.article 13 notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding article, the judicial or administrative authority of the requested state is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that – a) the person, institution or other body having the care of the person of the child was not actually exercising the custody rights at the time of removal or retention, or had consented to or subsequently acquiesced in the removal or retention; or b) there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.article 14 in ascertaining whether there has been a wrongful removal or retention within the meaning of article 3, the judicial or administrative authorities of the requested state may take notice directly of the law of, and of judicial or administrative decisions, formally recognised or not in the state of the habitual residence of the child, without recourse to the specific procedures for the proof of that law or for the recognition of foreign decisions which would otherwise be applicable.
the event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at bolotnaya square which was supposed to end at 7.30 p.m. the march was peaceful and held without any disruptions, but when the marchers arrived at bolotnaya square it became apparent that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue, allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting.it held, in particular, as follows: “between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. on 6 may 2012 ... at bolotnaya square ... unidentified persons ... called those present [at the venue] to move outside the agreed meeting venue, to defy the lawful orders of the police ..., to use violence ... which led to mass disorder accompanied by the use of violence against public officials in connection with the performance of their duties [and] the destruction of property.moreover ... the participants of the acts of mass disorder threw chunks of tarmac, stones, sticks and other objects at the police ... which hit them on various parts of their body, and [the defendants] ... [who] participated in the acts of mass disorder ... implemented their criminal intent to use violence against public officials ... applied physical force which was not a danger to the life or health of those [officials] ... [the applicant] used violence against police officer [k.] which did not endanger his life or health... [the applicant] ... from 5 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. ... put on a mask to conceal his face ... and threw at least three pieces of tarmac ... at police officers in a targeted manner ... one of the pieces ... which measured 15 cm by 15 cm ... hit the police officer [k.] on the right hand ... which caused him pain.... [the applicant] pleaded not guilty and testified that ... he had decided to attend the public gathering on 6 may 2012 ... after the security check he put on a mask with eye holes because he wanted to avoid being recognised by members of the opposition ... when a stampede occurred, he tried to leave the venue but could not get out of the crowd ... at some point ... [the applicant] saw three police officers with truncheons heading in his direction.... the court finds that [the applicant’s] guilt is established by the following evidence: ... a medical expert opinion stating that ... k. had a broken finger which could have been caused ... on 6 may 2012 ... the recovery process would take more than 21 days ... ... the court considers the [defendants’] arguments that they were protecting somebody from police officers or happened to be the victims of the police’s use of force as farfetched and aimed at the mitigation of their responsibility ... 30.  the applicant was sentenced to three years and six months’ imprisonment, calculated on the basis of a three-year prison term under article 212 § 2 of the criminal code, partly concurrent with a term of one year and four months under article 318 § 1 of the criminal code.
8.  on the same day the public prosecutor at the istanbul state security court prolonged the applicant’s detention in police custody for a period of up to 15 days.10.  on 14 september 1995 the applicant participated in a reconstruction of the events (yer gösterme) with another suspect k.a., organised by the police in the absence of a lawyer.according to a report, drafted by police officers and signed by the applicant and k.a., both of the accused gave the details of the murder which they had committed.13.  on 9 october 1995 a public prosecutor at the istanbul state security court filed an indictment with that court, charging the applicant with attempting to undermine the constitutional order, an offence prescribed by article 146 § 1 of the former criminal code.16.  on 13 september 2007, relying on, inter alia, the applicant’s and his co-accused k. a.’s statements to the police, the istanbul assize court held that the applicant had committed the offence under article 146 § 1 of the criminal code and sentenced him to life-imprisonment.
13.  on 27 february 2009 the applicant countersigned d.’s letter with the statement “to [k.] for execution taking into account the requirements of article 88 of the customs code of ukraine” (k. was chief of the regional customs office for power, and the legal provision in question set out the duties and responsibilities of customs applicants).25.  according to the government, the applicant and his lawyer studied the decision from 4.15 p.m. to 6.45 p.m. 26.  at 7.02 p.m. the investigator drew up a report on the applicant’s arrest with a general reference to articles 106 § 2 and 115 of the code of criminal procedure (“the ccp”, see paragraph 50 below).between the date of the initiation of the related proceedings against d. on 10 june and the applicant’s arrest on 23 june 2010, he had twice been abroad and had returned to ukraine of his own free will; he had duly reported for questioning as a witness as soon as he had been summoned; and he was willing to continue his cooperation with the authorities in good faith.the court noted, in particular: “... the particularly large amount of damage caused to rosukrenergo ag and the existence of serious consequences, manifested in the prestige of the state being undermined, indicate a high degree of danger to society from the crime, a primary ground for imposing on a. v. makarenko a preventive measure entailing his being remanded in custody.” 31.  the appellate court also concurred with the first-instance court’s finding that the applicant might take advantage of his social connections and wealth to influence the investigation if he remained at liberty.in all those rulings the appellate court noted that it had had regard to “the circumstances of the case, information as a whole about the character of the accused, the gravity of the offence ... and the absence of any grounds for changing the preventive measure [in his respect] to a more lenient one”.
according to the police records, the above statement was made at 5 p.m. however, as subsequently established (see paragraph 59 below), that was an error and the actual time of the statement was about 10 a.m. 10.  m. provided the police with a banknote of usd 100, two banknotes of usd 20 and one of usd 10. a detective officer put a special luminescent fluid on the banknotes and returned them to m. that act took place in the presence of two attesting witnesses and was documented in a report.the serial number of the usd 100 banknote seized from the applicant, as indicated in the report, differed by one letter (out of eleven characters) from the one noted in the report on marking the bill with the luminescent fluid drawn up earlier that day (see paragraph 10 above).when questioned in her lawyer’s presence on the same day, the applicant admitted that on 7 february 2004 she had hinted to m. that the examination of her application was likely to take time and that the applicant would be prepared to speed up the procedure before the higher authority, which she had not intended to do in reality.by the same ruling, the kyivskyy court ordered the prosecution authorities to ensure the mandatory presence of t. 35.  on 16 february 2006 the kyivskyy court found the applicant guilty of fraud and incitement to bribery and sentenced her to a fine of uah 5,000 (then equivalent to eur 830).she submitted, in particular, that “the [first‑instance] court had not given any legal assessment to the fact that the criminal proceedings against [her] had been instituted on 27 march 2009 and discontinued on 12 october 2012, and that all that time [she] had been under an undertaking not to abscond, which had been lifted by the ruling on the termination of the criminal proceedings of 12 october 2012, that being confirmed by [the investigator’s] letter of 22 june 2012” (see paragraph 45 above).
7. on 3 july 2009 the edirne public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the edirne assize court charging the applicant with membership of an organised criminal organisation as well as fraud and robbery.9.  on 12 august 2009 the 9th chamber of the istanbul assize court held a preparatory hearing and ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention.14.  on 30 september 2010 the 9th chamber of the istanbul assize court held the third hearing in the proceedings and again prolonged the applicant’s detention.15.  on 11 october 2011 the 9th chamber of the istanbul assize held the seventh hearing in the proceedings and released the applicant from detention on remand.16.  at the time when he present application was lodged with the court, the proceedings against the applicant were still pending before the first‑instance court.
11.  on 22 september 2009 the court of appeal ruled on the appeals lodged by the high state prosecutor and x. the applicants learned of this judgment on 27 may 2010 when checking the case-file at the high court.13.  on 7 june 2010 the president of the supreme court notified them that she had been informed by the high court president that the case file had been “at the court of appeal in order for it to rule on [their] appeal in respect of costs of criminal proceedings given that it had not been ruled upon by [its] judgment of 22 september 2009”.14.  on 24 october 2011 the applicants requested the president of the high court to transmit the case file to the court of appeal given that they had learnt that the file had been archived in the high court, contrary to what that court had said to the president of the supreme court.18.  on 17 june 2011 the court of first instance (osnovni sud) in podgorica rejected the claim (odbacuje se) finding that the high court had awarded them the costs, which judgment had become final in the meantime, and that the issue was thus res iudicata.22.  on 10 january 2017 the high court informed the agent’s office that the court of appeal had not ruled on the applicants’ appeal in respect of costs of criminal proceedings, but that the high court, after its judgment of 14 october 2008 had become final, had issued a decision on 8 december 2011 ordering that the applicants’ representative be paid the sum awarded thereby.
12.  on 26 june 2000 the general staff military prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the general staff military court charging the applicant with embezzlement under section 131 of military criminal code, involving in trade activities as a soldier under additional section 1 of military criminal code and breaching article 13 of the law no.the siblings of the applicant, şükrü aymelek and ulviye toprakkıran were also charged with the same bill of indictment with embezzlement and breaching article 13 of the law no.13.  on 29 may 2001 the general staff military prosecutor filed an additional bill of indictment and charged the accused with additional acts related to the crimes already stated in the first bill of indictment.20.  on 13 january 2014 the applicant requested from the military court of cassation to reopen the criminal proceedings alleging that a witness who had not been heard, was ready to give statements before the court.21.  on 19 february 2014 rejected the applicant’s request for reopening of the criminal proceedings, on the grounds that the witness’ statements did not have any evidential value, which could warrant a lesser sentence or the acquittal of the applicant.
4.  the applicant was born in 1963 and at the time of lodging his application he was serving his prison sentence in the bolu f-type prison.5.  on 3 december 2007 the applicant wrote a letter to the ministry of justice, in which he had praised the imprisoned leader of the pkk, abdullah öcalan by using the honorific “sayın”, meaning esteemed.6.  pursuant to the regulations on the administration of penitentiary institutions and the execution of sentences, the applicant was found guilty of breaching prison order by the bolu f- type prison disciplinary board (referred hereafter as “the board”).7.  on 12 december 2007 the applicant was sentenced to 11 days’ solitary confinement on the orders of the board, on account of his statements in the above mentioned letter.9.  on 15 january 2008 the bolu assize court upheld the judgment of 25 december 2007.
6.  on 16 february 2006 a gathering was held in adana on the anniversary of the arrest of abdullah öcalan, the leader of the pkk (kurdistan workers’ party), an illegal armed organisation.the prosecutor alleged that the accused had participated in the public gathering in question in response to calls made by the pkk and had resisted the police officers, and that they had therefore acted on behalf of the pkk.the assize court did not find it established that the applicant had attended the reading out of the press statement in response to calls made by the pkk or that she had injured any police officers.the court nonetheless considered that on 16 february 2006 the applicant had gone to the dtp building with a view to disseminating propaganda in support of the pkk and that she should therefore be convicted under section 7(2) of law no.11.  taking into account the applicant’s good behaviour during the trial and the absence of any previous criminal record, the court suspended the pronouncement of her conviction on condition that she did not commit another intentional offence for a period of five years, under article 231 of the code of criminal procedure (hükmün açıklanmasının geri bırakılması).
the event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at bolotnaya square, which was supposed to end at 7.30 p.m. the march was peaceful and held without any disruptions, but when the marchers arrived at bolotnaya square it became apparent that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue, allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting.along with the gravity of the charges, the court based its decision on the findings that “the reasons which initially warranted the detention have not changed” and that “no other measures of restraint would secure the aims and goals of the judicial proceedings”.it held, in particular, as follows: “between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. on 6 may 2012 ... at bolotnaya square ... unidentified persons ... called those present [at the venue] to move outside the agreed meeting venue, to defy the lawful orders of the police ..., to use violence ... which led to mass disorder accompanied by the use of violence against public officials in connection with the performance of their duties [and] the destruction of property.on the same day at 5 p.m. at the latest [the defendants] acquired the criminal intent to participate in mass disorder and to use violence against ... police officers ... moreover ... the participants of the acts of mass disorder threw chunks of tarmac, stones, sticks and other objects at the police ... which hit them on various parts of their body, and [the defendants] ... [who] participated in the acts of mass disorder ... implemented their criminal intent to use violence against public officials ... applied physical force which was not a danger to the life or health of those [officials] ... [the applicant] ... who was wearing a surgical mask to hide his face, together with unidentified persons ... tried to liberate those arrested by the police for a breach of public order and pushed the police officers away ... ... [the applicant] used violence against police officer [t.] which did not endanger his life or health ... [the applicant] ... from 5 p.m. to 9.40 p.m. ... when unidentified participants of acts of mass disorder tried to break the police cordon, acting intentionally and using force, grabbed [t.’s] hand and then pulled it off the person whom [t.] was arresting, thus impeding his apprehension, which caused [t.] pain.... the court considers the [defendants’] arguments that they were protecting somebody from police officers or happened to be victims of the police’s use of force as farfetched and aimed at the mitigation of their responsibility ...” 31.  the applicant was sentenced to three years and six months’ imprisonment, calculated on the basis of a three-year prison term under article  212 § 2 of the criminal code, partly concurrent with a term of one year and three months under article 318 § 1. the applicant’s pre-trial detention counted towards the prison sentence.
the event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at bolotnaya square which was supposed to end at 7.30 p.m. the march was peaceful and held without any disruptions, but when the marchers arrived at bolotnaya square it became apparent that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue, allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting.on the same day the district court granted the investigator’s application and extended the applicant’s detention until 6 november 2012. it relied on the gravity of the charges and information on the applicant’s character, which gave it sufficient grounds to presume that he might reoffend, threaten witnesses and other participants of the criminal proceedings, destroy evidence or otherwise obstruct the proper administration of justice.20.  on 1 march 2013 the basmannyy district court authorised a further extension of the applicant’s detention until 28 may 2013. the court relied on the gravity of the charges and the need to allow the defendants sufficient time to read the investigation case file.on the same day at 5 p.m. at the latest [the defendants] acquired the criminal intent to participate in mass disorder and to use violence against ... police officers ... moreover ... the participants of the acts of mass disorder threw chunks of tarmac, stones, sticks and other objects at the police ... which hit them on various parts of their body, and [the defendants] ... [who] participated in the acts of mass disorder ... implemented their criminal intent to use violence against public officials ... applied physical force which was not a danger to the life or health of those [officials] ... thus, [the applicant] used violence against police officer [k.] which did not endanger his life or health ... ... between 5.10 p.m. and 8.20 p.m. ... unidentified participants of acts of mass disorder ... intentionally seized [k.] by his uniform and knocked him down, while [the applicant] together with other unidentified participants of acts of mass disorder, acting intentionally ... tore off [k.’s] anti-riot helmet ... and punched and kicked him several times on his head and body, meanwhile [the applicant] punched [k.’s] head at least once and at least once kicked [k.] on the body when the latter was lying on the ground.... ... the court considers the [defendants’] arguments that they were protecting somebody from the police officers or happened to be victims of the police’s use of force as farfetched and aimed at the mitigation of their responsibility ... ... no medical document which could prove the presence of injuries on the [applicant’s] body ... was provided to the court.” 31.  the applicant was sentenced to three years and seven months’ imprisonment, calculated on the basis of a three-year prison term under article 212 § 2 of the criminal code, partly concurrent with a term of one year and eight months under article 318 § 1 of the criminal code.
with that in mind, [the scrpa] notes that the inappropriate depiction of christ and mary in the advertisements in question encourages a frivolous attitude towards the ethical values of the christian faith, promotes a lifestyle which is incompatible with the principles of a religious person, and that way the persons of christ and mary are degraded as the sacred symbols of christianity ... in addition, the inappropriate depiction of christ and mary in the advertisements was not only likely to offend the feelings of religious people but actually offended them because [the scrpa] has received complaints about them ... and the lithuanian bishops conference has received a letter expressing dissatisfaction of the [nearly a hundred] religious individuals, which demonstrates that the feelings of religious people have been offended.when determining the penalty, it took into account several circumstances: the advertisements had been displayed in public places and must have reached a wide audience, and there had been complaints about them; at the same time, the advertisements had only been displayed for a few weeks and only in the city of vilnius; the applicant company had stopped displaying them after it had been warned by the authorities, and it had cooperated with the scrpa; it had been the first such violation committed by the applicant company.the court held: “the entirety of the evidence in the present case gives grounds to conclude that the advertisements displayed by [the applicant company] are clearly contrary to public morals, because religion, as a certain type of world view, unavoidably contributes to the moral development of the society; symbols of a religious nature occupy a significant place in the system of spiritual values of individuals and the society, and their inappropriate use demeans them [and] is contrary to universally accepted moral and ethical norms.295‑a), it stated that it was not possible to discern throughout europe a uniform conception of the significance of religion in society and that even within a single country such conceptions might vary; for that reason it was not possible to arrive at a comprehensive definition of what constituted a permissible interference with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression where such expression was directed against the religious feelings of others, and a certain margin of appreciation was therefore to be left to the national authorities in assessing the existence and extent of the necessity of such interference.the supreme administrative court considered that the panel which had adopted the decision of 25 april 2014 had taken into account the fact that catholicism was the religion of a very big part of the lithuanian population and that the use of its most important symbols in the advertisements, which distorted their meaning, offended the feelings of religious people.
4.  the administration replied to that formal notice by letter of 10 september 2007. the latter stated that the redevelopment works mentioned should be considered in the light of compliance with the regulations on public property, which could take some time.the administration pointed out that the practical workshops were held on the ground floor of the building and posed no problems with regard to access, and that the applicant would consequently have no difficulty in attending the courses administered in the framework of those workshops.it explained that the only reason why the applicant’s participation in the practical workshops had previously been described as problematic (see paragraph 8 above) was that such workshops necessitated a considerable physical effort and that his particular situation required some thought regarding the type of assistance with which he could be provided.in the reasoning of its judgment it stated, in particular, that the buildings in question had been erected in accordance with the regulations in force in 1988. the court took the view that although it was incumbent on the authorities to apply the technical guidelines set out in the legislation subsequently enacted for persons with disabilities, it could not be contended that the respondent authority had not followed those guidelines during the construction of a building erected in 1988, before the guidelines had come into force.lastly, the judgment mentioned that the authorities had informed the complainant that architectural measures would be adopted, depending on the available budget, and that a person would be appointed to assist him in attending the courses.
the amendments operated to bring rates of rent up to eur 185 per year where these were below that figure; however this increase did not apply to the applicants’ property, the rent of which was already more than eur 185. pursuant to the current law the rent applicable in the applicants’ case is increased every three years in accordance with the increase in the inflation index (capped at a 100%).the applicants asked the court to order the eviction of the tenant and the latter to pay for ordinary and extraordinary repairs, and to award damages for the loss sustained as a result of the low amount of rent received, and in connection with the disbursements they had to make for their own housing.1 to the convention as a result of the application of articles 2 and 12 of chapter 158 of the laws of malta and ordered that the tenant be evicted within four months of the date of judgment.it considered that act xxii of 1979, which provided for the conversion of a temporary emphyteusis into a lease, had constituted interference with the applicants’ right of property as it had created a forced landlord-tenant relationship for an indeterminate time, during which they had not been able to use their own property and during which they had suffered financial losses as a result of the low amount of rent received, which had been established by law.in or around 2013 the applicants were given notice to vacate the property which they had been leasing as their ordinary residence since 1996 (see paragraph 11 above), as there were plans to demolish the property in 2014. at the time when they were renting this property, the second applicant’s mother had been one of five co-owners of the dwelling, and it appears that the second applicant has since become a co-owner.
the latter asked not to have his identity revealed for the following reasons: “the people who committed the crime are violent and have a criminal record and that’s why i’m afraid of their threats; they are armed, convicted, i fear for my life and the life of my family, i fear reprisals.” 11.  on photographs shown in evidence, both witnesses identified one of the applicants as having fired on the café and dz.he also stated that after the incident mr ramiz asani had told him the following: “what you’ve seen and heard on television about the incident with m.m.’s car – i did it in revenge for the killing of my brother ...” 13.  on the same date, the investigating judge opened an investigation against the applicants and dz.he did not, however, allow an additional ballistic examination and refused to admit further evidence regarding the intensity of the street lighting at the scene at the relevant time (the applicants alleged that the street light had been too low to allow the anonymous witnesses to see the assailants).the applicants’ presence at the scene when the incident happened, as well as the development and dynamics of events, was established on the basis of the testimony of the anonymous witnesses “korab” and “vodno”, which the court regarded as credible and consistent despite “small differences which were due to the intensity of the shooting and fear for their lives”.they dismissed appeals lodged by the applicants in which they complained inter alia that the trial court had failed to admit evidence proposed by the defence, that their conviction could not be based solely on the statements of the anonymous witnesses, which had been unlawfully obtained, and that the trial court had not examined b.h.
in the course of the investigation, the police organised an ambush, which led to the applicant and his acquaintance, mr d., being arrested.7.  on 4 september 2006 the odesa regional court of appeal, sitting as a court of first instance, found the applicant guilty of the illegal handling of arms, robbery with violence, intentional murder for profit and an attempt on the life of a law-enforcement officer.having regard to the fact that the applicant had previously been convicted of the intentional infliction of fatal injuries and that he had committed the crimes at issue while on probation following release in october 2005, the court sentenced him to life imprisonment.the applicant contended that the first-instance court had erred in its assessment of the facts of the case and their legal classification.9.  on 30 january 2007, following a hearing with the participation of mr d. (the other defendant) and his lawyer, as well as the prosecutor, but without the applicant or any representative from his side, the supreme court upheld the judgment of 4 september 2006.
7.  on 23 april 2013 the prefect of rome informed the public prosecutor at the rome youth court (“the youth court”) of the police operation carried out on 19 april 2013 and of the presence of v.c., a minor, at the scene.12.  on 2 july 2013 the public prosecutor informed the youth court that it was clear from the statements made by the parents and the applicant, who had admitted stopping school and using drugs, and from the psychiatrist’s diagnosis, that v.c.17.  on 9 december 2013 the youth court, after hearing evidence from the parents and adding to the file the conversations which the applicant, who had refused to give evidence, had had on facebook, and taking into account the fact that the social services had not attended the hearing, decided that it was necessary to place the child in the care of the social services.the public prosecutor stressed that the arrest of the two suspects was imminent, and requested the prosecutor at the youth court to inform him of the measures taken to implement the youth court’s decision of 9 december 2013 (see paragraph 17 above), given that the applicant was due to give evidence at the ad hoc hearing (incidente probatorio) (see paragraph 51 below).37.  on 19 december 2014 the karisma treatment centre informed the social services that the applicant’s problems persisted and that it did not have the necessary infrastructure to deal with them in view of the applicant’s drug addiction.
there is someone to take care of my child.” according to the court record of the hearing, the mother’s statement had been preceded by an intervention by the prosecutor, who had indicated that it was necessary to comply with the requirements of article 152 § 6 of the code of criminal procedure, so that if the family had no relatives or friends to care for the child, the municipality had to be informed with a view to placing her in a child-care centre, kindergarten or boarding facility (интернат).she directed her claim against the varna regional office of the ministry of the interior, the prosecution service, the ministry of justice and the supreme judicial council, and sought to establish the responsibility of the authorities that had left her unattended during her parents’ detention in december 2002, in breach of the child protection act.36.  the varna regional court rejected the applicant’s claim on 27 july 2009, finding that it had not been proven that she had been left alone while her parents had been detained in december 2002. the court also held that, in the three days following the court hearing on 6 december 2002, the applicant’s mother had not sought to have the record of the hearing rectified, even though it was legally possible to do so.given that the mother had stated during the hearing on her detention that someone had been taking care of the child, the conditions set out in article 152 of the code of criminal procedure had not been met and, therefore, the institutions involved in the criminal proceedings had not been obliged to pursue steps towards taking the applicant into care.40.  the appellate court confirmed the lower court’s decision on 10 december 2010. it found that, even if the applicant had been left alone after the arrest, responsibility for that could not be attributed to the police, the prosecuting authorities or the court, given that her mother had stated that there had been someone to take care of her.
10.  on 24 march and 21 april 2008 the district court adjourned the proceedings on procedural grounds and in order to allow the applicant to add to the file the relevant documents proving that he and the other six plaintiffs were entitled to claim the land in question and that the applicant was authorised by the other plaintiffs to represent them.11.  on 16 june 2008 the district court suspended the proceedings in accordance with article 242 § 1(2) of the former code of civil procedure (hereinafter referred to as the “ccp” – see paragraph 25 below) on the grounds that none of the parties had attended the hearing scheduled for that date.12.  on 26 january 2009 the district court amended of its own motion the decision of 16 june 2008. it held that some of the parties had in fact attended the hearing of 16 june 2008. however, the proceedings had had to be suspended on the grounds that, according to the available evidence, four of the other six plaintiffs had died prior to 2005 and the applicant had taken no steps to identify the heirs of the deceased parties in order to enable the court to summon them as parties to the proceedings.14.  on 8 october and 3 december 2009 the prahova county court (hereinafter referred to as the “the county court”) adjourned the aforementioned appeal proceedings brought by the applicant in order to allow the private company x to prepare its defence and the applicant to submit proof of the steps he had taken to identify the home addresses of the other six plaintiffs, and to serve a summons on the six plaintiffs by publishing it in a national newspaper.moreover, the summonses sent by the court to the known foreign addresses of the other six plaintiffs provided by the applicant had either not been received by the recipients or had been returned because the intended recipients had been unknown at those addresses.
27.  on 4 july 2012 the applicant company lodged a complaint with the vilnius regional administrative court, urging it to revoke the part of the government resolution where it had been decided that the buildings at 21 miško street (the location of the applicant company’s buildings) would be demolished and to order the authorities to amend the management plan.the court explained that the applicant company could only raise the issue of the lawfulness of the government resolution in the context of an individual case regarding violation of its specific rights (by complaining against an individual legal act, by which the government resolution and the decisions of the management plan would be implemented).the applicant company’s request to organise the procedure to amend the management plan so that it included the land in question in the landscape management recreational zone was dismissed because the applicant company had failed to address the authorities or the courts after the approval of the management plan.the court stated that it was a commonly known fact that the applicant company’s buildings had been earmarked for removal at the time the purchase agreement had been concluded, and the applicant company, as a diligent legal entity, should have assessed the legal status of the buildings and the restrictions on their use.37.  in december 2016 the applicant company appealed and asked the supreme administrative court to refer the matter to the constitutional court; to overrule the decision of the authority in charge of the curonian spit national park of 30 december 2013; to order the authority to issue the applicant company with the planning permission required to carry out major repair work and to award it eur 48,489 in respect of pecuniary damage.

it puts him in a different position as regards the perception of the degree of damage caused by the excessive length of one of the disputes compared to the position of a person participating in only one or only a few judicial proceedings (compare, in similar terms, the european court of human rights inadmissibility decision in the case of havelka v. the czech republic, of 20 september 2011, applications nos.30 cdo 3340/2011, the supreme court added that if in the proceedings concerned the procedure under article 118 §§ 1 and 2 of the code of civil procedure (ccp) has been followed, the application of the possibility to increase compensation is limited by the rules for submitting new facts and modifying the initial action in the proceedings before the court of first instance; the same applies in similar fashion to appeal proceedings (see article 205a § 1 and article 2016 § 2 of the ccp).in the present case, the appellant raised a claim for compensation for the length of the compensation proceedings only in the course of the proceedings before the appellate court, in a submission of 11 april 2012 (file page 128) ... so it was an inadmissible new claim.” 11.  on 24 april 2014 the constitutional court (ústavní soud) dismissed a constitutional complaint (ústavní stížnost) by the applicant.it found that awarding him financial compensation would be against good morals, given the circumstances of the case, namely the applicant’s conduct in the main proceedings, the conduct of the courts, the importance of the subject matter of the proceedings for the applicant as well as his character, his relation towards the state and society and his lack of respect for the rights of others.having regard to the overall length of the main proceedings, the municipal court determined the sum to be awarded to the applicant (czk 108,000 – eur 4,000) and then adjusted it with regard to the length of the compensation proceedings (+20%), procedural difficulties in the main proceedings (-30%) and the importance of what had been at stake for him (-40%).

as to the risk of absconding, the judge took into account the statements of the suspects, including the fact that some of them had decided to remain silent, the gravity of the charges and the severity of the anticipated penalty, and concluded that there was a risk of the suspects absconding if they were released.having regard to the nature, character and type of offences that are being investigated, as well as the gravity of the charges, the level of criminal responsibility, the anticipated penalty ... the panel considers that there is a real risk of flight if the defendants are released ... the risk of flight is further reinforced by the financial circumstances of the defendants, given the fact that most of them do not have immovable property in their name ... the panel has taken into consideration the fact that most of the defendants have families and that they are parents, as well as that [some of the defendants, including ms e. ramkovska] have immovable property in their name, but these circumstances do not eliminate the risk of the defendants absconding and are insufficient to secure their attendance at the pre-trial proceedings.” 11.  the panel also considered that, if released, the suspects might interfere with the investigation.in this connection, it took note of the fact that the examination of prosecution witnesses had been scheduled for 21, 25 and 31 january 2011. the fact that some of the suspects (but not the applicants) had decided to remain silent was considered by the panel as a factor that heightened the risk of interference with the investigation.having regard to the nature, character and type of offences with which the accused are charged under the indictment; given that the accused committed the criminal offences as a well-organised and compact group consisting of organisers and members with assigned roles in taking the incriminated actions they are suspected of; having regard to the degree of danger for society and criminal responsibility; having regard to the type and severity of the anticipated penalty for the type of offences of which the accused are suspected, including the possibility of an effective prison sentence, the panel considers that there is a real risk of flight if the accused are released ... the risk of flight is increased if the behaviour of h.r., n.r., r.i. and r.c [other accused] is taken into consideration given that they remain unavailable to the law-enforcement authorities ... in the assessment of the risk of reoffending as a ground warranting further extension of the pre-trial detention, the panel took into account the nature and type of the offences with which the accused were charged ... and the fact that the defendants are accused of acting as a well-organised group, consisting of organisers and members, with assigned roles in the business structures of several companies, that acted over a prolonged period of time.the fact that the majority of the accused still occupy the same posts in the companies involved in the criminal proceedings, from which they took the incriminated actions of which they are accused in the criminal proceedings at hand, generates a risk of reoffending if the accused are released ...” 19.  on 28 march 2011 the applicants lodged appeals complaining that the court order violated their rights under article 5 of the convention, in that it did not provide concrete reasons for their detention.
7.  on 2 december 2014 the russian ministry of justice issued an exclusion order, declaring the applicant’s presence in russia undesirable and prohibiting his return to russia until 2020. further to the exclusion order, on 4 march 2015 the migration authorities issued a deportation order in respect of the applicant and he was later arrested.12.  on 26 january 2016 the saint petersburg city court upheld the judgment of 15 december 2015. the appeal court considered that the applicant could still be removed to the country from which he had arrived in russia if there was a readmission agreement with that country; that he could be held in detention for a maximum of two years, which was the statutory period for the enforceability of a penalty; and that the cao had not required the trial judge to set any time-limit when ordering his placement in a detention centre for foreigners.15.  on 22 july 2016 the district court dismissed an application from the applicant to terminate the proceedings to enforce the judgment of 15 december 2015. the court held that there was no statutory basis in the cao or other legislation for granting such an application.19.  from 15 december 2015 to 5 august 2016 (when the application was lodged with the court) and then further until 22 june 2017 the applicant was kept in the сentre for the temporary confinement of foreign nationals (центр временного содержания иностранных граждан) in krasnoye selo.they noted that the toilets (consisting of a “hole”) in the cells on the fourth floor were separated from the main area by a low partition or curtain and that it was not possible to switch the lights on or off from inside the cells.

in his comments on the third-party submissions before the court, the applicant added that at the time he had been “involved with” the independent media centre (indymedia); prior to the g8 summit, he had taken leave from his television assignments and had “focused on media work” in the framework of linc.11.  it follows from the identical reports of two police officers that they approached the applicant and ordered him to cease his “unlawful actions”; despite several warnings, the applicant refused; he was then ordered to follow them to the police vehicle in order to be taken to the police station.physical force had to be used against him to make him get into the vehicle.” the record also had the following pre-typed line with added handwritten text: “witnesses, attesting witnesses, victims: go., [address]; so., [address] ...” 17.  several hours later, a new administrative-offence record was compiled by officer d. the applicant read and signed it at around 7 p.m. according to the record, the applicant was arrested because he had “disobeyed a lawful order from a police officer”.21.  according to the applicant, the court refused to hear the officers who had arrested him (“the arresting officers”), the officers who had compiled the initial and the amended administrative-offence records or anyone mentioned in the record (see paragraphs 16-17 above).the appeal court held as follows: “[the applicant] argued in his statement of appeal that the trial court had not taken into account that as a journalist he had not taken part in the so-called “anti-globalist” protest; the trial court had not examined prosecution witnesses while the judgment was solely based on the written reports made by the police officers who had arrested him ... the trial judge gave a proper assessment of the officers’ reports and testimonies, including the testimony by k. who had been examined at the defendant’s request.
4.  on 28 february 1996 the applicants and the debtor (jsp “tara” cetinje) reached a court approved settlement before the cetinje municipal court, whereby the debtor undertook to pay the applicants specified amounts in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.6.  the debtor ultimately paid part of the amounts determined in the settlement.9.  in the course of the insolvency proceedings the podgorica commercial court acknowledged the applicants’ claims.10.  on 23 december 2009 the podgorica commercial court terminated (zaključio) the insolvency proceedings against the debtor, but continued the proceedings against the debtor’s estate.14.  it transpires from the case file that at the time the court settlement was concluded and became final (see paragraphs 4 and 5 above) the debtor was a company predominantly comprised of state‑controlled capital.
8.  on 16 november 2009, after the investigator had reclassified their actions as a more serious offence, the zavolzhskiy district court in tver ordered the applicant’s placement in custody, citing the gravity of the charges and the fact that he had recanted.on 11 december 2009 the tver regional court upheld the detention order on appeal, finding as follows: “[the fact that the defendant] has a permanent place of residence, lives with his family, is studying in high school and does not have a criminal record does not provide a basis for rejecting unconditionally the investigator’s application [for a detention order] in the light of the extreme gravity of the charges.” 9.  on 12 january 2010 the district court extended the authorised detention period, pointing out that the applicant “had changed his attitude to the committed offence from an outright acknowledgement to a downright denial”.10.  on 20 january 2010 the investigator in charge of the applicant’s case refused the parents’ request for leave to visit their son, reasoning as follows: “the investigation appointed mr v. smirnov, the father of mr a. smirnov, as the legal representative of the underage defendant.the investigation considers that this kind of conduct on the part of mr v. smirnov may have a negative influence of the defendant mr a. smirnov, as well as interfering with the establishment of the truth in the criminal case.” 11.  on 25 january 2010 the supervising prosecutor rejected a complaint from the applicant’s father about the investigator’s decision, recalling that the granting of leave to visit a detainee was at the investigator’s discretion rather than being a legal obligation and that the arguments for refusing leave were “persuasive and well-justified”.12.  on 3 february 2010 the district court issued a further extension order, holding that the applicant had been charged with a particularly serious offence and that the circumstances warranting the application of a custodial measure still obtained.
according to the indictment, during the gathering, the second applicant had read out a press declaration containing statements praising the tkp/ml and i̇brahim kaypakkaya, and the following slogans had been chanted by the demonstrators: “i̇brahim is our leader”, “our struggle continues and shall continue”, “i̇brahim kaypakkaya is immortal”, “down with the usa” and “we will drown fascism in the blood it has shed”.3713. in its judgment, the assize court held that the applicants had disseminated propaganda in favour of the tkp/ml, given that the second applicant had read out the press statement and the first applicant had chanted slogans.8.  taking into account the applicants’ good behaviour during the trial and the fact that they had no previous criminal convictions, the court suspended pronouncement of the applicants’ conviction on the condition that they did not commit another intentional offence for a period of five years, under article 231 of the code of criminal procedure (hükmün açıklanmasının geri bırakılması).9.  the applicants filed an objection against the decision of 31 march 2009. in their petition, they stated that the first-instance court had erred in interpreting the facts and the law, and they asked to be acquitted of the charges against them.10.  on 20 july 2009 the diyarbakır assize court held that the application of article 231 of the code of criminal procedure in the case was in line with the domestic law, and rejected the applicants’ objection without examining the merits of the case.
10.  the government have submitted to the court a written statement from k., which reads as follows: “following the customs control measure of an interview and given [d.’s and the applicant’s] behaviour and the nature of their professional activities, a supposition/assumption (предположение) arose that they might have banned printed and/or audio- and video-material with extremist content in their bags ... since [the applicant] noted in his declaration that he had electronic storage devices, i made a written report to the acting chief officer of the customs checkpoint concerning the need for carrying out an inspection of [the applicant’s] bags in the framework of the risk management system and for involving officer b., an it specialist.the inspection was approved by the chief officer by way of his handwritten approval on my report ... the chief officer issued an order for an inspection and authorised b. and myself to use the sampling procedure ... the above-mentioned supposition/assumption was based on the presence of a folder labelled “extremist” in the laptop ... data from it was copied on the same day [on the spot] ... to dvd rw disks, which were then sealed in a plastic bag ... [the applicant], b. and two attesting witnesses were present ... the sampling report contained a detailed description of the data that was copied, including the names of the folders that had been copied, their number and the number of files in each folder ... the copying was carried out by officer b. i did not open or copy any electronic folders or files ... i did not read any ‘correspondence’ (personal correspondence or other text material) ... an order to carry out a forensic examination was issued on 8 september 2009 ... because on 27 august 2009 we had no information about the relevant expert organisations for that type of forensic examination ...” 11.  the government have also submitted a written statement from officer b., which reads as follows: “in accordance with the order for an inspection [no.17.  the applicant submitted the following written statement by ms d. to the court: “at 10 a.m. we presented ourselves at the border control and presented our passports ... we were then taken to the customs control area ... there the customs officers asked [the applicant] to hand over his press card; so they were aware that he had one ... officer k. interviewed us about the purpose of our visit to abkhazia and our professional and civic activities ... i heard an fsb border officer tell the customs officers about the need for a ‘special check’ of our electronic storage devices ... seeing a laptop in [the applicant’s] bag, the customs officers expressed their intention to copy all the available information ... i was interviewed (again) about my civic activities, my political views and about [the applicant’s] professional activities ... the type of work done and the publications ...” 18.  on 9 september 2009 the applicant was informed that a report had been commissioned from a criminal forensics expert to determine whether the data copied from his laptop had any prohibited “extremist” content.23.  on 22 april 2010 the krasnodar regional court upheld the judgment, essentially reproducing the lower court’s reasoning as follows: “under articles 403 and 408 of the customs code, customs authorities fulfill the tasks and functions assigned to them by federal and other legislation ... and have the authority to apply measures prescribed by the customs code for ensuring compliance with customs legislation ... article 11 of the customs code defines goods (for the purposes of customs legislation) as movable property which is being transferred across the customs border.677 of 10 november 1995 by the customs authority (‘on preventing the transfer of prohibited printed, audio- and video-material across the customs border’) does not contradict the current customs legislation and has not been revoked because the current customs code contains article 13 concerning bans and limitations on the transfer of goods across the customs border ... in view of the above, the court agrees with the first-instance court that the customs inspection was authorised and carried out within customs control procedures and that the data was copied in line with russian presidential decree no.
16.  the court noted that pursuant to the ordinance, as it was at the time, it had been the commissioner who had had to make an offer, and in the event that the offer had been refused, the same commissioner had had to institute proceedings before the land arbitration board (hereinafter “the lab”).the same applied concerning their complaint of a lack of public interest despite amendments to the law in 2009 (act xxv of 2009) ‑ which had introduced the possibility of challenging the public interest of an expropriation before the lab, within twenty-one days of the declaration – in the court’s view it was unlikely that an individual would be able to challenge a public interest which had not been mentioned in the declaration.furthermore, the applicants had received no compensation in forty-five years, and the offer made to them in 2010 (solely after constitutional redress proceedings had been commenced) had been based on a valuation from 2005. in the court’s view, based on the rent as submitted by the commissioner, “capitalised” at the rate of 3.5% applicable in such cases, the value of the property was approximately eur 60,000, that is to say five times the sum offered by the commissioner.it considered that at the time of the declaration the taking (of the land on which the shop had stood) had been certainly in the public interest, specifically the building of roads giving access to the public.thus, without prejudice to any such claim for pecuniary compensation in respect of the property taken and the relative interest, the constitutional court awarded eur 10,000 in non‑pecuniary damages for the violation suffered, bearing in mind that the value of the property was eur 13,000, and it annulled the return order for the property.
according to the police records bearing the applicant’s signature, the applicant did not benefit from the assistance of a lawyer during the reconstruction of events and was not informed of his rights to request legal assistance and to remain silent.he further contested the relevance of the dna examination with regard to the tile-cutting machine, arguing that the court should conduct an examination of the wooden club indicated in his police statements, in order to prove that his confessions had not been genuine.24.  on 16 october 2003 the gebze assize court held that it lacked jurisdiction and forwarded the case to the kocaeli juvenile court as the applicant had been a minor at the time of the murder.25.  during the course of the hearings before the juvenile court, the applicant requested the court to obtain a new forensics report, claiming that there were discrepancies between the police report and that prepared by the istanbul forensics institute, as the latter noted that no blood sample could be found on either the tile-cutting machine or the wooden club.the court noted that it did not take account of the statements made by the applicant during his questioning by the police, as in any event it found him guilty on the basis of his subsequent statements confessing his acts, the records of the reconstruction of events, the forensics reports, the statements of a.s., and the bank transcripts which rebutted his defence with regard to the money he had spent after the murder.
7.  on 26 august 2009 the serving of his sentence of imprisonment was interrupted in order for him to take care of his elderly mother, who had undergone hip-replacement surgery in july 2009. the interruption came to an end on 26 october 2009, and the applicant was again placed in kremikovtsi prison hostel.9.  the applicant further said that cold water was only available between 6 and 8 a.m. and 6 and 8 p.m., and hot water was only available between 8 and 9 a.m. and 7 and 8 p.m. hygienic and sanitary materials were not regularly provided.12.  according to the applicant, material conditions in the cells in which he was placed after 28 october 2010 were significantly better in terms of heating, lighting and hygiene, and were satisfactory.15.  according to the 2010 report of the committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (“the cpt”) on the visit to bulgaria from 15 to 19 december 2008, in 2008 the number of the inmates detained in that facility was 622.17.  according to information provided by the government to the council of europe’s committee of ministers, in december 2013 the official capacity of the prison hostel was 426, whereas the actual number of inmates housed there was 493 (see neshkov and others v. bulgaria, nos.
the second applicant was founded in cetinje in 1990. the first applicant is the founder, the sole owner, and the executive director of the second applicant.in the proceedings before the commercial court the second applicant was represented by the first applicant and a lawyer duly authorised by the latter.8.  on 18 march 2014 the court of appeals (apelacioni sud) in podgorica rejected the appeal (žalba se odbacuje) as having been submitted by an unauthorised person, given that the lawyer had not been appointed by the insolvency administrator.10.  on 13 may 2014 the applicants’ representative filed an initiative with the constitutional court (ustavni sud) seeking the assessment of the constitutionality of section 76 of the insolvency act in force at the time.11.  on 23 july 2014 the constitutional court rejected the applicants’ constitutional appeal for “not having been lodged by a party to the domestic proceedings or by a person authorised to appeal on behalf of the person whose rights and freedoms were violated”.
9.  the detention hearing was fixed for 1 february 2007. the applicant’s lawyers had been notified of the date and time of the hearing on the previous day but did not show up and asked the investigator to postpone the examination of his application because they were busy in other proceedings.the district court appointed legal-aid counsel to represent the absent applicant, proceeded with the hearing and issued the detention order, referring to the fact of the applicant’s absconding to ukraine and from there to hungary, the gravity of the charges against him and the risk of interference with the investigation.14.  while in custody, the applicant asked the investigator to be allowed to receive visits from his mother, wife and children and also pastoral visits from two orthodox priests, a. and s. 15.  with the investigator’s consent, the applicant’s mother and daughters visited him on two occasions in april and may 2007. in august and september 2007 the investigator interviewed his wife and mother as potential witnesses but they refused to testify, invoking the constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination.as to the orthodox priests, on 29 march 2007 the investigator invoked the same ground to refuse a visit from s. on 30 august 2007 the investigator once again refused a pastoral visit, stating that the applicant should see the prison chaplain instead.18.  as regards family visits, on 30 october 2007 the tverskoy district court granted the applicant’s complaint in part, finding as follows: (a)  restrictions on visits from the applicant’s wife and mother in the period after the investigator had interviewed them as witnesses in the criminal proceedings had been lawful and within the discretion of the investigator; (b)  restrictions on visits from the wife and mother in the preceding period had not been justified but no relief could be afforded to the applicant because they had already been granted the status of witnesses and the investigator might wish to interview them again at some point in time; (c)  restrictions on visits from the applicant’s children were not justified and the investigator had an obligation to remedy a breach of the applicant’s rights.
conclusion: needs involuntary placement and treatment, in accordance with section 29(a) and (c) of the 1992 psychiatric assistance act.” 14.  on the same day the hospital applied for judicial authorisation of the applicant’s involuntary hospitalisation under section 29(a) and (c) of the psychiatric assistance act 1992, since the applicant was a danger to himself or others and there was a risk of significant damage to his health owing to the deterioration or aggravation of his psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric assistance.the patient needs to be involuntarily hospitalised and treated under section 29 (a) and (c) of the psychiatric assistance act of 1992. the examination and treatment of the patient can take place only under an in-patient regime ... [it is requested] 2.  that the request for authorisation be assessed on the premises of the hospital, since because of his mental state [the applicant] cannot be produced in court ...” 15.  on 5 may 2014 the savyolovskiy district court of moscow (савёловский районный суд г. москвы) held a hearing on the premises of the psychiatric facility.16.  during the hearing mr p., mr l., and mrs k. generally advanced the same arguments as those presented in the application for judicial authorisation (see paragraph 14 above), maintaining that the applicant needed to be hospitalised and treated, that he posed a danger to himself and others, and that there was a risk of significant damage to his health in the event of a deterioration in or aggravation of his psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric assistance.the authorisation issued by the court in a succinct manner stated that, while the applicant and his father objected to hospitalisation, the evidence presented by the medical panel of the hospital demonstrated that the applicant was a danger to himself and others and that his mental state might deteriorate in the absence of treatment.since the reaching of conclusions regarding the mental health of a person is within the exclusive competence of psychiatrists, the [district] court reasonably gave due regard to the report on the need to provide in-patient treatment to [the applicant] ... the appeal does not refer to any factual information demonstrating that the relatives of [the applicant] or other persons are capable of ensuring his and other persons’ safety without an in-patient treatment regime ...” 24.  the applicant’s subsequent attempts to initiate a review of the above-mentioned judicial decisions proved unsuccessful.
the applicant’s mother opposed the marriage and on the same day s.’s relatives took the applicant back to her mother’s house.6.  on 12 december 2009 the relatives of the applicant’s deceased father made the applicant go back to s.’s, because of the presumed consummation of the marriage.13.  on 23 september 2010 the applicant’s mother complained to the local police department and prosecutor’s office that the applicant had been forcefully held by s.’s family in inhuman conditions which led to deterioration of her health and coma.21.  on 26 july 2013 the sunzhenskiy district court of the ingushetiya republic quashed the decision of 1 october 2012. the court noted that the inquiry had been incomplete.27.  the case-file materials submitted by the government contain two decisions dated 6 march 2015. the first decision was taken by the investigator who refused to institute a criminal investigation in the applicant’s case.
the court of appeal held that the applicant had stated that he could influence two judges in kaišiadorys and thus decided to transfer the case to the kėdainiai district court so that the proceedings would be fair.the applicant’s statement that he had been going to conclude an agreement on legal services after he had taken ltl 30,000 were refuted by his conversation with g.t., where the applicant had stated that in case of failure he would keep 20% of the money and return the rest.the court further held that v.š.’s testimony, voice and video‑recordings showed that the applicant had not been incited to take a bribe and that the criminal conduct simulation model had been applied within the limits prescribed by the court (see paragraph 12 above).on the basis of the audio-recordings, the court also observed that the applicant had been the first to say that he could settle the matter for money.he again argued that he had been incited to commit an offence, that v.š., as a convicted prisoner, was not allowed to have recording equipment, that he had been provided with that equipment by the stt, and that the transcripts of the recordings should not have been used as evidence against him in the case.
they also noted that there were two separate issues in the instant case; on the one hand the use of a hidden camera and on the other hand the entrapment of a.c. 8.  by its decision 214/162/23.05.2002, the national radio and television council ordered the applicant company to pay one hundred thousand (100,000) euros (eur) for each of the two television shows during which the above-mentioned videos were shown, as well as to broadcast on three days in a row on its main news show the content of that decision.it further stated that the sanctions had been imposed following an assessment of the gravity of the offence, of the number of viewers of the two television shows, of the size of the investment that had been made by the applicant company and the fact that the television channel had been repeatedly fined in the past for the same offence.the domestic court stressed that from the text of the decision and from the minutes of the meeting of the national radio and television council it derived that the sanction was imposed to the applicant company solely and exclusively on account of the broadcast of the images that had been recorded by hidden means and not on account of the transmission of the news, whose source had been the secretly recorded images.when, however, public figures were in public spaces but not under the conditions described above, or acted in a way that was of interest to the public (such as in cases in which they engaged in behaviour contrary to what their public role entailed or contrary to the image they projected towards the public), then the right to receive and impart information could justify the recording of that person without his consent and the broadcasting of the relevant images by the media.in view of the above, the four judges considered that the application for annulment should be allowed, taking into account especially the fact that a.c. was a public figure, that the recording of his image had taken place in a public space (that is to say in a gambling arcade), and that the broadcasting of the relevant images had served the purpose of informing the public of behaviour on the part of a member of parliament that did not meet the requirements of his position.
his decision was worded as follows: “ ... the analysis of the files stored on the hard disk of [the applicant’s] work computer, used for his professional duties, contained the following: i) change of address certificate, signed in his name, certifying the transfer on 01/11/2003 of ms catherine [t.] to the lille general security service; the original certificate, sent to icf north-east enabled the notice period for vacating her flat to be shortened; ii) change of address certificate, bearing the ministry of justice logo, in the name of m.these facts are in breach of the special obligation of exemplary conduct inherent in the duties formerly performed by him within the general security service, and of the following provisions: i) article 5.2 of the rh 0006 on the principles governing the conduct of sncf officials; ii) the general security database rg 0029 (information systems security policy – user’s charter); iii) the ra 0024 “code of professional conduct” - conduct to be observed with regard to the company’s information system; iv) article 441-1 of the criminal code.” 13.  on 28 october 2008 the applicant brought proceedings before the amiens industrial tribunal (conseil des prud’hommes) seeking a ruling that he had been dismissed without genuine or serious cause.the social division of the court of cassation dismissed the appeal in a judgment of 4 july 2012. it held as follows: “ ... whilst files created by an employee with the assistance of the computer facilities supplied to him by his employer for work purposes are presumed to be professional in nature, meaning that the employer is entitled to open them in the employee’s absence, unless they are identified as personal, the description given to the hard disk itself cannot confer privacy on all the data contained in it.the court of appeal, which found that labelling the hard disk in the employee’s computer “d:/ personal data” could not enable him to use it for purely private purposes and prohibit access by the employer, drew the legitimate conclusion that the files in question, which had not been identified as “private” according to the recommendations of the it charter, could be lawfully opened by the employer.the court of appeal, which found that the employee had stored 1,562 pornographic files representing a volume of 787 megabytes over a period of four years, and that he had also used his work computer to produce forged certificates, rightly held that such misuse of his office equipment in breach of the rules in force at the sncf amounted to a breach of his contractual obligations.
5.  on 1 march 2012 the herceg novi first instance court rendered a judgment in favour of the applicant and ordered the applicant’s employer “vektra boka” ad herceg novi (hereinafter “the debtor”) to carry out a re‑allocation of plots for the construction of apartments.9.  on 22 march 2016 the commercial court suspended (obustavio) the enforcement due to the opening of the insolvency proceedings, which decision became final on 11 may 2016.11.  on 8 february 2013 the applicant instituted administrative proceedings seeking, on the basis of the above judgment, the removal of competing titles from the land register.12.  on 29 july 2015 the real estate directorate terminated (prekinuo) the administrative proceedings because the commercial court had commenced insolvency proceeding in respect of the debtor.17.  on 31 october 2016 the herceg novi first instance court transferred the case to the commercial court for further action due to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor.
17.  in a judgment of 16 october 2006 the civil court (first hall) in its ordinary jurisdiction found the housing secretary and the band club liable for the damage suffered by the owners in connection with the structural alterations to the property.19.  in 2007 the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings in relation to the property requisitioned in 1955, asking the court to declare that, as a result of the requisition order and the continued occupation of the premises, she had suffered a breach of her rights under article 14 of the convention and article 1 of protocol no.she asked the court to award her compensation for the taking of possession of the property and for the violations suffered, and to order any other measure capable of preventing the continuation of the violation, including the release of the property.bearing in mind the values established by the applicant’s expert as to the rental value and sale value of the property, which was mtl 180,000 (approximately eur 420,000) (pg.12 of the judgment), as well as the length of time the requisition was and remained in place, the court awarded the applicant eur 60,000 in compensation (kumpens) for the requisition of the premises and the violations found, noting it was not awarding civil damages (danni ċivili) in this context.1 was a consequence of the lack of a fair balance between the interests of the landlord and those of the tenant, and given that the validity of the lease was not at issue in the present case, it did not seem appropriate for it to evict the tenant; it sufficed that that unfair balance be redressed.
in order to respect the sovereignty and the will of the electorate as expressed in the framework of general elections, it is necessary that the by-election stage, which is subsidiary and complementary to the general elections, should observe the electoral threshold criterion which allows political parties to be represented in parliament.to allow candidates to stand in by-elections for political parties which are not represented in parliament would alter the latter’s political structure, [which is] incompatible with the votes cast by the electorate during the general elections which led to the constitution of the romanian people’s supreme representative body, with a specific political make-up, which can only be modified in the cases and conditions determined by law.11.  by judgment of 30 march 2010 the county court dismissed the party’s challenge, referring to the reasoning of the constitutional court in its aforementioned decision of 14 january 2010, to the effect that since partidul verde had failed to pass the electoral threshold in the general elections it could not put up candidates for the by-elections.in the case of independent candidates, however, such a criterion would be absurd; ... they are asked to submit support lists comprising the signatures of a minimum 4% of all the voters registered in the permanent electoral lists of the boards to which they submit their candidacies, [and the total number should not be lower that] 2,000 electors in the case of the chamber of deputies and 4,000 electors in the case of the senate.), but it can in no way exclude from the electoral process, in the case of by-elections, the candidacy of a person [standing as an] independent candidate without thereby infringing the fundamental right enshrined in article 37 of the constitution – the right to be elected.” 15.  the applicant stood in the 2012 general elections and obtained a seat in the chamber of deputies for a four-year mandate.
10.  on the same day an identification parade took place at the istanbul security directorate, in the absence of a lawyer, where one of the eyewitnesses of the incident identified the applicant in front of police officers and the public prosecutor at the state security court.according to the record drafted by police officers and signed by the applicant, the applicant described in detail what steps she had taken before the attack on the shopping centre and indicated how she had acted as a lookout while the other co-accused threw molotov cocktails in the shopping centre.14.  on 6 may 1999 the public prosecutor at the istanbul state security court filed an indictment with that court, and charged the applicant with carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory, pursuant to article 125 of the former criminal code.16.  on 7 may 2007 relying on, inter alia, the applicant’s statements to the police, the istanbul assize court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced her to life imprisonment for membership of an illegal organisation and the murder of thirteen people.in delivering its judgment, the assize court further took into consideration several items of evidence, such as the applicant’s statements to the police, public prosecutor and investigating judge, video recordings and written records of the crime scene visits, autopsy reports, eyewitness identifications, and the statements given by some of the accused persons.
9.  on 22 april 2003 the applicant was heard by the public prosecutor and the investigating judge at the istanbul state security court, again in the absence of a lawyer.in his statements before both the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, the applicant denied the accusations and maintained that his statements to the police had been given under duress.on the same day, upon the order of the investigating judge, the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention.10.  on 6 may 2003 the public prosecutor at the istanbul state security court filed an indictment accusing the applicant of membership of an illegal terrorist organisation under article 168 of the former criminal code, law no.12.  on 19 september 2006, relying on, inter alia, the applicant’s statements to the police, the istanbul assize court convicted the applicant under article 314 § 2 of the new turkish criminal code and sentenced him to six years and three months’ imprisonment.
(a)  as to the lawfulness of the restriction of liberty when the applicant was held at vilnius psychiatric hospital 28.  the vilnius regional court noted at the outset that according to articles 27 and 28 of the law on mental health care a person could be placed in hospital without his or her consent if there was a clear and present danger of him or her harming themselves or others.31.  the vilnius regional court also observed that there was no written evidence that the applicant had ever agreed to be placed in vilnius psychiatric hospital between 7 may and 26 june 2003. according to the forensic expert report, the applicant had not been able to understand her actions on 7 may 2003; however, the experts had not reached the same conclusion about the period between 8 may and 26 june 2003. that notwithstanding, the applicant had been forced to stay in hospital for fifty‑two days for treatment.the court also relied on doctor d.š.’s admission during court hearings that the applicant’s life had “not necessarily been in danger” for all of the fifty-two days of treatment and to the same conclusion by the applicant’s treating doctor a.g. in fact, the records signed by doctor a.g. on 8 and 12 may 2007 stating that the applicant was being treated at the hospital had given only one side (vienašališki) of the situation as they had not been countersigned by the applicant.in that context, the court also had regard to the applicant’s explanation that because of the side effects of the medication (sleepiness, inability to concentrate) and the possibility of physical restraint (being tied down) in case of disobedience, she had not been able to express her disagreement about being treated at the hospital in writing.in the particular case of the applicant, the court of appeal also referred to her open letter of 14 august 2003 to the srovės journalists (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above), where she had acknowledged that the television broadcast had been instigated by members of her family, that she had not been shown in the programme in person, and that she had been given a different name.
6.  on 4 may 2016 the applicant applied for refugee status alleging the risks to his life and safety in the light of the on-going conflict in syria.the request and the subsequent appeals were dismissed by the russian migration authorities and the courts.8.  by a judgment of 9 june 2016 the oktyabrskiy district court of izhevsk found the applicant in breach of migration rules, an offence under article 18.8 § 1.1 of the code of administrative offences, and ordered his expulsion.10.  on 22 june 2016 the court indicated to the respondent government, under rule 39 of the rules of court, that the applicant should not be extradited, expelled or otherwise involuntarily removed from russia to syria for the duration of the proceedings before the court.11.  on 13 january 2017 the supreme court of the russian federation on appeal amended the lower courts’ judgments and excluded administrative removal from the sanction, since it would have exposed the applicant’s life to risk in syria.
the applicant stated that he was a member of the illegal organisation in question, that he had joined them in a rural area, and that he had afterwards tried to collect money for the organisation in istanbul.12.  on 19 march 1999 the public prosecutor at the diyarbakır state security court filed an indictment with the diyarbakır state security court, charging the applicant under article 125 of the former turkish criminal code with membership of an illegal organisation and involvement in separatist activities against the republic of turkey.the court based its decision, inter alia, on the applicant’s statements to the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, and other witness statements taken by the police and the public prosecutor.20.  on 3 may 2005 the court of cassation quashed the decision of 16 september 2004 on the grounds that the details of a number of pkk activities for which the applicant had been held responsible had not been discussed in the decision in depth and that the case file lacked the necessary official reports.the applicant claimed during the trial that his statements during the preliminary investigation had been made under duress and he asked to be allowed to confront and examine a certain witness, namely s.k., whose statements had been relied on by the prosecutor in the indictment.
8.  on 3 may 2005 the governor of the correctional colony ordered the applicant’s placement in a punishment cell for thirteen days as a punishment for the disorderly state of his bed and bedside table.14.  by letters of 15 june, 8 august and 1 november 2005 the applicant asked the prosecutor’s office of the altay region to initiate criminal proceedings against the warders on duty.16.  it follows from the letter of 16 december 2005 from the prosecutor of barnaul that the prosecutor’s office had found that the applicant had been lawfully placed in a punishment cell.17.  following to further complaints by the applicant, in which he stated in particular that he had never asked the warders to close the door, the prosecutor of barnaul conducted an additional inquiry.he also questioned warders mr k. and mr s. who testified that the door to the applicant’s cell had been temporarily closed to prevent his communication with other inmates who were at that time receiving clean bedding in the storage room opposite to the applicant’s cell.
in the majority of the cells the toilet was merely a hole in the floor.6.  according to the government the applicant was provided with an individual sleeping place, except for the detention period between 18 november and 2 december 2008. there was artificial lighting, natural and artificial ventilation in the cells; the cells were heated.8.  the applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal and asked to ensure the applicant’s presence at the appeal hearing.9.  on 17 may 2010 the tomsk regional court upheld the conviction, having heard a prosecutor and the applicant’s lawyer.10.  on 13 february 2013 the presidium of the tomsk regional court quashed the decision of 17 may 2010 and remitted the case for a fresh examination.
9.  on 22 june 1999 the applicant was heard by the diyarbakır public prosecutor and the investigating judge at the diyarbakır state security court, again in the absence of a lawyer.in his statements before both the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, the applicant denied the accusations and maintained that his statements to the police had been given under duress.10.  on 30 june 1999 the public prosecutor at the diyarbakır state security court filed an indictment with that court, charging the applicant under article 168 § 2 of the former turkish criminal code, namely for membership of an illegal armed organisation.13.  on 12 june 2008, relying on, inter alia, the applicant’s statements to the police, the diyarbakır assize court convicted the applicant under article 314 § 2 of the new turkish criminal code and sentenced him to six years and three months’ imprisonment.in convicting the applicant, the assize court further took into consideration information on computer hard disks and print-outs, which had been seized in a house belonging to the illegal organisation, as well as the statements of several witnesses who had testified against the applicant.

(o kiek man žinoma, ir užverbavo).)on the one hand, the victim could ask the court to order the author of the work to retract the disputed statements, which would be a personal obligation on the part of the author which could not be transferred to his or her heirs.it held that, in the case at hand, the first-instance court had thoroughly examined the evidence collected during the criminal proceedings and the sources indicated by the author himself (see paragraph 20 above), and had reached the conclusion that, on the balance of probabilities, the events described in the disputed statements “were more likely not to have happened than to have happened”.the court stated that the factual accuracy of the disputed statements could be proved by anyone and not only by their author, and that the applicant and her brothers had been able to rely on the material collected during the criminal proceedings and on the submissions made by their father in the civil proceedings, as well as to submit new evidence themselves.accordingly, once the court had declared that the disputed statements in the book had been erroneous and insulting to the honour and dignity of others, the author’s legal successors had the obligation to ensure that those statements would no longer be disseminated.
in addition to the factual account from the parties summarised above, the court notes that the soundtrack to the video was a famous 1974 soviet song “the battle is going on again” (devoted to the victory of the 1917 revolution and optimism about the future of the communist regime).it could be seen on the video that once the applicant had broken the eggs in the frying pan and was about to approach the fire, while her friends held skewers with sausages, the two police officers appeared and the applicant explained something to them and they left.29.  on 17 june 2011 the pecherskyy court held a preparatory hearing, during which it rejected the applicant’s application for release with reference to the seriousness of the charge against her, “the nature and the circumstances of the offence of which she [was] accused”, as well as the fact that she had been declared wanted by the police.the judgment further stated in that regard: “... the court considers that by committing deliberate acts in a group which showed disrespect for the burial place of the unknown soldier and for the public tradition of honouring the memory of soldiers who perished defending or liberating kyiv and the lands of ukraine from the fascist hordes, and by subsequently presenting those actions as a protest, [the applicant] has tried to escape social condemnation of her conduct and criminal liability for the offence.” 34.  relying on local authority documents, the court dismissed the applicant’s submission that there was no established location for the tomb of the unknown soldier.relying on the definition of the desecration of a burial place under the burial and funeral business act (see paragraph 47 below), she maintained that in the absence of any intention by her to “defile the family or social memory of a deceased or to show contempt for a burial place, or social and religious principles and traditions”, there were no constituent elements of a crime in her actions.
7.  on 30 october 2001 the applicant was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the pkk (the kurdistan workers’ party).9.  on 3 november 2001 the applicant was heard by the public prosecutor and the investigating judge at the istanbul state security court, again in the absence of a lawyer.on the same day, upon the order of the investigating judge, the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention.10.  on 6 november 2001 the public prosecutor at the istanbul state security court filed an indictment with that court, charging the applicant under article 168 of the former criminal code, with membership of an illegal armed organisation.12.  on 6 october 2006 the istanbul assize court, relying on, inter alia, the applicant’s statements to the police, convicted him of membership of an illegal organisation under article 314 § 2 of the new criminal code and sentenced him to seven years and six months’ imprisonment.
7.  on being released after the interrogation, the applicant was handed over to the guards of budapest prison who, in the presence of the police officer, asked him whether he had been ill-treated.15.  on 24 july 2013 one of the prisoner escort officers, c was questioned, and recalled that the applicant had complained of ill-treatment upon his return to the prison facility, which had surprised him since he had previously asked the applicant whether he had any complaints and had seen no injuries on the applicant’s body.he could not remember whether he had escorted the applicant to the medical examination, but suggested that the applicant’s injuries must have occurred before he had been examined by the medical staff, which was why he had been called on to take photos.examining the photos of the applicant, two of the medical staff stated that because of the bad quality of the photos, they weren’t even sure if they showed actual injuries or simply the shape of the applicant’s face, while the third asserted that the injury must have been fresh when the photo was taken.24.  the investigation was discontinued on 8 may 2014 on the grounds that the applicant’s allegations could not be substantiated beyond doubt in the absence of any witness testimony and taking into account the conclusions of the forensic expert opinion.
the domestic courts found in favour of the applicant’s employer, on the grounds that the applicant had breached his duty of confidentiality by disclosing the letters, and that he had failed to consult other heads of departments before disclosing the letters to the newspaper.on the same date the prosecutor general wrote to the head of the trade unions of the prosecutor general’s office, seeking the trade unions’ approval of the applicant’s dismissal from his employment on the basis of section 14(8) of the public service act (see paragraph 23 below).the applicant also argued that that section was not applicable in the circumstances of the case, since the position of head of the press department of the prosecutor general’s office was not part of the cabinet of the prosecutor general.the court of appeal considered that the court’s judgment of 12 february 2008 had been implemented once the domestic courts had revised the judgments confirming his dismissal in 2003. the court of appeal did not give any consideration to the applicant’s arguments concerning his discussion with the prosecutor general and/or his experience during the time of his employment.21.  the applicant informed the department for the execution of judgments of the european court of human rights about the developments described above, and alleged that his being dismissed once again and the outcome of the new reinstatement proceedings amounted to a failure by the state to comply with the court’s judgment of 12 february 2008. in an action report of 2 december 2016 (see dh-dd(2016)1446) the government informed the committee of ministers about the general and individual measures taken in the course of implementing the court’s judgment of 12 february 2008, and expressed the view that that judgment had been enforced once the supreme court had reviewed and quashed its own judgment of 26 november 2003. they asked the committee of ministers to terminate the execution procedure in respect of that case.
6.  in the context of the use of secret surveillance measures in respect of a vice-president of the croatian privatisation fund (hrvatski fond za privatizaciju, hereinafter “the fund”), a legal entity established by the state and tasked with carrying out the privatisation of publicly owned property, the authorities intercepted and recorded a number of the applicant’s telephone conversations and messages.9.  on 12 february 2008, upon completion of the investigation, the state attorney’s office for the suppression of corruption and organised crime (ured za suzbijanje korupcije i organiziranog kriminaliteta – hereinafter: “the state attorney’s office”) indicted the applicant and nine other individuals in the zagreb county court on charges of bribe-taking, offering bribes, and abuse of power and authority.the applicant was indicted ‒ in his capacity as the lawyer acting for the vice-president of the fund ‒ for facilitating the receipt of a bribe of 150,000 euros (eur) for his client and aiding and abetting the abuse of power and authority by him.10.  during the proceedings the applicant challenged the lawfulness of the secret surveillance orders, arguing that they lacked the requisite reasoning and had been issued contrary to the provisions of the relevant domestic law (see, for further details on the procedural actions taken, matanović, cited above, §§ 29-63).when convicting the applicant, the trial court had relied on the secret surveillance recordings, the statement of an informant, who had been questioned at the trial, the statements of other witnesses, and the evidentiary material available in the file.
as for the issues that were at stake for the applicant, the court notes that following the traffic accident the applicant was seriously injured and received a disability degree.given that the applicant was a single mother and had a child to raise, the compensations for loss of earnings and for expenses sustained as a result of a poor state of her health were of undeniable importance for the applicant.the court therefore considers that what was at stake for the applicant called for an expeditious decision on her claims.” 10.  on 27 march 2007 the simferopolskiy district court found against the applicant.on 29 july 2009 the court of appeal of the autonomous republic of crimea quashed this decision and remitted the case to a first-instance court for fresh examination.12.  on 10 november 2009 the simferopolskiy district court left the applicant’s case without consideration because she had failed to appear in court without giving plausible reasons on 28 october 2009 and 10 november 2009. the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision stating that she had not been aware about the above-mentioned hearings.
it observed that the applicant had recruited and instructed the child’s mother as a drugs runner for two separate consignments of cocaine from south america to europe in summer 1998 and in late 1999/early 2000. it considered, in favour of the applicant, that this was his first criminal conviction, that the first delivery had failed (the drugs did not actually enter the distribution system), and that the applicant had been detained on remand since july 2001. the regional court held against the applicant that he had used as drugs runners two young women who were adolescents at the time the offences were committed, and who ran the risk of a lengthy prison sentence in south america; that he had exploited the naivety of his daughter’s mother; that a large amount of cocaine was meant to be smuggled in the first case and that four kilograms of cocaine were smuggled into europe in the second case; and that the entire undertaking had been handled very professionally.13.  after his release, the applicant was granted exceptional leave to remain (duldung) under section 60a of the residence act – according to the information available to the court this was granted most recently in january 2017 and would last until july 2017. it meant that enforcement of the expulsion order was temporarily suspended, being impossible to execute as the applicant did not have a valid passport (see paragraphs 28, 29 and 36‑42 below).it found that the applicant had lived with his daughter only for a short time prior to his imprisonment, she had thus experienced separation from the applicant and that, in the light of the applicant’s very serious criminal offences, the state’s interest in removing the applicant prevailed over his interest in enjoying family life with his daughter.it considered that they could only live together in germany, as the child could not be expected to relocate to nigeria; that the applicant had committed the criminal offences prior to the birth of his daughter; that he had made considerable efforts as a father, as was also evidenced by his choice to remain imprisoned in germany and to have supervised meetings with his daughter as of january 2008 rather than having his sentence suspended and being expelled as of 1 november 2007; that the latter event marked a turning point, which occurred after the expulsion order had become final in 2003 and which had not been taken into account by the administrative authorities; that the child had already been deprived of a relationship with her father for many years during his imprisonment; that the material assessment with a view to the applicant’s expulsion had been conducted on 21 march 2003, years before the developments in the father‑daughter relationship and the moment the expulsion order would be enforced; and that the enforcement of the expulsion order in connection with a re-entry ban would deprive the child of the possibility of a normal father-daughter relationship for the remainder of her childhood.28.  after the authority of the city of munich, on 12 june 2012, had ordered the applicant to present himself to the embassy of nigeria in germany so that a passport for the upcoming expulsion could be issued, the applicant refused to do so and filed an action against this order with the munich administrative court.
7.  according to a medical certificate from tetovo medical centre issued on 29 january 2003 on the basis of the available medical evidence, mr s. selami was in a post-operative state (following medical trepanation of his skull and evacuation of the internal brain haemorrhage); parts of his skull and the tough brain membrane had been seriously damaged; he had suffered reduced mobility of all limbs, muscle hypotonia and neck and rib fractures.12.  on 18 november 2003 mr s. selami contacted the ministry of justice with a view to securing an out-of-court settlement and payment of 16,170,000 macedonian denars (mkd – equivalent to 263,000 euros (eur)) in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused, so it was asserted, by the unlawful deprivation of his liberty and the serious injuries that he had sustained at the hands of the police on 26 august 2002. in support he submitted the medical certificate from tetovo medical centre (see paragraph 7 above).they argued that the first-instance court had not determined their claim in relation to the serious injuries inflicted on him by the police, as a result of which he had had his skull broken; had suffered a brain haemorrhage; had required head surgery; had been immobilised and had lost the full use of his hands.the court, inter alia, stated: “in the impugned judgment, the first-instance court established ... on the basis of the expert opinion [that mr s. selami] had experienced intense pain on his head and body when he had been physically attacked ... every blow had caused physical pain of different intensity, accompanied by swelling and bruises on his body ... regarding the intensity and duration of the fear, the experts are of the opinion that when arrested and physically assaulted and hit, particularly on his head, [mr s. selami] had had intense, unpleasant, emotional experiences of primary fear ... which persisted until he had fallen into a coma ... regarding the emotional suffering due to his unjustified deprivation of liberty and detention, the experts are of the opinion that the basis for an award of non-pecuniary damages ... is the time calculated as of 26 august 2002 ... when [mr s. selami] was arrested by the police ..., transferred to other police stations, where he was subjected to serious physical ill-treatment and beaten, which caused serious bodily injury ... this court considers that the [above] facts were correctly established.in this connection it stated that: “the operative provisions and the reasons given in the [impugned] judgment clearly and unequivocally confirm that the court had decided the entire claim ... this court considers that the emotional suffering due to unjustified detention is a single type of damage which includes all the detrimental effects on the victim, including his physical ill-treatment ... in assessing the amount of the award, this court took into consideration all the circumstances of the case, including the duration of the unjustified deprivation of liberty, the respect with which the plaintiff was held in his family and in the community, that during the unjustified deprivation of liberty he was physically ill-treated and sustained serious bodily injury, as a result of which his left limbs became dysfunctional to a minor extent, that he was hospitalised and operated on and that he had been disabled before ...” 23.  by a final decision of 31 october 2012, delivered by a notary public, the fourth applicant was declared the sole heir of mr s. selami’s inheritance, including the compensation awarded to him.
10.  the applicant appeared before the court and, at the opening of the hearing, challenged the presiding judge, m., in the following terms: “applicant: your honour, i would like to challenge the composition of the court.in support of what i have said i can refer to the case where you considered my claim against [a prosecutor] and where you delivered a totally illegal judgment, even though there have been decisions of the nova kakhovka court and of the court of appeal concerning the same situation, in which the actions of the prosecutor had been declared unlawful in that the prosecutor should have delivered not only letters in response to my complaints but formal decisions so that i could challenge those decisions.applicant: your references to the court of appeal’s decisions ... [the applicant lists names, apparently of other judges] judge: the hearing is adjourned!” 11.  according to the applicant, the hearing was adjourned at 9.30 a.m. upon the adjournment judge m. instructed her secretary, ms p., to draw up an administrative-offence report in respect of the applicant for contempt of court.the report stated that the applicant “on 1 june 2017 in the course of a court hearing ..., while challenging the presiding judge, accused [her] of delivering unlawful judgments [and undertaking] unlawful actions, uttered knowingly (завідомо) false statements detrimental to the judge’s honour and dignity, failed to react to the court’s admonishment to be balanced, [and] continued making statements which demonstrated her clear contempt for the court”, and in doing so committed an offence under article 185-3 of the code of administrative offences (hereinafter “the code”) – see paragraph 22 below).judge b. found that the applicant “in the course of a court hearing, in making a challenge, had accused judge m. of adopting unlawful decisions [and undertaking] unlawful actions, had made false statements detrimental to the judge’s honour and dignity, had failed to react to the court’s admonishment to be balanced, and had continued making insulting statements which had demonstrated clear contempt for the court.” in convicting the applicant the court relied on the report (see paragraph 12 above), the statements of the witnesses me.
on 8 may 2015 the szombathely district court issued a restriction order in respect of the applicant, which was subsequently overturned on appeal on the grounds that the mother herself had not been a victim of violent behaviour on the part of the applicant.however, the proceedings before the thonon-les-bains tribunal de grande instance had failed to respect k.b.v.’s right to a fair trial, since – owing to the fact that the applicant had given false information to the french authorities – she had not been informed of the proceedings and had not been able to be heard in person.nonetheless, the court found that the recognition of the foreign judgments could not be recognised, pursuant to article 23(b) of the brussels ii bis regulation, since recognition would have been contrary to the public policy of hungary, given that the best interests of the child had only been respected in a formalistic way.since in the meantime the court of cassation had overturned the judgment of the chambery court of appeal, the applicant requested the enforcement of the judgment of the thonon‑les‑bains tribunal de grande instance and maintained that this judgment had been declared automatically enforceable.the szombathely high court held that the judgment of the thonon-les-bains tribunal de grande instance, under which no rights at all were granted to the mother at all, was contrary to the public policy of hungary since it did not respect fundamental rights, and in particular the best interest of the child, and refused by a decision of 10 december 2015 to execute it.
10.  on 15 september 2006 the executive committee of vinnytsia city council instituted administrative proceedings seeking “to enjoin the [association] not to organise and carry out pickets on the streets and squares of vinnytsia and to oblige it to uninstall the unlawfully erected ‘small architectural structures’ (малі архітектурні форми).” the plaintiff alleged that the protesters had been breaching the peace and public order by offending passers-by, acting arrogantly towards them, obstructing the traffic and pedestrians and endangering the lives and health of local residents.and the police officers present at the site of the picket be summoned for questioning; that the police authorities be asked whether any incidents of unlawful conduct by the picketers had been documented; and that the site be inspected in order to determine whether, in fact, the camping tents mounted by the picketers had obstructed the traffic or the passage of pedestrians.the relevant part of the judgment read as follows: “... [the] executive committee ... did not and could not have known about a possible breach of public order by the participants of the event, which fact resulted in missing the time-limit for lodging a court action as required by paragraph 1 of article 182 of the code of administrative justice of ukraine; the court therefore resets the procedural time-limit ... the court, when deciding the case, takes into account that the participants in the event installed small architectural edifices on the pavement.accordingly, at any time during the picket of indeterminate length, it cannot be excluded that those taking part might repeatedly breach public order.” 13.  the court also noted that the picket “may potentially encroach upon the rights and freedoms of other local residents” and held as follows: “[the court holds] to prohibit [the association] and other persons taking part in the action from organising and carrying out peaceful assemblies in the streets and squares of vinnytsia, [and] from installing small architectural edifices in vinnytsia; ... oblige them to dismantle the small architectural edifices installed in the square in front of the [administration’s] building ... to allow immediate enforcement of the court ruling ...” 14.  at 9 p.m. on 15 september 2006 the protesters were dispersed by the police.17.  on 22 november 2006 the vinnytsia regional court of appeal examined the applicant’s appeal and decided that, in view of the circumstances of the case (namely, the short notice of the intention to hold a picket and the indefinite period during which the participants planned to continue their demonstration) the administrative action lodged by the executive committee could be accepted for examination.
he also requested that the court of appeal decide on his objection and an appeal to be heard, lodged on 25 august 2014 against the court of appeal’s decision of 28 july 2014, prior to the expiry of the time‑limit given to him to respond to the prosecution authorities’ submission.on 25 november 2014 the applicant lodged a complaint of bias against two of the three judges concerned, arguing that they had repeatedly contacted the wrong authorities – either the frankfurt am main district court or regional court, rather than the prosecution authorities – to request the case file and had taken two and half months to decide on his objection and appeal to be heard.the court of appeal was informed by the prosecution authorities that the criminal proceedings had been brought before the darmstadt regional court, rather than the frankfurt am main regional court, so the court of appeal made a similar enquiry to the court in question on 3 february 2015.17.  on 10 march 2015 the applicant’s lawyer sent to the court of appeal two comprehensive submissions which he had made in the main proceedings before the regional court and asked the appeal court to take them into account when deciding on the continuation of the applicant’s remand detention.it further considered that in the light of, inter alia, the amount of evidence to be examined, the requests for legal assistance sent to several countries, and the scope and complexity of the case, there was no indication of undue delay in the conduct of the criminal proceedings, with the trial being scheduled to commence in june 2015. the applicant’s continued detention on remand was, therefore, proportionate.
40.  in a letter dated 12 may 2015 addressed to the government regarding the accident in question, the civil aviation agency stated: “as regards the responsibility of the aircraft owner, we note that the legislative acts [at the material time] provided that the owner of an aircraft was responsible for ensuring the maintenance of the aircraft’s airworthiness, but not its safe operation during a flight, which was the pilot’s responsibility.51.  section 37 set out the duties of the pilot of an aircraft, such as: managing the work of a flight crew so that aircraft flight safety was ensured and the provisions of this law and other laws of the republic of latvia were respected, as well as the requirements of by-laws, instructions and other laws and regulations; implementing measures to prevent danger threatening the aircraft which he or she controlled; rescuing passengers, injured crew members, the aircraft, and its documentation and property on board; and providing medical assistance to those who were injured if the aircraft had an aviation accident.the performance of duties shall commence with a flight crew member’s preparation for a flight and shall conclude after the flight at the moment when he or she has fulfilled all of the functions set out in the rules regarding the operation of the aircraft and other regulations.” 54.  section 97 provided as follows: “an aircraft owner or operator, if the aircraft is operated by another person, shall be liable for any harm caused to a third party in the territory of the republic of latvia by an aircraft in flight or an object that has become separated from that aircraft [where this harm] manifests [itself] in either the death of the third party or damage caused to his or her health, or harm caused to his or her property, if the aircraft owner or operator, in accordance with the procedures laid down in legal acts of the republic of latvia, does not prove that the harm occurred according to the fault of the victim himself or herself.for the purposes of this section, an aircraft shall be deemed to be an aircraft in flight from the moment the engines of the aircraft are started before take-off until the moment when the aircraft has finished taxiing after its landing.” 55.  on 21 march 2013 the law on aviation was supplemented by section 91. this was to have effect from 24 april 2013 onwards and was worded in the following manner: “an aircraft owner and operator is prohibited from handing over an aircraft which is to be flown to a person who does not have a civil aircraft flight crew member licence with an appropriate qualification stamp and who is not insured in accordance with section 111 of this law.” 56.  in a judgment of 24 november 2010 in case no....” chapter 2.2 flight operations 2.2.1 operating facilities “the pilot-in-command shall ensure that a flight will not be commended unless it has been ascertained by every reasonable means available that the ground and/or water facilities including communication facilities and navigation aids available and directly required on such flights, for the safe operation of the aeroplane, are adequate for the type of operation under which the flight is to be conducted ...” 2.2.2.1 operating instructions – general “an aeroplane shall not be taxied on the movement area of an aerodrome unless the person at the controls is an appropriately qualified pilot or: a) has been authorised by the owner ...; b) is fully competent to taxi the aeroplane; c) is qualified to use the radio if radio communications are required; and d) has received instruction from a competent person in respect of aerodrome layout, and where appropriate, information on routes, signs, marking, lights, atc signals and instructions, phraseology and procedures, and is able to conform to the operational standards required for safe aeroplane movement at the aerodrome.” 2.2.5 duties of pilot-in-command “2.2.5.1 the pilot-in-command shall be responsible for the operation, safety and security of the aeroplane and the safety of all crew members, passengers and cargo on board.
on the basis of the evidence collected, it concluded that the applicant had stolen a gun and other personal possessions several days before the murder, and on the day of the murder had entered the victim’s house in order to steal food.when she had surprised him in the house, he had attacked her, hitting her with the gun stolen earlier – in such a way that a part of the gun’s cock had broken off and fallen to the floor – and with an axe which he had found in the house.20.  in establishing the facts, the regional court relied on the following most important pieces of evidence: a metal fragment which had been found under the victim’s body and which the experts confirmed to be the missing part of the cock of the gun; traces of the victim’s blood found on the handle of the gun found in the applicant’s bag; the testimony of the person who had given the applicant a lift in his car and had found that bag; the fact that that person had also recognised the applicant’s photo when it had been shown to him by the police; and the testimony of officers z.k.he argued that the regional court had not commented on the evidence showing that the applicant had been beaten in order to make the confession the officers had recounted, pointed out that the confession had not been repeated once the applicant had been taken before an investigator, and relied again on article 118 of the code of criminal procedure.in addition to the evidence described above, it relied on the testimony of a neighbour of the victim, who had seen a person considered to be the applicant on the roof of the victim’s house shortly before the murder.
one of those witnesses, a certain a.a., who had been working on the street where the events had taken place, indicated that he had seen a group of about twenty people marching in the streets, chanting slogans and throwing molotov cocktails at shops, and that the group had dispersed after several shops had caught fire.he further stated that he had been arrested near the scene of the incident while on his way to his friend’s home, that he had seen a group of about thirty or forty people, and that he had had nothing to do with the events in connection with which he had been arrested.he gave a detailed account of his activities within the illegal organisation, including his participation in the events of 4 may 1995, and provided the names of various individuals who had also participated in that incident, including that of the first applicant.19.  on 10 may 1996 he was brought before the public prosecutor, where he accepted the statements which he had given to the police and admitted his participation in various activities of the organisation, including those of 4 may 1995. he stated that he had left the organisation and that he wished to have the benefit of law no.27.  following the judgment of the court of cassation, the proceedings before the trial court started again on 19 september 1999 and the composition of the trial court was changed several times.
it added that on the other hand, if the prison only offered one standard menu, the erzurum hospital’s health board would hold a further meeting in order to decide whether the applicant should be transferred to another prison, after ascertaining the view of a dietician on the cholesterol content of the standard menu.7.  on an unspecified date the applicant, arguing that the meal served in prison was incompatible with his medically prescribed diet, asked the prison authorities to send samples to the ministry of justice and the human rights commission of the grande national assembly of turkey.the applicant stated the following, inter alia: “... my state of health [is poor]; the prison authorities informed me that i would be provided with meals compatible with my diet, but that has not happened; this can be noted from surveillance camera footage; i was not provided with the menu list when i wanted to submit it to the ministry for examination.” 12.  on 2 january 2009 the judge responsible for the execution of sentences allowed the applicant’s request.that judge referred in his decision to a document which the prison authorities had drawn up for the attention of the erzurum public prosecutor’s office, stating the following: “... medically prescribed diets cannot be prepared in [our] prison’s kitchen; we can only cook unsalted and unspiced versions of the meals prepared for the other [prisoners].he argued as follows: the meals were prepared in the prison kitchen; the daily allowance per prisoner, which totalled three turkish liras (try – about 1.40 euro at the material time), was only sufficient to prepare one type of meal per day, which meant that the prisoners could not be offered several types of menus; menus could not be prepared for the medically prescribed diets for a total of thirty-eight individuals detained in the same prison, and only an unsalted, fat-free and unspiced version of the standard menu was on offer.
8.  the applicant institute applied to the administrative court of the republic of slovenia (“the administrative court”), seeking the setting aside of the ministry’s decision.11.  in order to reflect the fact that the ministry had adopted the decision of 30 march 2010, the applicant institute supplemented its action of 19 october 2009, which it had originally lodged on account of the ministry’s failure to adopt a decision (see paragraph 9 above), with a request that the ministry’s decision be set aside.the court also pointed out that the procedural rules for the evaluation of research programmes adopted by the national scientific and research council clearly defined the stages of the evaluation procedure, the participants in it and their tasks.as to the alleged errors in the evaluation of the competing programmes, the court merely disagreed with the applicant institute that not all criteria had been taken into account and again cited section 71(2) of the ada.16.  the applicant institute then lodged a constitutional complaint, arguing, among other things, that the decisions of the ministry and the domestic court had been arbitrary and that the courts had failed to address its allegations that errors had been made in the evaluation procedure.
8.  on 26 december 2001 the applicant gave a statement to the public prosecutor in the absence of a lawyer in which he denied the statements he had given to the police.10.  on 9 january 2002 the diyarbakır public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment, charging the applicant under article 146 of the former turkish criminal code with attempting to undermine the constitutional order of the state.15.  during the criminal proceedings against the applicant, the first-instance courts examined the applicant’s continued detention at the end of the hearings, either on their own motion or at the applicant’s request.the courts ordered that he be kept in detention owing to the nature of the offence, the state of the evidence and the contents of the file.21.  on 5 june 2012 the diyarbakır juvenile court found that, inter alia, on the basis of the applicant’s statements to the police, the applicant had committed the offence under article 146 of the former turkish criminal code and sentenced him to sixteen years and eight months’ imprisonment.
13.  on 5 may 2005 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan, on the basis of an application by the investigator, changed the preventive measure in respect of the applicant from a written undertaking not to leave his place of residence to detention on remand for a period of two months.the district court lastly found that the investigator had taken an unfounded decision not to prosecute the police officers by assessing their actions as lawful and asked the prosecutor general, with reference to article 184 of the code of criminal procedure (“the ccp”), to institute criminal proceedings against them under article 309 § 3 of the cc for exceeding their authority, resulting in grave consequences.however, it decided to annul the request made to the prosecutor general on the grounds that article 21 of the ccp prohibited the reopening of proceedings if there had been a decision of the prosecuting authority to discontinue the proceedings or not to carry out prosecution.26.  on 19 may 2008 the criminal court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal, finding that article 21 § 5 of the ccp was not applicable to his case and holding that the applicant had failed to contest the investigator’s decision of 21 june 2005 within the time-limits prescribed by articles 21 and 290 of the ccp, as well as the time-limit for requesting a reopening of a case prescribed by article 426.3 of the ccp.it held at the outset, with reference to the judgments adopted in the applicant’s criminal case and article 52 of the code of civil procedure, that the applicant had a case for damages under article 1063 of the civil code, taking into account the fact that the police officers’ actions had been unlawful within the meaning of that article.
the first-instance court, relying on section 133 of the labour act, held that the applicant and his employer had concluded a fixed-term contract lasting until 31 may 2009 and that the applicant must have known that his contract would end on that day.he had not concluded a new contract of employment with his employer and he had therefore been obliged to lodge an application for the protection of his rights with his employer within the fifteen-day time-limit, starting from 1 june 2009. however, he had failed to do so and consequently his claim had been lodged out of time.rejecting the applicant’s argument, the first‑instance court also held that the defendant company had not been obliged to adopt a formal decision on terminating his employment or to send him any other kind of notification, given that he must have known that his contract would come to an end on 31 may 2009.13.  on 14 november 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (revizija) with the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske), which was dismissed as ill-founded on 25 september 2012. the supreme court also held that the applicant had failed to seek the protection of his rights in respect of his employer within the deadlines prescribed by section 133 of the labour act.he relied on a decision by the velika gorica county court of 16 january 2013 in the case of a colleague of his, who for the same reasons as the applicant had also sought to have the court recognise that he had concluded an open-ended contract of employment.
13.  on 24 april 1991 the first-instance court allowed the applicant’s claim in part, but on 16 august 1991 the vukovar county court (županijski sud u vukovaru) quashed the first-instance judgment in part, because it found that the first-instance court had failed to correctly establish the facts.it held that the first-instance court had failed to take into account the fact: that the first-instance judgment of 24 april 1991 had become final as regards an amount of 63.80 former yugoslav dinars (yud) per month payable for the period from 1 january 1991 onwards; the applicant had turned 60 on 15 august 1994; and he should have lodged an application for his disability pension to be recalculated as an old-age pension.specifically, it ordered the expert witness, in calculating the monthly amount, to take into account the amount of 63.80 dinars which had already been awarded, as well as the fact that the defendant was 50% responsible for the damage at issue, and to establish whether the applicant had used his right to have his disability pension recalculated as an old-age pension when he had turned 60.26.  in the resumed proceedings, at a hearing held on 22 december 2008 the first-instance court commissioned a report from an accounting expert in accordance with the second-instance court’s instruction given in its judgment of 3 may 2005, and ordered the applicant to pay the related costs in the amount of hrk 2,578 in advance.in its reasoning, the first-instance court stated that the vukovar county court, in its decision of 11 november 2008, had awarded the applicant hrk 20,000 for the violation of his right to a trial within a reasonable time, and that he could have paid for the costs of the expert witness with that money.
the relevant part of the judgment reads as follows: “with regard to an action in tort based on the unlawful acts that were allegedly committed in tunisia by the defendants, to the claimant’s detriment, the swiss courts do not have territorial jurisdiction under international law to examine the complaint, given that the defendants are not domiciled or habitually resident in switzerland, and given also that no illegal act or detrimental outcome occurred in switzerland, pursuant to sections 2 and 129 of the ldip.” 26.  under section 3 of the ldip (see paragraph 37 below), the swiss courts also lacked jurisdiction under the forum of necessity, given the lack of a sufficient connection between, on the one hand, the case and the facts, and, on the other, switzerland.the mere fact that on account of those acts the claimant applied for and received political asylum in 1995 in switzerland, where he has since been domiciled, does not, in itself and in the light of current case-law, amount to a sufficient connection enabling a forum of necessity to be established against the defendants in switzerland and geneva.” 27.  by a writ dated 16 november 2005, the applicant appealed against that decision before the court of justice of the republic and the canton of geneva (“the court of justice”).his appeal was rejected in a judgment of 15 september 2006. after noting that the appellant had shown that he was unable to bring a civil action in tunisia, the court of justice found as follows: “as the outcome of the present appeal depends on the immunity from jurisdiction of the respondent parties, the question whether there exists a forum of necessity in the appellant’s place of residence can, however, remain undecided.” 28.  the court of justice thus held that the respondents enjoyed immunity from jurisdiction, since the acts of torture had been perpetrated in the exercise of sovereign authority (iure imperii) and not under private law (iure gestionis).i, geneva 2002, n.10 ad article 99/lpc/ge, concerning the force of res judicata, in which the authors consider that identical claims, in terms of their content, based on the same arguments and the same combination of alleged facts, constitute the objective limit of res judicata; that identity is determined by the complete set of legal considerations which formed part of the first application and were adjudicated upon; this was how “cause” was to be understood in former article 99(2); the alleged facts of the case determine an overall situation [“sachverhalt”, “prozessstoff”] which it is for the court to assess) but would appear to equate to “procédure” or “demande en justice” or in german to “rechtsstreit”, “rechtssache”, “prozess”, “angelegenheit”, “causa litigandi” or “streitgrund”.as the versions of the law drafted in the three official languages have the same standing, the question arises whether the difference between the french wording and that of the other two versions results from an error in the legislative process, from a difference in meaning which becomes apparent only in the context of specific cases according to a varying understanding of the legal provision in each of the languages, or, lastly, from a linguistic difference attributable either to the non-translatability knowingly taken into account in the drafting or to uncertainty on the part of the legislator as to the meaning to be conveyed (see schubarth, die auslegung mehrsprachiger gesetzestexte, in rapports suisses présentés au xviie congrès international de droit comparé, zurich 2006, p. 11 et seq., especially p. 12 s.).
the deadline for submitting bids was october 2004. together with three other companies, the applicant company took part in the tendering process.7.  on 28 january 2006 the court of appeal quashed this decision and remitted the case to the first instance.9.  on 26 march 2010 the court of appeal upheld the decision of the commercial court.the decision of the court of appeal was served on the applicant company’s lawyer on 27 april 2010.10.  on 15 july 2010 the applicant company lodged an initiative urging the supreme public prosecutor’s office (vrhovno državno tužilaštvo) to file a request for the protection of legality (zahtjev za zaštitu zakonitosti), but this motion was rejected on 21 july 2010.
therefore, since [for the court] it is beyond dispute that the plot in question had been socially owned on 8 october 1991 ... in order to determine whether it had been acquired by adverse possession it had to be established whether the plaintiffs’ legal predecessors had been in possession of certain quality of the disputed property before 6 april 1941 and thus for the period prescribed for adverse possession by the rules applicable at the time.” 27.  in their appeal the respondent authority emphasised that the applicants could not have become the owners of the property in question because prior to 8 october 1991 it had been prohibited to acquire ownership of socially owned property by adverse possession unless the ownership had been acquired in that manner before 6 april 1941. the respondent authority claimed that the lifting of that prohibition had not had retroactive effect (see paragraphs 11-15 above).in their constitutional complaint they, inter alia, stated: “therefore, from the legal and factual situation where, as in the instant case, the plaintiffs have, themselves and through their predecessors, indisputably been in possession in good faith of the property in question for more than 100 years, and viewing such situation in the light of croatian law in force, ... it follows that it is necessary to ... quash the contested judgment and remit the case ... if the view that the property in question was socially owned on 8 october 1991 is to be accepted, even though in the land register it was not registered as such in accordance with the [relevant regulations concerning registration of the property in the state and social ownership], then it was, in accordance with the cited statutory provisions, necessary to take into account the entire period of possession until the bringing of the civil action, except [the period] between 6 april 1941 and 8 october 1991.1 to the convention, which guarantees the protection of the right of property, and the rights provided by article 14 of the convention because the applicants’ are being discriminated and thereby placed in a disadvantageous position compared to other croatian nationals because in almost the same, i.e. in terms of substantive law and factual background compatible, cases the same court, the split county court, has been adopting judgments allowing registration of the right of ownership [in respect of the land] in the immediate vicinity of that of the applicants, to those who make such requests on the basis of undisturbed possession of hundred years.before the croatian courts in substantially similar cases final judgments were adopted from which it follows that the courts have been granting the claims of those in possession of the land adjacent to that of the applicants, and have been declaring those possessors the owners of that immovable property on the basis of adverse possession that is, undisturbed possession of 20 years , which [period] elapsed by 6 april 1941, and so in accordance with the opinion [expressed at] extended plenary session of the federal supreme court of yugoslavia of 4 april 1960. therefore, [such] different treatment by the courts placed the applicants in an unequal position, which caused them enormous damage.” 34.  on 23 may 2014 and 25 june 2015 respectively, notice of the complaints concerning the alleged violation of their property rights was given to the government and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to rule 54 § 3 of the rules of court (see paragraph 4 above).in particular, the trgo case was about acknowledging ownership acquired by adverse possession in the period between 6 april 1941 and 8 october 1991, whereas the applicants herein do not claim that said period should, nor do they have any expectations that the said period would, be taken into account in calculating the time-limit for acquiring ownership by adverse possession given that they acquired the ownership [of the land in question by adverse possession] regardless [of that period] the trgo case therefore cannot be regarded as relevant case-law in the present case.” 42.  the applicants in their observations in both cases cited section 388(4) of the 1996 property act, as amended by the 2001 amendment (hereinafter referred to as “the 2001 version of section 388(4)”).
25.  the records of the questioning indicate that the applicant was accused of: (i) attempting to discredit an investigation into an alleged coup (the “balyoz” case); (ii) making certain statements serving the interests of fetö/pdy, in particular during a television programme broadcast on can erzincan tv on 14 july 2016, in the course of which, according to the public prosecutor, the terrorist organisation had sought to prepare the public for a military coup; (iii) holding an account with bank asya, a bank with alleged links to fetö/pdy; (iv) avoiding a criminal investigation through the assistance of members of the national police suspected of belonging to fetö/pdy; (v) visiting fetullah gülen at his home in pennsylvania and kissing his hand; and (vi) having in his possession a united states one-dollar bill with an “f” serial number (denoting the initial of the forename fetullah).at the end of the hearing, the magistrate ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention, having taken the following factors into consideration: the strong suspicions against him; the nature of the alleged offences and the fact that they were among the offences listed in article 100 § 3 of the code of criminal procedure (“the ccp”) – the so-called “catalogue offences”, for which a suspect’s pre-trial detention was deemed justified in the event of strong suspicion; the risk of absconding; and the risk that alternative measures to detention might be insufficient to ensure the applicant’s participation in the criminal proceedings.36.  with regard to the applicant’s complaint that his pre-trial detention was unlawful, the constitutional court noted firstly that the evidence forming the basis for his detention had included: (i) an article entitled “the meaning of sledgehammer” (“balyoz’un anlamı”), published in the star newspaper in 2010; (ii) his statements during the television programme broadcast on can erzincan tv on 14 july 2016; and (iii) an article entitled “turbulence” (“türbülans”), published on his own website on 20 july 2016. after examining the substance of these items of evidence, the constitutional court held that the investigating authorities had been unable to demonstrate any factual basis that might indicate that the applicant had been acting in accordance with the aims of fetö/pdy or with the purpose of preparing the ground for a possible military coup.41.  concerning the applicant’s complaint that he had had no access to the investigation file, the constitutional court held that he had had sufficient means available to prepare his defence to the charges against him and challenge his pre-trial detention, in view of the contents of the detailed questions put to him during questioning by the public prosecutor and the magistrate, and the overall duration of the restriction on access to the case file.42.  with regard to the complaint that no hearing had been held during the examination of the applicant’s applications challenging his pre-trial detention, the constitutional court found that there was no obligation to hold a hearing on each and every objection to pre-trial detention orders and their extension, and that where a person had been able to appear before the first-instance court considering the issue of detention, the fact that there was no hearing on a subsequent appeal did not in itself contravene the constitution since it did not breach the principle of equality of arms.
6.  on 29 december 2006 the leninskiy district court of dnepropetrovsk, ukraine, ordered to arrest and bring the applicant to the court in order to determine the preventive measure during the investigation of his alleged robbery.on 15 may 2008 a prosecutor authorised his detention considering that the decision of 29 december 2006 of the leninskiy district court of dnepropetrovsk had authorised the applicant’s “placement into custody”, as mentioned in article 61 § 1 of the minsk convention.11.  on 24 june 2008 a district prosecutor decided that the applicant should be “placed in custody” considering that the decision of the leninskiy district court of dnepropetrovsk of 29 december 2006 authorised “placement into custody”, as required under article 466 § 2 of the russian code of criminal procedure (“the ccrp”).on 4 september 2008 the perovskiy district court of moscow dismissed the applicant’s complaint considering that his arrest and detention in relation to the ukrainian extradition request had been and remained lawful.on 18 november 2008 the moscow city court confirmed the decision of 3 october 2008. on 29 january 2009 the supreme court of russia upheld the judgment of 18 november 2008 on appeal.
8.  on 7 april 2005, following the applicant’s supervisory review appeal, the presidium of the supreme court quashed the decision of 23 april 2001. the supreme court remitted the case for a new examination by the court of cassation instance for the applicant had not been duly summoned to the hearing of 23 april 2001.10.  on 26 january 2006, upon the applicant’s supervisory review appeal, the presidium of the supreme court quashed the judgment of 2 february 2001 and the decision of 11 may 2005 as it found that the lower courts misjudged the facts of the case and erred in application of the national law.26.  on 8 february 2012 the district court clarified the judgment of 23 september 2008. it explained that the debt had to be recovered from the government of the republic of sakha (yakutiya) represented by the federal treasury of the republic of sakha (yakutiya) from the federal budget sources allocated for the housing subsidies for persons leaving the high north regions.33.  on 20 december 2010 a judge of the supreme court of russia ordered that the application should be returned to the applicant with the reasoning that the proceedings complained of ended on 17 november 2008, i.e. before the entry into force of the compensation act.the court agreed with the judge that had passed the decision of 20 december 2010 that the end date of the proceedings was the date of the decision of 17 november 2008 to uphold the judgment of 23 september 2008 on appeal, while the subsequent period when the applicant applied for supervisory review of that decisions should not be included in the overall length of the proceedings.
in the reasons given for ordering the applicant’s pre-trial detention, the magistrate took the following factors into consideration: the strong suspicions against him; the nature of the alleged offence and the fact that it was among the offences listed in article 100 § 3 of the code of criminal procedure (“the ccp”) – the so-called “catalogue offences”, for which a suspect’s pre-trial detention was deemed justified in the event of strong suspicion; the risk of absconding; the state of the evidence and the risk of its deterioration; and the risk that alternative measures to detention might be insufficient to ensure the applicant’s participation in the criminal proceedings.25.  on 10 april 2017 the istanbul public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the istanbul assize court in respect of several individuals, including the applicant, who were suspected of being part of the fetö/pdy media network, in particular accusing them, under articles 309, 311 and 312 in conjunction with article 220 § 6 of the criminal code (“the cc”), of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, the turkish grand national assembly and the government by force and violence, and of committing offences on behalf of a terrorist organisation without being members of it.in that connection, it noted that on 4 october 2016, following a request he had made to that effect the previous day, the applicant had been examined in prison by a general practitioner and had then been transferred to the urology department of the state hospital, where he had undergone a medical examination on 20 october 2016, and that his next appointment had been scheduled for 22 march 2017. in those circumstances, the constitutional court found that keeping the applicant in pre-trial detention did not currently constitute a danger to his life or health.32.  with regard to the applicant’s complaint concerning the lawfulness of his pre-trial detention, the constitutional court noted firstly that the evidence forming the basis for his detention had included: (i) an article entitled “as if it were a religious war” (“din savaşıymış”), published on 21 december 2013; (ii) an article entitled “the president must not remain a spectator” (“cumhurbaşkanı seyirci kalamaz”), published on 24 december 2013; (iii) an article entitled “between erdogan and the west” (“erdoğan ile batı arasında”), published on 28 december 2013; (iv) an article entitled “yes, both the crime and the punishment are individual” (“evet suç da ceza da şahsidir”), published on 8 february 2014; (v) an article entitled “this nation is not empty-headed” (“bu millet bidon kafalı değildir”), published on 1 march 2014; and (vi) an article entitled “the solution is a government without erdoğan” (“çıkar yol erdoğan’sız hükûmet”), published on 29 march 2014. after examining the substance of these articles, the constitutional court found that they mainly dealt with matters relating to the “17-25 december [2013]” criminal investigations.noting firstly that the examination of the merits of an individual application to the constitutional court against a judicial decision entailed determining whether there had been a violation of fundamental rights and what measures would be appropriate to put an end to the violation, and secondly that grounds of appeal on points of law could not be examined by the constitutional court in the context of an individual application, it found that the constitutional court did not have jurisdiction to assess the evidence in the case file.
why should the police force interfere in labour’s internal politics where, it is obvious, there are too many cooks spoiling the broth?” ... “yet the ease with which the mlp deputy leader phones him up to complain, and ‑ even worse ‑ the ease with which this leading politician is provided with a service that cannot be linked in any way with the pursuit of ‘criminality’ ‑ as we know it ‑ makes one wonder.” ... “these events seem to indicate that within labour there are people who can influence and interfere in decisions taken by the police force.he owes it to all present and future maltese citizens who did not live the past ‑ so that they will live in a future where no one controls their freedom and hence their lives.” 12.  on 17 july 2007 m.f., the deputy leader of the mlp, instituted libel proceedings against the applicant (and against the editor of the newspaper) under article 28 of chapter 248 of the laws of malta (see the “relevant domestic law” section below), and sought damages, claiming that the above‑mentioned extracts of the article had been defamatory.it considered it appropriate to analyse and mention all the relevant evidence that had not been referred to by the first‑instance court: - m.f., as plaintiff and now respondent, submitted that the reader had been induced to believe that he had persuaded the police to harm someone, when all he had done was to file a report requesting that the anonymous letters and emails he had received be investigated.- the editor testified that in his opinion the speech delivered by the deputy leader of the mlp indicated that the latter had put pressure on the cop to investigate the matter when he had met up with him to discuss the emails and the anonymous letters.it considered that the court of appeal had reached a legitimate conclusion in finding that the applicant’s opinion piece had contained declarations which assumed as a fact that the mlp deputy leader had illegitimately and abusively influenced the police and also that the exercise of illegitimate and abusive pressure on the cop had not been proved as a fact.
16.  on 29 november 2013 the family court upheld its interlocutory order of 1 september 2013. on the basis of articles 1631, 1666 and 1666a of the german civil code (see paragraphs 30–32 below), the court stated in its reasoning that there was a high probability that leaving the son in the community or returning him there would lead to him being subjected to corporal punishment, thus infringing his personal dignity and integrity, values protected by the german basic law (see paragraphs 26 and 27 below).the court found that the statements by other children in parallel proceedings, the video footage and the statements of other witnesses confirmed that the disciplining of children in the community would include corporal punishment.the court observed that statements by the daughters and other children in parallel proceedings, the video footage and the statements of other witnesses had confirmed that the disciplining of children in the community might include corporal punishment.it based its finding on the statements of the oldest daughter, which had been confirmed by the statements of the former members of the community and the guidelines in the leaflet our teachings on child training.it further observed that the wishes of the two girls (nine and twelve years old) did not prevent the taking of such a decision because only the expert opinion expected in the main custody proceedings would clarify how relevant the wishes of the girls were and the extent to which they had formed those wishes themselves.
37.  after interviewing the applicants, their two daughters and the children’s foster parents, and observing a meeting between the applicants and their children, the expert submitted a written opinion on 23 december 2013. he stated that the applicants and their daughters had confirmed that the parents had used a rod as corporal punishment on the daughters and that even though the applicants had a loving attitude towards their children, they considered corporal punishment using physical objects as an appropriate and necessary parenting method.based, in particular, on the opinion by the court‑appointed expert and the statements by the applicants and their children, the court concluded that there was a high, concrete probability that the children would be subjected to systematic corporal punishment using physical objects, which would in turn be detrimental to the best interests of the children in physical and psychological terms.besides the problem of detecting corporal punishment through unannounced visits by the youth office (see paragraph 30 above), the court also pointed out that the applicants had consistently, over the course of the proceedings, shown a lack of willingness to cooperate with the youth office and had refused to accept state schools, both of which the court found necessary to prevent degrading corporal punishment and ensure the children’s autonomous development.the court held that corporal punishment with a rod, prohibited by article 1631 § 2 of the civil code (see paragraph 54 below), constituted the physical abuse of children and if applied regularly and repeatedly the competent authorities were obliged under article 1666 of the civil code (see paragraph 55 below) to intervene and take the necessary measures in the best interests of the children.48.  the court of appeal also confirmed that the applicants’ withdrawal of their consent to being assessed did not prevent the courts from using the expert opinion as evidence and that there were no less severe measures available to avert the imminent detriment to the best interests of the children resulting from their parents’ use of corporal punishment.
it answered the above questions as follows: (1) the craniocerebral injury and the bruise on the neck had resulted from contact with blunt objects; (2) neither the examination of the second applicant nor the evaluation of the medical file had established any injuries to her head (apparently, implying visible injuries); (3) the second applicant’s injuries could have been inflicted on her in the circumstances described; and (4) according to the medical documents, the second applicant could have sustained the injuries on 19 june 2008.32.  on an unspecified date (illegible in the available copy) the kalyninskyy prosecutor’s office sent a summons to the first applicant at his registered residence (his mother’s home), instructing him to come to the prosecutor’s office on 5 september 2008. it is not clear whether it was issued in the context of the criminal investigation in respect of the complaints by the first applicant’s wife (see above) or whether it was rather related to the subsequent criminal proceedings against him.the investigator relied on articles 106 and 115 of the code of criminal procedure (hereinafter “the ccp”, see paragraph 78 below) and substantiated the arrest as follows: the first applicant had been on the wanted list since 19 september 2008, had impeded the establishment of the truth and had committed serious criminal offences.56.  on 1 august 2013 the higher specialised court for civil and criminal matters quashed the appellate court’s ruling of 6 march 2012 in the part concerning the first applicant’s conviction (the part concerning the remittal of the case to the first-instance court remained in force) and remitted the case for fresh appellate examination.71.  on 11 february 2009 the police conducted a search of the fourth applicant’s flat on the basis of the court ruling of 7 october 2008. as indicated in the search report, the police were searching for “items, valuables and documents related to the criminal activity of [the first applicant]”.
8.  the applicant was released on 18 may 2012 following the suspension of his sentence by virtue of a decree issued by the president of the republic concerning a number of prisoners.following his conviction and sentence he had been transferred to block 2b, where he had been detained between 24 january 2011 and 5 october 2011. on the latter date he had been placed in block 2a, where he had been detained until his release on 18 may 2012. both block 2b and 2a accommodated sentenced prisoners.(d)  additional information regarding the general conditions in the blocks 15.  the various parts of the prison were equipped with a central heating system which covered all the blocks and cells.16.  following the 2012 report of the european committee for the prevention of torture (“cpt”) on its visit to cyprus from 12 to 19 may 2008, the prison administration discontinued the practice of switching off cell bells during the night, hence detainees had access to the toilets during those hours (see paragraphs 26-27 and 30 below).the order had also directed prison staff to check and ensure that the call panel in the warden’s room was active at all times, especially during the evening, so that prisoners could be assisted and emergencies prevented.
5.  on 19 may 2004 the military court of the moscow circuit found the applicant guilty of the disclosure of state secrets and the illegal possession of ammunition and sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment.7.  according to the government, on 26 may 2005 the federal penitentiary service of the russian federation (the “fsin”) decided that the applicant should serve his sentence in correctional settlement facility (колония-поселение) no.the court relied on the relevant provision of the rules of criminal procedure which provided for such reinstatement if there had been a delay of at least five days before a party to the proceedings had received a copy of the impugned decision.11.  on 16 september 2005 the sverdlovsk regional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 1 september 2005 and quashed the decision of 19 august 2005, remitting the matter for fresh consideration.he further informed the applicant that, following a report by the prosecutor, the administration had made the necessary arrangements to set up a proper quarantine area in the facility.
the relevant section of the operative part of the decision read as follows: “[the court] ordered to schedule a preliminary hearing in the criminal case of mr dudin ... on 25 december 2007 at 10.00 a.m. ... to transfer [from the detention facility] the accused mr dudin for the hearing at the set date and time.during the hearing the applicant and his representative raised the objection regarding unlawfulness of the applicant’s detention between 24 december 2007 and the time of the hearing, but the district court dismissed it without advancing any specific reasons in this regard.in the relevant part the regional court’s decision read as follows: “mr dudin’s and his representative’s arguments regarding unlawfulness of the detention ... at the moment of the adoption of the decision [are unfounded] ... [t]he present criminal case was transferred to court on 11 december 2007, i.e. within the period of [the accused’s detention ordered during investigation] and according to section 2, article 255 of the criminal procedure code the period of the defendant’s detention is calculated from the date when the case was transferred to court and until the judgment is pronounced and may not exceed six months.” 12.  on 27 may 2008 the district court convicted the applicant of aggravated robbery and sentenced to six years’ imprisonment.on 10 july 2008 the conviction was upheld on appeal by the novgorod regional court and the period of the applicant’s pre-trial detention between 23 june 2007 and the day of conviction was fully counted towards execution of his sentence.the representative of the ministry of the interior (intervening in the proceedings) admitted that the authorisation for the detention expired on 24 december 2007. the representative of the regional prosecutor’s office (also intervening in the proceedings) maintained that the applicant’s detention was lawful, but stated that any detention without a court order would be unlawful.
5.  on 7 april 2008 the applicant notified the executive committee of naberezhniye chelny of his intention to hold a public event in the form of a hunger strike in front of the local prosecutor’s office beginning from 21 april 2008. on the same day the applicant was informed that his notice did not comply with the requirements of the law.11.  on 24 april 2008 the justice of the peace of the 8th court circuit of naberezhniye chelny found the applicant guilty under article 20.2 § 1 of the cao and imposed a fine of 1,000 russian roubles ((rub), equivalent to 27 euros (eur) at the time).moreover, the applicant had intended to hold a twenty-four-hour picket in breach of the pea’s ban on public events between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. the court concluded that the applicant breached the procedure for the organisation of his public event.the justice of the peace found it established, on the basis of testimony of two eyewitnesses and police officers, that at 8 p.m. on 22 april 2008 the applicant being aware of the administrative offence proceedings pending against him under article 20.2 of the cao, had nevertheless disobeyed the lawful police order to stop the picket being held in breach of the pea.15.  on 3 june 2008 the applicant lodged a supervisory-review appeal against the judgment of 7 may 2008. on 8 july 2008 the deputy president of the supreme court of the tatarstan republic dismissed it, fully endorsing the findings of the lower courts.
10.  on 28 february 2008, in the context of a set of civil proceedings in which he was nevertheless acting as a lawyer, the applicant criticised the decisions taken by the judge hearing the case, saying that they were not worthy of a judge and that a judge could not lie or omit the truth in the exercise of his functions.the court held that under the provisions of portuguese law, in particular article 32 of the constitution and articles 64 § 3 and 287 § 4 of the ccp (see paragraphs 28, 33 and 40 below), the defendant had the right to be represented by independent counsel, a right which would not be made effective if self-representation were to be allowed.it considered the appeal to be admissible despite the fact that it had been lodged by the applicant in person, as it concerned the very issue whether the applicant, as the defendant, was entitled to conduct his own defence.20.  in an order dated 1 may 2014 the baixo-vouga criminal court rejected an appeal by the applicant against the judgment as inadmissible, on the ground that the appeal had not been signed by court-appointed defence counsel or by a lawyer instructed by the applicant.27.  according to the material before the court, the applicant did not call into question the qualifications or quality of the court-appointed lawyer at any stage in the proceedings before the domestic courts.
7.  on the same day the customs authorities instituted administrative‑offence proceedings (prekršajni postupak) against the applicant before the financial inspectorate of the ministry of finance (ministarstvo financija, financijski inspektorat – “the ministry”) for failing to declare eur 560,000 – a sum exceeding eur 10,000 – an administrative offence defined in section 40(1) of the foreign currency act and section 74 of the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism act.while the italian authorities did not reply at all, the serbian authorities informed the ministry that neither the applicant nor his wife had been recorded in their register of suspicious transactions, and the french authorities only confirmed the authenticity of the transactions on which the applicant relied to prove the origin of the money he had been carrying.11.  on the basis of the documentary evidence, the ministry established that: (a)  the company sci m. had been founded in 2002 and recorded in the business and companies register in strasbourg, and under french law its members were liable for its debts in proportion with their share in the company, that is, the applicant in respect of 99.75% and his wife in respect of 0.25%; (b)  on 6 july 2009 the applicant had indeed sold his house in france, and eur 243,091.82 from the proceeds of sale had been paid into his bank account on 29 july 2009, from which he had first transferred eur 30,000 to his company’s account on the same day and then withdrawn eur 211,500; and (c)  on 21 december 2009 the applicant, acting as the company’s director, had sold its real estate, and eur 326,008.03 from the proceeds of sale had been paid into the company’s bank account on 19 january 2010, a sum which had been withdrawn by the applicant the next day.15.  the applicant appealed by arguing that: (a)  the evidence collected indicated that the french authorities had been aware of the transaction from which the confiscated sum originated, but had done nothing about it, which suggested that they considered that it originated from a legitimate source, (b)  the ministry correctly assumed that he had not borrowed the confiscated sum from his company, as he had actually lent eur 358,600.81 to his company in 2008 and 2009, for which he had submitted documentary evidence; (c)  under french law, he was fully liable for the debts of his company, the payment of which, including taxes, he therefore could not have avoided by misappropriating the company’s funds as the ministry implied; (d)  the ministry had attempted to interpret foreign (french) law, and in such a complex area as tax and commercial law, about which it had known very little; and (e)  it was peculiar that the ministry had confiscated for the benefit of the croatian state budget the amount on which he had, in the ministry’s own view, not paid the relevant taxes in france.18.  by a decision of 17 november 2011 the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible and served its decision on his representative on 2 december 2012. it found that, even though the applicant had relied on the relevant articles of the constitution in his constitutional complaint, he had not substantiated his complaint by any constitutional-law arguments, but had merely repeated the arguments raised in the proceedings before the ministry and the high court for administrative offences.
9.  on 10 august 2005 the investigator sent the bill of indictment to the kentron and nork-marash district prosecutor (“the prosecutor”) for approval but on 15 august 2005 the prosecutor refused to approve it and returned the case to the investigator for further investigation.12.  on 7 march 2006 the investigator decided to amend the applicant’s charges and to bring new charges against him under article 178 §§ 2 (2) and 3 (1), article 182 § 3 (2), article 213 § 2 (1) and (2), and article 349 § 1 of the cc on account of fraud in large and particularly large amounts, extortion in particularly large amounts, usury performed as a profession which resulted in dire financial consequences for the injured parties, and forgery of evidence.13.  on the same date the investigator lodged an application with the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan, seeking to have the applicant detained for a period of two months, which was rejected by the district court.in addition, on thirty-five occasions the hearings were adjourned because of the absence of the victims or witnesses or because of applications lodged by them, and on thirty-two occasions because the prosecutor’s applications had been granted or because the court had decided to adjourn the case of its own motion.22.  on 31 january 2011 the district court gave judgement, finding the applicant guilty of five counts of the offences set out in article 178 § 3 (1) (fraud), article 182 § 3 (2) (extortion), article 213 § 2 (1) and (2) (usury), and article 349 § 1 (forgery of evidence) of the cc and sentenced him to nine years’ imprisonment, confiscated half of his property and imposed a fine of 400,000 armenian drams (amd).
it assessed the costs of the proceedings by reference to the value of the subject matter of the dispute indicated at the hearing on 6 april 2005, namely hrk 105,000. the relevant part of the judgment reads as follows: “... [t]he costs of the proceedings were awarded to the respondents [and assessed] according to ... the value of the dispute indicated by the claimant (hrk 105,000 ‑ (page 58 [of the case-file]) which this court accepted.” 26.  on 12 december 2005 the first-instance court ordered m.z.the relevant part of that judgment reads as follows: “in view of the fact that the [first-instance judgment] is challenged in its entirety, thus including also the decision on the costs of the proceedings, and although the appeal is not specified in that respect, [it is to be noted that] the decision on the costs of the proceedings is based on the relevant law and adequate reasons are provided.” 28.  on 24 may 2010 m.z.the relevant part of that decision reads as follows: “with regard to section 40 (3) of the civil procedure act if, in a situation referred to in subsection 2, it is obvious that the value of the subject matter of the dispute indicated by the claimant is too high or too low, so that an issue arises concerning jurisdiction over the subject matter, the composition of the court, the type of proceedings, the right to lodge an appeal on points of law, the authorisation for representation or the costs of proceedings, the court shall, ex officio or upon the objection of the respondent, by the latest at the preparatory hearing or, if no preparatory hearing has been held, at the first session of the main hearing before the respondent has begun litigation on the merits of the case, quickly and in an appropriate manner verify the accuracy of the value specified and, by a decision against which no separate appeal is allowed, determine the value of the subject matter of the dispute.only a court may set the value of the subject matter of the dispute, ex officio or if an objection is raised by the respondent, if it establishes that the value indicated in the civil action is too high or too low, by the latest at the preparatory hearing or, if no preparatory hearing has been held, at the main hearing before the examination of the merits.it follows that the relevant value of the subject matter of the dispute is the one indicated by the claimant in the civil action, namely 10,000 croatian kunas, because the claimant was not allowed to change the indicated value if he did not amend his claim at the same time.” 31.  by a decision of 10 november 2011 the constitutional court summarily declared a constitutional complaint by the applicant, complaining, inter alia, of a lack of access to the supreme court, inadmissible on the grounds that the case raised no constitutional issues.
5.  the applicant is a legal entity, a local community of the christian baptist church in the republic of poland operating on the basis of the act of 30 june 1995 on relations between the republic of poland and the christian baptist church act (ustawa o stosunku państwa polskiego do kościola chrześcijan baptystów w rp – hereinafter “the 1995 act”) with its seat in wrocław.the governor further held that: “... in the circumstances of the case, section 40 of the act likewise cannot be applied because the property in question is located on territory which was not part of poland before 1 september 1939. the fact that the property was owned by an organisational unit of the baptist church operating in the german reich does not constitute a basis to claim return of ownership because its ownership was transferred to the state under the [1946 decree].” 18.  on 23 september 1996 the applicant church appealed against this decision to the minister of the interior and administration.22.  on 5 march 1999, before examination of the applicant church’s complaint, the minister of the interior and administration issued a decision, annulling the challenged decision and ordering the return of the case to the governor.28.  on 20 october 2000 the applicant church lodged a complaint (zażalenie) with the minister of the interior and administration that the governor had exceeded the statutory time-limits and had failed to issue a decision on the merits or to justify the delay in the proceedings.the governor relied on the amended 1995 act and found that the applicant church had failed to satisfy the requirements laid down in section 4 of the act, namely that it could not be a legal successor of the church which had not operated on the territory of poland before 1 september 1939.
under the terms of this agreement, the applicant undertook to pay child support to the two children born during the marriage and agreed to his wife’s keeping his family name after the divorce.the applicant underwent a dna test to determine whether he was the father of the younger child.the dna test ‒ the result of which the applicant received on 15 january 2007 ‒ established that he was not the biological father of the second child.on 1 march 2007 the varna regional court dismissed his request, finding that it was time-barred due to the expiry – in 2004 – of the year-long limitation period counting from the child’s birth or from learning thereof (see the section “relevant domestic law and practice” below”).on 20 may 2008 his claim was rejected by the varna district court, which found that it had not been proven that the applicant was not the child’s father, given that he had not rebutted the legal presumption under article 32 (1) of the family code 1985 (“the 1985 code”).
15.  at the hearing on 11 october 2005 the representative of the plovdiv court of appeal, judge n.d., presented a copy of the judgment delivered on 3 october 2005 by the stara zagora regional court (see paragraph 27 below), and invited the sofia city court to adjourn the civil case until the end of the second set of criminal proceedings against the applicant.it further noted that the criminal courts had also deduced from the combined sentence the period of one year seven months which the applicant had spent in pre-trial detention during the first set of criminal proceedings, and found that therefore the length of the applicant’s detention had not exceeded the sentence imposed on him.the trial court further held that there had been no evidence of bias on the part of any of the two professional judges and the three lay judges sitting in the trial court, who had not been involved in the first set of criminal proceedings against the applicant.that request was dismissed on the following grounds: none of the lawful reasons for the withdrawal of judges set out in article 25 of the code of criminal procedure had been established in the present case; there was no evidence of bias on the part of the trial court judges, the case had been examined by a different court whose impartiality was unchallenged and the regional court had no means of influencing the outcome of the respective proceedings; and in any event, an appeal lay against the regional court’s future decision in that criminal case.32.  by judgment of 16 november 2006 the supreme court of cassation set aside the 25 january 2006 judgment of the plovdiv court of appeal, reduced the applicant’s sentence to three years’ imprisonment, combined the latter with the sentence imposed during the first set of criminal proceedings and deducted the period spent in pre-trial detention during the first set of criminal proceedings.
10.  during the hearings on the same day - which lasted from 11.30 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. for the first applicant, from 9.40 a.m. to 10.25 a.m. for the second applicant and from 10.30 a.m. to 11.25 a.m. for the third applicant – the judge heard the prosecutor, the applicants and their counsel.they complained that they had not still received copies of the detention orders of 13 march 2007. they further argued that the town court had disregarded the fact that the offence imputed to the applicants was not a serious one, that they had permanent places of residence, had positive references and studied at a university.14.  on 27 march 2007 counsel for the applicants complained before the odintsovo town court that the investigators had denied them access to the case file and had refused to give them copies of, in particular, the prosecutor’s applications for remand and of the detention orders.the first and third applicants received copies of their respective detention orders on 30 march 2007. the delay in serving the detention orders on the applicants was due to the fact that the judge had sent the documents to the mozhaysk detention facility, although the applicants were held at the odintsovo detention facility.the evidence showing the existence of the risks of absconding, reoffending or interfering with the investigation to which the town court had referred in its detention orders had not been examined during the hearings and the applicants had not been given an opportunity to challenge it.
the latter argued that he should not be detained by reliance on article 108 § 1.1 of the code of criminal procedure (“the ccrp”), which prohibits the remanding in custody of people suspected or accused of offences committed within the sphere of their business activities.the taganskiy district court dismissed that argument in the following terms: “... [the applicant] is suspected of having committed a serious offence aimed at making a profit which was unconnected to any business activity and had been organised by a group of people; [the offence being] punishable with up to ten years’ imprisonment, some of the accomplices have not yet been identified and arrested.” 7.  on 21 october 2013 the moscow city court upheld the detention order.as regards article 108 § 1.1 of the ccrp, the district court stated as follows: “the court dismisses the arguments of the defence and of [the applicant] himself that the offence of which he is accused was committed within the sphere of his business activity because, according to the current bill of indictment, he is accused of having committed an offence motivated by profit with the aim of misappropriating another’s property by way of deception or abuse of trust, using an organised group, and on a particularly large scale.the court therefore concludes that the offence imputed to [the applicant] was not connected to the carrying out of a business activity, which is an independent activity undertaken at one’s own risk with the aim of obtaining regular revenues from the use of possessions, the sale of goods, or the performance of works or services by people registered in such a capacity in accordance with the law.” 10.  on 14 may 2014 the moscow city court upheld on appeal the detention extension order of 28 march 2014. it held that the first-instance court had examined and dismissed with proper substantiation the applicant’s argument that his alleged offence had been committed within the sphere of his business activity.the tverskoy district court rejected the argument as follows: “... the court takes the view that, as can be seen from the evidence in the case, the method and circumstances described in the decision to initiate the criminal investigation, and the actions of [the applicant] in misappropriating the funds in this case are not related to [a business] activity as defined in article 2 § 1 of the civil code of the russian federation”.

[the applicant] was escorted to the police station for the compiling of a record of administrative offence ... with a view to the correct and expedient examination of the case, he was subjected to the measure of administrative arrest ... the actions of the police officers relating to the escorting and the arrest procedures were assessed by the courts dealing with the administrative charge and were, in substance, declared lawful ... the claimant’s argument that the courts in a civil case should assess the lawfulness of the police actions is based on a wrong interpretation of the law ... it is not appropriate to challenge the procedure of administrative arrest within the procedure under chapter 25 of the code of civil procedure, where there is a decision to engage the liability of a person for an administrative offence ...” 34.  this application was lodged on 5 september 2014 by aleksey olegovich dragomirov, who was born in 1980 and lives in roslavl in the smolensk region, russia.the court observed as follows: (a)  having regard to articles 5, 10 and 11 of the convention and the ruling of the plenary supreme court of russia dated 27 june 2013 (concerning the application of the convention by courts of general jurisdiction), the police’s action in taking the applicant to the police station had been proportionate and had pursued a legitimate aim; it had been of short duration, and had not involved any recourse to physical force.53.  the justice of the peace convicted the applicant of the offence and sentenced him to five days of administrative detention, to be counted from 4 september 2015. the justice of the peace stated that the applicant’s guilt was confirmed by, inter alia, the record of administrative offence compiled by the police as well as by the applicant’s guilty plea.

[they consist of] the islamic religion and the teaching of the holy koran, which is supplemented and interpreted by the knowledge and practices of prophet mohamed and imam ali, the holy ehlibeyt (the prophet’s family) and the holy journey of haji bektash veli ... it is about the sources of the islamic religion, for which there is already a registered religious community ... whose teaching includes the koran and the practices of mohamed aleyhisselam.in order to reply whether there are elements of discrimination in the dismissal of the application for registration of the bektashi religious community, the constitutional court assesses whether the courts which decided in the registration proceedings ... gave sufficient reasons and whether the refusal to register the bektashi religious community was based on relevant and reasonable grounds, namely whether the refusal of registration pursued a legitimate aim and whether there was a measure of proportionality between the means used and the aim pursued ...” 33.  the court then referred to the grounds on which the registration court had based its decision and stated as follows: “... the [registration] court refused to register the [applicant association] on two grounds: (1) the intended name of the [applicant association] contained the term ‘bektashi’ which had been incorporated into the name of an already registered religious entity, the ‘ehlibeyt bektashi religious group of macedonia’ ... and (2) its doctrinal sources were the same as the doctrinal sources of an already registered religious entity, the islamic religious community.

39.  the legal question read as follows: “does the expression “court improperly constituted” in article 439 § 1 (2) of the ccp also concern a situation in which a court that ruled on a case included a judge who had been “allocated” to the case by some other entity than the [one] authorised to do so by law, i.e. the president of a court (president of a division) assigning a judge – article 350 § 1 (1) of the ccp – in the manner specified in article 351 § 1 of the ccp.” 40.  in a resolution adopted on 17 november 2005, the supreme court replied as follows: “the assignment of members of a court in breach of the rules specified in articles 350 § 1 and 351 § 1 of the ccp constitutes a relative ground of appeal (względna przyczyna odwoławcza) referred to in article 438 § 2 of the ccp.” 41.  in its legal question, the court of appeal noted that, in consequence of a decision adopted by the board of the warsaw regional court, the president of a division in that court had issued an order assigning judge a.k.59.  the court of appeal held as follows: “in the present case ... on the basis of the circumstances concerning the passing of the 2005 amendment established in the course of the appellate proceedings, the court of appeal reached the conclusion that the regulations contained in the act had been adopted by the legislature, in particular, so that they could be applied to the pending proceedings in a specific case indicated in the reasons for the bill, and in addition, the judge hearing the case took part in the process of amending the law as an advisor, thus showing a lack of impartiality.having regard to the foregoing, the application of the 2005 amendment to the present case would have patently violated the standards of articles 10 and 45 § 1 of the constitution and article 6 of the convention concerning the right to a fair trial before an impartial tribunal and would have had an obvious influence on the pertinent part of the judgment.” 60.  the court of appeal decided not to apply the 2005 amendment to that part of the case.66.  the prosecutor general lodged a cassation appeal against the part of the court of appeal’s judgment concerning the discontinuation of the proceedings against the second applicant in respect of the charge of theft of the fozz’s property of a considerable value (point vi.2 of the operative provisions of the trial court’s judgment).was present at the [committee’s] meeting on 1 june 2005 on the point concerning the above-mentioned bill, because he was waiting for the beginning [of a discussion on] of the third point for which he had been invited as an advisor (i.e. on the bill amending the criminal code and the code of execution of sentences in respect of combating paedophilia ...) the agenda of that meeting included a discussion on the amendments proposed in the second reading of the deputies’ bill: 98.  it appears that judge a.k.
the judge refused to adjourn the hearing until 25 august 2010, but granted a two-hour adjournment until 6 p.m. 12.  on 24 august 2010 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 24 november 2010, having found no grounds for altering or lifting the custodial measure and having taken note of the particular complexity of the case.most of the file consisted of procedural documents concerning issues relating to the institution of the criminal proceedings, the extension of the time-limit for the investigation, the joinder of criminal cases, and documents which had been previously handed to the applicant.besides, all these documents had been examined in the hearing on 24 august 2010. as regards the applicant’s complaint as to his inability to have a confidential exchange with his lawyer before the hearing of 24 august 2010, the city court held that the applicant and his lawyer had been given the opportunity to communicate in the courtroom.20.  on 22 february 2011, reiterating the reasons which had prompted the application of the custodial measure in the applicant’s case, the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 24 may 2011 pending examination of the case file.the court noted that the grounds which had prompted the application of the custodial measure in the applicant’s case had not changed, and referred to the considerable size of the case file, a case file which neither the applicant, nor his co-defendants or their lawyers had been able to examine in full.

according to the statement of the charges, at 12.30 p.m. on 14 december 2004 forty party members had effected an unauthorised entry into the reception area of the administration of the president of the russian federation.until the arrival of the police, the party members, including the applicants, had waved anti‑president placards through the office window, thrown out leaflets and chanted slogans calling for the president’s resignation.20.  counsel for the defendants asked the guards questions about the names and positions of the persons who had given orders during the arrest operation, the number of persons involved in the arrest operation, the witnesses’ exact positions and duties and about the substance of the orders they had received from their superiors.14 on the ground floor... they then blocked the door with a heavy metal safe and conducted an unauthorised meeting, during which they waved the national bolsheviks party flag and placards, threw anti-[putin] leaflets out [of windows] and issued an unlawful ultimatum by calling for the president’s resignation, thereby destabilising the normal functioning of the president’s administration and preventing its reception personnel from performing their service duties, namely ... reception of members of the public and examination of applications from citizens of the russian federation ... while performing the above disorderly acts [the defendants] ... destroyed and damaged property in the offices of the reception area of the president’s administration building ...” 23.  given that the defendants had voluntary compensated the pecuniary damage caused by their actions and taking into account their positive references, the court sentenced the majority of them to various terms of imprisonment (ranging from one year and six months to three years) conditional on two or three years’ probation.they also submitted that when determining the sentences the trial court had unlawfully taken into account the defendants’ respective roles in the commission of the imputed offence, given that the charges brought against them were identically phrased and that the role and actions of each defendant had not been detailed.
he highlighted the length of the investigation, the fact that the gendarme had not been held in pre-trial detention and the disjoinder of the proceedings for false testimony concerning members of the gendarmerie patrol present on the day of the events, as well as the tensions during the five days of the hearing before the assize court.20.  on 2 april 2010 the applicant was summoned to appear before the disciplinary board on the basis of article 183 of the above-mentioned decree of 27 november 1991 (see paragraph 29 below), “for having, in the public lobby outside the courtroom of the nîmes court of appeal, seriously breached the essential ethical principles of the legal profession, and specifically those of discretion and moderation, by publicly making the following comments accusing the court and jury of racist and xenophobic bias”.it found as follows: “outside the courtroom, lawyers are not protected by immunity [of judicial speech] and the appropriate degree of their freedom of speech is no longer assessed in relation to the requirements of the exercise of the rights of the defence, but only in relation to freedom of expression.” the court of appeal noted that the statements had been made in public, inside the court building, but before the press and not in the course of judicial proceedings; at that juncture, the verdict had been known and the hearing was over.the court further found as follows: “as the members of the jury form part of the assize court, composed of three professional judges and nine lay jurors, this amounts to discrediting the entire court and consequently the judiciary itself, by disregarding the other three members of the assize court and especially the collegial spirit whose very purpose is to avoid bias and afford enhanced procedural guarantees.” in the court of appeal’s view, the remarks did not form part of the exercise of the rights of the defence, in the absence of any mention of the possibilities of appeal against the decision of the assize court.among those debates he mentioned the courts’ treatment of police officers implicated in criminal proceedings, stating as follows: “we need only recall the judicial ramifications of two cases that caused a sensation and attracted widespread media coverage at the time of the proceedings resulting in the acquittal of gendarme c: [after] the pursuit and death of zyed b and bouna t in 2005 [triggered riots for weeks, the decision of the paris court of appeal on 27 april 2011 to dismiss the case revived the debate], and the death of ali z in 2009. following those events, in a report published on 2 april 2009, amnesty international expressed concern about an increase in police violence and a lack of judicial action against the perpetrators.
he was also the chairman and one of the co-founders of the election monitoring centre (seçkilərin monitorinqi mərkəzi), a non‑governmental organisation specialising in the monitoring of elections which was established on 19 february 2006. following numerous attempts to acquire status as a legal entity under domestic law, the election monitoring centre was finally registered by the ministry of justice on 1 february 2008. however, a few months later, in may 2008, the domestic courts ordered its dissolution at the request of the same ministry.the prosecutor justified his request by citing the gravity of the charges against the applicant, the fact that he did not live at the address where he was officially registered as a resident, and that there was a risk of his absconding from the investigation and obstructing the investigation’s functioning by influencing other participants in the criminal proceedings.the court cited the gravity of the charges and the risk of re-offending and justified its decision as follows: “after having examined the request with the material of the case file and having heard the submissions of the investigator and the prosecutor in favour of the request and the submissions of the accused and his representative against the request, the court considers that the request should be granted.moreover, he was unable to obstruct the functioning of the investigation as all the documents relating to his activities had been in the possession of the investigation since the search of the centre’s office on 31 october 2013.23.  following a request dated 4 march 2014 from the prosecutor general’s office for an extension of the period of the applicant’s pre-trial detention, on 6 march 2014 the nasimi district court extended the applicant’s detention pending trial by three months, until 16 june 2014. the court justified its decision by citing the complexity of the case and the fact that a number of investigative steps still needed to be carried out, meaning that more time was needed to complete the investigation.
10.  on 6 february 2008, following an appeal by the applicant against the order by which his criminal complaint was filed away, the public prosecutor at the athens court of appeal ordered e.t.’s criminal prosecution for slander made through the press, considering that the above-mentioned statements were susceptible of harming the applicant’s honour and reputation, not only individually, but also as representative of greek helsinki monitor.in respect of article 62 of the constitution and the applicant’s objection, the domestic court held the following: “... in addition, since parliament has not granted leave, the prosecution is declared inadmissible if it concerns an offence committed when the defendant was a member of parliament.if, however, criminal proceedings were initiated prior to that, when the defendant was not a member of parliament, then they are suspended until the said leave is granted or until the defendant’s status as a parliamentarian ends ... it should be noted that in the present case no matter arises concerning the interpretation of articles 61, 62 and 20 § 1 of the constitution ... and of article 6 § 1 of the convention, so as for the court to rule that parliament’s leave is not required to conduct this trial because the above-mentioned act did not take place, according to the civil claimant’s allegations, in the context of her parliamentary duties.that is because the prosecutable offence (slander for an interview that the defendant gave to a newspaper in her capacity as general secretary for gender equality of the ministry of interior, public administration and decentralisation) clearly does not concern a private dispute; it should be examined if it relates and is linked to the political activity of the defendant-deputy and in general to the exercise of her parliamentary duties.however, examination of this matter and, eventually, any conclusion thereof can only be carried out by the competent authority, the greek parliament ...” 16.  the decision was published on the date of the hearing, that is to say 17 february 2010, and was finalised (i.e. entered in a special book at the registry of the criminal court) on 10 august 2010. on 13 august 2010 the applicant lodged an application with the public prosecutor of the court of cassation requesting an examination of points of law of the said judgment.
mr guk’s application has already been examined by the court, which found, in particular, a violation of article 3 of the convention on account of the conditions of his detention in the above colony (see guk v. ukraine [committee], no.(b)  submissions by the government 11.  according to the government, the equipment in the applicant’s cell corresponded to the domestic standards.the temperature in the cell was not less than 18 degrees celsius and the air in the cell was neither damp nor cold.12.  according to the applicant, the washing unit in the colony had no changing facilities, so the prisoners had first to undress in their cells.15.  in support of the above submissions, the applicant referred to the written statement of mr guk, which confirmed the procedure the prisoners had had to follow when the guards had opened the cell.
article i of its transitional provisions, as in force at the material time, also provided that persons who on the date of the entry into force of the transitional provisions of the law were members of the already existing bar association or who had a special permit to provide paid legal services had the right to be founding members of the aba, without having to pass a qualification examination, subject to their complying with the requirements in respect of candidates for admission to practice as legal counsel (see paragraph 35 below).by a unanimous decision of the members of the presidium of the aba the admission of intigam aliyev to the aba is refused.” 15.  on 21 february 2006 the first applicant brought an action in the nasimi district court alleging that the presidium’s decision of 27 january 2006 had been unlawful.it appears from the transcript of the nasimi district court’s hearing held on 7 february 2007, which was submitted to the court by the first applicant, that the representative of the aba at the hearing, i.k., stated, in reply to the first applicant’s question concerning the grounds for the presidium’s decision of 27 january 2006, that the first applicant’s replies to the questions and his previous statements had justified the decision of the presidium’s members.the court held that the first applicant’s complaint should be dismissed because admission to the aba was a matter which fell within the exclusive competence of the members of the presidium and there had been no breach of law in the examination of the first applicant’s request by the presidium.it further appears from the transcript of the court of appeal’s hearing held on 6 june 2007, which was submitted to the court by the first applicant, that the representative of the aba, i.k., again stated at the hearing that the members of the presidium had considered that the first applicant should not be admitted to the aba because of his stance on the functioning of the aba.
12.  in his advisory opinion of 10 december 2013, the advocate general (advocaat-generaal) to the supreme court expressed his view that the applicant’s appeal should be dismissed with the exception of the first of the grounds of the appeal, which pertained to the length of the proceedings: the duration of the cassation proceedings had exceeded a reasonable time within the meaning of article 6 § 1 of the convention, for which a reduction of sentence was to be applied.the appeal may, for instance, be manifestly ill-founded (klaarblijkelijke ongegrondheid), because the impugned ruling rests on two grounds, each of which is capable of supporting the decision by itself but only one of which is challenged, or there may be a lack of interest, for example because a ground for the appeal, although well-founded, cannot, after the overturning of the impugned ruling, lead to an outcome other than the one to which that ruling had led.’ ... 2.2.2.  section 80a of the judiciary (organisation) act does, however, bring about a change in cases in which an omission hitherto necessitated the overturning of the impugned ruling, even though the person bringing the cassation appeal did not actually have a sufficient interest − deserving to be respected in law (niet voldoende in rechte te respecteren belang) − in such an overturning and a possible rehearing after remittal or referral of the case.... consequences for the content of the statement of grounds of appeal in cassation and the ‘borgers letter’ 2.6.1.  pursuant to the second paragraph of section 80a of the judiciary (organisation) act the supreme court will not issue a decision of the kind referred to in the first paragraph without first having taken cognisance of the written statement of grounds of appeal in cassation ... if the ‘selection at the gate’ (selectie aan de poort) which the legislature has introduced by way of section 80a of the judiciary (organisation) act is to achieve its intended aim, then the lawyer who acts as legal representative, or the public prosecution service as the case may be, can reasonably be expected – in the words of the explanatory memorandum – to submit ‘statements of grounds of appeal ... that are of decent quality’.the judgment also implies that the case in question concerns one of the situations where there is no need for such referral of preliminary questions, namely when the preliminary question raised is not relevant for the resolution of the dispute or can be answered in the light of the case-law of the court of justice [of the european union] or that no reasonable doubt exists as to the manner in which the question concerning the rules of community law was to be resolved.” 21.  article 267 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (“tfeu”)[2] provides as follows: “the court of justice shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning: (a)  the interpretation of the treaties; (b)  the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the union ...; where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a member state, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the court to give a ruling thereon.it concluded that they were not obliged to refer a question of interpretation of community law raised before them in the following situations: (1) where the question was not relevant, in the sense that the answer to the question, regardless of what it might be, could in no way affect the outcome of the case; (2) where the question was materially identical to a question which had already been the subject of a preliminary ruling in a similar case, or where previous decisions of the court had already dealt with the point of law in question, irrespective of the nature of the proceedings which led to those decisions, even though the questions at issue were not strictly identical; or (3) where the correct application of community law was so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt as to the manner in which the question raised was to be resolved (bearing in mind that before it came to this conclusion the national court or tribunal had to be convinced that the matter was equally obvious to the courts of the other member states and to the court of justice, and only if those conditions were satisfied could the national court or tribunal refrain from submitting the question to the court of justice and take upon itself the responsibility for resolving it).
13.  in september 2007 the authorities informed the applicant that they had addressed the kaunas municipality regarding vacant plots of land in the area where her father had had the land, and had been told that the restitution process had to be carried out in accordance with the detailed plan for restitution approved in 1991.25.  in november 2014 the authorities informed the applicant that as of 1 november 2014, article 21 § 4 of the law on restitution provided that a citizen who had already asked for his or her property rights to a plot of land to be restored could, by 1 march 2015, express or change his or her wish regarding the form in which the ownership rights to the real property were to be restored, and choose a plot of forest of equal value, provided that a final decision on restitution had not been taken or, if taken, had not yet been executed or had been executed in part.the court further referred to the administrative proceedings regarding the applicant’s alleged inability to use one plot of land that had been returned to her (see paragraphs 26-28 above), and the civil proceedings regarding the sale of the plot of land of 0.0498 hectares to r.n., started by the national land service (see paragraphs 29-31 above).the court held that the authorities could only choose the method of restitution for a citizen if he or she had not expressed his or her decision before 1 april 2003. in the applicant’s situation, the national land service had not issued any decision within the required six-month time-limit, and thus the applicant had a right to receive compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage.in june 2009 the authorities had indicated the method by which the compensation would be calculated and had stated that the value of the 2.5469 hectares of land which had to be restored to the applicant would be ltl 20,167 (approximately eur 5,841) if the applicant preferred to acquire the land in another area, and ltl 32,267 (approximately eur 9,345) if she preferred compensation in securities (see paragraph 16 above).
the authors of the memoirs described their lives in the pkk camps, in rural areas in both turkey and iraq, armed clashes with the turkish security forces, and their ideology and opinions regarding the situation in turkey.the judge considered that the passages referred to by the public prosecutor incited the use of methods of violence and terror, and thus constituted propaganda in favour of the pkk.in its judgment, the court held: “on the basis of the examination of the book in its entirety, it has been observed that the book depicts the activities of members of the pkk-kadek, the terrorist organisation, and their so-called impressions of the clashes between them and members of the security forces.the preface to the book contains the following: ‘our president apo[2] states that the outcome of the war is very valuable ... while the history written and life created by bullets drip off pens, guerrillas go beyond the faraway corners of our land with their bags on the backs and their weapons in their hands ... we smile with a picture of war and, with a song, we add new [people] to those who have left us ...’ on page 160, it is stated: ‘we had to change the anatolian people’s army for emancipation in accordance with the needs of the anatolian people.i had only one wish: engaging in a clash and getting in a good shot with my weapon, which i had not used, although i had had it with me for long time.’ ‘... [he asked] “my friend, is this your first [armed] clash?” i said “yes.” “[armed] clashes are nice, aren’t they?” “yes, they are.”‘” 17.  the istanbul assize court considered that the above-mentioned passages and certain other passages on pages 19, 21, 81, 105, 108, 110, 113, 114, 134, 135, 139, 147, 163, 189, 197, 203, 273, 274, 277, 317 and 321 praised the armed clashes between pkk militants and the security forces, and those militants’ acts.
7.  on 18 january 2006 ms l., an investigator of the primorskiy district prosecutor’s office in st petersburg, asked the head of the primorskiy district police to identify relatives of the deceased; to establish their place of residence and to summon them to the prosecutor’s office for the purpose of granting them victim status in the criminal case.15.  on the same day, responding to the applicants’ complaints about the authorities’ failure to notify them of their son’s death, the district court issued an interim decision (частное постановление) in respect of the investigator, ms l. the decision, sent to the primorskiy district prosecutor, in so far as relevant, reads as follows: “moreover, the [finding] that the investigator, ms l., did not take sufficient steps to find relatives of the deceased and that measures undertaken [by her] were formalistic in character is not only confirmed by the fact that the decision assigning victim status to [a representative of the municipal authority] had been taken before the information was received from the police officials, but also by the fact that the criminal case-file material contained sufficient information about [the applicants’ son] on the basis of which it was possible to establish the place of residence of his relatives ([there was] an explanation from mr o. made on 1 december 2005, in which he had given information about the place of residence of [the applicants’ son]; a statement made by mr o. on 8 december 2005 in which he said that a criminal case against [the applicants’ son] was pending before a court; statements by a witness, ms a., who asserted that [the deceased’s] mother had occasionally made telephone calls to [the deceased’s] flat; a certificate on [the deceased’s] criminal record from which it is apparent that the primorskiy district prosecutor’s office of st petersburg applied a measure of restraint in the form of a written undertaking in respect of [the applicants’ son] in criminal case no.relying on article 29 § 4 of the russian code of criminal procedure, [the court] rules: -          that the violations of criminal procedural law committed during the preliminary investigation in the criminal case should be brought to the attention of the primorskiy district prosecutor in st petersburg; -          that the primorskiy district court of st petersburg should be informed of the measures taken no later than a month after receipt of the present decision.” 16.  in 2007 the applicants lodged an action against the prosecutor general’s office and the ministry of finance, seeking compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.relying on the primorskiy district court’s interim decision of 6 june 2006, the applicants argued that as a result of the investigator’s failure to promptly notify them of their son’s death, they had sustained pecuniary damage, having been forced to pay for the exhumation and transport of their son’s remains from st petersburg to belomorsk.in addition, they had suffered non-pecuniary damage as they had been unaware of their son’s whereabouts for a long time and had been forced to initiate a search for him; they had been unable to properly say “goodbye” to their son and to provide him with a decent burial; they had been forced to go through a two-week bureaucratic procedure to obtain permission to exhume their son’s remains; and subsequently, after the exhumation, they had been forced to identify his disfigured remains.
and st., were arrested on suspicion of robbing and killing m. 7.  according to the applicant, he was apprehended by the police task force at about 10 a.m. on 22 august 2004 in the apartment of his girlfriend and taken to the police station, where he was beaten up and threatened in an attempt to force him to confess to the robbery and murder of m. 8.  the case file contains two arrest warrants – one issued by a police officer and another one by the prosecutor investigating the murder (hereinafter “the investigator”), both indicating that the applicant had been arrested by the above-mentioned officials on 22 august 2004 at 6.30 p.m. at their offices.12.  during the reconstruction, which commenced near the place where the bat used for the murder had been hidden, the applicant pointed to the exact place where the bat was; the bat was then uncovered and retained as evidence.18.  on 14 october 2004 the video recording of the reconstruction of the crime of 23 august 2004 was played to the applicant in the presence of s. the applicant retracted his earlier confession and explained that he had only given it because he had been threatened and beaten up by the police on 22 august 2004.25.  the court based the applicant’s conviction, among other evidence, on the confessions he had made during his questioning by the investigator on 22 august 2004, the reconstructions of the crime on 22 and 23 august 2004, the statements of his co-defendants that they had seen him with a bat in m.’s house, and physical evidence, including an expert’s report suggesting that the traces of blood found on the bat (the location of which had been pointed out by the applicant during the reconstruction of the crime on 22 august 2004) could have belonged to m. 26.  by the same judgment, the court rejected as unsubstantiated the applicant’s submissions that he had made his self-incriminating statements under duress, referring to the results of the medical examination of 8 october 2004 (see paragraph 17 above) and the prosecutors’ decision of 19 january 2005 (see paragraph 20 above).28.  the court refuted the applicant’s allegation that the bat retained as evidence had been switched with another (see paragraph 22 above), noting that the disparity in the bat’s description by the experts and the prosecutor could have been explained by the fact that the latter was colour blind.
12.  on an unspecified date the applicant lodged a request with the pest central district court for the child’s return, pursuant to the hague convention of 25 october 1980 on the civil aspects of international child abduction (hereinafter, “the hague convention”).14.  following an appeal by k.s., on 8 november 2012 the budapest high court upheld the decision of the pest central district court and ordered that the child be returned to italy by 30 november 2012 or to the applicant or his proxy in budapest by 4 december 2012.the bailiff of the mezőtúr district court instructed the mother to comply with the final decision and return the child to the applicant within fifteen days and ordered her to pay a fine of 152,400 hungarian forints (huf – approximately eur 490).the application was dismissed on 29 october 2013 on the grounds that the judgment of the venice minors court (see paragraph 18 above) was not yet enforceable (see paragraph 31 below) and the requirement of dual criminality was not satisfied.on 18 march 2015 the budapest prosecutor’s office dismissed this application on the grounds that the conduct described in the criminal complaint could be classified as kidnapping under the italian criminal code, but not under article 190 of the hungarian criminal code.
7.  based on the data obtained by the swiss police, on 7 august 2006 the slovenian police, without obtaining a court order, requested company s., a slovenian internet service provider (hereinafter “the isp”), to disclose data regarding the user to whom the above-mentioned ip address had been assigned at 1.28 p.m. on 20 february 2006. the police based their request on section 149b(3) of the criminal procedure act (hereinafter “the cpa”, see paragraph 36 below), which required the operators of electronic communication networks to disclose to the police information on the owners or users of certain means of electronic communication whose details were not available in the relevant directory.24.  on 20 january 2011 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law, reasoning that given the general accessibility of websites and the fact that the swiss police could check the exchanges in the p2p network simply by monitoring the users sharing certain contents, that is without any particular intervention in internet traffic, such communication could not be considered private and thus protected by article 37 of the constitution.29.  the most relevant parts of the constitutional court’s decision are as follows (as translated into english on the constitutional court’s website): “review of the objections regarding access to the complainant’s ip address by the swiss police 11. the second paragraph of article 37 of the constitution provides a higher level of protection than article 8 of the echr as it requires a court order for any interference with the right to communication privacy ... the right to communication privacy determined by the first paragraph of article 37 of the constitution primarily protects the content of the communicated message.... review of the objections regarding access to data on the user of a certain ip address 16. the complainant also challenges the standpoint of the supreme court that by its request to the service provider under the third paragraph of article 149.b of the cpa the police did not acquire traffic data, but only data regarding a particular user of a determined means of communication ... 17. in the case at issue, on 7 june 2006, on the basis of the third paragraph of article 149.b of the cpa, the police sent a request to the service provider for data regarding the user to whom ip address 195.210.223.200 was assigned on 20 february 2006 at 13:28. in the response, they received data regarding the user’s name, surname, and address, while the time of the communication set to the nearest second was already known.this essential circumstance in my opinion negates the notion of the neutrality of the datum regarding a specific user of services for a certain (known) dynamic ip address that the police sought through the service provider - namely, the neutrality of the datum in terms of denying its ability to communicate anything more than the name and address of a certain person (who has a subscription contract with the service provider).
6.  at the material time, the applicant was a civil servant in the metropolitan municipality of istanbul and a member of the local branch of the tümbel-sen trade union, which is affiliated to the kesk (kamu emekçileri sendikaları konfederasyonu – the confederation of public employees’ trade unions).7.  in april 2008 two of the largest trade unions, namely the di̇sk (devrimci i̇şçi sendikaları konfederasyonu – confederation of revolutionary workers’ trade unions) and the kesk (kamu emekçileri sendikaları konfederasyonu – confederation of public employees’ trade unions) announced that they were planning a large scale demonstration in istanbul for 1 may 2008 and that their members would be gathering to celebrate the labour day and to commemorate their friends who had lost their lives during the demonstrations of 1 may 1977.8.  in may 2008 the applicant was informed that a disciplinary investigation had been initiated against him for being absent without leave on 1 may 2008 and he was asked to submit his defence submissions.9.  subsequently, the applicant was given a warning as a disciplinary sanction owing to his being absent without leave on 1 may 2008 pursuant to section 125 of the civil servants act (law no.11.  on 16 may 2008 the disciplinary board of the istanbul municipality dismissed the applicant’s objection, finding that the contested decision was in accordance with the law and that there were no grounds to annul it.
8.  on 29 august 2001 the public prosecutor attached to the istanbul state security court filed an indictment with the istanbul state security court charging the applicant with aiding and abetting the pkk, an illegal armed organisation, under article 169 of the former criminal code, on account of the publication of the book entitled the language of life in the mountains.13.  on 16 august 2003 the public prosecutor attached to the istanbul state security court filed an indictment with the istanbul state security court charging the applicant with aiding and abetting the pkk under article 169 of the former criminal code on account of the publication of the book entitled 33 days in the deluge.according to the indictment, on pages 129, 130 and 135 the struggle of the pkk and its leader, abdullah öcalan, was praised and the applicant had therefore aided the pkk through the medium of the press.16.  on 25 june 2009 the court of cassation quashed the judgment of 7 december 2007, holding that the first-instance court should not have joined the two cases, since the case concerning the language of life in the mountains was a re-qualification of the applicant’s previous final conviction (uyarlama yargılaması).the assize court further found that the book permitted the opinions of the pkk to be transmitted to the public and was aimed at bringing more sympathisers into that organisation and thus at destroying the unitary nature of the state of the republic of turkey.
11.  at the relevant time, the applicant possessed a certificate issued by the sfry authorities in kosovo in 1988 indicating that he had been an albanian national with the status of a foreigner holding a temporary residence permit in the sfry.12.  on 2 february 1989 the ministry of the interior of the then socialist republic of croatia informed the novska police that the applicant’s application for a permanent residence permit in the sfry had been refused in accordance with the government policy according to which albanian refugees should be instructed to apply for the sfry citizenship.29.  a report on the applicant’s personal circumstances prepared by the novska police on 8 march 1995 indicated that he had lived in croatia since 1979. the report contains a statement that the applicant had an albanian passport issued in kosovo (then part of serbia) and that he had allegedly disappeared from his place of residence during the war in croatia.33.  on 29 may 1996 the administrative court dismissed the applicant’s administrative action on the grounds that there was no evidence that he had had a registered residence in croatia since 1979. in fact, according to the novska police’s report of 28 march 1995 (see paragraph 29 above), he had had a registered residence in novska, as a foreigner with extended residence status, since 24 september 1993. in these circumstances, the administrative court considered that no available evidence suggested that the applicant had had an uninterrupted registered residence in novska for a period of more than five years as required by section 8(1)(3) of the croatian citizenship act.the administrative court held that the ministry had properly established that the applicant had failed to meet the statutory requirements under section 29(1) of the movement and stay of foreigners act as his employment booklet did not show that he had worked for an uninterrupted period of three years.
on 29 july 2009 the authorities initiated assistance measures, including parenting guidance, couple therapy, a norwegian language course for the applicant, and aggression management therapy for c. an application was also submitted for a kindergarten place for a. after a while the kindergarten raised concerns owing to a’s high absence rate and the fact that many verbal expressions of anger were being directed at the staff by c. 15.  on 15 october 2009 the police raised additional concerns with the child welfare authorities after they had been called out to the hospital in f. the mother had been admitted the day before with a suspected ectopic pregnancy.23.  the parents appealed against the emergency care order of 17 november 2010 to the board, which granted the appeal in part in a decision of 15 december 2010. the decision regarding the emergency placement was upheld, but the amount of contact with the children was increased and the decision not to inform the parents of the children’s whereabouts was set aside.in the high court’s opinion, there can be little doubt that the father’s further contact with the mother will be harmful to the children and constitute a significant deficiency in relation to the children’s safety if the care order is revoked.” 49.  however, the high court had stated in its judgment that the question of contact for the applicant could be seen in a different light if c were expelled from the country.his rape of the applicant in march 2012, and the surveillance and death threats against her via an accomplice in the summer of 2013 showed that he had learnt nothing from the abduction in 2011. on the basis of the factors set out above, the board assumed that, for the foreseeable future, c appeared to be prepared to use unlawful means to gain control over the applicant and the children.being removed from them would constitute a serious trauma with the potential to do great harm, not least because of the vulnerability they have developed as a result of their experiences before the placement.” 96.  the city court deemed it out of the question to expose the children to the risk that returning them to the applicant would entail, and found that the conditions for this were not satisfied.
8.  on 5 november 1996 the regional office of the croatian employment bureau in rijeka (hrvatski zavod za zapošljavanje, područna služba u rijeci, hereinafter “the rijeka employment bureau”) granted the applicant unemployment benefits in the amount of 410.89 croatian kunas (hrk – about 55 euros (eur)) for 468 days, starting from 11 december 1995. there was no appeal, so that decision became final.16.  on 25 july 2001 the applicant then lodged two administrative actions with the administrative court, seeking the annulment of the central employment bureau’s decisions of 11 and 15 may 2001. she claimed that she had twenty-seven years of service, and as such was entitled to unemployment benefits until she was next employed or until she retired.18.  in a separate judgment of the same day the administrative court quashed the decision of 15 may 2001 which upheld the decision of 3 april 2001 by which the applicant had been ordered to repay the sum of hrk 19,451.69 (see paragraph 14 above).19.  on 25 march 2005 the rijeka employment bureau contacted the applicant by letter, proposing to reach an out-of-court settlement within fifteen days regarding the repayment of the unemployment benefits which she had received between 9 june 1998 and 27 march 2001, in total hrk 19,451.69. she was cautioned that the rijeka employment bureau would otherwise be compelled to institute civil proceedings against her for repayment of the amount claimed.it also allowed the rijeka employment bureau’s appeal and, relying on section 210 of the civil obligations act, reversed the first-instance judgment in respect of the unjust enrichment claim, and ordered the applicant to pay hrk 19,451.69 plus statutory interest running form 3 august 2005 (the date of lodging the claim against the applicant) to the rijeka employment bureau.

a guard had had to open the door of the cell every time the applicant needed to visit the toilet and sometimes its use had taken place in front of the other prisoners, since it had no door.he had not been provided with hygiene or cleaning products, nor had he had access to medical care despite his disability and the wounds to his leg, which had become worse owing to the conditions in which he had been detained.15.  the applicant submitted that he had not received appropriate medical treatment, that he had not been regularly monitored by a doctor, and that at no time had he been admitted to a hospital with access to nursing staff who would have taken appropriate measures to ensure that his needs were met.the records at the government’s disposal did not show the exact number of the applicant’s fellow inmates but at the time of the government’s submissions the cell had accommodated seventeen detainees.the record submitted by the government showed that the applicant had met with the prison psychologist twenty-seven times, and had been provided with financial, psychological and material assistance through the channel of the prison’s department of social service.

the event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at bolotnaya square which was supposed to end at 7.30 p.m. the march was peaceful and held without any disruptions, but when the marchers arrived at bolotnaya square it transpired that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue, allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting.on 9 june 2012 he was arrested on suspicion of having participated in acts of mass disorder and of using violence against the police during the demonstration of 6 may 2012. on the same day the basmannyy district court of moscow ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention until 9 august 2012. it referred to the gravity of the charges and information about the applicant’s personality.it held, in particular, as follows: “between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. on 6 may 2012 ... at bolotnaya square ... unidentified persons ... called those present [at the venue] to move outside the agreed meeting venue, to defy the lawful orders of the police ..., to use violence ... which led to mass disorder accompanied by the use of violence against public officials in connection with the performance of their duties [and] the destruction of property.on the same day at 5 p.m. at the latest [the defendants] acquired the criminal intent to participate in mass disorder and to use violence against ... police officers ... moreover ... the participants of the acts of mass disorder threw pieces of tarmac, stones, sticks and other objects at the police ... which hit them on various parts of their body, and [the defendants] ... [who] participated in the acts of mass disorder ... implemented their criminal intent to use violence against public officials ... applied physical force which was not a danger to the life or health of those [officials] ... between 5.05 p.m. and 10 p.m. [the applicant] ... shouted insulting slogans and used metal barriers to block the police’s movement ... thus preventing the arrest of the participants in the acts of mass disorder ... [the applicant], acting intentionally, at least three times threw stones and pieces of tarmac at police officers in a targeted manner ... and used violence against an unidentified police officer which did not endanger his life or health ... unidentified participants in the acts of mass disorder, acting intentionally, tore a protection helmet off an unidentified police officer’s head and punched and kicked him several times in the head and body, meanwhile [the applicant] ... punched this police officer at least once.... the court considers the [defendants’] arguments that they were protecting somebody from police officers or happened to be victims of the police’s use of force as farfetched and aimed at mitigating their responsibility ...” 36.  the applicant was sentenced to three years and six months’ imprisonment, calculated on the basis of a three-year prison term under article 212 § 2 of the criminal code, partly concurrent with a term of one year under article 318 § 1. the applicant’s pre-trial detention counted towards the prison sentence.
the board feels that in this case the envelope has been pushed beyond the limits of public decency.” 14.  on 2 february 2009 the applicants filed a judicial protest against the chairperson, in her personal capacity and as chairperson of the board, the commissioner of police and the attorney general claiming that the actions of the board were illegal in so far as they constituted a violation of article 39 of the maltese constitution and article 10 of the convention.he, however, explained that there were instances, such as the one in the present case, where the script was so objectionable, that he did not feel the need to watch it, since the two elements which he objected to (the words concerning auschwitz and the passage about fred and rose mary west) would always remain objectionable, no matter the way in which they were presented, be it a tragedy or a comedy.no matter how the text of the play is looked at, it runs aground on the reef of the inalienable dignity of the human person, and the court understands that this was the underlying reason for the board’s decision.” 43.  the court rejected their complaint under article 6 on the basis that the proper procedure had been undertaken, the applicants had been free to put forward their views in their request for reconsideration, which was carried out by another person [not present at first-instance] and no bias had been shown.46.  as to the constitutional and conventional complaint raised by the applicants, the constitutional court held that the existence of the board did not breach any of the applicants’ rights, and indeed the applicants had not impugned the law establishing the board.however, the manner in which religious beliefs and doctrines are opposed or denied is a matter which may engage the responsibility of the state, notably its responsibility to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the right guaranteed under article 9 to the holders of those beliefs and doctrines.” 49.  in its view the limits of decency had been breached due to the blasphemy which was an offence under maltese law and to the vilification of the dignity of a people, of a woman, of children, and of the human being, as well as the extreme glorification of sexual perversion.
in particular, the order did not correspond to the date on which it had been issued and the impress of a seal on the order had been made with the help of an improvised cliché which in its turn had been made with a help of a computer on the basis of an impress of the authentic seal.8.  upon receipt of this information the administration of grozny brought court proceedings against the applicant seeking to declare the allocation order of 7 february 1999 null and void and to evict her from the flat in question.the impress of a seal of the leninskiy district of grozny [on the order] had been made with the help of an improvised cliché which in its turn had been made with a help of a computer on the basis of an impress of the authentic seal.the court has assessed the whole of evidence submitted by the parties and finds that it is possible to grant the claimant’s claim...” 12.  in her appeal against the judgment of 24 february 2009 the applicant submitted that in taking the decision to evict her the district court had not examined whether she had been in need of housing or not.the impress of a seal of the leninskiy district of grozny [on the order] had been made with the help of an improvised cliché which in its turn had been made with a help of a computer on the basis of an impress of the authentic seal... ... having regards to the above, the court of first instance had concluded that the claims submitted by the administration of grozny had to be granted.
7.  the second applicant, adriatik berberaj, was detained in the prison hospital from 6 april 2010 until 21 january 2011 and from 7 february 2012 until 1 july 2015, the date on which he was released following use of the remedy provided for by section 12 of law no.10.  the fifth applicant, theodoros iliopoulos, was detained in the prison hospital from 8 january 2013 until 2 june 2015, the date on which he was released following use of the remedy provided for by section 12 of law no.27.  the applicants acknowledged that the conditions of their detention had improved in mid-2016 and that the medical-staff numbers had increased, resulting in conditions which met the requirements of article 3 of the convention but only for the period after june 2016.specifically as regards the applicants, some of them had been detained in wards 7 and 8 on the first floor of the hospital and some others in wards 1, 2 and 3 on the second floor.the government specified that all the above-mentioned improvements had made the prison hospital a detention facility significantly different to the image given in the greek ombudsman’s (συνήγορος του πολίτη) report, which had been prepared on the basis of a visit in february 2012, that is to say on a date that had no relevance to the present case.
12.  by a letter of 16 february 2011 the applicant’s lawyer disputed the lawfulness of what he categorised as the “seizure” (“beslag”), arguing that there had been no reasonable grounds for suspicion against the applicant and requested that the city court quash the “seizure” decision and order that the collected material be returned to him.19.  from the above it was apparent, in the high court’s view, that the applicant was not at that stage of the procedure entitled to have the question of whether to maintain the “seizure” in force (spørsmålet om opprettholdelse av beslaget) under article 208 reviewed (see paragraph 37 below), and it could not see how him disputing the existence of reasonable grounds for suspicion in his case could lead to a different result.20.  the high court also noted that the code of criminal procedure contained several provisions conferring on the accused a right to judicial review in respect of enforcement measures taken in the form of search and seizure, inter alia could a decision by a court to the effect that documents were to be handed over to the prosecution authorities after perusal of the documents in accordance with article 204 (see paragraph 37 below) – which was what the city court was doing at the time – be appealed against.30.  the applicant appealed against the decision to the high court, which on 8 january 2013 ordered that the mirror copies were to be returned to the applicant unless the prosecuting authority promptly (relativt omgående) requested that the city court examine them.33.  when, on 20 may 2014, the high court contacted the prosecuting authority, its decision concerning the mirror copies having been quashed by the supreme court (see paragraph 31 above), the authority responded by informing the high court of the developments in the criminal case against the applicant (see paragraph 35 below).
the second applicant is the former spouse of the first applicant and the third and the fourth applicants are their children.since 2001 (and as at the time of the observations exchanges between the parties), the household was paying the relevant maintenance charges and other tenancy-related fees, which were calculated on the premise that the flat was occupied by four persons.7.  in 2005 the first and the second applicant divorced and the first applicant and her children were placed on the waiting list for social housing managed by the municipal authority.in addition to that, the fourth applicant had still been a minor at the material time, and further legislation applicable to the protection of minors warranted the protection of her housing rights.lastly, the applicants referred to the judgment of the european court of human rights in the case of kryvitska and kryvitskyy v. ukraine (no.
8.  on 21 july 1998 the applicant addressed a letter (kërkesë) to the kavaja district court (“the district court”) and the kavaja district prosecutor (“the district prosecutor”), stating that he had engaged a., a lawyer, to represent him before the district prosecutor during the investigation and during the trial proceedings.the domestic courts held that the applicant should have known of the proceedings as he had been represented by a lawyer of his own choosing, a., who had been informed of the prosecutor’s appeal, and as his mother had appointed a lawyer to make an application for review.19.  judge a.h., who had been a member of the district court’s bench that had delivered the judgment of 26 december 2000, also sat in the district court’s bench of 4 november 2005 that dismissed the applicant’s application.20.  on an unspecified date the applicant, represented by his lawyer, lodged a constitutional complaint in respect of the alleged unfairness of the proceedings in absentia and the lack of impartiality of the district court and the court of appeal.the constitutional court, noting that a. and the applicant’s mother had had knowledge of the trial proceedings, stated that there had been no exceptional circumstances which had prevented the applicant from attending the proceedings in person.
the declared objectives of the demonstration were, inter alia, to draw the public’s attention to the precarious financial situation in which the employees of the airport would find themselves if salary cuts envisaged by the company managing the airport were carried out.the event was scheduled to be held between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. on 17 october 2012. the second applicant also specified that it was expected that about fifty to 100 persons would participate in the event and that it was intended that speeches would be given and that an open letter would be read out.7.  on 14 october 2012 the budapest police department registered the application and informed the second applicant that, in order to clarify details regarding the programme of the demonstration and the number of police officers that would be required to secure the event, it was necessary to schedule a meeting with the organisers.8.  the second applicant and the vice-president of the united civil aviation trade union met with the representatives of the monor police department on the same day.the second applicant assured the police that the demonstrators would respect traffic rules, would only occupy the part of the road not used for traffic and would distribute flyers to car passengers, and that the organisers would call off or halt the demonstration if it was not in compliance with the relevant legal provisions.
referring to the findings of the disability commissions and its own direct observation of the applicant at the hearing, it concluded that the impairment to the applicant’s health did not amount to a physical impairment within the meaning of the law.she argued that the impairment to both of her arms, her psychological illness and her headaches meant that the normal functioning of her organism was inhibited and that she had to exert greater efforts in order to perform daily tasks; that the list, which was out of date, could not possibly contain a complete list of all illnesses and injuries; that the first-instance court should not have relied on the opinions of the disability commissions and a doctor (opinions which the applicant had disputed); that the first-instance court should have appointed a medical expert, as requested by the applicant; that the applicant could not have explained all her medical issues at the hearing and that the court had not been in a position to assess the flexibility of her arms.the higher labour and social court further found the following: “a court in a judicial social dispute ... assesses the correctness and lawfulness of the impugned administrative decisions [in question] and having regard to the dispute of the full jurisdiction [the court] when quashing [the administrative decisions] alone decides on the merits.within the context of the judicial review of the administrative decisions [the court] is of course not obliged to accept evidence [submitted by] a forensic medical expert if the expert opinions of the disability commissions at first and second instance allow for the conclusion that the negative administrative decisions are correct and lawful because they are based on an assessment by both commissions which is convincing in view of the available medical documentation and the report of [the relevant] medical examination.such a procedural situation is found in the present case, because in the opinion of the appeal court the expert bodies in the pre-judicial administrative proceedings correctly determined that the applicant had no physical impairment.” 17.  the court furthermore found that physical impairments could not be determined contrary to what was provided in the list.
7.  on 7 october 2002, following an appeal by the three other defendants, the gjirokastër court of appeal upheld the decision in the applicant’s absence.the district court stated in its reasoning that the postal service had noted that the applicant was living in italy and that as a consequence he had not been aware of his conviction.in the first place, he requested that his case be re-examined separately from that of his co-defendants on the grounds that he had not sought the use of the summary procedure.in upholding the conviction, the court relied on forensic evidence produced in 1997 and 1999 and on witness statements made in 2001 and 2002. the court further stated that the applicant had been duly informed as the authorities had issued a public notice.he stressed the fact that in his appeal to the court of appeal he had asked for evidence to be obtained, including an identification parade, the questioning of a fourth person who had been present at the events, a face-to face confrontation between himself and the other co-defendants and so on.
7.  on 14 january and 10 november 2005, following proceedings in absentia, the gjirokastër district court and the court of appeal, respectively, convicted the applicant of attempted theft resulting in death in collusion with others and sentenced him to seventeen years’ imprisonment.9.  on 3 may 2007 the gjirokastër district court allowed a request by the applicant to appeal out of time and he lodged an appeal against his conviction in absentia.10.  on 12 november 2007 the gjirokaster court of appeal while requalifying the charges against the applicant on the basis of the evidence obtained during the proceedings in absentia, upheld the applicant’s conviction, ruling that it had become res judicata.11.  by a final decision of 7 october 2009 the supreme court upheld the applicant’s conviction as decided in the gjirokastër district court’s decision of 2005, ruling that it had become res judicata and that the facts and law in the case had been examined previously.12.  on 21 february 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal with the constitutional court against the supreme court’s decision, complaining, inter alia, about the fact that the domestic courts had not given him the possibility of a fresh factual and legal determination of the criminal charge.
contracts and powers of attorney envisaging future (after expiry of the moratorium) transfers of land subject to the moratorium declared invalid legislation aimed at preventing circumvention of the moratorium through the issuance of powers of attorney by land owners to third parties authorising them to dispose of the land subject to the moratorium[4] 3 19/12/2006 01/01/2008 moratorium extended, in addition to land for commercial agricultural production, to individual smallholdings (see paragraph 18 above); any change of designated use of the land subject to the moratorium forbidden; swap transactions involving a swap of one land plot for another allowed again develop private land ownership, ensure the unrestricted exercise of owners’ rights, and ensure free circulation of land except in the cases provided for by law.an “extension” of the moratorium was needed to develop an effective mechanism for sales and overseeing sales of land and to prevent possible abuses 11 10/11/2015 the same as in row 10, but not before 01/01/2017 the law extending the moratorium instructed the cabinet of ministers to produce the draft cala and submit it to parliament by 01/03/2016 lifting the moratorium in times of war and economic crisis would be a threat to national and food security and the threat of a loss of land, as an important national resource.in order to solve these and other problems created by the moratorium, the cala had to be passed and the land eventually introduced into circulation 12 06/10/2016 the same as in row 10, but not before 01/01/2018 draft cala to be submitted by 01/07/2017 apparently no such draft was submitted by the cabinet of ministers by this or the previously set deadlines, although two drafts of the cala were submitted in 2016 by certain mps (see paragraph 43 below) while the creation of a land market was a necessary element of the development of a market economy, the market had to be transparent and fair, competitive and efficient, and be able to prevent shadow transactions.the prohibition on the sale of agricultural land was a barrier for attracting investment in the agricultural sector since land could not be used as security for loans, but its lifting could not be the end in itself and needed to be thought of as a measure to encourage investment in the agricultural sector without, at the same time, leading to landlessness among the rural population[9] 22.  as at today’s date, the transitional provisions of the land code prohibit alienation in any form of most agricultural land, including of the categories owned by the applicants, except in cases of inheritance, swap transactions and expropriation for public use.[16] 37.  coalition agreements of 22 june 2006 and 29 november 2007[17] and an action programme of the cabinet of ministers of 16 january 2008[18] stated, in nearly identical terms, that the coalition and government had the following priorities: creation of the conditions for the functioning of the land market (issuance of ownership certificates, demarcation of boundaries of plots of land, putting the land cadastre into operation, land valuations, introduction of the mechanism for land market regulation) and then revocation of the moratorium.
13.  in october 2009 the ivano-frankivsk regional department of justice, acting in the interests of the first applicant, lodged a claim with the ivano-frankivsk town court for the return of the second applicant to the czech republic, pursuant to the hague convention.14.  on 2 july 2010 the court granted the claim, finding that the removal of the second applicant from the czech republic and his retention in ukraine had been wrongful within the meaning of article 3 of the hague convention.19.  further to its earlier decision granting the parents alternating custody of the second applicant, the prague 10 district court reconsidered the matter in the light of new developments in the case, especially the child’s abduction by b., his retention in ukraine, and the first applicant’s lack of access to the child.23.  on 6 march 2014 the ivano-frankivsk regional court of appeal upheld the decision of the first-instance court, finding that the child had settled in a new environment since his arrival in 2009 and that b. was entitled to bring that action in order to ensure the best interests of the child.however, on 29 september 2011 the ivano-frankivsk regional court of appeal examined an appeal lodged by b. and partly quashed that decision as regards the temporary placement of the child in care, considering – in view of the submissions by the local childcare authority – that such a measure would be excessive and detrimental to the child.
12.  consequently, following his request of 17 august 2012, by a decree of 22 august 2012, the court of magistrates granted the applicant bail subject to the following conditions: that he appears for all the scheduled hearings in the criminal proceedings; that he does not go abroad or abscond; that he does not contact or approach, directly nor indirectly, witnesses for the prosecution; that he does not commit a crime of a voluntary nature while released on bail; that he present himself at the district police station every day between eight a.m. and eight p.m.; that he be home not later than ten p.m. and that he does not leave home before six a.m. of the following day; that he inform the police of any change of address by not later than twelve hours of such a change; that he deposit by way of security the amount of 15,000 euros (eur) in the court registry; and that he undertake a personal guarantee of eur 25,000. in the event of any bail condition being breached, the entire amount of eur 40,000 would be forfeited in favour of the state.15.  by a decision of 7 september 2012 the criminal court, having examined the documents submitted by the applicant, rejected the attorney general’s request to increase the deposit but added the condition that the applicant could not be in the vicinity of locality r. it also rejected the applicant’s request considering that the court of magistrates had correctly applied its discretion.20.  on 7 december 2012 the court again rejected the applicant’s request; it noted that its previous decisions had determined the deposit in order to strike the requisite balance between, on the one hand, the seriousness of the crime and the potential punishment, and, on the other hand, the obligation of the accused to fulfil the imposed conditions.nevertheless, the applicant had only provided copies of self-assessment forms for purposes of income tax for the years between 1998 and 2011. according to the court, if an applicant argued that the deposit was too high, he had to show the court what he could afford by providing a list of his assets and property, even if this meant that he had to conduct researches in the public registry, and provide the relevant documentation.although the applicant relied on the court’s judgment of iwanczuk (cited above), where a violation had been found on the basis that it took four months for the polish authorities to adjust the conditions for bail, the constitutional court held that (even if this were the case), the applicant – who was legally represented ‑ had not explored all avenues to satisfy the courts with an adequate guarantee for the observance of the conditions of bail.
in view of (i) the expert opinions regarding the shoe traces on x’s back which had led to the conclusion that the presence of another person at the crime scene prior to x’s death could not be excluded, and (ii) the fact that the knife with which x had been stabbed and cut had not been found, the koper district court held that there was insufficient proof that the applicant had stabbed and cut x. however, the court found on the basis of the forensic medical evidence that x had still been alive before he had been run over by the car and that the injuries to x’s chest, spine and aorta, which had been the direct cause of his death, had been caused by the applicant having intentionally run him over with his car.it further found it proven on the basis of the evidence at the scene – such as (i) a piece of rubber tube belonging to the applicant’s car, (ii) the applicant’s biological traces found on x’s body, (iii) x’s biological traces found on, inter alia, the applicant’s clothing (which was blood-stained) and on the outside of the applicant’s car – that the applicant had been beyond doubt at the crime scene and had had contact with x. referring, in particular, to the findings of the experts in vehicle science, who had performed reconstructions at the scene testing the applicant’s versions of events, the court discounted the possibility that the applicant had run over x by accident.he further stated as follows: “it is irrelevant that the police, by [their] unlawful interference with [x]’s mobile telephone, did not directly violate the appellant’s right under article 37 of the constitution [“privacy of correspondence and other means of communication”], because the fact remains that the police obtained that evidence (data from [x]’s mobile telephone) without a court order – that is to say unlawfully.” 24.  the applicant moreover argued that the examination of x’s telephone alone had not adduced enough evidence to arrest the applicant and that that had been possible only after the applicant’s telephone had been examined.however, in the supreme court’s view, the information on whether the text message with sexual content had been sent from the applicant’s telephone would have inevitably been discovered, either (i) by means of a simple call to the number from which the message had been sent, (ii) by checking the applicant’s telephone’s sim card (for which, in the supreme court’s view, no court order would have been necessary), or (iii) on the basis of a court order, which had in point of fact later been issued.in particular, as regards the examination of x’s telephone, the applicant argued that he “had not sought redress for the violation of x’s right to privacy (mental integrity) and freedom of communication as he had not been entitled to do so [... but rather] had exclusively pointed out that the violation had occurred and the [trial] court had based its decision [to convict the applicant] on the consequences of that violation ...” in this connection he, referring to x’s “right to piety” (pravica do pietete), disputed the supreme court’s view that x’s right to privacy had ceased with his death and pointed out that a court order had been nevertheless subsequently issued.
7.  in 1998 the applicant was implicated in the commission of the criminal offence of setting up and being a member of an armed gang and of other criminal offences.17.  the applicant’s family-appointed lawyer and the other co-accused appealed against the conviction to the durrës court of appeal (“the court of appeal”).on 19 april 2000 the court of appeal declined to examine the applicant’s appeal on the grounds that the applicant’s family had not given any express authority to the lawyer for such a procedure.however, the court of appeal examined the applicant’s case as part of its overall examination, having regard to the appeals of the other defendants.23.  on 24 october 2007 the constitutional court, sitting in camera, declared the appeal time-barred as the two-year time-limit had started to run on 7 december 2000. the constitutional court’s reasoning stated that throughout the proceedings the applicant had been represented by a court‑appointed lawyer or a family-appointed lawyer and that accordingly he had had the opportunity to become acquainted with the proceedings brought against him.
7.  on 6 november 2000, in inheritance proceedings following the applicant’s grandmother’s death, the applicant’s relative, m.j., and the applicant’s father were declared the beneficiaries in respect of a house, which was not registered in the land register, by a decision of the zabok municipal court (općinski sud u zaboku).the supreme court thus halved the value of the dispute and held that the value of each claim did not reach the necessary ratione valoris threshold of hrk 100,001 (approximately 13,300 euros (eur)) for an appeal on points of law to be admissible.the relevant part of this decision reads as follows: “the claimant in his civil action indicated the value of the dispute as hrk 110,000. pursuant to section 37(2) of the cpa [(civil procedure act)], if the claims in the civil action arise from a variety of grounds, or different claimants put forward individual claims or individual claims are raised against several defendants, the value of the dispute must be established in accordance with the value of each individual claim.given that the claimant indicated the [unique] value of the dispute as hrk 110,000, and that this amount should be divided by [the number of the claims], the value of the dispute of each claim does not exceed the amount of 100,000. it follows that an appeal on points of law by the defendant is inadmissible.” 15.  the applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske), arguing that m.j.’s action had two aspects which could not be separated, and that the supreme court’s decision finding that the case concerned two separate claims had therefore been arbitrary and had violated her right to a fair hearing, in particular her right of access to the supreme court, as guaranteed under article 29 of the constitution.it held that the applicant in her constitutional complaint “did not demonstrate that the supreme court had failed to respect the provisions of the constitution concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely that it had applied relevant law in an arbitrary manner” and that therefore “the present case did not raise a constitutional issue.” its decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 3 march 2011.
10.  also on 26 september 2011 the applicant challenged the prison board’s decision before the investigating judge, arguing that he had been sanctioned twice for the same offence, contrary to the express legal requirements, and that he had not been informed of the reasons for the decision to handcuff him.16.  under article 219 of the regulation, a detainee may be handcuffed if (i) he or she physically resists prison staff or “is infuriated” (until he or she calms down), (ii) he or she refuses to move under escort, (iii) there are grounds for believing that there is a risk of the detainee escaping, (iv) he or she attempts suicide or self-mutilation, or attacks other detainees (until the detainee calms down), or (v) during the escorting of a detainee after his or her escape and subsequent apprehension.18.  the european prison rules (annex to recommendation rec(2006)2 of the committee of ministers to member states of 11 january 2006), in so far relevant, read as follows: “... 68.2 handcuffs, restraint jackets and other body restraints shall not be used except: a. if necessary, as a precaution against escape during a transfer, provided that they are removed when the prisoner appears before a judicial or administrative authority, unless that authority decides otherwise; or b. by order of the director, if other methods of control fail, in order to protect a prisoner from self-injury [or] injury to others or to prevent serious damage to property, provided that in such instances the director shall immediately inform the medical practitioner and report to the higher prison authority....” 19.  the relevant parts of the 25th general report (april 2016) of the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (cpt/inf (2016) 10) provide as follows: “the basic objectives and principles for the treatment of life-sentenced prisoners 74. in the cpt’s view, the objectives and principles for the treatment of life-sentenced prisoners enunciated by the committee of ministers in recommendation rec (2003) 23 on the management by prison administrations of life sentence and other long-term prisoners remains the most pertinent and comprehensive reference document for this group of prisoners.in summary, these principles are: ... - the normalisation principle: life-sentenced prisoners should, like all prisoners, be subject only to the restrictions that are necessary for their safe and orderly confinement; ... conclusion 81. the cpt calls upon member states to review their treatment of life-sentenced prisoners to ensure that this is in accordance with their individual risk they present, both in custody and to the outside community, and not simply in response to the sentence which has been imposed on them.
the event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at bolotnaya square, which was supposed to end at 7.30 p.m. the march was peaceful and held without any disruptions, but when the marchers arrived at bolotnaya square it turned out that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue, allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting.8.  on the same day the moscow city department of the investigative committee of the russian federation opened criminal proceedings to investigate suspected acts of mass disorder and violence against the police (articles 212 § 2 and 318 § 1 of the criminal code).the applicant’s complaints concerning the grounds and the length of his detention on remand, the poor conditions of detention and the lack of medical assistance in the remand prison were examined in the case kovyazin and others v. russia (nos.on 4 may 2012 he received an assignment from the newspaper chief editor to attend the “march of millions” on 6 may 2012 at bolotnaya square and to take a video footage of the event.17.  on 19 december 2013 the applicant requested the termination of the criminal proceedings against him by operation of the amnesty act.
on the same day the hospital informed the prosecutor that the clothes had been given to the police officers at the hospital when the injured person had been taken into the operating theatre.denied the allegation that he had put his knee in the small of the back of the person on the ground and fired two bullets into his back (see paragraph 21 above), and told the prosecutor that if he had not shot the person, the person would have shot him.29.  a security guard who had been on duty at the hospital on 28 may 2004 told the prosecutor on 14 july 2004 that the applicant’s son had been taken into the operating theatre with his clothes on and that shortly afterwards the personnel in the operating theatre had removed those clothes and given them to plainclothes police officers from the anti-terrorism department waiting at the hospital.moreover, although according to the report prepared by those police officers both pistols, the hand grenades and the motorbike had been taken away by them before the arrival of the crime-scene officers, according to the crime‑scene officers’ report the motorbike had still been at the scene on their arrival (see paragraph 12 above).given that there was a large amount of evidence in the file showing that the clothes had been taken away from the hospital by the police officers, the conclusion reached by the trial court, namely that the clothes had got lost during “the commotion at the hospital”, was clearly wrong.
the news that their children would not be buried in siirt and that their bodies had been confiscated by the soldiers had caused an upsurge of emotion in the people waiting at the cemetery in siirt and as a result they had attacked members of the security forces and local shops with sticks and stones.the administrative court considered that, although the applicants had the right to bury their children in a cemetery of their choice, the refusal to permit them to do so had been in compliance with the restrictions set out in the second paragraphs of articles 8 and 9 of the convention and in section 13 of the turkish constitution.12.  the applicants appealed against the decision and maintained that the incidents at the cemetery referred to by the administrative court had only occurred after the crowds had found out about the authorities’ refusal to allow them to bury their children in siirt.13.  the request for an interim measure was rejected by the supreme administrative court on 13 december 2006. in a decision of 24 october 2008 the supreme administrative court also rejected the appeal lodged by the applicants against the decision of the diyarbakır administrative court.in reaching its conclusion the supreme administrative court stated that the incidents at the siirt cemetery had begun when the people who had gathered there had insisted that the applicants’ two children be buried next to the graves of members of the pkk.
8.  on 30 may 2005 he wrote to the prosecutor general’s office, listing the many complaints that he had previously lodged with various authorities (including the police) of having been ill-treated by his ex-wife and children, the destruction of his property by them, and the failure of the local police to react in any manner.12.  in a letter dated 12 december 2006 the head of edineț police station informed the applicant’s brother that, on a date not indicated in the letter, “a cautionary discussion” had been conducted with the applicant’s ex-wife and that she had been “officially warned to change her conduct” towards the applicant and his brother.on 7 may 2007 the head of the forensics department at the centre of forensic medicine (“the centre”) asked the prosecutor to submit the x-rays of the applicant’s elbow in order to allow the report to be prepared.the judge found that the investigator had ignored the prosecutor’s conclusion in the decision of 10 april 2008 and had limited his investigation to interviewing the applicant’s children and members of his ex-wife’s family, who all had a hostile relationship with him and who, moreover, had given somewhat different versions of the incident of 27 december 2006. furthermore, one of the doctors (t.) had been interviewed only superficially, another doctor who had seen the applicant after the incident had not been interviewed at all, and a third doctor who had taken the x-ray of the applicant’s elbow had also not been interviewed.28.  on 25 july 2011 the investigating judge of the bălți district court upheld the decisions of 30 june and 17 december 2010. the judge found that the investigator had undertaken all possible measures to investigate the case, and that the witnesses had not confirmed the applicant’s version of the events and had even contradicted it by stating that on 12 january 2007 they had been out cutting wood with the applicant and had not observed any injury to his elbow.
14.  on 29 november 1995 the applicant asked the zagreb municipality as the owner of the flat to conclude a contract for the sale of the flat with herself as the buyer.16.  on 26 september 2005 the applicant brought a civil action against the city of zagreb, which in the meantime had become the owner of the flat she occupied, seeking a judgment in lieu of the contract of sale of the flat in question.17.  the claim was dismissed by the zagreb municipal court on 18 june 2007 on the grounds that the applicant had not acquired a protected tenancy of the flat in question, since the priority list did not constitute a decision on the granting of protected tenancies within the meaning of the housing act.the only reasons she had not been formally granted a specially protected tenancy of the flat she had been occupying were the challenge of the priority list by her co-workers and the delay in the civil proceedings before the zagreb municipal court.20.  on 11 may 2012 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint on the grounds that the findings of the lower courts that she had not acquired a specially protected tenancy of the flat at issue had been correct.
9.  the prison authorities informed the moldovan ministry of justice, the president’s office, the organization for security and co-operation in europe (osce), the red cross and the council of europe, as well as local human rights organisations, with a view to obtaining assistance in resolving the problem arising from the disconnection from the town’s utilities network.10.  on 12 august 2003 the bender prosecutor’s office (which forms part of the official moldovan authorities) informed the helsinki committee for human rights in moldova (“the chdom”), for which the applicant’s representative worked, that, as a result of pressure from the osce, the bender authorities had reconnected the prison to the electricity and water supply systems on 23 february 2003. on 10 july 2003 the last of the people who were ill with tuberculosis were transferred to a newly-built hospital wing in pruncul prison hospital, situated in moldova.21.  on 1 june 2009 the chdom asked the prosecutor general’s office what actions had been undertaken after the judgment of the supreme court of justice of 3 august 2004. on 14 july 2009 the bender prosecutor’s office replied that the actions of the “mrt” authorities could not be investigated by the moldovan authorities as long as the “mrt” authorities de facto controlled the territory of the “mrt”.none of the complaints made to the state authorities had resulted in an improvement in the conditions of detention until much later, as established in 2008. the court acknowledged a breach of the applicants’ right not to be held in inhuman conditions of detention, and increased the award in favour of each of them to mdl 20,000 (eur 1,266 at the time).it analysed in detail the length of the civil proceedings (between 22 march 2004 and the date of adopting its own judgment on 27 april 2010), the complexity of the case, how the parties and the courts had contributed to the length of the proceedings, as well as the significant interest at stake for the applicants.
9.  on 8 june 2009 the applicant sought the reopening of her case in view of the judgment of the constitutional court of 27 february 2009. after an initial refusal, on 24 september 2009 the st petersburg city court quashed the judgment of 5 april 2004 and remitted the applicant’s case for a fresh examination.19.  on 15 september 2009 the st petersburg city court quashed the decision of 30 june 2009 and reset the time-limit for lodging an appeal against the judgment of 10 march 2009. on 30 september 2009 the st petersburg city court examined the appeal and found the applicant’s involuntary treatment lawful.31.  the applicant allegedly learnt that he had been stripped of legal capacity only in 2012. on 24 december 2012 he asked the dmitrovskiy district court to reset the time-limit for lodging an appeal against the judgment of 7 august 2003. on 22 january 2013 the dmitrovskiy district court dismissed the request.32.  on 29 may 2013 the moscow regional court examined an appeal lodged by the applicant against the decision of 22 january 2013. it reset the time-limit and at the same hearing examined the merits of an appeal lodged by the applicant against the judgment of 7 august 2003. having found that in 2003 the dmitrovskiy district court had examined the applicant’s case in his absence despite the lack of any information on the applicant’s ability to attend, the moscow regional court quashed the judgment of 7 august 2003. it then proceeded to re-examine the merits of the case.35.  on 24 october 2013 the zyuzinskiy district court refused to reset the time-limit, having also noted that the russian law in force at the material time had not called for the mandatory presence of the applicant at the court hearing.
9.  on 22 december 2006 the pezinok special court (špeciálny súd, hereafter “the special court”), where the case had been transferred in the meantime owing to the organised nature of the crimes, dismissed an application by the applicant for release.10.  on 16 march 2007 the special court extended the applicant’s detention until 3 october 2007. in addition to the reasons mentioned above, it relied on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant was the leader of a criminal group which had been operating for several years, and that not all of the members of that criminal group had been identified.it held that it was reasonable to suspect that, if released, the applicant would continue his criminal activities, taking into account: the motives for such activities and their duration and extent; the methods of intimidation and violence used by the criminal group; the hierarchical and organised nature of the group; and the fact that not all of the members of the group had been identified.although the supreme court had examined in detail the applicant’s arguments regarding the grounds for his detention, it had failed to respond to his other arguments, such as one about the impartiality and independence of the tribunal reviewing his detention, and another about alleged shortcomings in his representation during the judicial review, and thus the court had breached article 5 § 4 of the convention.32.  between the lodging of the indictment with the trial court and the applicant’s conviction by the court of first instance, the trial court held hearings over the course of fifty-one days.
7.  in a decision of 24 june 2002 the braşov county court allowed in part the action lodged by the applicants against company r., and ordered the latter to pay to the first applicant 2,284,679,617 romanian lei (rol), an amount representing compensation for the use, between 1985 and 1988, of the invention patented in 1975. the second and third applicants appealed, and in a decision of 8 november 2002 the braşov court of appeal also awarded them compensation – rol 2,230,620,676 to the second applicant and rol 1,669,759,157 to the third applicant.9.  on 5 may 2005 the high court of cassation and justice took note of the terms of the agreement of 10 march 2004 and concluded that company r. had withdrawn its appeal on points of law against the decision of 8 november 2002 (see paragraph 7 above), which thus became final.the applicants’ claims were accepted by the county court and recorded in the register of claims compiled by the judicial administrator in conformity with the provisions of the applicable law (tabloul creditorilor, hereinafter “the register of claims”).18.  in a final decision of 17 april 2008 the court of appeal dismissed that argument and concluded that the appeal had been made out of time, as it had been lodged more than ten days after 23 january 2008, the date on which the braşov county court’s judgment had been published (see paragraph 15 above).1137 of 4 december 2007 (see paragraph 21 below), the court of appeal considered that the notification procedure via the bulletin had offered sufficient safeguards to the participants in the proceedings, and had been justified by the nature of the insolvency procedure.
11.  the need for the applicant’s detention was justified by the prosecutors in the following way: that the applicant could abscond; he could influence witnesses; he could collude with other co-accused persons; and because the offence imputed to him was sanctioned with imprisonment of up to ten years.the applicant’s appeal was rejected by the court of appeal on 14 may 2015. the court of appeal used the same arguments as the first time and added that one of the reaosons to hold the applicant in custody was to protect other persons involved in the proceedings from his violent actions.it argued that the risk of absconding was justified by the gravity of the offence and that the prosecutor had presented evidence in support of the claim that the applicant may hinder the investigation.17.   on 8 october 2015 the court of appeal examined the appeals lodged by the applicant against the decisions of 29 september 2015 and 6 october 2015. in its first judgment it dismissed the applicant’s appeal after finding that all the risks enumerated by the first-instance court persisted.however, when examining the appeal against the second decision, the same panel of judges considered that the risk of the applicant’s absconding was no longer justified and that there were no new reasons to consider necessary the applicant’s continued detention.
5.  the facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, refer to the same context and domestic criminal proceedings as those described in association “21 december 1989” and others v. romania (nos.11/p/1996, culminating in the referral to court and subsequent conviction of senior military officers by a decision of the high court of cassation and justice of 3 april 2007, which became final on 15 october 2008. as is apparent from the documents submitted by the parties, the death of the applicants’ son did not form part of this investigation, but in the court proceedings the first applicant nonetheless lodged a civil claim regarding his son’s death during the december 1989 events.11.  the most important steps taken by the prosecutors in the main criminal investigation are summarised in association “21 december 1989” and others (cited above, §§ 12-41) and anamaria‑loredana orășanu and others v. romania ([committee] nos.12.  on 14 october 2015 the prosecutor’s office closed the main investigation, finding that the offences of homicide and instigation to homicide of which the applicants’ son had been a victim had become statute‑barred.13.  although the parties have not communicated any information regarding the lodging of an appeal against this decision, it is apparent from the prosecutor’s office website that it was subsequently quashed and to date the main criminal investigation is still ongoing (see anamaria‑loredana orășanu and others, cited above, § 11).
5.  according to the applicant’s submissions, he left kazakhstan in 2008 and lived in saudi arabia and syria as a student until june 2011. he did not wish to return to his country as a number of people had been detained on charges of religious extremism in kazakhstan and some of his friends had left the country after coming under pressure from the kazakhstan government because of their political and religious identity.14.  according to a document dated 6 january 2012 sent by the deputy director of the general police headquarters to a number of police authorities, during a meeting held on 4 january 2012 the ambassador of kazakhstan in ankara requested the turkish interior minister to extradite kazakhstan nationals who had been involved in terrorist acts and in respect of whom kazakhstan had issued wanted notices (“red notices”) via interpol.a formal extradition request in respect of such persons was submitted by the kazakhstan embassy in ankara to the ministry of foreign affairs on 31 december 2011. according to the document prepared by the embassy, the applicant and four other persons were members of the “islamic jihad union”, a terrorist organisation which carried out terrorist attacks in the western region of kazakhstan.the bakırköy assize court held that the applicant could not be extradited to kazakhstan because the charge against him in kazakhstan fell within the scope of one of the offence categories, precluding extradition, listed in article 18 § 1 (b) of the criminal code, as in force at the material time (see paragraph 30 below).28.  the government submitted that the kumkapı foreigners’ removal centre, where the applicant had been held, had a capacity of 300 persons and that a total of between 100 and 140 persons had been held during the period between 28 february and 12 march 2012. detainees were accommodated on three floors: the first two floors were reserved for male detainees, and the third floor for females.
21.  on 3 november 2011 the interpol‑europol department attached to the general police headquarters requested the foreigners, borders and asylum department (also attached to the general police headquarters) to provide information regarding the applicant, noting that he was sought for by the prosecuting authorities and the interpol bureau of kazakhstan as he was suspected of having committed an offence in that country.on 1 december 2011 the deputy head of the foreigners, borders and asylum department informed the interpol‑europol department that the applicant had requested asylum and was residing in sakarya and that on 24 october 2011 a further entry ban had been issued in respect of him after the applicant had been prosecuted for “hooliganism”.28.  on 13 february 2013 the ankara administrative court dismissed the application lodged by the applicant on 22 march 2012. in its judgment, the administrative court noted that according to information obtained from the national intelligence organisation (milli i̇stihbarat teşkilatı), the applicant was involved in international terrorism and had carried out terrorist activities when he had been in turkey.on the basis of the documents in the case file, the administrative court concluded that the administrative decision to reject the applicant’s asylum application and to deport the applicant from turkey had been lawful.31.  the government submitted that the kumkapı foreigners’ removal centre where the applicant had been held had a capacity of 300 persons and that a total of between 100 and 150 persons had been held during the period between 9 june and 13 september 2011. detainees were accommodated on three floors: the first two floors were reserved for male detainees, and the third floor for females.
each time, the reasons for his detention were that it was an exceptional case, that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed serious offences punishable by imprisonment, that the criminal case was complex and that if released the applicant could interfere with the investigation, influence the witnesses and victims, re-offend or abscond (as he had earlier been declared a wanted person).on 17 june 2010 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s lawyer’s claims and on 21 june 2010 it prolonged the applicant’s detention warrant for another ninety days, relying on exactly the same reasons as before.13.  on 6 april 2012 the prosecutor’s office lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of 22 february 2012. in the appeal the prosecutor’s office made reference to article 439 of the code of criminal procedure.in particular, the applicant describes his conditions of detention as follows: the cell was equipped with twelve wooden beds, it was not heated, the quality of food was very poor, there was a lack of ventilation, worsened by the inmates’ smoking directly in the cell, and poor lighting.11 (bălți), where he was detained until the date of his acquittal by the bălți court of appeal on 22 february 2012. on the date of his arrival he was not fed.
9.  according to the government, the applicant was transferred from the detention facility of the ministry of the interior to prison no.the delegation was informed during the 2015 visit that the opening of a new 1,500-place remand prison in the chișinău area, financed in large part by a loan from the council of europe development bank, was now envisaged for june 2018. chișinău prison, with an official capacity of 1,000 places, remains the largest prison establishment in the republic of moldova and operates primarily as a remand facility, with a very high turnover of prisoners (according to the management, between 13,000 and 15,000 prisoners were admitted to the prison every year).indeed, the delegation observed for itself that the national standard of at least 4 m2 of living space per prisoner was far from being met in most of the prison establishments visited; in particular at chișinău and soroca prisons, the levels of overcrowding had reached disturbing proportions.in this context, the delegation was told by the authorities that the increase in the number of prisoners was largely attributable to the rising re-offending rates and excessive resort to remand detention, as well as to reluctance on the part of judges to grant early conditional release.in so doing, the authorities should be guided by the relevant recommendations of the committee of ministers of the council of europe: recommendation r (99) 22 concerning prison overcrowding and prison population inflation, recommendation rec(2000)22 on improving the implementation of the european rules on community sanctions and measures, recommendation rec(2003)22 on conditional release (parole), recommendation rec(2006)13 on the use of remand in custody, and recommendation rec(2010)1 on the council of europe probation rules.
he found that the applicant had a cephalohaematoma (κεφαλαιμάτωμα) in the right temporal region; abrasions in the parietal area; abrasions and mild oedema on his nose; bruising of his lower lip; a broken upper incisor (σπασμένο/διατομή πρόσθιου άνω τομέα οδόντος); a bruise on the left hemithorax with sensitivity and a few abrasions; oedema and abrasions on both wrists (πηχεοκαρπικές αμφώ); a few abrasions on the knees, with no evidence of inflammation; pain during the examination of the movement of the right knee; sensitivity of the upper thoracic vertebra and the upper lumbar spine.(xi)  constable m.p., who had interviewed the applicant at the station, in his statement of 17 march 2011 stated that the applicant had had abrasions on the face and when he had asked the applicant how the latter had got them, the applicant had told him that he had been hit during his arrest.- the applicant had alleged that the ill-treatment had continued until 3 p.m., but in his prisoner record it had been recorded that he had been taken to a cell in the detention facilities of the station at approximately 1.45 p.m. - the applicant had claimed that the doctor at the hospital had refused to give him painkillers but this had been refuted by dr a.k.denied the occurrence of a discussion between him and the investigator a.s. 76.  at the end of their investigation the investigators prepared a lengthy report on the investigation procedure and their findings 77.  in their report the investigators pinpointed a number of deficiencies in the investigation of the case from the very beginning on the part of the police and the first investigation by the iaiacap.had failed to ask the officers about the applicant’s injuries and how they had happened; nor had he asked constable p.p., who had been the first officer to receive the applicant at the police station at 9.30 a.m., if the applicant had had any injuries on him at the time; he had merely filed (αρχειοθέτησε) p.p.’s statement; he had also not taken any investigative steps with regard to the applicant’s injuries – he had filed the medical report of the pathologist dr a.k., which referred to the applicant’s injuries and had not sought to obtain a medical report by dr s.j., who had visited the applicant in hospital.
7.  the accident report – prepared on the same day by the traffic police on the basis of their findings and the statements of the first applicant – indicated that after the first applicant had lost control of the vehicle on the bend, it had first crashed into the metal barrier alongside the road, and had then fallen over the barrier into an empty canal.12.  at the first hearing held before the i̇zmir assize court on 15 december 2008 the first applicant stated that as he had been driving along the road at a normal speed, his car had started skidding to the left for an unknown reason, and that he had swerved the car to the right to avoid hitting the car approaching him from the opposite lane on the left.14.  in the meantime, on 17 november 2008 the first applicant applied to the i̇zmir magistrates’ court for a declaratory judgment in order to establish (i)  whether and to what extent the state of the crash barrier alongside the road had contributed to the fatal accident and whether the barrier had been repaired after the accident; and (ii)  whether there had been any structural problems with the road, such as unusual sloping.15.  the expert report submitted to the i̇zmir magistrates’ court on 5 december 2008 made the following findings: -  the crash barrier at the bend in question had been damaged prior to the accident and the damaged parts of it had not been repaired after the accident; -  there was a slight dent in the road right by the damaged barrier; however, there was no structural problem with the slope of the road surface.23.  relying mainly on the findings in the traffic accident report and the statements of the first applicant, on 27 may 2010 the i̇zmir administrative court found that the first applicant bore sole responsibility for the accident in question, as he had lost control of his car while taking the bend, despite a sign warning of the sharp bend ahead.
6.  the facts of the applicant’s ill-treatment in police custody were established in a judgment of the novocheboksarsk town court of the chuvash republic (“the town court”) of 22 august 2008 and upheld on 11 november 2008 by the supreme court of the chuvash republic.he also argued that, in calculating the amount of compensation due in respect of non‑pecuniary damage for a violation of the convention, the domestic courts therefore had to take into account the sums awarded by the court under article 41 of the convention in similar cases.he stated that his claim had been calculated based on the sum awarded by the court in the case of ribitsch, in which a violation of article 3 of the convention had been found on account of inhuman and degrading treatment in police custody (see ribitsch v. austria, 4 december 1995, series a no.it noted that, under article 61 § 4 of the code of civil procedure, a judgment in a criminal case which had become enforceable was binding on a court examining the civil-law consequences of the acts of a person against whom the judgment had been delivered, in so far as it established whether those acts had taken place and whether they had been committed by that person.it disagreed with the applicant that, in determining the amount of compensation for non‑pecuniary damage, the domestic courts had to be guided by the amounts of such compensation awarded by the court in similar cases, stating as follows: “indeed, in accordance with article 15 § 4 of the constitution of the russian federation, commonly recognised principles and norms of international law and international agreements of the russian federation are an integral part of [the russian federation’s] legal system.
5.  by decision of 9 may 2003, which became final and binding on 4 september 2003, the human rights chamber for bosnia and herzegovina (“the chamber”) found that the federation of bosnia and herzegovina (an entity of bosnia and herzegovina) had discriminated against the applicant in its enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion guaranteed by article 9 of the convention.in order to remedy the situation it ordered the federation of bosnia and herzegovina to ensure the relocation of public schools housed in the archdiocese high school building in travnik, and to reinstate the applicant in the premises within one year.6.  by an agreement of 21 may 2004, the federation of bosnia and herzegovina undertook to reinstate the applicant in the impugned premises by 1 july 2006. shortly thereafter, the travnik municipal council adopted the implementing decisions, and also one of the public schools was moved from the premises.9.  on 17 february 2017 the applicant initiated civil proceedings against the public school remaining in its premises, requesting its relocation, as well as damages for the use of the premises for the period between 1 february 2014 and 1 june 2017.at the date of the latest information available to the court (20 february 2018), the central bosnia canton submitted a revision petition to the supreme court of the federation of bosnia and herzegovina against the final judgment in these proceedings.
5.  the applicants or their close relatives participated in demonstrations and were injured or killed by gunfire during the events of december 1989 in bucharest, brașov and vișina which led to the fall of the communist regime.9. the decision of 14 october 2015 was annulled by a prosecutor general’s decision of 5 april 2016, confirmed by the high court of cassation and justice on 13 june 2016. it was noted that the investigation in file no.10.  on 1 november 2016 the military prosecutor ordered the initiation in rem of a criminal investigation for the offence of crimes against humanity in respect of the same circumstances of fact.up to february 2017 further steps were taken in gathering information from domestic authorities, the prosecutor’s office contacting 211 civil parties, questioning members of the political party which took over the presidency at the time of events, planning the hearing of military officers and other participants in the events, verifying the activity of the relevant military units and the audio/video recordings broadcast by radio and television.11.  at the date of the latest information available to the court (submitted by the parties on 13 april 2017 and 19 may 2017), the criminal investigation was still ongoing.
he brought the court’s attention to the fact that the charge against him was based only on the statements of the prison officers who had conducted the search in question, and who had already been summonsed as witnesses for the prosecution, and that the cellmates had never been interviewed at the pre-trial stage.in particular, one of the officers submitted that the knife had been found “in the bed, between the mattress and the blanket, closer to the footboard” while another stated that it had been hidden “in [the applicant’s] bed, between the mattress and the sheet, closer to the headboard, near the pillow”; yet another officer stated that “the knife fell onto the floor the moment we took the mattress off the bed”.the court confirmed that the prison officers’ statements, the video recording and the written record of the search of the cell and the seizure of the knife constituted the incriminating evidence.notably, given the stages of the two diseases at that time and the known side-effects of the anti-tb and anti-hcv drugs, the doctors recommended that the applicant firstly be provided with anti-tb medication under the dots programme (directly observed treatment, short-course – the treatment strategy for detection and cure of tb recommended by the world health organisation).30.  according to his medical file, the applicant started receiving the anti-tb medication under the dots programme from 13 november 2007. during the intensive period of the treatment, which lasted three months, the applicant was kept in the prison hospital under the close supervision of medical personnel with the appropriate training.
another man had also had intercourse with the mother at the crucial time, however, the blood test established that he was not the father.15.  on 12 september 2012 the prosecutor general informed the applicant that the determination of his paternity had been decided by the jihlava district court under article 54 of the family code and that therefore the prosecution service could not initiate proceedings under article 62 and 62a of the family code.when paternity had been established by a judicial declaration under article 54 of that code and the judgment had come into legal force, as in the applicant’s case, the law did not provide for any possibility to challenge it.16.  relying on his rights under article 6 § 1 of the convention, the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint (ústavní stížnost) against the prosecutor general’s decision of 12 september 2012. he maintained that he had proved that he was not z.’s biological father and requested that the constitutional court (ústavní soud) order the prosecutor general to initiate proceedings and challenge his paternity.it noted that his paternity had been established by a judicial decision which had come into legal force and stated, inter alia, that the competence of the prosecutor general could only apply if all the legal requirements had been fulfilled, which was not, however, the applicant’s case.
21.  on 30 may 2013 the nasimi district court extended the first applicant’s detention pending trial until 7 september 2013. the court substantiated the need for the extension by the complexity of the case, the gravity of the charges, and the likelihood that if released the first applicant might abscond or obstruct the investigation by influencing those participating in the criminal proceedings.29.  on 24 june 2013 the nasimi district court extended the second applicant’s detention pending trial by three months, until 1 october 2013. the court substantiated the need for the extension by the complexity of the case, the gravity of the charges and the need for additional time to carry out further investigative measures.36.  on 18 september 2013 the nasimi district court extended the second applicant’s detention pending trial by two months, until 1 december 2013. the court substantiated the need for the extension by the complexity of the case, the gravity of the charges, the need for additional time to carry out further investigative measures and the likelihood that if released the second applicant might abscond or obstruct the investigation by influencing those participating in the criminal proceedings.43.  on 22 june 2013 the nasimi district court extended the third applicant’s remand in custody by three months, until 30 september 2013. the court substantiated the need for the extension by the gravity of the charges, the risk of his reoffending, and the likelihood that if released he might abscond or obstruct the investigation.54.  on 24 june 2013 the nasimi district court extended the fourth applicant’s remand in custody by three months, until 30 september 2013. the court substantiated the need for the extension by the complexity of the case, the need for additional time to carry out further investigative measures and the possibility of the fourth applicant’s absconding or influencing persons participating in the criminal proceedings.
11.  appeals by the applicant were dismissed by the skopje court of appeal (апелационен суд скопје, “the court of appeal”) on 8 february 2010. the court of appeal reiterated that the gravity of the charges, the severity of the penalty and the fact that the suspects had acted as a well‑organised group indicated a risk of flight and of reoffending if the applicant were to be released.however, the court of appeal upheld the panel’s finding regarding the risk of absconding and held that a further extension of the detention order had been justified on the basis of the gravity of the charges and the potential penalty.16.  three-judge panels ordered further extensions of the pre-trial detention of the applicant and the other co-accused on 23 april, 19 may, 21 june, 22 july, 20 august, 20 september, 20 october, 18 november, 17 december 2010 and 17 january 2011. in each order the panel provided the following reasoning regarding the risk of absconding: “the material and verbal evidence adduced so far corroborates the reasonable suspicion that the accused have committed the crimes with which they are charged.the risk of flight is further supported by the financial circumstances of the [accused] ... [the applicant] ... has been in conflict with the law ... the panel has taken into consideration the fact that the accused have families and children, and that [the applicant] has immovable property in his name, but it considers that the accused’s family and material situation are insufficient guarantees of their presence at trial ...” 17.  the applicant appealed against the extension orders, arguing, inter alia, that the panels had not given sufficient reasons to substantiate the risk of his absconding, given that they had only relied on the gravity of the charges and the potential penalty.in decisions dated 13 may and 16 december 2010 the court of appeal stated: “the court considers that the circumstances related to the type, gravity and the specific circumstances of the criminal offences with which the accused has been charged, the manner in which the criminal offences were committed and the potential penalty, indicate a risk of flight if the accused is released in order to avoid eventual criminal responsibility for the criminal offences in question, as the first-instance court rightfully decided, providing sufficient reasoning, which this court finds acceptable.
the taxi had dropped them off at a café that was being refurbished in plovdiv city centre; she had tried to escape, but mr dimitrov had hit her on the neck and pushed her inside, where he had forced her to undress and had hit her on the head several times.in that connection, the court noted that the victim had changed her account during the investigation, that it had not had the opportunity to examine her in person, that the other witnesses had portrayed s.d.31.  the regional court based its findings of fact on s.d.’s statement of 19 december 2000, the statements by the three police officers who had attended to her at the police station the day after the events and had carried out the initial investigative steps, the statement by s.d.’s husband and a certain v.m., part of the statements by the applicants and mr dimitrov’s employer, the findings of the site inspection report and the photographs taken in the course of the inspection, various items of documentary evidence, the findings of the initial medical examination of the victim and the two additional medical examinations, and the two psychiatric examinations of the applicants.34.  next, the regional court found that the statement in question was credible in that it was consistent with those given by the police officers who had registered the victim’s complaint and had observed her psychological and physical state on the day after the events.it further held that the regional court had established the facts on the basis of all the evidence and that, on that basis, s.d.’s statement was “an important element, but not the only element” in establishing mr dimitrov’s guilt and “the main evidence” in establishing mr momin’s guilt.
238.  it should also be borne in mind that, under the first sentence of article 6(3) of the habitats directive, any plan or project not directly connected with or necessary to the management of the site is to be made subject to an appropriate assessment of its implications for the site in view of the site’s conservation objectives if it cannot be excluded, on the basis of objective information, that it will have a significant effect on that site, either individually or in combination with other plans or projects (case c‑127/02 waddenvereniging and vogelbeschermingsvereniging [2004] ecr i‑7405, paragraph 45).what happened from then onwards, the annual allocation of seed collection authorisations and the constant refurbishing of the plaintiffs business gave rise to a pattern of events where the plaintiffs had good reason to rely upon the comfort given to them that there would not be a summary closure of their business without some good scientific reasons or without some consultation process before doing so.” 39.  the high court also found that there had been “operational negligence” due to the failure of the authorities to carry out the necessary scientific tests or monitoring that would have provided the data required by eu law.... 10.10  next, reliance is placed on the fact that, as found by the trial judge, the ongoing activities of [the applicant company] were carried out to the knowledge of the minister and on the basis of annual legal measures put in place by the minister which facilitated the so-called opening of the harbour.if the detailed surveys complained of were necessary to establish the baseline, one is only left to speculate as to how these surveys could have been carried out without exactly the same or similar cessation of activity in the harbour, albeit in earlier years.” 45.  he then referred to the legislative complexity of the situation, which involved provisions of eu law, as well as primary and secondary domestic legislation, and to the complexity of the situation that the state faced in the aftermath of the infringement judgment of the cjeu.the real question was therefore: “15.4  ... in the light of developments in european law, did the minister owe a duty of care to those who, to his knowledge (and up to then with his permission), were carrying out activities in protected areas, to ensure that he had appropriate survey(s) and other scientific evidence available to enable a decision to be made for the purposes of considering whether to permit the continuance of traditional activities and, should appropriate evidence be found to be present, to allow those activities to be authorised?” 51.  he considered that on the facts of the case the necessary elements of foreseeability and proximity were present.
7.  on 13 june 2001 they brought proceedings before the kolomna town court of the moscow region (“the town court”) against their employer and the town administration seeking recovery of unpaid wages and taxes to various social funds.8.  on 13 july 2004 the kolomna town court issued a first-instance judgment on the merits of the case.on 22 september 2004 the moscow regional court quashed the judgment on appeal and remitted the case for a fresh examination.10.  between 26 june 2001 and 7 july 2005 the court hearings were adjourned twenty-five times due to the respondents’ or one of the respondents’ failure to appear, eighteen times on the claimants’ request and eleven times pursuant the requests by the defendants; four times the first‑instance court adjourned the case as the respondent authorities had been requested to submit additional documents.moreover, on 11 june 2002 the proceedings were suspended pursuant to a decision by the domestic court on account of the claimants’ alleged failure to appear; on 4 february 2003 that decision was quashed by the appeal court, due to the first-instance court’s failure to notify the applicants of the hearing date.
it also stated that there was no more vacant land in the former village of kryžiokai and that i.b.’s property rights could be restored by: (i) assigning a plot of land or forest equal in value to the land held previously; (ii) providing securities; (iii) discharging liabilities to the state; (iv) transferring, free of charge, a new plot of land equal in value to the land held previously for the construction of an individual home in the city or rural area where the previously held land was situated; or (v) providing monetary compensation (see paragraph 92 below).the court noted that the applicant had retained the right to restoration of her property rights, and that the restitution process had to be “continued at the expense of the vca or its successor, by finalising (and not starting afresh), in the same order of priority, the restitution process that had already begun”.it observed that it had no authority to directly order the vca to complete the restoration of the applicant’s property rights within that period of time, but that “the activity of the vca or its successor in the restitution process could constitute grounds for reducing the possible expenses of that institution, if [the applicant and j.s.]72.  the court of appeal further observed that even though the unlawful restoration of property rights had been the result of a decision adopted by the vca, under the law it was not possible to order the vca, and not the applicant, to return the money paid for the plot in question to j.s.it stated that there was no more vacant land in kryžiokai and that her property rights could be restored by: (i) assigning a plot of land or forest equal in value to the land held previously; (ii) providing securities; (iii) discharging liabilities to the state; (iv) transferring, free of charge, a new plot of land equal in value to the land held previously for the construction of an individual home in the city or rural area where the previously held land was situated; or (v) providing monetary compensation (see paragraph 92 below).
15.  in a response of 27 october 2006 the volgograd region prosecutor’s office stated that the fms was not competent to seize passports, something which only the agencies of the interior could do; that the first applicant’s passport had been seized in breach of the law; and that the prosecutor’s office recommended that the fms rectify the situation.a copy of [the second applicant’s] passport issued on 21 december 1981 by the chkhorozkuskiy department of the interior of the republic of georgia contains a [glued] insert issued by the department of the interior of the leninskiy district of rostov-on-don on 21 december [year illegible] to the effect that [the second applicant] is a citizen of the russian federation in accordance with section 13(1) of the russian citizenship act of 28 november 1991. on 29 january 2010 ... a request was sent to [the fms of the rostov region] to confirm that [the second applicant] had russian citizenship.47.  at a hearing on 20 october 2010 a representative from the fms of the centralniy district of kostroma stated, in particular: “on the basis of the written instructions from the fms that there should be an urgent check on all passports previously issued to individuals not born in the territory of the russian federation, we sent a request for information to the fms of the rostov region.it noted that, as a result of a check carried out pursuant to sections 51 and 52 of the 2002 regulation on the examination of issues related to citizenship of the russian federation, the fms had found that the second applicant had been issued with a russian passport in breach of the applicable rules, and was not entitled to russian citizenship.the appeal court noted, in particular, that the certificate issued by the rostov region fms on 30 june 2010 showed that a russian passport had been issued to the second applicant on the basis of a certificate of 23 december 1998 issued by the department of the interior of the leninskiy district of rostov-on-don confirming that he was a russian citizen in accordance with section 13(1) of the 1991 law on citizenship of the russian federation.
from the documents submitted to the court, it is unclear whether the fsb presented the regional court with any evidence concerning the applicant’s case, other than its letter to the applicant of 13 august 2009 (see paragraph 10 above) and copies of the relevant legal provisions governing the activities of the fsb and the applicable immigration regulations.its decision stated, amongst other things, the following: “ ... in july 2009 the federal security service took a decision on the undesirability of mr zezev’s presence (residence) in the russian federation and on prohibiting his re-entry into the country until july 2014 ... in his complaint, mr zezev seeks to have the decision of the federal security service declared unlawful and for it to be overruled, referring to the following: he has resided in the russian federation for five years.given the circumstances, mr zezev’s request to have the fsb’s decision on the undesirability of his presence (residence) in russia and on the prohibition on his re-entry until july 2014 declared unlawful should be rejected ...” 15.  on 5 april 2010 the applicant appealed against the above decision to the supreme court of the russian federation (hereinafter “the supreme court”).16.  on 2 june 2010 the supreme court upheld the regional court’s judgment stating, amongst other things, the following: “...on 22 july 2009 the federal security service issued a decision on the undesirability of the presence (residence) of the kazakh national mr zezev in the russian federation and on the prohibition of his re-entry ... in the cassation appeal mr zezev seeks to have the judgment of the krasnodar regional court overruled as unlawful.26.  in reply to a request by the court for a copy of the documents which served as the basis for the decision to exclude the applicant, the government only furnished a thirteen-page copy of the transcript of the hearing of the applicant’s appeal by the krasnodar regional court on 24 march 2010 (see paragraphs 12-14 above).
the decision stated, in particular, that in view of information received from the fsb, the applicant’s residence permit must be revoked under section 9(1)(1) of the federal law on the legal status of foreigners in the russian federation (hereinafter “the foreigners act”), which provided that a resident permit issued to a foreign national should be revoked if he or she advocated a radical change in the constitutional order of the russian federation or otherwise posed a threat to the security of the russian federation or its citizens.the court neither examined the effect of the impugned measure on the applicant’s family life, nor balanced the public and private interests involved, but stated, in particular: “... given that the residence permit of ms gaspar was revoked on the basis of her actions representing a threat to the security of the russian federation ... which necessitates taking measures by the russian federation for the protection of its interests and those of its citizens, the court believes that when taking the impugned decision, the federal migration service balanced public and private interests.” 20.  the applicant’s counsel appealed against the above-mentioned decision to the city court, stating, amongst other things, that the district court had unlawfully refrained from judicial scrutiny of the factual circumstances which had served as the basis for the measure imposed on the applicant.in its decision, the court stated, in particular: “... the allegations of the applicant’s representatives concerning the failure of the representatives of the federal security service to submit proof showing the necessity to send the impugned letter [recommending that the residence permit be revoked] to the federal migration service are unsubstantiated, as the federal security service’s information note on ms gaspar as presented to the court does not contain any such information.” 25.  the applicant’s counsel appealed against the above-mentioned decision to the supreme court of the russian federation (hereinafter “the supreme court”).in response to the applicant’s grounds for appeal, the supreme court held as follows: “... the applicant’s argument concerning a violation of her right to respect for private and family life by the [fsb] decision cannot be taken into account, as this decision did not concern the applicant’s entry into the russian federation to see her family members who were russian nationals in russia ... ... the state has the right to take decisions limiting certain rights of foreign citizens, including the right to request residence permits and the right to request the nationality of that state, in the interests of the public, including that of national security.therefore, the impugned decision is lawful and substantiated, and the appeal against it does not provide reasons to overrule it ...” 27.  in reply to the court’s request for the information and documents that served as the basis for the decision to revoke the applicant’s residence permit, including the fsb’s recommendation of 17 june 2014, the government furnished copies of two documents totalling six pages: the fms’s decision to reject the applicant’s russian citizenship application of 28 march 2014 (see paragraph 10 above), and the decision of 21 july 2014 to revoke her residence permit (see paragraph 12 above).
the cheque bore the applicant’s name underneath the name of the company of which he was president of the executive board, and the address of the company on the cheque was indicated as being “... bakırköy / istanbul”.20.  upon examining the relevant case file at the registry of the first-instance court, the applicant discovered that he had been charged and convicted in absentia for issuing an uncovered cheque on 27 april 1999 and sentenced to a fine of try 500[2], an amount corresponding to the amount of the cheque.he emphasised that, although his accurate address details could easily have been obtained from the mayor of the neighbourhood, the judgment of october 2004 had been served at the address which his company had moved out of on 15 april 1999. in his absence, it had apparently been posted on the door of the building.24.  on 21 september 2006 the principal public prosecutor at the court of cassation delivered her opinion on the applicant’s appeal, where she requested that the first-instance court’s judgment of 5 may 2006 be quashed on account of the unlawful service of the initial judgment rendered in his absence.29.  on 1 december 2008 the principal public prosecutor at the court of cassation rejected the applicant’s application under article 308 of the code of criminal procedure, maintaining that the applicant’s arguments had already been examined by the court of cassation in its decision of 2 october 2006.
the prosecutor also refused the applicant’s request that the material relating to his previous criminal conviction be added to the file pertaining to the instant case, noting that the judgment regarding his earlier conviction (nuosprendis) had been added to his case file, but holding that other material from the earlier criminal case file had not constituted evidence directly relevant to the circumstances being investigated in the instant criminal case.as for the applicant’s request that his neighbours, his sons’ teachers and his work colleagues be questioned in order to prove that in 2009 he had worked long hours and had therefore had no practical opportunity to sexually abuse his children, the court of appeal deemed that there was no reason to believe that the testimony given by those people would outweigh the entirety of the rest of the incriminating evidence in the case, which for that court was consistent.monthly child support of 300 lithuanian litai (ltl – approximately 90 euros (eur)) in respect of the applicant’s child, ro.k., to be paid by the applicant until he came of age, as well as child support in the amount of ltl 1,200 (eur 350) due for the four-month-period between march and july 2011 (that is to say from the day on which the boy had ceased to be cared for by the state until the day on which v.k.as to the other child, ra.k., the court held that v.k.’s claim had to be dismissed because, in the light of the established circumstances, the record in the case file testifying to the applicant being ra.k.’s father was not sufficient to give rise to legal consequences, since the purpose of that record was not to confirm the paternity but to obtain welfare benefits.the court considered that there was no proof in the file that the applicant had asked for the return of his spectacles earlier than on 20 march 2012. in sum, since the inconvenience caused to the applicant could have been easily resolved had he shown some initiative, and given that his need for spectacles had not been proved, the appellate court considered that an acknowledgement that the spectacles had been taken away constituted sufficient compensation for the damage suffered.
on account of the above issues related to the applicant company’s suppliers, the audit concluded that the applicant company had failed to meet the conditions necessary to benefit from the vat deductions it had received.11.  the applicant company lodged an appeal with the minister of finance against the decisions of 9 december 2009. in the appeal it stated that it had met all of its vat obligations stemming from the suppliers’ invoices and that it could not be held responsible for the suppliers’ mistakes.specifically, the income of the applicant company was created by companies which failed to meet their legal obligations in relation to the payment of vat ... in the deliberations the court took into account the claims by the appellant that it was wrongfully deprived of the right to claim vat deductions because the errors found in the tax assessment had pertained to other [companies] ... these claims were rejected by the court ... inter alia taking into account that it is in the interests of every taxpayer to know and be aware of those with whom they engage in business.” 20.  on 17 september 2013 the applicant company appealed to the higher administrative court (виш управен суд).21.  in a final judgment of 13 march 2014 the higher administrative court upheld the findings and conclusions of the tax authorities and stated the following: “... [t]he appellant failed to fulfil the cumulative conditions prescribed in sections 33 and 34 of the vat act to obtain a vat deduction specifically because the monetary inflow of the appellant as a taxpayer was done by other taxpayers who failed to meet their obligations to declare or pay tax.... the court examined the complaint that all of the outstanding issues in the audit reflected errors committed by third parties and that the appellant should not be forced to bear the obligations of third parties ... but dismissed them ... having in mind that every taxpayer has an interest to enter into relations with other subjects.” 22.  on 2 february 2017 the applicant company was removed from the register of companies and ceased to exist.
in may 2003 the audit agency in its report concluded that while the advertising and marketing expenses incurred in 2001 (755,000 latvian lati (lvl), approximately 1,074,268 euros (eur)) and 2002 (lvl 555,000, approximately eur 789,694) had been greater than in previous years (in 1998 the figure had been lvl 374,000, approximately eur 532,154; in 1999, lvl 324,000, approximately eur 461,010; and in 2000, lvl 640,000, approximately eur 910,638), this could be explained by the fact that the bank had been in the process of changing its corporate identity during the period under consideration.is now speculating that he will soon be afforded immunity as a member of [parliament], preventing him from being criminally prosecuted without a majority vote of [the parliament] ... commenting on the value of marketing, advertising and public relations contracts, [the applicant] admitted that even though it is necessary to carry out in-depth market research, during a.l.’s era various procedures were breached and payments were made whose sums currently cannot be precisely determined ... nra has already written that [lvl] 522,000 has been transferred [to finance krājbanka’s] advertising and marketing activities since the beginning of the year 2001, in respect of which no documentation – the relevant contracts, delivery/acceptance deeds, etc.23.  the court also held that the journalists had not had a responsibility to verify the accuracy of the provided information, since the applicant’s status as the chairman of the supervisory board of krājbanka had created a legitimate expectation that the provided information was correct.... [the appellate court] found that the journalists had had no reason to doubt the credibility of the information, as it had been provided by the applicant [in his capacity as] chairman of the supervisory board of krājbanka, and his position had undoubtedly created a legitimate expectation that this information was true ... accordingly, the appellate court rightly held that the journalists had had no obligation to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the applicant.referring to section 2352a of the civil law and section 29(3) of the law on the mass media, the senate of the supreme court ordered the applicant (who had disseminated that defamatory information), and not preses nams, to retract the relevant parts of the articles in question (see paragraph 15 above).
6.  on the same day, the applicant was brought before the investigating judge who ordered his detention on remand taking into account the nature of the offences, and the strong suspicion that he had committed the alleged offences, and the risk of absconding.7.  on 28 march 2012 the applicant’s lawyer lodged an objection against the decision dated 30 december 2011 ordering the applicant’s detention and requested his release.on 29 march 2012 the mersin magistrates’ court dismissed the objection on the basis of the case file, without holding a hearing.on 17 april 2012 the mersin criminal court with general jurisdiction dismissed the objection on the basis of the case file, without holding a hearing.9.  on 10 september 2012 the adana public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, accusing him of being a member of a terrorist organisation and of making propaganda in its favour.
5.  between 3 december 2002 and 15 september 2003 the daily newspaper dan published several articles about a human trafficking case in montenegro, in which the applicant’s name was mentioned in various contexts.6.  on 22 october 2004 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against the publisher of the said newspaper, seeking compensation for non‑pecuniary damage due to violation of his honour and reputation caused by the publishing of untrue information about him.7.  on 4 june 2010, following a remittal, the podgorica first instance court ruled partly in favour of the applicant, ordering the publisher to pay the applicant 8,000 euros (eur) in non-pecuniary damages and to publish the judgment in dan, the daily newspaper in question.8.  on 22 october 2010 the podgorica high court amended this judgment by awarding the applicant eur 4,000 as compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered, which judgment was served on the applicant on 29 november 2010.10.  on 7 april 2011 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal.

7.  on 8 july 2004 the public prosecutor at the istanbul assize court filed a bill of indictment, charging the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of the kongra-gel[1] under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no.3713) on account of the article published on 6 july 2004. in the indictment, the public prosecutor quoted the following passage from the article: “... abdullah öcalan, who has contributed to the essential dynamic of the kurdish movement and the hpg[2], the pja[3] and the kongra-gel, organisations which have acted as military, political and ideological leaders and which have represented his leadership,... [must be well understood]”.in its judgment, the istanbul assize court held that the content of the article and the publication of abdullah öcalan’s photograph amounted to dissemination of propaganda in favour of the pkk/kongra-gel.in his appeal petition, referring to a number of the court’s judgments, the applicant claimed that he had not had the intention of disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation and that his criminal conviction had been in breach of articles 6 and 10 of the convention as he had been exercising his right to impart information.11.  on 16 may 2006 the principal public prosecutor at the court of cassation returned the case file to the first-instance court and requested that the latter revise its judgment in the light of the recent legislative amendments.
9.  on 17 october 2007 the malatya public prosecutor filed an indictment with the malatya assize court charging the applicants with disseminating propaganda in favour of the “dhkp/c” (revolutionary people’s liberation party/front), an illegal armed organisation, under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no.as regards the second applicant, the public prosecutor alleged that he had chanted the following slogans during the same concert: “mahir, hüseyin, ulaş; fight until emancipation”[1] (“mahir, hüseyin, ulaş; kurtuluşa kadar savaş”); “martyrs of the revolution are immortal” (“devrim şehitleri ölümsüzdür”); “revolutionary prisoners are our honour”, “victory on mountains, emancipation at the front; long live victory, long live resistance” (“dağlarda zafer, cephede kurtuluş; yaşasın zafer, yaşasın direniş”).10.  during the criminal proceedings against them, the applicants stated that they had attended the concert of 5 april 2007 and had sung along with the musicians but had not chanted the slogans noted in the indictment.in its judgment, the assize court considered it established, on the basis of a police video recording of the concert of 5 april 2007, a report on the video recording, the indictment, the applicants’ defence submissions and the public prosecutor’s observations on the merits of the case, that the applicants had chanted the slogans noted in the indictment.the court considered that the concert in question had become a propaganda activity in favour of the dhkp/c and that the applicants had chanted slogans that were used by that organisation.
6.  on an unspecified date the applicant was invited to istanbul to take part in a television programme that was due to be broadcast live on a public channel on saturday 31 march 2001. the programme consisted of a debate on the topic of “the cultural structure of the european union and the traditional structure of turkey – comparing identities and modes of behaviour – likely problems and suggested solutions”.11.  in letters dated 2 and 5 april 2001 to the dean of the faculty, the applicant asked why his participation in the broadcast of 31 march 2001 had not been considered appropriate in spite of his past work on the subject covered by the programme.he added that the director of the translation course had expressed misgivings as to whether the applicant was sufficiently familiar with the topic of the programme of 31 march 2001, and that the view of the course director had been taken into account in the decision to refuse authorisation.it noted at the outset that the applicant had been authorised to take part in events outside his city of residence on twelve occasions during the 2000/01 academic year, but that his request for authorisation concerning the programme of 31 march 2001 had been refused in view of the opinion of the course director, who considered that the topic of the programme was not directly linked to the applicant’s specialist field.as to the applicant’s participation in the broadcast of 14 april 2001, the commission noted that the dean of the faculty had authorised the applicant to attend an academic gathering to be held from 11 to 13 april 2001 in istanbul, and that this authorisation had not covered 14 april 2001. the commission considered in that regard that not even research professors should take part in programmes of this type without supervision or authorisation, and that universities had to uphold academic ethics.
the nicosia crime investigation department informed the attorney general that that there was sufficient evidence against all the nine individuals arrested, including the applicants, in relation to the offence of taking part in a fight in a public place contrary to section 89 of the criminal code, but not as regards the remaining offences, which were more serious.the third applicant had also committed the offence of staying in cyprus unlawfully, as his temporary resident permit had expired on 12 february 2009. at the suggestion of the police, the attorney general decided not to prosecute the applicants, but to deport them instead.deportation and detention orders were issued against the applicants on the same day: under section 6(1)(g) of the above law in respect of the first and the second applicants, on the grounds of public order, and under section 6(1)(k) in respect of the third applicant, on the grounds of unlawful stay.the letters stated that the applicants were illegal immigrants: the first and second applicants under section 6(1)(g) of the aliens and immigration law, because their “conduct had been considered dangerous for reasons of public order”, and the third applicant by virtue of section 6(1)(k), on the grounds of “illegal stay”.30.  the government submitted that the applicants’ case had then been reviewed by the minister of the interior, who had noted their lawyer’s objection, read the administrative file and maintained the decision to deport the applicants.
8.  on 4 september 2000 the applicant lodged an action against tedaş with the gaziantep administrative court requesting the annulment of the decision of the kilis branch of tedaş not to appoint her to the post in question and a stay of execution of this decision.18.  on 6 december 2007 the supreme administrative court’s general assembly of administrative proceedings divisions (danıştay i̇dari dava daireleri genel kurulu), the composition of which included some members of the twelfth division, delivered a decision in favour of r.b., who, like the applicant had been a female candidate for tedaş whose application to be appointed to the post of security officer had been rejected by tedaş on account of not fulfilling the requirements of “being a male” and “having completed military service”.20.  in the rectification proceedings the judge rapporteur of the twelfth division submitted his written opinion on the merits of the case and argued, inter alia, that the decision of 16 november 2007 should be rectified in the light of the decision of the supreme administrative court’s general assembly of administrative proceedings divisions of 6 december 2007 in the case of r.b.he also noted in that connection that turkey had ratified the united nations convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and that pursuant to its article 11, the state was bound to take all appropriate measures to ensure, inter alia, the right to the same employment opportunities on a basis of equality of men and women, including the application of the same criteria for selection in matters of employment.21.  on 24 june 2009 the twelfth division of the supreme administrative court dismissed the applicant’s application for the rectification of its previous decision, holding that none of the reasons put forth by the applicant for rectification fell within the exhaustive list of permissible grounds for rectification indicated in section 54 (1) of the administrative procedure act (law no.
5.  the applicant was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment in november 2011. as it transpires from documents in the file, pursuant to an order of the prison governor referring to section 248(1)(1) of the 2009 execution of punishments and pre-trial detention act (see paragraph 18 below), on 29 july 2011 the applicant was placed in isolation in burgas prison, in a permanently locked cell without the possibility to take part in collective activities.6.  the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment in a final decision by the supreme court of cassation of 10 november 2005. he complained about the conditions under which he has been serving his sentence since 12 july 2007 when he had been transferred to plovdiv prison.in the summer the temperatures were very high and in the winter the heating was switched off at around 6 p.m. as a result of which it became very cold in his cell.11.  on 10 june 2011 the first instance court sentenced the applicant to a whole-life sentence, which was confirmed by the appellate court on 27 june 2013. the supreme court of cassation upheld the whole-life imprisonment sentence in a final judgment of 21 may 2014.12.  the applicant submitted, and the government did not comment on, that he has been kept in a permanently locked cell in pazardzhik prison, isolated from the rest of the prison population and only allowed to communicate with other life prisoners during the one-hour daily physical exercise he took outside his cell.
13.  it can be seen from the judgment of the investigation division of the rennes court of appeal of 12 december 2014 (paragraphs 39-41 below) that a certificate drawn up by argenteuil hospital on 10 june 2009 at about 12.30 p.m. recorded the following details of mr ziri’s condition when he arrived in intensive care: “a reactive coma with non-reactive bilateral mydriasis, abolition of corneal reflexes, no coughing, persistence of spontaneous ventilation, periorbital bruising to right eye with skin abrasion of the right cheekbone, skin abrasion on the right kneecap, bruising on the left side of the lower thorax, 1 cm bruise on the left forearm, and an alcohol concentration of 2.4 grams per litre of blood at 11.30 p.m.” 14.  it can be seen from the same judgment that later that day, on 10 june 2009, at 2 p.m., mr ziri was also examined by dr r., a forensic medical examiner.and v.p (or in the case of the first two, at least as assisted witnesses); they also asked the judge to order, in the presence of all the ordinary witnesses, of any assisted witnesses, of any individuals under judicial investigation, of the public prosecutor, of the lawyers of the civil parties and of dr l. and t., a viewing of the video of the arrival at the police station and a reconstruction of the events.34.  those requests were rejected by the judge’s decision of 22 july 2011, on the grounds that testimony had already been taken in a precise and detailed manner and that the civil parties had not indicated any points which had not been raised, that it was for the investigating judge to decide on the choice of status – whether a person should be placed under judicial investigation or be an assisted witness – without this having any bearing on the establishment of the truth, that the viewing of the video in the presence of witnesses was capable of undermining the sincerity of their testimony, and that, in the absence of any person under judicial investigation or assisted witness, a reconstruction could not take place solely in the presence of witnesses or experts.while the commission expresses the opinion that inhuman and degrading treatment was constituted as a result of the precipitation and violence with which ali ziri was extracted from the vehicle, and also by the fact of leaving the two men, aged 60 and 69, lying on the floor of the police station, handcuffed behind their backs, in their vomit, within view of all the officials for about an hour, it does not follow from this opinion, given the circumstances of the arrival at the police station analysed above, that any of the acts in question could have led to the death of ali ziri.43.  on 16 february 2016 the criminal division of the court of cassation dismissed the appeal by a judgment giving the following reasoning: “... in upholding the discontinuance decision, the judgment notes that it could be seen from the statements of the police officers who were part of the patrol team, from the recording of the messages exchanged during the journey between the place of the arrest and the police station, and the testimony of the police officers who intervened on arrival at the police station, that this journey had been particularly agitated and that the acts of restraint used against [m. ziri] had been made necessary by the state of agitation and rebellion of those arrested, whose conduct, in the confined environment of a vehicle, close to the driver, was highly dangerous for the safety of all the passengers and of other road users; the court added that the immobilisation techniques applied for a few minutes by the police, whose professional conduct could not be called into question and was attested by the witness to the arrest, did not constitute an excessive degree of restraint.
13.  on 17 june 2013 the supreme court (the second section), sitting as a five-judge panel, granted the ordinary appeal on points of law and restored the commercial court’s judgment of 6 april 2012. it considered that due to the close professional ties, the applicant company had had a significant interest in selling if shares.15.  the applicant company further explained that it had only learned about the composition of the panel – and thus the involvement of judge n. in the proceedings at issue – when the supreme court’s judgment had been served on the applicant company.18.  following these explanations, the supreme court rejected the applicant company’s action for nullity, holding that a decision which had become final could only be contested under section 529 of the code of civil procedure on the ground that a judge who had taken part in the decision had been excluded by law from exercising his or her office (see paragraph 25 below).in the present case, however, no such particularly grave reason had been shown, since the participation of a judge who had in the past considered filing an action against one of the parties to the proceedings was not comparable to a ground enumerated in section 20 of the act on exercise of jurisdiction (see paragraph 21 below).19.  in other proceedings concerning an action brought against the applicant company (by a different person) in connection with the purchase of shares in if, the applicant company filed an extraordinary appeal against a judgment of the court of appeal of 29 november 2012 with the supreme court and subsequently challenged judge n. for bias in those proceedings.
mihalev, father of the first applicant and grandfather of the second applicant, owned a machinery factory in gabrovo, which was nationalised in 1947. after the nationalisation the property was allocated for use to a state-owned enterprise, which in 1991 was transformed into a state-owned company named t.. under domestic law, such a transformation entailed the newly-created company becoming, in principle, the owner of the assets which had until then been allocated to it for use and management; some assets allocated to state-owned enterprises or companies could nevertheless be the subject of restitution (see paragraph 15 below).6.  after the restitution of ownership of nationalised real property act (hereinafter “the restitution act”, see paragraphs 15-16 below) came into force in 1992, the first applicant and his brother asked the mayor of gabrovo to strike the factory building out of the register of state properties.9.  after the entry into force of the compensation of owners of nationalised real property act (hereinafter “the compensation act”, see paragraph 17 below), in january 1998 the first applicant and his brother applied to receive compensation for moveable properties such as industrial equipment and materials which had been nationalised together with the factory.it argued that the restitution of the property had not taken place, because the preconditions under the restitution act had not been complied with, and that it had become the owner of the building as a result of its transformation into a company (see paragraph 5 above).on the basis of expert evidence and witness testimony, it concluded that after the nationalisation the building had been modified in a manner and to a degree which meant that in 1992 it had not existed in its state prior to 1947. accordingly, the applicants could not rely on restitution and company t. had become the owner of the building on the strength of its transformation from a state-owned enterprise into a company in 1991 (see paragraph 5 above).
8.  on 28 september 2013 the director of the aliens subdivision of attica ordered the applicant’s expulsion on the grounds that he had entered the country illegally, did not possess a valid residence permit, was considered to pose a danger to public order, and had been convicted by a criminal court for possession of false documents.she also noted that the legality of the applicant’s detention was not affected by the conditions of his detention, which in any event were tolerable, taking into account the difficult financial situation of the country and the fact that little time had elapsed since the applicant’s arrest (judgment no.on the same date the director of the attica aliens directorate issued a decision modifying the legal basis of the applicant’s detention and basing it instead on the grounds that he posed a danger to public order and/or national security and that his detention was necessary for the speedy determination of his application for asylum.in her reasoning, she observed that the applicant had not yet been registered as an asylum-seeker, but the procedure was ongoing, taking into account a document dated 24 october 2013 from the aliens division of attica which said that the applicant had expressed his wish to request asylum on 7 october 2013, but this had not yet been registered by the new asylum service.21.  on 27 november 2013 the applicant lodged an application for annulment of the decision dated 28 september 2013 of the director of the aliens subdivision of attica by which it had been decided that he would be returned to his country of origin and that he would be detained with a view to being expelled.
the latest relevant decision was taken on 28 april 2008. on 30 june 2008 the district court examined an appeal lodged by the applicant against the decision of 28 april 2008. the court established that the applicant had been taken to the police station at about 4 a.m. on 28 june 2007 and that the arrest record had been drawn up at 6 p.m. the same day.on the basis of the testimonies given by the applicant and police officers, the court found that the applicant had spent a considerable time in the hallway of the police station without attempting to leave it.drew up his arrest record at 6 p.m. on 28 june 2007. regard being had to the above and on the basis of the inquiry conducted, the investigator k. has rightfully concluded that [the applicant] when present at [the police station] had not been restricted in movement and that he had been able to leave the premises.40.  on 20 may 2015 the presidium of the volgograd regional court (“the presidium”) quashed the judgment of 31 may 2011 and the appeal decision of 26 july 2011 on the grounds that the trial judge had earlier adjudicated the case of his co-accused.45.  on 18 october 2011 the regional court found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment starting from 27 november 2010. the trial court considered that despite the arrest record of 30 november 2010, the applicant had actually been arrested on 27 november 2010. on 27 march 2012 the supreme court of russia upheld the judgment on appeal.
5.  on 28 may 2005 the applicant, who was walking home after an evening drinking, was stopped on the street by police officers from the patrol and inspection service and driven to the sovetskiy district police station of orsk (советское ровд г. орска).12.  on 14 october 2005 the preliminary investigation into the criminal case was suspended under article 208 § 1 (1) of the code of criminal procedure, owing to the inability to identify the individuals to be charged.15.  in 2012 the applicant brought a civil claim against various state authorities, including the russian ministry of finance, seeking 6,000,000 russian roubles (rub) in compensation for his ill‑treatment at the police station and the lack of an effective investigation into his complaint.16.  on 24 july 2012 the leninskiy district court of orsk allowed the applicant’s claim in part and awarded him rub 150,000 (the equivalent of about 3,800 euros) in compensation.it established that the applicant had been taken into police custody in good health and that his injuries had been caused at the police station, since the state authorities had failed to provide a plausible explanation for the injuries or any evidence showing that he could have sustained them elsewhere.
the show followed a day of discussions and explanations about the leak of secret documents given by the minister of defence, the chief of the armed forces and the head of the information department of the army before the defence commission of the senate.23.  the investigation further established that by the end of 2005 the applicant had shown the content of the cd to a few people and had given a copy of the cd to e.g. and i.m., who the applicant believed were former members of the police.25.  on 2 july 2007 the head of the romanian armed forces informed the chief prosecutor of the prosecutor’s office attached to the high court of cassation and justice that the documents which formed the object of the investigation and which had been issued by the romanian army, and had been compromised by their publication in the media, had been de-classified.the prosecutor also mentioned that the actions undertaken by o.s and the applicant in order to gather information concerning the content, nature and importance of the secret documents in question, by contacting active or reserve members of the armed forces or other journalists were part of the working methods of investigative journalists and did not necessarily present a danger for society.the court held that the facts established during the investigation had led to the conclusion that the applicant had secretly transmitted the cd containing secret information to other people he knew, avoiding handing it over to the competent authorities of the ministry of defence or the romanian intelligence service.
15.  a report drawn up on that same day by one of the officers who had seized the applicant read as follows: “i hereby inform that on 15 april 2014 during the general morning meeting of the prevention sub-division, an oral instruction was received from [the chief] to execute the order of the tauragė district court, which ordered that [the applicant] be brought (atvesdinti) to the klaipėda court psychiatric centre where she was to undergo a psychiatric assessment, in connection with an ongoing pre‑trial investigation.she speaks loudly about the criminal allegations against her, denies them and blames the victim, her parents and the surroundings.” 19.  the report concluded that the applicant had a chronic mental disorder ‑ schizo-affective disorder with a type of mania (lėtinis psichikos sutrikimas ‑ šizoafektinis sutrikimas, manijos tipas), that because of that disorder she had been incapable of understanding and controlling her actions at the time of the alleged criminal offence, and that those circumstances persisted at the time of the assessment.he gave the following responses to the questions submitted to him by the judge and the applicant’s lawyer (the questions were not included in the minutes of the hearing): “i stand by my responses given in the assessment report.” “as of this moment, i cannot say if procedural steps can be conducted with [the applicant].she submitted that the court had not assessed whether she had posed a danger to society – the applicant submitted that the offence which she had committed had not been serious and that she had committed it because of the pre‑existing conflict between e. and herself and not because of her mental disorder, so the disorder had not made her a danger to others.30.  in the appeal the applicant also raised complaints about being taken for a psychiatric assessment without her consent on 15 april 2014. she submitted that she had not been informed that a psychiatric assessment had been ordered and had not been provided with a court order to that effect, that a record of provisional arrest had not been drawn up, a lawyer had not been present during the assessment, and she had not been informed about her right to request the removal of experts.
10.  on 25 march 2014 the second applicant, represented by two lawyers of her choice, lodged a complaint with the caraş-severin county court against the prosecutor’s decision of 17 march 2014. she claimed that the seizure of assets for the purpose of subsequent special or extended confiscation provided for by article 249 of the criminal procedure code, taken together with articles 112 and 1121 of the criminal code, could be ordered only with respect to assets belonging to a suspect or accused.356 of 25 june 2014 of the constitutional court (see paragraph 37 below), the district court explained that the confiscation measure would apply only to the assets acquired after april 2012. the court therefore decided to lift the seizure order in respect of the assets belonging to the family which did not fall within the scope of the case, having been acquired before april 2012.the report concluded that there were serious discrepancies between the first applicant’s lawful income and her assets, and said that the information would be sent to the commission for the verification of assets of the timişoara court of appeal for a decision on the further steps to be taken.as a result of this criminal conviction, the first-instance court considered that the requirements of article 1121 of the criminal code had been fulfilled and ordered the extended confiscation of money, flats and vehicles, items which had a value exceeding the income of the defendant and his family in the last five years .... as regards the income of the defendant and his family, the court observes that he submitted an accountant’s report showing the family’s income starting with january 1991, but without mentioning their expenses for the same period.in order to establish whether there was a discrepancy between the family’s income and their properties and other goods acquired, the court must compare the amounts of money spent during the period of the acquisition of the properties in question with the income.
16.  in the above-mentioned decisions the courts of appeal upheld the claimants’ requests, stating that the applicants’ colleagues should be paid the differences in their salaries together with interest on the unpaid amounts, and the contributions in respect of the their old-age pensions, for the period during the which unconstitutional norm had been applied.rev.2 393/2013 of 26 september 2013 17.  given the differences in adjudication on the matter, on 27 march 2013 the novi sad court of appeal requested, in accordance with article 395 of the civil procedure act (zakon o parničnom postupku, published in the official gazette of the republic of serbia – og rs – 125/04 and 111/2009), that the supreme court of cassation amend its judgment no.983/2012 of 26 september 2013, state organs [were engaging in what had to be considered] unlawful work, as the constitutional court failed to adopt a decision [regarding] in which manner the consequences of the unconstitutional norm should have been overcome[, and] the government of the republic of serbia, as the regulatory authority, within the scope of their jurisdiction did not secure the execution of the impugned decision of the constitutional court concerning the disputed period during which the claimant’s salary was unconstitutionally and illegally reduced, the claimant had a right to lodge a claim for compensation for damage with the civil courts, and the civil courts are in charge of deciding on the matter in accordance with article 1 of the civil procedure act.” (cited from the judgment no.27.  the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal on 25 november 2013 complaining, inter alia, of the existence of inconsistent domestic case-law of serbian courts, in particular the rejection of her own claim and the simultaneous acceptance of identical claims lodged by her colleagues, and asked the constitutional court to find that there had been a breach of the principle of judicial certainty as an integral part of her right to a fair trial.29.  on 23 october 2014 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s constitutional appeal and decided not to evaluate the decision of the supreme court of cassation of 26 september 2013 because it had been adopted after the judgment of the belgrade court of appeal of 3 october 2013 had been adopted in the applicant’s case (ustavni sud nije posebno cenio imajući u vidu da ona potiče iz perioda nakon donošenja osporene presude apelacionog suda u beogradu gž1 556/13 od 3. oktobra 2013.
it summarised the suspicions against him, referred to police reports, an autopsy report, the victim’s medical documents, examinations of various exhibits and witness testimonies, and concluded that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had poisoned the victim on 8 april 2010. the court found it established that there was a need for the applicant’s detention, because otherwise he would tamper with evidence by exerting pressure on the witnesses, as evidenced by his previous conduct whereby he had threatened them.24.  on 21 december 2012 the applicant’s detention was extended; the budapest high court again referred to the fact that, at the time of his arrest, the applicant had been unreachable at his permanent address and had been earning a living from temporary jobs, which, taken together with the severity of the potential punishment, substantiated the risk of his absconding.29.  on 28 january the applicant applied for release, but the application was dismissed on 18 february by the budapest high court on the grounds that, given the gravity of the offence and the complexity of the case, pre‑trial detention did not constitute an anticipated punishment.that decision was upheld on appeal by the budapest court of appeal on 18 february 2014. a further application by the applicant of 18 april 2014 was dismissed on 8 april 2014 (the dismissal was upheld by the second-instance court on 24 april 2014) on the grounds that the applicant had not relied on new circumstances warranting his release.it held that the gravity of the offence, the applicant’s lack of financial resources and essential ties, and the fact that he had only notified the authorities of his place of residence once he had been placed in detention substantiated the risk of his absconding.
32.  on 25 june 2004 consortium industrial group, the losing party in the 2004 bidding competition, instituted proceedings in the kyiv commercial court against the applicant company, the fund, the ministry of industrial policy and the state commission on securities and the stock market, challenging the validity of the authorities’ decisions adopted in connection with the privatisation of kryvorizhstal and the contract of 14 june 2004. it contended that the 2004 bidding competition had been unlawful and unfair.33.  in particular, consortium industrial group argued that the shares in kryvorizhstal had not been issued in accordance with the law; that the competition had not been announced in due time; that the conditions of the competition had been too narrow and restrictive, thereby limiting the circle of potential bidders and disrespecting the statutory right of every citizen to participate in the privatisation of state assets; that the shares should have been sold through the stock exchange; and that its total offer, including the money it had planned to invest in kryvorizhstal, had been higher than the amount paid by the applicant company for the shares in the enterprise.52.  the court held that the fund had failed to announce the competition in due time; that it had unlawfully introduced a condition concerning the production of charcoal and steel; that the fund had failed to set out specific conditions of sale of certain number of the kryvorizhstal shares outside the bidding competition; that the fund’s decisions issued between 8 and 14 june 2004 in relation to the competition had been invalid, as the complaints of three private individuals against the decisions concerning the organisation of the 2004 bidding competition had been ongoing before the courts during that period; and that the applicant company and consortium industrial group had unlawfully been allowed to participate in the competition.54.  the applicant company appealed against the judgment of 22 april 2005 and the ruling of 28 april 2005. according to the text of the kyiv commercial court of appeal’s decision of 2 june 2005 (see paragraph 56 below), the applicant company contended that the kyiv commercial court had wrongly established the circumstances of the case, and that it had erred in applying the law.it will be evidence not only of the court’s objectivity, but also of the [past] negotiations behind closed doors between various representatives from the authorities and the business...” 65.  in july 2004 consortium industrial group instituted proceedings in the pecherskyy court against the applicant company, the fund, the ministry of industrial policy and the state commission on securities and the stock market, challenging the validity of the authorities’ decisions issued in connection with the privatisation of kryvorizhstal and the contract of 14 june 2004. consortium industrial group relied mainly on the same circumstances and considerations referred to in its claims before the commercial courts.
29.  by 1 december 2005 the applicant’s request had been refused by the agency at least four times on the grounds that construction was banned pursuant to either the decision to change the dup of 6 june 2005 or the decision of 6 october 2005. the agency also held that the calculation could not be done as the first applicant had no building permit.the court considered in particular that the first decision to change the dup, which prohibited construction, had entered into force on 7 july and expired on 5 october 2005, while the next decision had entered into force on 14 october 2005. therefore, there had been no construction ban before 7 july 2005 or between 5 and 14 october 2005, when the first applicant requested the communal charges to be calculated and when the agency was bound to calculate them.45.  on 29 december 2005 the administrative court dismissed the first applicant’s claim on the grounds that there was no contract between the first applicant and the agency concerning the communal charges, that the first applicant had failed to submit all the evidence required by the relevant statutory provision in order to obtain a building permit, and it had failed to obtain an adjacent plot of land as required by the urban technical conditions.46.  on an unspecified date thereafter the first applicant lodged a request for judicial review before the supreme court, maintaining that there was a contract between itself and the agency concluded in 1998. it also submitted that the courts had blamed the first applicant for not paying the charges and completing the plot, even though it had done everything it could to comply with these requests, and had actually complained about the unlawfulness of the relevant state bodies’ refusal to cooperate in these matters.the ministry further explained that a decision on ‘a construction ban’ related exclusively to a ban on issuing a decision granting a location, as a document on the basis of which a building permit was issued, and that in a case where the decision on location had been issued prior to the construction ban, the competent body had a duty to issue a building permit to an investor, provided that the conditions provided in section 34 of the construction act (zakon o izgradnji objekata) were fulfilled, regardless of whether the construction ban in the relevant area was in force.
the courts were called upon to consider the seriousness of the infringement of the right to personality and the offender’s interest in resocialisation; in that regard, account had to be taken of the way in which the person concerned was presented in the report and, in particular, the extent of its dissemination.it acknowledged that the applicants’ interest in no longer being the subject of reports concerning their crime was considerable, since the crime had been committed a long time previously and they had been released from prison, the first applicant in august 2007 and the second in january 2008. however, in the view of the federal court of justice, in the circumstances of the case the impugned passage from the report of 14 july 2000 did not affect the applicants’ personality rights in a significant manner (erheblich), as it was not liable to cause them to be “pilloried for all time” or to draw them into the spotlight (ins licht der öffentlichkeit zerren) in a way that would stigmatise them again as criminals.in the view of the federal court of justice, the passage in question did not stigmatise the applicants as the perpetrators of the crime or as murderers, but stated that the two brothers had been convicted of murder after a six-month criminal trial based entirely on circumstantial evidence and that they continued to protest their innocence; this left it open to the reader to conclude that they had been wrongly convicted.the federal court of justice found that there was therefore no doubt that, on the day on which the transcript of the report had been posted on the radio’s website, the identification of the applicants in the radio programme had been justified in view of the seriousness of the crime, the fact that the victim had been well known, the considerable public attention the crime had received and the fact that the applicants had tried after 2000 to have their convictions quashed using all conceivable remedies (alle denkbaren rechtsbehelfe).if they were deprived of the possibility of collecting, processing and using personal data without the consent of the person concerned, neither the press nor radio stations would be able to carry out their work as journalists and would thus be unable to perform the tasks recognised and guaranteed by article 5 § 1 of the basic law, article 10 § 1 of the convention and article 11 of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union.
according to the official version of events, during the meeting, when ms k. enquired about the necessary documents and applicable procedure for the issuance of the construction permit, the applicant replied that, apart from the necessary formalities, she would also need to make a pay-off (ქრთამი) to the amount of 30,000 united states dollars (usd); of this amount, usd 20,000 would be the share of the governor himself, whilst the rest would be divided between the applicant and representatives from the various agencies involved.22.  when questioned by the trial court on 23 june 2006, both the notary who had certified the sales agreement and the head of the land registry of the marneuli region confirmed that the applicant had been urging them to expedite the registration of ms k.’s title to the plot of land on which a petrol station was scheduled to be constructed.she further stated before the trial court that she had already acted as an undercover agent of the dcs when she had approached the applicant for the first time on 1 december 2005. she stated that the initial objective of that undercover anti-criminal operation, led by the dcs, had been to expose the criminal activity of the governor of the marneuli region.26.  on 7 july 2006 the applicant requested the trial court to summon ms n. as an additional witness so that he could question her in relation to her purported collaboration with the dcs and role in the sequence of the events which had led to the initiation of the criminal proceedings against him (see the preceding paragraph).the court stated that the collection of the evidence in the case file – the statements given during the trial by ms k., the notary and the head of the land registry; the judicially authorised secret video and audio recording; and the results of the personal search of the applicant on 13 december 2005 and of the forensic chemical and phonoscope examinations – confirmed the applicant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
because they care about any accidents that may happen – not, of course, owing to someone’s choosing to walk or park his or her car there, but owing to the fact that the height of this construction, which accidently (as they claim) juts out of their land, is such that any unsuspecting person runs the risk of getting head injuries when he or she steps out of his or her car ... as they are bailiffs, like spies, they also find out the names of the people who come into the pavlidis area in philyro in order to work, from the number plates of the cars.the appeal court rejected the applicant’s argument and held the following: “... considering the above-mentioned content of the article and the then ongoing dispute between the parties and especially their personal confrontation at the city council, it is at the outset clear and without a doubt that the references (facts and characterisations) solely and exclusively concern the complainant.it was proved that the above-mentioned facts which the defendant disseminated to others via the local press were true, as the complainant admitted ... it was also proved that a) the above-mentioned facts that the defendant disseminated in the above-mentioned way could harm, seen objectively, the honour and reputation of the complainant, also in view of her aforementioned capacity in conjunction with the fact that the dissemination took place via the local press and became known to an indefinite number of people; b) the defendant knew that the disseminated facts were capable of harming the honour or reputation of the complainant, and c) the defendant wanted to make such a dissemination harming her honour and reputation.in particular, the court bases its conclusion on the fact that the applicant presented the above-mentioned true facts along with unacceptable value judgments and references to the complainant’s public post, such as, ‘because those people will serve petty political – but mostly their own personal – interests much more readily in order to impose themselves more easily than others, others whose vote they wormed out by making many promises’, and unfamiliar characterisations such as, ‘those are the totally (un)worthy, squeaky clean people in proper clothes every sunday’, or, ‘as they are bailiffs, like spies, they also find out the names of the people from the number plates of the cars’.these phrases were not necessary in this case for the expression of the defendant’s desire to protect the legitimate interest upon which he relied, and he could have used other phrases such as: ‘they try to serve their [own] personal interests’ instead of, ‘because those people will serve petty political – but mostly their own personal – interests much more readily in order to impose themselves more easily than others, others whose vote they wormed out by making many promises’; or the phrase, ‘the elected public persons’ instead of, ‘those are the totally (un)worthy, squeaky clean people in proper clothes every sunday’; as well as the expression, ‘as bailiffs, they know how to find other people’s data’, instead of, ‘as they are bailiffs, like spies, they also find out the names of the people from the number plates of the cars’ ...” 12.  based on the above, the court of appeal found the applicant guilty of insult via the press and sentenced him to a two-month suspended prison sentence (judgment no.
47/1985 and illegal, the bari district court ordered, in accordance with section 19 of that law, the confiscation of all the developed land at punta perotti, including that belonging to the applicant company, together with the buildings thereon, and the incorporation of the property, without compensation, into the estate of the municipal authority of bari.the court of cassation also took into account the conduct of the administrative authorities, and in particular the following facts: on obtaining the building permits, the defendants had been reassured by the director of the relevant municipal office; the site-protection prohibitions with which the construction project was at odds did not appear in the land-use plan; and the competent national authority had not intervened.in a decision of 12 march 2013 the preliminary investigations judge of that court revoked the confiscation measure and ordered the return of the land on account of the fact that, first, the court had found a violation of article 7 of the convention in sud fondi s.r.l.it reproached the municipal authority for: (1) failing to adopt an alternative to the land-use plan; (2) failing to clarify the existence of the constraints arising as to the authorised use of the areas concerned by the site development at issue; and (3) approving site development procedures which had apparently been lawful but had led to the confiscation of the land and had caused a significant economic loss.shortly before that, on 21 may 2015, a resolution of the municipality of golfo aranci had acknowledged the genuine interest of the community in keeping the confiscated complex, referring in particular to the possibility of using the housing to cope with situations of urgency in the event that the local authorities should decide to assign the use of the property, directly or indirectly, for rent by persons with low income.
the average monthly wage in 1982 was sur 177.30 across all branches of the economy plus sur 68.70 in various social benefits (people’s economy of the ussr 1982, a statistical yearbook by the ussr central statistics directorate, moscow, 1983).to confirm succession of the [russian] government in respect of the obligations of the former ussr vis-à-vis russian federation citizens arising out of the bonds of the 1982 state internal premium loan.... 6.  to give russian federation citizens who are holders of bonds of the 1982 state internal premium loan the right to voluntarily exchange their bonds against state securities, including 1992 russian internal premium loan bonds, shares in the savings bank ... and also to credit the proceeds of sale of the bonds into deposit accounts open in the savings bank ... from 1 october 1992 ...” 11.  between 1995 and 2000 a series of russian laws and regulations were passed which provided for the conversion of soviet securities, including the 1982 premium bonds, into special russian promissory notes nominated in “promissory roubles” (dor) (for details, see yuriy lobanov v. russia, no.632-o of 3 april 2012, the constitutional court declared it inadmissible, finding that it was not competent to rule on the issue of an alleged failure of federal lawmakers to enact laws guaranteeing the protection of savings which had been recognised as russia’s internal debt.in its view, the federal lawmakers had adequate discretion to legislate on those issues in the interests of everyone, taking into account the specific social and economic conditions prevailing in russia and the balance between the rights and lawful interests of various categories of citizens, including those who acted as creditors of the state and others in respect of whom the state had public policy obligations.
it found: “the consolidation of the relationship between the applicant and the minor by means of complying with the county court’s decision is even more necessary since, from the report of the interview with the minor, it appears that the minor had been visiting her father after the parents’ separation until about six months before the hearing, [when the mother] stopped allowing her to talk on the phone with the applicant; from the same report it appears that the minor does not wish to see her father in order not to upset her mother.in these circumstances, the [county court] has correctly decided that the visits should take place in the applicant’s home, in order to allow the normal parental ties to develop and to avoid the possibility of inculcating feelings of hatred towards the father, which would run counter to the child’s harmonious psychological development.” 11.  as n.e.c.the court concludes that the non-enforcement of the obligation set down in the contact order is caused exclusively by the debtor and there is no evidence to show that the minor herself would refuse in absolute terms contact with the creditor or that she would manifest aversion towards him.” 14.  on 21 august 2013, acting on an application lodged by the bailiff under article 188 § 2 of the ccp (see paragraph 27 below), the brezoi district court fined n.e.c.he also argued that the provisions of the ccp allowing the bailiff to stay the execution while a criminal complaint was ongoing were unconstitutional in so far as it allowed the debtor − in bad faith − to stay or obliterate the enforcement efforts and to manipulate the child’s behaviour to the point of rejecting the non-custodial parent.in the light of the above, we consider that it is important for the child that both you and your former spouse try to improve your communication and that you change your current attitude (complaints before courts and other institutions, enforcement proceedings (...)), in order to overcome the conflicts and to offer your daughter the support and reassurance that she requires at this age.” 20.  acting upon the criminal complaint lodged by the bailiff on 18 august 2014 (see paragraph 15 above), the prosecutor’s office attached to the vâlcea county court started an investigation into the commission of the offence of a breach of a court judgment (nerespectare a hotărârii judecătoreşti).
7.  on 2 december 2009 the federal penal authority (“федеральная служба исполнения наказаний”, “the fsin”) of russia sent a telegram to the fsin department for the oryol region (“the oryol fsin”) instructing the latter to send each month up to forty people detained in remand prisons and sentenced to a term of imprisonment in a strict-regime facility to the krasnoyarsk region.9.  acting on the basis of the fsin of russia’s instruction of 2 december 2009, on an unspecified date the oryol fsin decided, in view of the overcrowding in the post‑conviction detention facilities in the oryol region, that the issue of which particular facility the applicant would be transferred to should be resolved by the fsin department for the krasnoyarsk region (“the krasnoyarsk fsin”).11.  on 12 november 2010 the fsin of russia rejected the applicant’s request, informing him that, under article 81 of the code on the execution of sentences (“the ces”), in the absence of exceptional circumstances convicts were to serve their prison term in its entirety in the same detention facility, and that there were no such exceptional circumstances in the applicant’s case.they noted as follows: “[a]s regards maintaining the convict’s social ties, the right to receive visits and parcels as well as the right to correspondence and phone calls should be realised in accordance with the laws on execution of sentences in force and does not depend on the place in which he is serving the sentence.” 12.  the applicant brought civil proceedings against the oryol fsin, claiming compensation for pecuniary and non‑pecuniary damage caused by their decision to transfer him to a penal facility in the krasnoyarsk region in breach of his right, under article 73 § 1 of the ces, to serve his prison sentence in his home region, which had adversely affected his capacity to maintain his family and social ties.the court did not address the applicant’s argument regarding his difficulties in maintaining family ties because of the distance between his family home and the detention facility.
7.  in the meantime, an ex officio investigation concerning the offences of illegal deprivation of liberty, illegal arrest and abusive investigation of a large number of persons, including the applicants, culminated in the referral to court and subsequent conviction of senior military and public officials by a decision of the supreme court of justice of 10 may 1991, which became final on 14 november 1991. the injured parties, including the applicants, did not participate in that procedure, as the government acknowledged.8.  as regards the offence of abusive conduct, the military prosecutor’s office decided on 9 march 1994 (in respect of the first applicant) and 28 october 1994 (in respect of the second applicant) not to open a separate ex officio investigation on the grounds that the offence of abusive conduct fell under a subsequently enacted amnesty law; that decision was communicated only to the second applicant on 4 october 2001. no decision was adopted in respect of the applicants’ injury.9.  further, without a formal decision to overturn the decisions issued by the military prosecutor’s office (see paragraph 8 above) and to reopen the applicants’ respective cases, in the main criminal investigation, the prosecutor heard the applicants who reiterated their complaints regarding the offences of illegal deprivation of liberty and homicide as an attempt raised on account of their ill-treatment and injury during the events of december 1989. thus, the first applicant requested on 5 january 2005 and on 4 august 2008 to participate in these proceedings as a civil party and for the investigation of his case to be pursued by the military prosecutor’s office.11.  on 14 october 2015, as regards the second applicant, the military prosecutor’s office issued a decision only in respect of the offence of instigation to illegal deprivation of liberty by closing the main criminal investigation on the grounds of res judicata in relation to the supreme court of justice’s decision of 10 may 1991, failing to decide the offence of homicide as an attempt or her injury, as complained of (see paragraph 7 above).thus, on 1 november 2016 the military prosecutor’s office ordered the initiation in rem of a criminal investigation regarding the offence of crimes against humanity in respect of the same circumstances of fact.
the courts repeatedly relied in their decisions on the strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence in question, the likelihood of a severe prison sentence being imposed on him and the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation, especially the need to obtain further expert evidence.on 23 september 2009 the gdańsk court of appeal upheld the impugned decision, finding that the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence in question persisted, despite the fact that the judgment convicting the applicant had been quashed.the court of appeal further considered that the regional court had correctly relied on the severity of the anticipated penalty as the principal ground for the applicant’s continuing detention and on the risk of the obstruction of the proceedings.22.  on 26 october 2012 the gdańsk regional court extended the applicant’s detention until 30 december 2012. on 13 november 2012 the gdańsk court of appeal upheld the impugned decision.the court also held that further detention on remand was the only preventive measure capable of securing the proper course of the proceedings until the delivery of a final judgment.
7.  the police were called to the scene and drew up an official “note” (службена белешка) in which the event was described as a fight involving the applicant, r. and a certain p. 8.  on 11 june 2012 an investigating judge (истражен судија) opened an investigation against the applicant, with oral evidence being provided by the applicant, r., and witnesses j. and k., the latter being friends of r.’s.is refused for the same reasons as stated in the minutes of 12 february 2013. since there has already been an expert report commissioned in the case, further requests for the commissioning of additional expert reports are refused, and the court is already in possession of sufficient evidence to establish the facts in the case.” 18.  closing arguments were also delivered at that hearing, in which the applicant complained that all the evidentiary testimony proposed on his behalf had been rejected by the trial court and he had therefore been prevented from proving his case.the trial court based its findings on the expert report, the statement given by r. and the statements given by the two witnesses j. and k. although the trial court in its reasoning accepted that there had been a third person, the applicant’s friend, involved in the altercation, it considered that the defence’s arguments contradicted the other evidence put before it sufficiently, thereby showing that the applicant was guilty of the offence he had been charged with.20.  the applicant submitted two appeals, one through a lawyer on 17 april 2013 and another personally on 22 april 2013. in the appeals it was stated that none of the witnesses proposed by the defence had been questioned by the trial court and none of the expert opinion requests had been accepted, effectively rendering the taking of evidence in the case completely one-sided.the relevant parts of the judgment read as follows: “in the appeals it is stated that the defence’s request to question p. as a witness was wrongfully rejected and that it could have significantly contributed to different conclusions with regard to the facts ... [t]his court finds that the request was rightfully rejected by the lower court because the witness p. was not an eyewitness to the event in question, which is supported by the statement of the accused given at the investigation stage ... ... from the statement [of r.] ... which finds support in the statements given by j. and k., it can be concluded that on the evening in question the accused insulted r., the accused then hit r. over the head with a glass.
10.  in january 2007 the trustee prepared the first list of k.’s creditors, which included company e. 11.  in may 2007 company e. brought proceedings against the first applicant under section 646(2) of the commerce act, as in force at the time (see paragraph 25 below), seeking to have the payments k. had made to her during the so-called “suspect period” – the period between the initial date of insolvency as declared by the plovdiv regional court and the commencement of the insolvency proceedings (the payments described in paragraph 7 above) − declared null and void and the sum received by her returned to the insolvency estate.12.  the action was allowed in a judgment of the regional court of 31 october 2007. observing that it was undisputed that k. had paid the first applicant bgn 22,043.23 during the “suspect period”, and without analysing the matter any further, it ordered her to pay back this sum to the insolvency estate, plus default interest.16.  in april 2007 company e. brought proceedings against the second applicant under section 646(2) of the commerce act, as in force at the time (see paragraph 25 below), seeking to have the payments k. had made to it during the “suspect period” between 30 october 2005 and 17 november 2006 (payments described in paragraph 8 above) declared null and void and the sum received by the applicant returned to the insolvency estate.21.  in the insolvency proceedings against k., the majority of its assets were distributed among its creditors between november 2007 and october 2008. in two decisions delivered in november and december 2008 the trustee in bankruptcy added the state to the list of creditors, with claims exceeding bgn 5,000,000. as the state was a privileged creditor, almost all payments from the insolvency estate after that were made to it, but a substantial proportion of the debts owed to it by k. nonetheless remained unpaid.22.  the applicants did not make use of the possibility afforded to them by section 648 of the commerce act (see paragraph 29 below) to join the insolvency proceedings as creditors of k. two other companies in a similar situation – they had also been obliged to return sums to the insolvency estate on the basis of section 646(2) of the commerce act – did join the insolvency proceedings, but received no part of the sums owed to them.
6.  on 29 january 2008 the applicants were involved in a street protest as a result of which they were arrested and detained for six hours and forty‑five minutes.on 18 december 2008 the first applicant was again involved in a street protest, as a result of which he was arrested and detained for approximately four hours and a half.8.  on 2 november 2010 the court adopted a judgment in the case of mătăsaru and saviţchi (cited above), in which it declared inadmissible the applicants’ complaints concerning the alleged breaches of their rights guaranteed by articles 5 and 11 of the convention on the ground of their failure to exhaust domestic remedies (see mătăsaru and saviţchi (cited above, § 75).9.  after that, the applicants brought a civil action under law 1545 (on compensation for damage caused by illegal acts of the criminal investigation bodies, the prosecution authorities or the courts) seeking compensation in respect of the breach of their rights guaranteed by articles 5 and 11 of the convention in regard to all three street protests of 2008 and 2009.10.  by a final judgment of 6 february 2013 the supreme court of justice acknowledged the breach of the applicnts’ rights guaranteed by articles 5 and 11 of the convention and awarded them the equivalent of 900 and 270 euros (eur), respectively.
according to the applicants’ submissions, which were not contested by the government, at the time of the lodging of the application, they were serving the prison sentences arising out of their criminal convictions which gave rise to the present application.7.  on 17 and 18 june 2005 seventeen members of the maoist communist party (hereinafter “the mkp”), an illegal organisation, were killed in a rural area within the administrative jurisdiction of the town of ovacık, near the city of tunceli, by members of the security forces.the press statement concerned the killings of 17 and 18 june 2005, the arrest of a number of persons subsequent to the reading out of the press statement on 21 june 2005 and the alleged unlawful killing of a detainee by the police.as regards the gathering of 21 june 2005, the assize court found it established that the slogan “martyrs are immortal” had been chanted by mr kürşad arslan, ms dilek kömpe, mr olcay bayraktar and mr ahmet doğan and that the slogans “the murderer state will pay the price”, “revolutionary martyrs are immortal” and “long live revolutionary solidarity” had been chanted by mr yaşar çalışkan, mr kürşad arslan and ms dilek kömpe.in the court’s view, by chanting those slogans the applicants had not intended to find a solution to a problem but had praised and glorified the source of the problem, that is to say, the terrorist organisations concerned.
6.  on 5 october 2004 the applicant was brought before the judge at the ankara assize court who placed him in detention on remand taking into consideration the nature of the offence, the state of evidence and the severity of the envisaged penalty.10.  on 10 november 2009 the 11th chamber of the ankara assize court held a further hearing, in which both the applicant and his lawyer were present.at the end of that hearing, the court ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention.11.  on 10 december 2009 the applicant’s lawyer filed an objection against the decision of 10 november 2009. on 21 december 2009 the 12th chamber of the ankara assize court dismissed this objection without holding a hearing.in delivering its decision, the court took into consideration the written opinion of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative.
6.  on 21 august 2006 the applicants took part in a religious ceremony (mevlüt)[1] on the premises of the altındağ district branch of the party for a democratic society (demokratik toplum partisi – “the dtp”) in ankara, at which they paid tribute to three members of the pkk, an illegal armed organisation, who had been killed by the security forces.7.  on 23 november 2007 the ankara public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the ankara assize court, charging the applicants and a number of other persons with dissemination of propaganda in favour of the pkk, under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no.3713), on account of their participation in the ceremony of 21 august 2006. according to the indictment, during the ceremony photographs of the deceased and the pkk’s flag were displayed at the venue and a film about the lives of the deceased was shown.it also took the view that the choice of venue for the ceremony – the premises of a political party – and the fact that the pkk flag had been spread over the tables and photographs of members of the organisation had been displayed, contributed to raising serious doubts as to the applicants’ submissions that they had taken part in the ceremony in observance of their religious duties.the court considered that the applicants had committed the offence of dissemination of propaganda given that they had shared the feelings of mourning and sorrow for the deceased who had been involved in terrorism.
the court also observed that although during the applicant’s detention no investigative actions had been carried out with regard to the applicant, the records of the pre-trial investigation showed that various investigative actions had been performed in order to establish grounds for the suspicion in respect of the applicant (vehicles had been inspected, a chemical analysis of the substances found during the search of the applicant’s flat had been performed, expert conclusions had been received, and other suspects – who had given testimony about the applicant – had been questioned).in addition, the court held that there were over forty suspects in the case; numerous investigative actions had been performed: suspects had been arrested and questioned; witnesses had been questioned; eyewitnesses had been identified; items relevant for the investigation had been examined; characteristics of the suspects had been collected; and material gathered in the pre-trial investigation had been divided into two parts (and the material gathered in the first part had already been transferred to a court for examination on the merits).30.  on 14 june 2012 the court of appeal upheld the decision of the vilnius regional court of 17 may 2012. the court held that it could not conclude that the proceedings had been protracted because the case had been transferred to the vilnius regional court for examination on the merits and because of that, in the course of criminal proceedings the duration of the applicant’s detention on remand had not been limited.45.  between the transfer of the case to the vilnius regional court for examination on the merits on 1 august 2011 and the decision on 17 february 2014 to impose house arrest on the applicant, a total of sixty‑five hearings were coordinated in advance and scheduled, and nineteen of those hearings were either cancelled or adjourned: (a)  from 1 august 2011 until 26 june 2012 twenty-two hearings were scheduled (one each month from october 2011 until january 2012, three in february 2012, three in march 2012, four in april 2012, three in may 2012 and five in june 2012); four of them were adjourned (one in february 2012, two in april 2012 and one in june 2012) and one was cancelled (in may 2012); (b)  from 12 september 2012 until 7 june 2013 thirty-three hearings were scheduled (three each month from september 2012 to march 2013, six in april 2013, three in may 2013 and three in june 2013); seven of them were adjourned (one in december 2012, one in february 2013, three in march 2013 and two in april 2013), and three of them were cancelled (one in february 2013 and two in april 2013); (c)  from 13 september 2013 until 17 february 2014 ten hearings were scheduled (two each month from september 2013 until november 2013, one in january 2014, and two in february 2014); three of them were adjourned (one in september 2013, one in october 2013, and one in february 2014) and one of them was cancelled (in october 2013).the first‑instance judgment had been delivered on 22 may 2014, and the case had been received at the court of appeal on 10 november 2014. however, at the first hearing on 19 february 2015 the court of appeal had decided to adjourn the case until 7 october 2015. during the hearing on 6 november 2015 the court of appeal had decided to apply to the relevant german authorities to be allowed to question one witness in germany, and the next hearing was scheduled for april 2016. the reply from germany had been received by the court of appeal on 10 february 2016; however, during the hearing on 7 april 2016 the next six scheduled hearings had been cancelled owing to the fact that the lawyers of eleven of the co-accused had been involved in other cases.
the court found that in view of the gravity of the accusations against the applicants, of the fact that the investigation was at its initial stage and of the applicants’ position in the ministry of internal affairs, there was a serious risk of absconding and of interfering with the investigation by influencing witnesses, misleading the investigation and increasing the volume of work.the risk of interference with the investigation was determined by the fact that the investigation had just started and the risk of absconding resulted from the fact that the applicants were police officers and thus knew how the investigating authorities operated.the court of appeal did not answer the applicants’ complaint about the alleged lack of access to the materials in the case-file, relied upon by the first instance court to order their detention.18.  the same day, judge v. of the rîșcani district court extended the applicants’ detention by ninety days considering that the three risks invoked by the public prosecutor resulted from the character of the charges against the applicants.20.  on 20 april 2011 the chișinău court of appeal upheld the decision of the rîșcani district court of 7 april 2011. the court relied on the fact that the applicants were police officers and considered that they could influence the witnesses or destroy evidence.
he further noted, on the basis of video footage provided by the police, that the applicants had carried banners on behalf of the esp (the socialist platform of the oppressed) and the sgd (socialist youth association), which, according to information on the internet, were connected to the mlkp.as to the documents, periodicals, books and cds found in their homes, the applicants maintained that none of the material they had had was illegal, and that they did not accept the content of the search-and-seizure reports prepared after the searches conducted in their homes, as those reports had not been drafted in their presence.on 22 october 2008 the court issued a judgment containing the same conclusions and sentences as in its judgment of 17 january 2007. it also ordered the release of metin kürekçi, necla çomak and alihan alhan, taking into account the period of time that they had spent in detention and the length of the sentences imposed on them.the court found it established, on the basis of the conduct of members of the esp and the sgd and having regard to the documents found in the accused’s homes, that esp and sgd members were carrying out activities in line with the strategies of the mlkp and had been holding legally authorised demonstrations in favour of that organisation on the pretext of exercising their democratic rights.16.  in convicting the applicants, the ankara assize court noted that all the applicants except selçuk mart had participated in the demonstration of 17 december 2005. as regards selçuk mart, the court observed that he had attended the demonstration of 19 february 2006. the court found it established that the applicants had chanted the following slogans during the demonstration held on 17 december 2005: “m-l-k-p”, “yaşasın partimiz mlkp” (“long live our party, mlkp”), “devrimin zaferi, biji mlkp” (“victory to the revolution, long live the mlkp”), “i̇şçiler partiye, mlkp’ye” (“workers join the party, join the mlkp”).
c)  no, at the time of the investigation [the applicant] was not being searched for by the moroccan authorities in the context of a criminal investigation into offences other than those as referred to by question 5a.” 20.  by letter of 12 january 2016, in reply to a request for further clarification, the minister of foreign affairs stated: “there are no indications that [the applicant] is being searched for by the moroccan authorities in the context of the criminal investigation referred to in question 2a of your letter of 15 october 2015. there are also no indications of a charge against [the applicant] or indications that [the applicant] is being searched for by the moroccan authorities in connection with a criminal investigation of facts other than those referred to in question 2a of your letter of 15 october 2015.” 21.  the asylum application was rejected by the deputy minister on 21 july 2016. in addition, an entry ban (inreisverbod) of twenty years was imposed on the applicant, the deputy minister holding that he posed a threat to public safety on account of his criminal conviction and information from the netherlands security service that he posed a danger to national security.although in the case of an asylum application this falls short of due care, the court finds that in this case [the deputy minister] did not have to see reason for not taking into account in the decision making the person-specific official report of the ministry of foreign affairs, as [the deputy minister] has given sufficient reasons for holding that the interests of [the appellant] were not harmed by this failure to exercise due care.finally, it has been included in the person-specific official report that at the time of the investigation [the appellant] was not being searched for by the moroccan authorities in connection with the criminal investigation into the dismantled terror cell, that at the time of the investigation no charge had been brought against [the appellant] and that at the time of the investigation [the appellant] was not being searched for by the moroccan authorities in connection with a criminal investigation into other facts.moreover, it follows from question 5 in the letter from [the deputy minister] to the ministry of foreign affairs of 15 october 2015 that the ministry has been asked both whether [the appellant] is being searched for by the moroccan authorities in connection with the criminal investigation into the arrested terror cell and whether [the appellant] is being searched for by the moroccan authorities in connection with a criminal investigation into other facts.6.5.  the court concludes that it follows from the person-specific official report of the ministry of foreign affairs that [the appellant] is not being searched for by the moroccan authorities in connection with the criminal investigation concerning the dismantled terror cell or other facts and that [the appellant] has not put forward any concrete arguments for [the court] to doubt the correctness of this information.
15.  on 26 september 2006 the diyarbakır assize court held the fourth and the last hearing in the case and convicted the applicant and his co‑accused of membership of an illegal organisation under article 314 § 2 of the criminal code on the basis of articles 220 § 7 and 314 § 3 of the same code, finding it established that the applicant had knowingly and willingly aided the pkk.the judgment of the assize court, insofar as relevant, reads as follows: “in the indictment dated 26 april 2006 it was alleged that abdulcelil i̇mret had committed the following acts: 1.  attendance at the reading out of a press statement and an illegal march held on 19 february 2005 in the mem-u zin park in batman during which the demonstrators chanted slogans in favour of the pkk and abdullah öcalan; 2.  attendance at the event commemorating a deceased pkk member held in the batman cemetery on 31 march 2005, making a speech in kurdish and making participants say prayers in kurdish; 3.  attendance at the reading out of a press statement at the batman branch of dehap on 16 august 2005 regarding the petition campaign entitled “i accept abdullah öcalan as a political actor”; 4.  attendance at the illegal demonstration held on 22 august 2005 to commemorate seven members of the pkk killed by the security forces in an armed clash which had occurred in batman; 5.  attendance at the demonstration organised by dehap and held on 9 november 2005, during which the demonstrators chanted illegal slogans, and making a speech in kurdish addressed to the press and the demonstrators; 6.  attendance at the demonstration held on 16 november 2005 during which the demonstrators chanted slogans in favour of the pkk and abdullah öcalan and carried banners, and making a speech in kurdish addressed to the press and the demonstrators; 7.  attendance at the demonstration held on 30 november 2005 protesting against the attempts to close down roj tv, the alleged solitary confinement of abdullah öcalan and the statement by deniz baykal, the leader of the chp (people’s republican party) regarding the events that had occurred in yüksekova during which the demonstrators chanted slogans in favour of abdullah öcalan, and making a speech in kurdish addressed to the press and the demonstrators; 8.  attendance at the reading out of a press statement and at a march held on 21 december 2005 protesting against the solitary confinement of abdullah öcalan, during which the demonstrators chanted illegal slogans and carried banners, and making a speech in kurdish addressed to the press and the demonstrators; 9.  attendance at the march and the reading out of a press statement held on 8 february 2006 in batman, during which illegal slogans were chanted, and making a speech in kurdish; 10. attendance at the illegal demonstration and the reading out of a press statement held on 16 february 2006 close to the dtp batman branch, during which illegal slogans were chanted and banners were carried, and making a speech in kurdish; ... in his defence submissions abdulcelil i̇mret stated that he had participated in the demonstrations and the reading out of press statements mentioned in the indictment but that he had neither chanted slogans nor carried banners.although the accused submitted that their aim had been to prevent clashes between the demonstrators and the security forces and [that they] had not had the intention of disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk when they had participated in the demonstrations and marches in question, taking into account the content of the case file and their acts during those meetings, their defence submissions have been found to be baseless.as a result of the trial and in the light of the evidence, it has been established that abdulcelil i̇mret worked as the head of the batman branch of dehap and that subsequent to the closure of dehap he was the head of the batman branch of the dtp.taking into account the continuity and nature of their acts, it is considered that those acts went beyond the offence of dissemination of propaganda in favour of a [terrorist] organisation and amounted to the offence proscribed by article 220 § 7 of the criminal code, that is to say, ‘knowingly and willingly aiding an illegal organisation without being in the hierarchical structure’.
3436/15, on 31 october 2013 the levokumskiy district court of the stavropol region found the applicant guilty of three counts of an attempted drug sale “committed with the same intent” on 10 and 17 may and 19 june 2013, as well as declared him guilty of unlawful purchase and storage without an intent to sell of a large quantity of drugs, seized from him on 19 june 2013. the applicant was sentenced to ten years and a month of imprisonment.the conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal by the stavropol regional court on 23 january 2014. in may 2015 the deputy prosecutor of the stavropol region asked the presidium of the regional court to amend the conviction by excluding episodes of 17 may and 19 june 2013 “in view of the lack of a criminal conduct [in the applicant’s actions]” and to uphold the conviction in respect of the episode on 10 may 2013. the deputy prosecutor argued, in particular, that the “operative experiment” in the course of which the applicant had sold drugs on 10 may 2013 had been properly authorised by the acting head of the district police department and had been recorded, and thus there was no need to perform subsequent “operative experiments” in the form of the test purchase on 17 may and 19 june 2013. on 30 june 2015 the presidium of the stavropol regional court accepted the deputy prosecutor’s request for the revision of the final conviction by virtue of article 401 of the russian criminal code, annulled the conviction in respect of the two episodes of drug sale on 17 may and 19 june 2013, declared the applicant guilty of an attempted drug sale on 10 may 2013 and sentenced him to eight years and one month of imprisonment.the presidium of the supreme court of the russian federation revises ...

accordingly, in the light of this new amnesty law, on 10 april 2009 the supreme administrative court decided that there was no need to examine the merits of the case.6.  in the meantime, on 30 september 2005 the criminal proceedings initiated against the applicant had ended with the decision of the criminal court, convicting him of abuse of office.8.  by a decision dated 8 january 2008, the ankara administrative court found in line with the applicant’s claims and decided to annul the decision of the authorities by which they had refused to reinstate the applicant.on 25 may 2009, relying also on the opinion of the chief public prosecutor, the supreme administrative court quashed the decision of 8 january 2008. in particular, the appeal court referred to its previous leading case which had been delivered on 17 october 2008 on a similar case and held that the amnesty law did not put an obligation on the administration to reinstate the applicant.on 9 october 2009 the first instance court adhered to the judgment of the appeal court and dismissed the applicant’s case.

5.  the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.7.  on unspecified date, the applicant requested the general directorate of pension fund (the fund) (“emekli-sandığı”) to modify his retirement statute as service-disabled (“vazife malülü”), but the fund rejected that request.8.  on 9 august 2007 the applicant brought an action before the supreme military administrative court seeking the annulment of the fund’s decision.9.  on 22 may 2008 the supreme military administrative court dismissed the applicant’s request.11.  during the proceedings, namely on 12 may 2008 and 29 july 2008 the public prosecutor at the supreme military administrative court filed lengthy written opinions on the case.
the contents of a computer disk holding detailed information on the applicant’s background, which had been obtained by the security forces in a house belonging to hizbullah, and police statements of four people, all of whom were accused of being members of the same illegal organisation, were read out to him during the questioning.13.  at the hearing on 30 may 2000 the applicant’s lawyers once again challenged the use of the background information obtained from the computer disk, arguing that it was unreliable in that the disk had been de-encrypted and the information extracted in their absence.in that connection, he referred to the statements of a certain n.s., who had maintained before both the police and the public prosecutor that the applicant had been a recruiter for the illegal organisation, had given courses to new members and had been in charge of certain cells.17.  on 18 november 2003 the applicant’s lawyer applied for the expansion of the investigation and the cross-examination of the witnesses who had confirmed the applicant’s membership of hizbullah.21.  at the hearing on 21 february 2006 the assize court read out the police statements of ş.a., in which he had claimed that the applicant had acted as a mentor within the illegal organisation and had given courses to other members, including him, which had ended when the applicant had started his military service.
6.  mr vasilevskiy stayed in detention for longer that he should have because the sentencing courts did not count the time he had spent in pre-trial detention towards the overall duration of his sentence, in breach of the applicable domestic provisions.in response to mr vasilevskiy’s repeated complaints, on 7 may 2007 the belogorskiy district court in the amur region corrected the error and acknowledged that his sentence had expired on 26 february 2006. mr vasilevskiy was released on 13 june 2007. he sought compensation for 472 days during which he had been wrongfully detained.as regards the level of compensation, it held that the town court had “had regard to the case-law of the european court but had correctly determined the amount of compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage in the light of the requirements of russian law”.on 20 march 2013 the supreme court of the russian federation acknowledged, referring to the court’s case-law under article 6 of the convention, that the police had incited mr bogdanov to commit the last three of the four offences.however, on 9 july 2014 the novgorod regional court reduced the award to rub 15,000 (eur 324), referring to the “circumstances in which the criminal proceedings had been instituted” and the “category of offence that mr bogdanov had been charged with”.

and his employer, on 8 march 2006 the court of appeal quashed the lower court’s judgment in so far as it concerned the award made to the applicant, and discontinued the examination of her claim.in addition, even if the running of the limitation period could be considered to have been interrupted by the applicant’s bringing her claim in the context of the criminal proceedings, that interruption had been retroactively invalidated by the court of appeal’s decision of 8 march 2006 finding that the claim was inadmissible and discontinuing the proceedings.19.  the applicant filed an appeal, which was dismissed by a judgment of the sofia city court of 13 march 2009. while it considered the applicant’s claim well-founded in principle, since the tort resulting in the liability of h.h.it pointed out that the applicant’s bringing her claim in the context of the criminal proceedings could only have interrupted the running of the relevant time-limit if the claim had been allowed.the applicant had to bear the adverse consequences of having brought her claim in the context of the criminal proceedings in breach of the rules, and this was so notwithstanding the fact that the claim had been, erroneously, initially accepted for examination by the regional court.

[the expert reports issued on 2 april and 14 may 2012] cannot be used by the court as the basis for conviction as those reports were received in violation of the criminal procedural law as they relate to an examination of the circumstances of the case in light of the provisions of article 282 of the russian criminal code – incitement to hatred, enmity or disparagement, as can be seen from the questions put [to the experts] and the answers given by them.given the lack of a linguistic and psychological analysis of the lyrics of the song performed in christ the saviour cathedral, the experts made an unfounded and poorly reasoned conclusion, which runs counter to the testimony of the eyewitnesses, the victims of the crime, who expressed an extremely negative view of the events in christ the saviour cathedral and of the video-recording.” 51.  on the other hand, the district court found the expert report of 23 may 2012 to be “detailed, well founded and scientifically reasoned”.54.  as regards the punishment to be imposed on the applicants, the district court ruled as follows: “taking into account the gravity and social danger of the offence, the circumstances in which it was committed, the object and reasons for committing the offence, and [the applicants’] attitude towards their acts, the court believes that the goals of punishment, such as the restoration of social justice, the correction of people who have been convicted and the prevention of the commission of new offences, can only be achieved by sentencing them to prison and their serving the sentence ...” 55.  the two-year prison sentence was to be calculated from the date of arrest of each of the applicants, that is from 3, 4 and 15 march 2012 respectively.relying on sections 1, 12 and 13 of the suppression of extremism act and section 10(1) and (6) of the federal law on information, information technologies and the protection of information, the court gave the reasons for its decision and stated as follows: “according to section 1 of [the suppression of extremism act], extremist activity is deemed to be constituted by, inter alia, the stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord; propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion; violations of human and civil rights and freedoms and lawful interests in connection with a person’s social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion; public appeals to carry out the above-mentioned acts or the mass dissemination of knowingly extremist material, and likewise the production or storage thereof with the aim of mass dissemination.
7.  the other two applicants (officers daţco and pohila) went to tiraspol to clarify the reasons for the arrest of their colleagues, but were also arrested upon their arrival.the head of the “mrt” secret service declared in an interview that the officers had been released after russian authorities had “given assurances” that moldovan authorities would not “kidnap people” in the “mrt”.12.  the applicants were accused in the “mrt” media of being members of “black squadrons” created for the purpose of kidnapping politicians and other persons causing nuisance to the moldovan authorities.according to the applicants, during their detention they were questioned by the “mrt” secret service and forced to declare that in tiraspol they had been trying to kidnap “mrt” politicians.officers pohila, daţco and vasiliev were allegedly beaten on the soles of their feet and threatened with the killing of members of their families, as well as with being transferred to cells occupied by common criminals, where they would be ill-treated or even killed.

9.  at an early stage of the investigation investigators inspected the crime scene, collected footage from surveillance cameras located in the vicinity, and examined logs of telephone connections made in the area around the time of the killing.in the government’s submission, as a result of such actions, the investigation established that anna politkovskaya had met “a well-known russian former politician” in london, and that unnamed person had proposed that she publish articles “to discredit the leadership of the russian state, which she [had] refused to do, to his dislike”.19.  in the course of court hearings in the period 2008-09 d.p., a high‑ranking officer of the moscow city department of the interior, was questioned as a witness for the prosecution.23.  on 25 june 2009, in the appeal proceedings, the supreme court of russia quashed the judgment of 20 february 2009 and remitted the case to the circuit court for fresh examination.on the basis of the jury’s guilty verdict, the city court characterised the murder as one committed by an organised group for a fee in connection with the victim’s performance of her professional and civic duties.
148. the first applicant has never asked for a transfer because, although there were prospects that he would be transferred to a division with an automated flushing system, this would also have meant that he would lose his individual cell and be placed in a dormitory, to the detriment of his privacy.in the summer, when the temperature ranges between 35 and 40 degrees celsius, the two fans purchased by the first applicant do not suffice as they merely circulate hot air, which is made worse in the absence of proper ventilation.the government submitted that the first applicant received eur 34.77 every four weeks in so‑called “gratuity” remuneration and from the “work and pay” scheme, with which he had been involved since 2015. they stated that at the tuck shop a six‑pack of water cost eur 2.24 and an individual bottle eur 0.38.12.  according to the government, following communication of the complaint, the second applicant was asked whether he wanted to be transferred to another division and replied in the negative.16.  the second applicant also submitted that because of the humidity in his cell and the fact that he does not have a heater, he frequently catches the flu during the winter months.
9.  after that an expert prepared a valuation of the nationalised property, which was confirmed by the minister of education on 5 june 2003. it stated that the first and second applicants and their mother were entitled to compensation for 57,932 bulgarian levs (bgn, equivalent of 29,630 euros (eur)), which equalled 579 shares in ‘obrazovanie i nauka’ ead, each with a face value of bgn 100 (eur 51).in another letter dated 30 august 2006 the parliamentary committee on petitions informed the applicants and their mother that it had urged the minister of education to find a solution, pointing out that with the enactment of the compensation act parliament had sought “to restore historical justice”.the last of them, stating that the third applicant, her mother and her sister were entitled to compensation for bgn 26,309 (the equivalent of eur 13,460), equalling 263 shares in ‘obrazovanie i nauka’ ead, each with a face value of bgn 100, was confirmed by the minister of education on 6 june 2003.as in the procedure described above concerning the first and second applicants, he relied on the fact that the company had been included in the list under section 11 of the concluding provisions of the privatisation act (see paragraph 24 below).in a judgment of 27 january 2015 the supreme administrative court dismissed their application, noting that they were not shareholders in the company, since the compensation procedures had not been completed with the actual transfer of shares to them in accordance with the law.
submitted half a year ago, in which he specified that he possessed shares valued at eur 300,000. sdsm ask(s) whether m. obtained any of that property during the nine months he has been in office, without submitting a declaration, and whether that was the reason for his failing to submit the declaration within the first nine months of his mandate’ the recording continues with a photograph of [the applicant] at a stand in front of the sdms logo and states that [statement described in paragraph 7 above] ... the video material continues with a commentary by the journalist stating that: ‘s.m.the relevant parts of the judgment read as follows: “... the accused is the vice-president of sdsm ... ... [the applicant] said [the words described in paragraph 7 above] from a podium which had the sdms logo behind it ... ... a statement ... must contain certain facts and ... be false ... the fact of that which ... is expressed or disseminated being false constitutes the core of the criminal offence of libel.the court further held that: “the way in which [the applicant] expressed his opinion (мислење) in public concerning the performance of public duties by a public official (in an interrogatory form, as a member of an opposition political party, from a political party’s podium (говорница), the consequences of his public action ...), without trying to prove the veracity of his question or statement, taken as a whole, represents an action which only appears to fall within the ambit of the freedom of conviction, conscience, thought and public expression of thought, but in substance it affects the reputation and dignity of the citizen who holds that public office at the time and violates those values.the freedom of political debate is not of an absolute nature ... the court notes that the impugned statement concerns the public sale of state-owned building land ... and should be considered in the context of a debate concerning an issue of public interest, which in particular was of prime political interest ... the court considers that the veracity of the statement ... was of primary importance for the courts.despite the fact that the statement is part of a public debate, the question is whether (it) ... had any impact or was relevant for the public as a contribution to a better understanding of the issue subject to public debate ... the way in which the (applicant) expressed his opinion (мислење) in public concerning the performance of a public office by a public official (in an interrogatory form, as a member of an opposition party, from the podium (говорница) of the political party, the consequences of his public action ...) without trying to prove the veracity of his question or statement, taken as a whole, represents an action which only appears to fall within the ambit of the freedom of conviction, conscience, thought and public expression of thought, but in substance it affects the reputation and dignity of the citizen who holds the public office at the time and violates those values.
6.  on 17 october 2000 the medical commission for the assessment of health and fitness for work (veselības un darbspēju ekspertīzes ārstu komisija) granted the applicant a disability status of category 3 (the least severe level of disability) on the grounds of a visual impairment.8.  on 9 november 2001 this decision was upheld by the state medical commission for the assessment of health and fitness for work (veselības un darbspēju ekspertīzes ārstu valsts komisija, hereinafter ‑ the commission) and on 5 december 2001 by an extended composition of that commission.12.  on 9 january 2006 the applicant brought a claim to the administrative district court challenging the commission’s decision and requesting to be granted the status of a disabled person from 16 october 2001.14.  the administrative cases division of the supreme court two times quashed the judgments of the regional administrative court for its failure to follow the interpretation of the domestic law given by the supreme court.15.  on 24 november 2010 the regional administrative court declined the applicant’s claim, and on 14 march 2011 the administrative cases division of the supreme court refused to institute cassation proceedings.
he noted that despite the closure of the investigation, the family’s resistance to allow an exhumation of the body to determine the precise cause of death, and the inability to establish criminal responsibility on the part of the doctors in question, the conclusion of the panel of experts that a medical error had been committed in the course of g.b.’s treatment called for “the implementation of adequate measures to prevent similar violations.” 20.  on 27 september 2004, referring to the findings of the prosecutor and the panel of experts in report no.it noted as follows: “based on an analysis of the evidence before it, the appellate court concludes that in the course of mr g.b.’s treatment in [the hospital] the medical negligence of the medical staff (insufficient attention towards the patient, misdiagnosis) caused harm to a person’s health and eventually caused the patient’s ... death.” 33.  the appellate court continued to note that: “in addition to establishing that harm was caused to a person’s health as a result of the medical negligence of the [hospital] staff, it can also be established from the case files that [the hospital] was carrying out unlicensed activities in a number of medical fields and at the same time some of the medical staff did not have authorisation to practise medicine independently, in violation of the requirements of the [relevant legislation]...” 34.  the kutaisi court of appeal further found the hospital to be the only appropriate respondent to pay the damages in respect of the medical negligence of the doctors.as regards who should be held responsible for the hospital and its doctors operating without the necessary licences, it was noted that: “the ministry of health of the aar cannot be held responsible in the present case ... for [the hospital] operating in certain medical fields without the requisite licences considering that, in accordance with section 54 of the health care act, the issuance of such licences is [the exclusive competence] of the ministry of health of georgia.referring to the evidence available in the case files, the court found that despite the fact that the exact cause of death could not be determined without an exhumation of the body, the case files confirmed that gastroduodenal bleeding was the cause of death and that a medical error had been committed in terms of the surgery and an incorrect assessment of the various data.the civil code does not define moral (non-pecuniary) damage... under article 413 of the civil code, not all types of moral harm (mental suffering) shall be compensated, even if there is no doubt as to its existence, only those for which compensation is expressly provided for by law... accordingly, in accordance with the practice of the supreme court of georgia, non-pecuniary damage resulting from the infringement of the right to life of a person’s husband, child or other relative shall not be compensated as it is not expressly provided for by law...” 42.  the supreme court disagreed with the lower court’s interpretation that the right to claim non-pecuniary damages under section 10(a) of the patient rights act also applied to the death of a relative, and noted that that right was strictly personal.
the likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences in question was established, in particular, on the basis of the testimony of a key prosecution witness (the so-called “crown witness”).10.  the bill of indictment against the applicant was lodged with the warsaw regional court on 30 december 2013. the applicant was charged with ten offences committed in an organised criminal group and – in the case of some of the offences – as a re-offender.11.  subsequently, the applicant’s detention pending trial was extended by the warsaw regional court’s decisions of 10 january and 7 may 2014 and by the warsaw court of appeal’s decisions of 30 december 2014, 28 april, 27 august and 26 november 2015, and of 25 february and 25 may 2016. the domestic courts continued to rely on the same grounds for detention as in their previous decisions.they also stressed the complexity of the case and the links between the co-accused within an organised criminal group which, according to the domestic courts, justified a suspicion that, if released, they would attempt to obstruct the proper course of the proceedings.it underlined that the amount of bail had to take into consideration not only the financial situation of the applicant, but also the gravity of the charges against him.
two similar round-shaped ecchymoses are present on the inner surface of the same area measuring 1 cm in diameter: on the mid-third of the inner left upper arm measuring 1 cm in diameter; on the lower third of the inner left upper arm measuring 2 x 1 cm and 1.5 x 1.2 cm and on the mid-third of the outer left forearm measuring 2.5 x 1.5 cm.conclusion: [the applicant’s] bodily injuries in the form of ecchymoses [around] the right and left upper arms and the left forearm have been inflicted with blunt, hard objects possibly in the period mentioned; [the injuries] taken separately as well as all together do not contain elements of [short-term] damage to health.” 15.  on 24 january 2012 the investigator took an additional statement from the applicant.in addition, the applicant stated that the incident had taken place in the workplace and naturally all the witnesses questioned by the investigator were the subordinates of h.a.as regards the applicant, the decision stated, inter alia, that because the stress she had suffered as a result of the incident in h.a.’s office she had perceived and described what had happened in a subjective manner.she argued that the decisions of the district court and the criminal court of appeal had failed to explain the existence of injuries on her body or the fact that h.a.
11.  according to the report produced and signed by the two police officers on the same date, they seized 8,943 euros (eur), the amount paid in income tax by the private party selling the immovable property, and eur 1,000 and 12,215 romanian lei (ron – approximately eur 3,470), representing public notary fees and the applicable tax for the registration of the sale in the immovable property register.21.  the court furthermore held that the police officers who had asked the employees of the applicant organisation to give statements had not breached the relevant domestic rules concerning professional secrecy because the information provided by the said employees with regard to the commission of an offence had not amounted to them being formally heard as witnesses in the case.22.  the court concluded that the applicant organisation was mainly unhappy with the fact that the sale contract and the public notaries’ professional fees seized by the police officers had been returned to the alleged victims of the offence and not to the organisation.it asked the prosecutor’s office to quash the acts and measures taken by the police officers and to order the return of the original documents produced by the applicant organisation and of the relevant fees and taxes seized by the police officers.in addition, it dismissed the applicant organisation’s requests for the return of the original documents produced by it and the relevant fees and taxes on the grounds that the documents in question had been annulled and the relevant fees and taxes returned to the private party who had sold the property and who had been the victim of the offences committed by the criminal group.
9.  on 13 july 2009 the local police examined the applicant’s complaint concerning threats which o. regularly made when the applicant went to see the child, as well as o.’s refusal to let the child stay overnight with him and her restriction on the amount of time which the applicant could spend with the child.11.  on 20 october 2009, at the applicant’s request, the mykolayiv state bailiffs’ service opened proceedings for the enforcement of the judgment of 4 june 2009. however, on 22 october 2009 the bailiffs’ decision was quashed since the procedure for enforcement of a court judgment of that kind was not specified by law.on 9 april 2012 in the presence of the applicant, o. and two witnesses, the state bailiff read out the operative part of the judgment of 4 june 2009 and issued a resolution on termination of the enforcement proceedings, considering that the judgment had been fully enforced by so doing.17.  on 21 june 2013 the leninskyy dstrict police department in mykolayiv opened criminal proceedings following the applicant’s complaint that o. had refused to comply with the judgment of 4 june 2009. on 10 december 2014 the police terminated the criminal proceedings because of the absence of the constituent elements of a criminal offence.the court also stated that the applicant had not substantiated the allegation that the child’s life was in danger and the mere fact of anti-terrorist military operations taking place in the region did not prove that risk.
6.  on 10 november 2005 the supreme court of the tatarstan republic convicted the applicant and sentenced him to imprisonment.the applicant never received any summons to the appeal hearing due to the supreme court’s mistake in the postal code.neither did he receive copies of the statements of appeal filed by the prosecutor, by the co-accused, g., and the latter’s lawyer.in the text of his claim the applicant explicitly asked the court to consider the claim in his absence.the applicant received the notification of the time and date of the hearing after the hearing had actually taken place.
6.  in early august 2009 preliminary proceedings were initiated against the applicant based on the suspicion that he had committed violent acts against his spouse, r.k. on 6 august 2009 r.k. was examined at the request of the public prosecutor’s office by the investigating judge, w., after the latter had decided, at the suggestion of the public prosecutor’s office, to exclude the applicant from the hearing under article 168c § 3 of the code of criminal procedure, since there was a risk, given the nature of the reported offences, that r.k. would not testify or would not tell the truth in the applicant’s presence.10.  at the hearing of 28 may 2010, the investigating judge was examined on the evidence he had obtained from his examination of r.k. on 6 august 2009. the regional court rejected an objection by the applicant’s counsel on the grounds that it was permissible to examine the investigating judge even if the applicant’s rights under article 6 § 3 (d) of the convention had been breached by r.k.’s examination.where the lack of an opportunity to cross-examine a witness had been a result of procedural errors imputable on the judiciary, as in the present case, the court found a breach of the convention where the conviction had been based to a decisive extent on the evidence of the untested witness.32.  moreover, witness n. of the women’s shelter in which r.k. had sought refuge had, on the day of r.k.’s admission to the shelter, observed wounds in the head area, some of which had been bleeding, and burn marks on r.k.’s left breast and neck as well as various bruises and weals on her back which r.k. had shown her.other witnesses reported that r.k. had run into the street in panic that day, with a bleeding wound on the back of her head, and had subsequently sought refuge with the m. family until the police had arrived, while the applicant had been seen leaving the house and driving off following that (see paragraphs 24-27 above).
in view of the above, and concluding that the applicant had been duly summoned to the hearing in accordance with articles 70 to 73 of the ccp, the judge issued, in accordance with article 229 § 1 of the ccp (see paragraph 20 below), a default judgment rejecting the applicant’s action without examining it or giving any reasons.11.  the applicant’s lawyer filed an application to set aside the judgment, enclosing a letter from the supreme court dated 5 february 2004 confirming that he had participated in the hearing of an appeal on points of law at 3 p.m. on 28 january 2004. he argued that his involvement in the examination of another case was a “valid reason” for his absence (see articles 233 and 241 of the ccp as cited in paragraph 20 below).13.  the applicant appealed against the decision of 19 march 2004. on 16 july 2004 the tbilisi regional court (“the regional court”) found that, in breach of article 72(z) of the ccp, the applicant and his lawyer had not been properly warned of the consequences of not appearing before the court.therefore, as the caution provided for in articles 70 to 78 had not been issued in the present case, the regional court held that there were grounds, under articles 233 and 241 of the ccp, for setting aside the decision of 19 march 2004. the applicant’s appeal was thus remitted to the district court for re-examination.the supreme court also found that, according to the record of the hearing of 28 january 2004, the judge had warned the applicant that “in the event of a refusal to take part in the hearing, a decision [would] be given in absentia”.
she submitted, inter alia, that the child had no knowledge of the applicant’s claims, that the latter could not prove his fatherhood in the absence of a legal basis and that the child’s legal parents had not submitted any proof of their allegations that the mother’s husband was also the child’s biological father.the court of appeal then addressed the question of whether article 1685 § 2 of the civil code could be interpreted, in the light of the court’s judgments anayo and schneider (cited above), as assuming that a father who was able to prove that he had seriously tried to bear actual responsibility but failed to do so because of the mother’s or legal parent’s resistance, could be considered as having borne actual responsibility within the meaning of this article.due to the highly emotional conflicts between the legal parents and the applicant, and the fact that the applicant had not ruled out that he might tell the child that he was her biological father if he saw her, contact would jeopardise the child’s well-being.whether the provision can be interpreted in the light of the above mentioned decisions of the european court of human rights, as assuming that a biological father can also claim a right for information, can be left open: that would require addressing the preliminary issue of whether the applicant was the child’s biological father.28.  on 18 july 2013 the federal constitutional court informed the applicant that on 13 july 2013, the law for the strengthening of the rights of biological but not legal fathers had entered into force which, pursuant to article 1686a of the civil code, provided a new possibility for biological fathers to be granted contact and information rights even if they had no social and family relationship with the child (see paragraph 32 below).
8.  on 24 april 2009 the hamburg regional court withdrew the authorisation of mr arif to act as defence counsel, while at the same time rejecting the application lodged by mr arif for the applicant to be released from the obligation to appear in person at the appeal hearing.9.  also on 24 april 2009 the regional court fixed the date for the oral hearing of the applicant’s appeal to 9.10 a.m. on 13 may 2009. it decided to serve the summons on the applicant via public notification because the applicant had moved abroad.10.  on 12 may 2009 mr arif learned by telephone of the court of appeal’s decision of that same day to overturn the regional court’s decision in respect of his authorisation to act as counsel for the applicant and of the appeal hearing having been scheduled for the next morning.moreover, the applicant had not convincingly shown that he had been prevented through no fault of his own from appearing at the appeal hearing, as required by article 44 § 1 of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 19 below), because the applicant’s lawyer had not provided an affidavit to support his claim that he had advised the applicant, on 12 may 2009, that the latter did not need to attend the hearing because he had not been summoned.14.  on 16 july 2010 the court of appeal rejected an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant against the regional court’s judgment of 13 may 2009 as ill-founded, finding that the review of the regional court’s judgment had not revealed any legal errors that had been detrimental to the applicant.
only in his request for the protection of legality, lodged in his own language, and in his constitutional complaint, did the applicant complain of a breach of his right under article 62 of the constitution owing to the conduct of the district court, which had ignored his remarks about his trouble understanding russian ... having regard to the foregoing and to the content of the constitutional complaint, the constitutional court examined whether the supreme court’s view ... violated the applicant’s right to use his own language provided for in article 62 of the constitution and whether there had been a breach of his defence rights under the first line of article 29 of the constitution.in the reasoning of the judgment [the supreme court] noted that there was no indication in the record of the hearing that the applicant had mentioned that he had not understood russian or that he or his counsel had requested the use of the applicant’s native language at the hearing.48.  the relevant provisions of the constitution of the republic of slovenia read as follows: article 29 (legal safeguards in criminal proceedings) “anyone charged with a criminal offence must, in addition to absolute equality, be guaranteed the following rights: the right to have adequate time and facilities to prepare his defence; the right to be present at his trial and to conduct his own defence or to be defended by a legal representative; the right to present all the evidence that is to his benefit; the right not to incriminate himself or his relatives or those close to him, or to admit his guilt.” article 62 (right to use one’s own language and script) “everyone has the right to use his own language and script as provided by law in the exercise of his rights and duties and in procedures before state and other authorities performing a public function.” 49.  the relevant provisions of the criminal procedure act (official gazette no.(3) translations shall be done by a court interpreter.” (b)  grounds of appeal 50.  the relevant provision of the criminal procedure act concerning grounds of appeal reads as follows: section 371 “(1) a material breach of the provisions of criminal procedure shall be deemed to exist: ... 3) ... where the defendant, counsel, the injured party acting as prosecutor or the private prosecutor was, notwithstanding his request, deprived of his right to use his own language during investigative or other court actions or at the main hearing and his right to follow the proceedings in that language (section 8) ...; ... (2) a material breach of the provisions of criminal procedure shall also be deemed to exist if in preparation for a hearing or in the course of a hearing or in giving judgment the court omitted to apply a provision of this act or applied it incorrectly, or if in the course of the hearing the court violated the rights of the defence, such that the act or omission influenced or might have influenced the legality and regularity of the judgment.” 51.  the charter of fundamental rights of the european union (“the charter”) enshrines the right to a fair trial (article 47) and respect for the rights of the defence (article 48(2)).member states shall take concrete measures to ensure that the interpretation and translation provided meets the quality required under article 2(8) and article 3(9).” 57.  furthermore, article 7 of directive 2010/64/eu reads: record-keeping “member states shall ensure that when a suspected or accused person has been subject to questioning or hearings by an investigative or judicial authority with the assistance of an interpreter pursuant to article 2, when an oral translation or oral summary of essential documents has been provided in the presence of such an authority pursuant to article 3(7), or when a person has waived the right to translation pursuant to article 3(8), it will be noted that these events have occurred, using the recording procedure in accordance with the law of the member state concerned.” 58.  on 22 may 2012 the european parliament and the council of the european union adopted another directive relating to the measures set out in the roadmap, namely directive 2012/13/eu on the right to information in criminal proceedings (“directive 2012/13/eu”).
(3)  no appeal lies against a court decision making a reference for a preliminary ruling or dismissing a request for a reference for a preliminary ruling.” article 272 “(2)  the petition for review shall specify the decision that is the subject thereof and the substance of the decision requested; furthermore, it shall set out the alleged infringement, specify the legal provision that has been breached and explain the reasons why the impugned decision requires modification.” article 275 “(2)  the kúria may review a final decision only within the framework of the petition for review ... unless it decides to dismiss the action of its own motion, or if the court that rendered the decision had not been properly formed, or if a judge who should have been disqualified by law took part in rendering the decision.” 29.  in leading case no.in such cases, the level of protection to be afforded by the constitutional court to the fundamental right should in no way be lower than the level of international protection afforded to the given right (typically by the european court of human rights in strasbourg)” ... based on this consideration, the constitutional court has reviewed the case-law of the [european] court [of human rights] on the right to a reasoned court decision, which it also finds applicable in interpreting the right enshrined in article xxviii (1) of the fundamental law.the constitutional violation of the duty to give reasons means the application of this procedural rule is not in conformity with the fundamental law ... the constitutional requirement of a fair trial demands, as a minimum, that the courts should, with due care, examine the parties’ observations made on the relevant parts of the case and should include an assessment of those observations in their decisions ... ... [40]  in the light of the above considerations, the constitutional court finds, on the merits, that the high court ... examined the questions ... concerning the relevant circumstances of the case and gave appropriate reasons as regards its conclusions.38.  the relevant part of article 267 of the tfeu[1] provides: “the [cjeu] shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning: (a) the interpretation of the treaties; (b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the union; where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a member state, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the court to give a ruling thereon.in providing that a request for a preliminary ruling may be submitted to the [cjeu] where ‘a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a member state’, the second and third paragraphs of article 267 tfeu are not intended to restrict this procedure exclusively to cases where one or other of the parties to the main action has taken the initiative of raising a point concerning the interpretation or the validity of european union law, but also extend to cases where a question of this kind is raised by the court or tribunal itself, which considers that a decision thereon by the [cjeu] is ‘necessary to enable it to give judgment’ ... 24.  moreover, according to settled case-law, in proceedings under article 267 tfeu, it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine in the light of the particular circumstances of the case both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the court.” the cjeu further held, in the case of lucio cesare aquino v. belgische staat (c-3/16, judgment of 15 march 2017, § 43), that: “[i]t follows from the relationship between the second and third paragraphs of article 267 tfeu that the courts referred to in the third paragraph have the same discretion as all other national courts as to whether a decision on a question of eu law is necessary to enable them to give judgment.” 42.  article 94(6) of the regulation 1408/71/eec of the council of the european communities on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the community, as in force until 1 may 2010, provided as follows: “if an application referred to in paragraph 4 or 5 [in particular, an application for the review of a pension awarded prior to the entry into force of this regulation] is submitted within two years from the date of entry into force of this regulation, the rights acquired under this regulation shall have effect from that date, and the provisions of the legislation of any member state concerning the forfeiture or limitation of rights may not be invoked against the persons concerned.” it appears that the interpretation of that provision has so far not been the subject of a preliminary ruling of the cjeu.
11.  on 27 december 2005 the stara pazova municipal court issued an interim contact order giving the applicant contact with the children every other weekend from 6 p.m. on friday to 6 p.m. on sunday and during the first half of the summer and winter school holidays.14.  on 17 october 2011 the sremska mitrovica basic court stara pazova judicial unit (the stara pazova municipal court having ceased to exist following the 2010 judicial reform – hereinafter “the sremska mitrovica basic court”) revoked the interim contact order of 27 december 2005 given that the custody proceedings had terminated on 11 december 2008. the applicant was ordered to pay 30,625 dinars (approximately 257 euros (eur)) to m.k.28.  on 3 february 2009 the stara pazova municipal court decided to obtain an opinion and recommendation from the social care centre concerning the continuation of the enforcement proceedings and the possible harm it might have on the children’s development.refused to see his father, the court considered that it was in everyone’s interests to realise the contact gradually with the assistance of the social care centre until the conditions for uninterrupted enforcement of the contact order were created.44.  on 24 december 2015 the stara pazova basic court (which had been re-established and renamed in the 2014 judicial reform; see paragraph 14 above), at m.k.’s request, ordered enforcement of the decision of 15 november 2011. in addition to the legal costs ordered by that decision, the applicant was ordered to pay enforcement costs of 10,225 dinars (approximately eur 85), to be deducted from his disability pension.
19.  on 14 january 2005 the investigators again questioned mr a., whose statement concerning the abduction was similar to the statement given on 29 december 2004. in addition, he stated that mr b.p., who had been on duty at the traffic police checkpoint, had told him that the abductors had introduced themselves as officers from the organised crime unit and that two traffic police officers from makhachkala had been with them.25.  on 28 march 2005 the investigators questioned a police officer, a.kh., who stated that at about 6 p.m. on 23 december 2004 he had been on duty at the “mars-20” traffic checkpoint when two traffic police officers in a red and white police vaz 2107 car with the beacon light (that is to say flashing roof lights) and the blue registration plate of the makhachkala traffic police department had arrived at the checkpoint.mr b.p., who is a traffic police officer, claimed that at about 6.30 p.m. on 23 december 2004 amirkhan alikhanov had been detained by servicemen of the organised crime unit at the “mars-20” traffic checkpoint and taken in the direction of makhachkala, while the police officers of the traffic police unit from makhachkala had taken away his vaz 2108 car ... however, senior officials of the organised crime unit and of the makhachkala department of the interior denied that amirkhan alikhanov had been taken to their [respective] premises.one of the traffic police officers from makhachkala followed them in amirkhan alikhanov’s car ... on 29 march 2005 the brother of the abducted person, mr a., informed the investigators that he had received a phone call from a man who had seen a television programme about a special operation conducted by the federal forces in the nozhay‑yurt district [in the chechen republic], during which six persons had been killed and that two of the six bodies had been identified by relatives ... .according to the information provided by the military prosecutor’s office of the uga, the six corpses ... had belonged to members of illegal armed groups eliminated during clashes with the federal forces between 25 and 26 january 2005 ... in order to verify the identity of one of those corpses as that of amirkhan alikhanov, the military prosecutor’s office is carrying out an additional check into the matter ... .” 62.  on 8 june 2009 the investigation of the criminal case was resumed.
15.  the applicants appealed against the judgment to the administrative court of appeal which, on 6 august 2009, struck the case out since, in the meantime, the children had been taken into public care (see paragraph 20 below) and the immediate public care order thereby had lapsed.lastly, the court noted that both of the applicants had declared that they were willing to receive help from the social council while, at the same time, they had refuted the accuracy of the investigation and claimed that the information was fabricated or much exaggerated.however, the court observed that the applicants still denied that they had failed in the care of their children and it found that they continued to lack understanding of the children’s problems and their own ability to meet the children’s special needs.on the basis of the investigation the court found that if the applicants were granted contact rights to visit the children, there was a real risk that the second applicant, in particular, would intervene in the public care of the children.in the present case, the court considered that the only way to find suitable solutions to avoid the risks involved in contact rights between the applicants and the children was for the social council to plan the visits carefully together with the applicants and for the applicants to be willing to receive the help and support that they needed.
the press release mentioned, in particular, that the newspaper in question had published a large amount of material in the context of the election campaign, and that it was in opposition to the current authorities of the komi republic, as it actively supported a well-known local politician who had a long-standing conflict with those authorities.some of the witnesses stated that they had seen the applicant’s comment in mr b.s.’s blog, whereas others stated that they had only become aware of the comment or read it after the criminal proceedings had been instituted against the applicant and his case had attracted the attention of the mass media.22.  the court stated, in particular, that the applicant, acting out of his personal aversion towards police officers, “[had] decided to influence the public with the aims of inciting them to commit violent actions against police officers, of instilling the public with the resolve and aspiration to commit unlawful actions in respect of [the police officers]”.it also noted that the applicant “[had been] aware of the illegal nature of his actions when he [had] published his text aimed at inciting enmity and hatred, imbued with hostility, hatred and humiliation of the dignity of the police officers of russia... on a more popular internet blog than his own ... and thus [he had] made it accessible to a larger readership” and that “... access to the text [had been] unrestricted and it [had] remained accessible ... for approximately one month ...” 23.  the town court went on to note that the impugned text had been generalised and impersonal and had drawn no distinctions on any grounds; the word “cop” had been used with a negative and insulting meaning.26.  lastly, the court considered that “the crime committed by [the applicant was] particularly blatant and dangerous for national security [as] it [ran] against the fundamentals of the constitutional system and state security”, with the result that a sentence involving the deprivation of liberty should be imposed on the applicant.
9.  not being suspected of having taken part in the street mugging, v. could not refuse to give evidence about it; he made a statement to the effect that he had not personally witnessed the robbery but had heard from bystanders that it had been committed by a group that did not include the applicant.it sentenced the applicant to six years’ imprisonment and, as the regional court had done, ordered the execution of the two-week suspended sentence of juvenile detention.15.  the evidence on which the conviction of the fourth charge was based may be summarised as follows: (a) the supermarket manager’s report to the police that his supermarket had been robbed; (b) a statement made to the police by a cashier who had been forced at gunpoint to open her cash register, from which one of the robbers had snatched money and other goods; (c) v.’s confession to the police, in which the applicant was named as co-perpetrator.as relevant to the case before the court, he complained under article 6 § 3 (d) of the convention of the use made by the court of appeal of v.’s statements to the police to ground his convictions even though v. had refused to answer the questions of the defence under cross-examination.17.  the advocate general (advocaat-generaal) submitted an advisory opinion (conclusie) analysing the case-law of the court, in particular the chamber judgment al-khawaja and tahery v. the united kingdom, nos.
pursuant to articles 123, 156 and 266 of the ccomp [code of commercial procedure] the case is being examined in his absence ... this decision ... may be challenged by way of a cassation appeal before the commercial court of the central circuit within two months ...” 26.  according to the government, the correspondence enclosing the appeal decision was dispatched to the applicant but was then returned to the court undelivered.it is noted, however, that the statement of cassation appeal in respect of the appeal decision of 12 march 2015 was dispatched to the first-instance court on 8 july 2015 – that is to say after the expiry of the relevant period ... the case file contains no indisputable proof that the impugned court decision was in a timely manner dispatched to and received by [the applicant].thus, the cassation appeal has been examined in their absence ... having examined the case file and having examined the arguments raised in the cassation appeal and observations in reply, the cassation court finds no grounds for granting the cassation appeal ... this court dismissed the cassation appeal in the part concerning the alleged non‑notification of the appeal hearing.... where a case file contains a document concerning the handing over (о вручении) of the first judicial act to the person or information relating to article 123 § 4, this person is deemed to have been duly notified of appeal, cassation or supervisory review proceedings ... , provided that the relevant court fulfils its obligations relating to the posting of information regarding dates and places of hearings on the official internet site ... pursuant to article 9 § 1 and article 41 §§ 2 and 3 of the ccomp, participants in commercial-court proceedings bear the risk of adverse consequences that may arise from their taking a certain procedural action or from omitting to take it; they use their procedural rights in good faith and fulfil their procedural obligations ... failure to comply with such obligations entail the consequences prescribed by the ccomp ... the decisions to initiate a case and to start the examination of the case were dispatched to [the applicant], as required by the law, but he evaded (уклонился) receipt of the court notifications.given the above-mentioned legal provisions and the presumption of good-faith conduct on the part of the participants in a commercial case, this court concludes that [the applicant] should have been aware of the time and place of the appeal hearing and could have accessed the relevant information on the processing of the case via accessible official sources ... this decision may be challenged before the supreme court of russia within two months of the adoption of this decision, as prescribed by article 291.1 of the ccomp.” 31.  in his cassation appeal before the supreme court of russia the applicant mentioned, inter alia, the following information: “as can be seen from a certificate on registered mail postal dispatches (i have received this certificate on 25 july 2015; see its original enclosed herewith) the decision of 12 august 2014 ... was dispatched on 13 august to the following address [the applicant’s registered residence address].
he had proclaimed that the truth was to be found through dialogue and had spoken against hatred and all forms of compulsion; -  a letter from the ministry of justice of the arab republic of egypt and the mufti of egypt, submitting that said nursi’s texts were beneficial to the reader as they taught love of god and high moral values, and condemned envy, hatred, anger and resentment; -  a letter from the director general of the research centre for islamic history, art and culture of the organisation of islamic conference, stating that said nursi’s texts promoted love of god, the importance of prayer and high moral values.possible aberrant perceptions of the textual material by emotionally unstable or easily suggestible people cannot be evaluated in the framework of the present review, as they would require an evaluation of the readers rather than of the text itself ... the book does not contain any statements, appeals or declarations which could be definitely interpreted as incitement of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord associated with violence or as calls to violence ... the book does not contain any ideas which could be definitely interpreted as propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion or their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation ... the book does not contain any statements which could be definitely interpreted as statements aiming to humiliate persons on the basis of their sex, race, ethnic origin, native language, origin, attitude to religion, affiliation to a social group or on any other basis ... from a scientific point of view, the book is not different from any other religious text; it does not substantiate, justify or advocate the idea that people have an exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency on the basis of their religious affiliation or attitude to religion ... islam, like any other religion as well as atheism, is characterised by a psychologically based belief in the superiority of its world-view over all other world‑views, which made it necessary to substantiate the choice of that world-view ...” 33.  at the hearing the applicant organisation requested the district court to secure the attendance and in-court examination of the moscow state university experts to clarify several of their findings which could be considered ambiguous.after summarising the applicable domestic law and the submissions by the parties, it held as follows: “according to the specialists’ report of 24 december 2008 by the astafyev krasnoyarsk state pedagogical university, [the specialists] read the book ‘the tenth word: the resurrection and the hereafter’ from the risale-i nur collection by bediüzzaman said nursi ... having analysed the textual content of the book, its syntax structures, the genre characteristics and the methods of structuring the text and expressions, the panel of specialists came to an unanimous finding that, as a whole, the book ‘the tenth word: the resurrection and the hereafter’ from the risale-i nur collection by bediüzzaman said nursi is ideological, and at the same time religious, literature inciting religious discord and containing propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion.the structure of the book is such that in the subsequent text the idea of the necessity to fight, of being ready for a fight, is, on the one hand, attenuated as it is not expressed directly; on the other hand, having been already stated earlier, it may be reinforced in the readers’ minds because the text inspires the idea that non-believers commit a crime consisting in the very fact of not believing and which, according to the text under review, does not merit forgiveness.to sum up, in the opinion of the panel of specialists, the psychological characteristics of the potential addressees (readers) mentioned above are not essential for understanding the text of the book because the text itself, by its specific structure and its [psychological] methods of holding attention and suggestion, is capable, after a long reading, to transmit the advocated religious ideology to any person who is in search of ideological support for his life, who is inclined to reflection and is in the process of self-development.” 36.  the court considered the findings of the report by the astafyev krasnoyarsk state pedagogical university to be credible because they had been made by specialists with professional expertise in the spheres of social psychology, psycholinguistics, philosophy and religious studies who had used scientific methods of analysis.
6.  on 30 december 1992 the applicant’s legal predecessor and two others applied to the bratislava land office for the restitution of some plots of land under the land ownership act of 1991. the date on which the applicant subsequently became a party to the proceedings is not specified.9.  on 12 july 2013 the land office stayed the restitution proceedings on the grounds that the parties had failed to furnish it with their consent to process, in the course of the proceedings, their personal data.11.  on 19 october 2015 the land office stayed the examination of the remainder of the claim, inviting a number of institutions to submit relevant documentation, which they did by the end of 2015.17.  on 12 november 2013, in response to a complaint lodged by the applicant, the bratislava ii district office of the public prosecution service (“the pps”) informed him that the pps had reprimanded the land office for unjustified delays in the restitution proceedings.the constitutional court noted that under article 250t § 1 of the ccp examination of delays in proceedings before administrative authorities fell within the jurisdiction of administrative tribunals, which excluded the jurisdiction of the constitutional court.
8.  however, following an appeal lodged by the claimants with the supreme court, on 29 january 2014 that court quashed the regional court’s judgment and remitted the case to it on the grounds that the latter had failed to establish the representatives’ authority to act on behalf of all the claimants.the proceedings before the regional court had been conducted merely in the presence of the designated representatives and the court had failed to summon the claimants in person and to have its judgment served on them.9.  accordingly, it became incumbent on the regional court to determine anew the claimants’ administrative-law appeal against the decision of the land office of 27 may 2010. in those proceedings, the court invited the claimants to clarify issues concerning their legal representation with a view to ensuring that they would be represented by a common representative.13.  meanwhile, on 21 january 2015 the constitutional court had rejected a complaint lodged by the applicants about the length of the proceedings in their claim, in so far as they had taken place before the land office and the regional court.the constitutional court held that the length of the administrative proceedings before the land office and of the judicial‑review proceedings held before the regional court could not be considered together.
7.  on 2 november 2012 the applicant lodged an application for an interim injunction (ordonanţă preşedenţială), seeking to be granted sole or shared custody of the child during the divorce proceedings, or alternatively the right to visit the child during those proceedings according to a detailed schedule that he submitted to the court.10.  in june 2013 the applicant, who was in the habit of visiting his son at school in the mornings, was removed from the school premises by the school guard, who informed him that from then on, he would need the school principal’s permission if he wanted to see his son at the school.it appears from the parties’ submissions that the applicant was able to see his son on 27 december 2012, between 31 december 2012 and 2 january 2013, on 20 january, between 2 and 3 march, on 14 and 17 march, on 28 april, on 2, 6 and 12 may 2013, and one last time, on 9 june 2013, after the court had given its ruling in respect of the interim injunction.despite requests from the applicant to expedite the proceedings in order to allow him to re-establish contact with his son, the case file could not be sent to the prahova county court before 7 may 2014 owing to administrative problems within the district court.15.  the start of the proceedings before the prahova county court was postponed on several occasions in order to allow the parties to get acquainted with the submissions in the file, to hear evidence and to obtain an expert evaluation of the relations between the parents and between each parent and the child.
6.  on 13 april 2003 the applicant was brought before the judge at the istanbul state security court who placed him in detention on remand taking into consideration the nature of the offence, and the state of evidence.7.  on 23 july 2003 the istanbul public prosecutor filed an indictment with the istanbul state security court, charging the applicant with membership of a terrorist organisation, and attempting to undermine the constitutional order of the republic of turkey by force.at the end of that hearing, the court ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention.in delivering its decision, the court took into consideration the written opinion of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative.11.  on 25 september 2012 the court of cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.
16.  on 22 june 2007 the applicant companies wrote to the casa and asked it to reverse its decision on the grounds that it had not explained exactly what irregularities formed the basis for the withdrawal of the aocs and that the casa had not afforded them enough time to remedy the alleged irregularities.the applicants submitted, inter alia, that according to section 23 of the law on civil aviation, the casa was entitled to suspend or withdraw the aocs only if the companies failed to remedy the irregularities found by the casa within the prescribed time-limit.18.  on 3 december 2008 the chişinău court of appeal rejected the applicant companies’ action, finding that the casa had been entitled to withdraw the applicant companies’ aocs because serious irregularities threatening the safety of the flights had been found in respect of the first applicant company and three other companies, which are not applicants in the present case, and because those companies had failed to remedy those irregularities.the court also found that the other companies had failed to comply with the casa’s order of 1 june 2007 prohibiting flights to iraq and afghanistan as of 15 july 2007. the court did not give an answer to the applicants’ argument concerning the casa’s failure to observe the provisions of section 23 the law on civil aviation and those of the regulations in the field of civil aviation.19.  on 29 april 2009 the supreme court of justice dismissed the applicant companies’ appeal and upheld the judgment of the court of appeal after finding that the casa was entitled to revoke the aocs since the second and third applicant companies had failed to comply with its instructions concerning the ban on all flights of aircraft registered in moldova to iraq and afghanistan, with effect from 15 july 2007. as to the first applicant company, the supreme court confirmed the finding of the inferior court that serious irregularities threatening the safety of the flights had been found in respect of it and other companies which are not applicants in the present case and that they had failed to remedy those irregularities.
having regard, inter alia, to the statements of the applicant as well as of the other co-accused, the “written evidence” and the content of the case file as a whole, the trial court concluded that the applicant had committed the offence of aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation by allowing the other co-accused, namely mehmet desde, e.y.having regard, inter alia, to the statements of the applicant as well as of the other co-accused, the “written evidence” and the content of the case file as a whole, it held that the applicant had committed the offence of aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation by allowing the other co-accused, namely mehmet desde, e.y.by a decision dated 10 november 2005, the principal public prosecutor at the court of cassation sent the case file back to the first‑instance court and requested that the latter reconsider the case in the light of the amendments made to the code of criminal procedure.22.  the public prosecutor before the i̇zmir assize court submitted his opinion on the merits of the case and requested the acquittal of the applicant and his co-accused on the grounds that the organisation which they had allegedly founded did not correspond to the definition of a terrorist organisation under section 7 (1) of law no.moreover, having regard, inter alia, to the statements of the applicant as well as of the other co-accused persons, the “written evidence” and the content of the case file as a whole, it held that the applicant had committed the offence of aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation by allowing the other co-accused persons, namely mehmet desde, e.y.
he was remanded in custody by the centru district court on 28 august 2011 and his detention was subsequently extended every thirty days until 21 january 2012 on the grounds that given the seriousness of the charges against him, he might abscond, re-offend and interfere with the investigation.6.  on 17 january 2012 the applicant’s case was committed for trial and his detention was extended by the court every three months, finding that the grounds which justified his initial detention had remained valid.7.  in his appeals against the decisions of 12 april, 10 june and 10 july 2013 the applicant complained, inter alia, about the length of his detention which, in his view, was no longer justified.he argued that his detention pending trial had already exceeded the twelve-month time-limit set under article 186 (8) of the code of criminal procedure and that the courts had not put forward any exceptional circumstance justifying such a long detention period, while the seriousness of charges could not by themselves constitute sufficient ground for his extended deprivation of liberty.9.  by a final judgment of the supreme court of justice of 17 september 2014 the applicant was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to twenty‑three years of imprisonment.
4.  the applicant was born in 1983 and at the time of lodging his application he was serving his prison sentence in bolu f-type prison.5.  on 10 december 2007 the applicant wrote a letter to a member of parliament, in which he had praised the imprisoned leader of the pkk, abdullah öcalan by using “kürt halk önderi”, meaning the leader of kurdish people.6.  pursuant to the regulations on the administration of penitentiary institutions and the execution of sentences, the applicant was found guilty of breaching prison order by the kocaeli f- type prison disciplinary board (referred hereafter as “the board”) and on 24 december 2007 the applicant was sentenced to 13 days’ solitary confinement, on account of his statements in the above mentioned letter.7.  on 17 january 2008 the kocaeli enforcement judge rejected the applicant’s objection.8.  on 14 february 2008 the kocaeli assize court upheld the judgment of 17 january 2008.
the applicant was also present and after the meeting he asked the minister a question about the method of calculation of his pension.7.  on 12 may 2014 the prosecutor in charge of the case ordered the applicant’s psychiatric examination in order to determine whether he was fit to plead in the criminal proceedings.it appears from a video submitted by the applicant’s representative, that the door of the hospital ward where the applicant was detained was locked and that one could enter or exit only with the approval of the medical staff.14.  on 30 september 2014 the prosecutor in charge of the case applied to the glodeni district court to have the applicant remanded in custody pending trial for a period of thirty days.16.  by a final judgment of the supreme court of justice of 26 december 2017 the applicant was found guilty as charged and sentenced to a criminal fine of 4,000 moldovan lei (mdl), the equivalent of some eur 180.
13.  on 5 november 2012 the chief of the zadar criminal police sent a report on the use of force against the applicant to the chief of the zadar police, describing the events at issue in the same manner as officers b.r.20.  on 28 march 2013 the chief of the national police asked the chief of the zadar police to check the applicant’s allegations from the standpoint of the police and to cooperate with the state attorney’s office.the report it had received on 23 january 2013 indicated that the applicant had resisted the police officers in their attempt to carry out an identity check and put him in a police vehicle, in response to which the officers had used force against him which had resulted in him being forced to the ground and “receiving a blow to the head”.24.  on the same day the chief of the zadar police sent a letter to the applicant informing him that the police officers had lawfully used force against him and that no case of ill-treatment could be established on the basis of the medical reports or statements of the police officers concerned.27.  on 14 may 2013 the state attorney’s office ordered the police to identify the fourth police officer mentioned in the criminal complaint who had allegedly pushed the applicant down the stairs and had the badge no.
in the period between 1 september 2009 and 30 march 2010, and in particular two telephone calls made on 10 march 2010; and the relevant exit and entry stamps in the applicant’s passport proving that he had arrived in yerevan from moscow on 10 march 2010.14.  at one of the hearings before the regional court, relying, inter alia, on the strasbourg convention of 1959 on mutual assistance in criminal matters, the applicant requested the temporary transfer of s.t.16.  by a letter of 29 april 2011, the ministry of justice of georgia, refused to grant the request by referring to article 11 § 1(b) of the strasbourg convention, which states that a request for assistance may be refused if “his or her presence is necessary at criminal proceedings pending in the territory of the requested party”.19.  at the same hearing the applicant asked to summon s.g. – the conductor of the train who had been questioned during the investigation – as a witness, on the grounds that some of his statements were in contradiction with the statements of s.t.– the applicant’s friend and h.o.’s daughter respectively; the results of forensic examinations carried out in georgia and armenia confirming that the substance discovered contained enriched uranium; the evidence of telephone correspondence between the applicant and h.o.
the court referred to statements the applicant had made to the police, to the extent that her father wanted to take over the care of the child and planned to take the applicant and her daughter abroad, kill the applicant and then take over the care of a. he had allegedly said this only a few hours before he had stabbed the parents of the applicant’s friend (see paragraph 7 above).in addition, the applicant’s father could not in any way be expected to be a serious care person for a. viewed in connection with the contact sessions that had taken place, which had led to the child having negative reactions and challenged the calm and stability in the foster home, this supported the conclusion that the court should not allow any contact.2014 page 976) the supreme court first set out the general principles with respect to contact rights, based on the child welfare act, its preparatory works and related supreme court case-law, article 9(3) of the 1989 convention on the rights of the child (see paragraph 69 below) and article 8 of the convention on the right to respect for family life as this provision had been interpreted by the european court of human rights in cases such as johansen v. norway, cited above; r. and h. v. the united kingdom (no.this included a’s maternal grandfather having started serving a four and a half year sentence (see paragraphs 7 and 31 above); two years had passed since the incident in which the emergency foster mother had been followed (see paragraph 12 above) and nothing had happened since to indicate that the applicant’s family was trying to locate a or planning to abduct her; the applicant had grown older and was anew pregnant, now with a father to-be from a different environment; the applicant had gone to school and undergone a work placement.in the present case, the relevant provisions were found in article 9(3) of the 1989 convention on the rights of the child on the child’s right to regular and direct contact with both parents (see paragraph 69 below) and article 8 of the convention on the right to respect for family life.
8.  in a final judgment of 28 december 2010 the supreme administrative court found that compensation was due to the applicants as owners of the plot at issue and that it had to be increased to bgn 59,817 (the equivalent of eur 30,577), in accordance with the conclusions of an expert report obtained in the course of the proceedings.in a judgment of 26 june 2012, the supreme administrative court declared the decision of 5 july 2011 null and void as it had failed to take account of the binding character of the judgment of 28 december 2010, the latter having determined the dispute between the parties with final effect.14.  in the meantime, on 22 november 2013 the applicants brought proceedings before the sofia administrative court in relation to the lack of enforcement of the final judicial decision of 28 december 2010. in particular, they claimed they had incurred pecuniary damage as a result of the lack of enforcement; they also claimed interest on the amount determined in the said judgment for the period of its non-enforcement.if, on the other hand, the applicants’ claim was about the lack of enforcement of a final judicial decision, the court held that the competent body in that connection was the bailiff and the relevant procedure was under chapter xvii of the code of administrative procedure 2006 (“the 2006 code”).15.  the applicants appealed before the supreme administrative court, alleging a breach of article 203 of the 2006 code and a breach of section 1(1) of the state and municipalities responsibility for damage act (the “smrda”), and challenging the lower court’s decision as being unreasoned.
it was of the view that the lower courts had not duly accounted for the fact that the mine operated in a prohibited area close to the applicant’s house, the house being situated within both the “sanitation zone” and the “security zone” around the mine.the lower courts had had to examine this fact in light of the statements of the witnesses, which had “established the circumstance” that the damage to the applicant’s property had been the result of the detonation works.the expert noted that, owing to the passage of time and the destruction of some documents, it was impossible to determine the exact distance between the applicant’s house and the area where the detonations had been carried out in 1997. nevertheless, it was clear that the house had been well inside the “sanitation zone” around the mine.it has not been shown whether and to what degree the buildings’ state described by the expert [heard by the regional court] was due to normal wear and tear, taking into account the year [they were built] and the manner of [their] construction, and any lack of maintenance by the owner after the 1990 expropriation.” 21.  upon a further appeal by the applicant, in a final judgment of 3 july 2008 the supreme court of cassation upheld the court of appeal’s judgment, affirming its conclusions.it pointed out in particular that the expert report presented to the court of appeal (see paragraph 18 above) had only established that the applicant’s property had been situated within the “sanitation zone” around the mine, but “was insufficient to prove the existence of a causal link between the damage ... and the unlawful behaviour of employees of the respondent company”.
8.  after the expropriation the municipal authorities opened a blocked housing savings account with the state savings bank in the name of ms maria kopankova and the fourth applicant and transferred to it 13,420 old bulgarian levs (bgl) – the equivalent of the expropriated property’s value as assessed at the time.12.  on 16 february 2009 the applicants and mr kancho kopankov made a request to the mayor under section 9(2) of the transitional provisions of the territorial planning act of 2001 (hereinafter “section 9(2)”) for the revocation of the expropriation order of 18 july 1988. as no response followed, they applied for judicial review of the mayor’s tacit refusal.the administrative court found further that the authorities had not “taken possession” of the applicants’ property, within the meaning of section 9(2), because there had been no formal decision to take possession (as had been required at the time), and because in any event the construction work which had started on the plot had eventually been abandoned.16.  in the context of the ensuing proceedings the administrative court, examining the case, appointed experts, who estimated the value of the house and the remaining objects at 37,868 new bulgarian levs (bgn – the equivalent of approximately 19,370 euros (eur)).it reasoned that the applicants’ situation had been regulated by sections 9(1) and 9(2) of the transitional provisions of the territorial planning act of 2001 (see paragraph 22 below, hereinafter “section 9(1)” and “section 9(2)”), and that the existence of such a special avenue of redress meant that the general tort provisions of the state and municipalities responsibility for damage act did not apply.
on 22 august 2006, the applicant and the same three neighbours wrote again to the same directorate expressing concern about and dissatisfaction with the manner in which the measurements in respect of noise and air pollution had been taken on 18 august 2006. in particular, two individuals who had not shown any credentials had turned up and measured the noise with a machine which had not reacted to sudden high-pitched noises but was set up to measure only background noise.furthermore, when the applicant had invited the inspectors to also measure the purity of the air, one of them had opened the window, sniffed the air and stated that it was not that bad and that, in all likelihood, it would turn out to be within the relevant norms when measured.12.  on 30 august 2006, apparently in reply to the applicant’s letter of complaint of 31 july 2006, the head of the public health agency informed the applicant that: the chemical agents identified at the work stations at the printing company in question were within the limits listed in regulation no.18.  on 10 september 2007 the head of the ruse regional inspectorate for the environment and water wrote to the applicant in reply to the letter of 20 august 2007. the reply stated that two experts sent by the inspectorate had carried out a check on 30 august 2007 at the printing company in the presence of its owner.the court then stated that, as seen from a chemical agents inspection report of august 2006 and from the subsequent explanations of the person who had carried out the check, it was clear that measurements had been taken throughout the working process at the printing premises and that the level of the chemical agents measured was not above the norms.
7.  on 9 july 2008, after the expiry of the deadline envisaged in the relevant provisions of the media act (zakon o medijima) to publish a correction, the applicant brought a civil action against the publisher in the zagreb municipal civil court (općinski građanski sud u zagrebu), claiming non-pecuniary damage.9.  at a hearing held on 31 january 2012 the zagreb municipal civil court heard evidence from the applicant who said that he had authorised his representative to act on his behalf vis-à-vis the publisher.the first-instance court held that the request for the publication of a correction of the disputed information had not been signed by a duly authorised person because the applicant had not proved that his representative had actually submitted a power of attorney with the request.the relevant part of the decision reads: “in his testimony, the [applicant] stated that he had given power of attorney to his counsel, [lj.p], authorising her to institute both criminal and civil proceedings for defamation ... he was present during the preparation of a draft of the request for the correction of the disputed information ... ... this court does not accept the [applicant]’s evidence because the [applicant] has no direct knowledge of what was ultimately sent to the defendant ... on the other hand, the [applicant’s] statement concerning the granting of a power of attorney is of no relevance for the solution to the specific legal issue ... ... given that the request for the publication of a correction of the disputed information was not signed by the [applicant], but by his counsel, [lj.p.], and that it was not accompanied with a power of attorney, the [applicant] has not proved that he had properly requested the publication of a correction of the disputed information ... an action which is, pursuant to section 22(2) of the media act, a procedural requirement for bringing a civil action for non-pecuniary damage against the publisher ...” 11.  on 19 november 2012 the šibenik county court (županijski sud u šibeniku) dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the first-instance decision.
20.  it rejected their claim concerning the lack of public interest of the expropriation, having considered that the purpose of the taking was one in the general interest of citizens, given the role of the attorney general who performed constitutional duties in the interest of the state.1 to the convention in so far as in the absence of a notice to treat issued by the col the applicant companies had had no access to court from 1993 to 2009. however, these violations persisted further, in so far as even after the declaration of 2009 and the col’s deposit in court of the offer made to the applicant companies, he had failed to notify the owners as required by law [article 9 (2) of the ordinance] with the consequence that proceedings had stagnated and no access to court by the applicant companies was possible as a result of his inaction.31.  the constitutional court also confirmed the lack of independence and impartiality of the lab, however not only until 2009. the constitutional court considered that, even following those amendments the law remained deficient given the lack of security of tenure of the technical members of the board, on whose technical advice the chairperson had to base his or her decision.although the role of the technical members was subordinate to that of the chairperson (who following the amendments was not bound to follow the experts’ unanimous report), in practice it was decisive in so far as the chairperson (a legal person without the necessary technical knowledge) was undoubtedly influenced by the decision of the technical members when considering technical matters.34.  at the same time, the government informed the court that due to the urgency of vacating and transferring the office of the attorney general, another building in valletta which was previously a museum was identified for use as the office of the attorney general.
13.  on 1 april 2015, relying on a criminal report filed by the high inspectorate for the declaration and audit of assets and the prevention of conflicts of interest, the prosecutor’s office initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant for laundering the proceeds from a criminal offence or activity and refusing to state or falsely stating what his possessions were in breach of articles 287 and 257/a of the cc.the arrest warrant referred to a letter from the tirana police directorate stating “the enforcement of the security measure of house arrest cannot be entirely guaranteed, on account of the geographical position of the applicant’s house, the large surface area of the house, the existence of more than two entry and exit gates, and the existence of numerous buildings constructed adjacent to and around the house”.17.  the supreme court further stated that the security measure of detention (arrest) should be imposed in accordance with articles 228-230 of the ccp, and this entailed the fulfilment of three conditions: firstly, that there was a reasonable suspicion, based on evidence, that the accused had committed a crime; secondly, that the facts attributed to the accused constituted a criminal offence which had not become time-barred, as provided for by the criminal law; and thirdly, that the accused was criminally responsible for the alleged criminal offence.further, the applicant’s detention complied with the criteria laid down in article 229 of the ccp, and would also be justified by the need to prevent any interference by the applicant in the administration of justice because of his public office, and the need to prevent further consequences resulting from the offence.26.  it appears from the case file that the applicant lost his mandate as a member of parliament on 20 october 2015. therefore, on 17 december 2015 the supreme court, at the gpo’s request, decided to dismiss the case, noting that the competence to review the personal security measure lay with the court examining the merits of the case.
because it was owing precisely to jishkariani’s scribbles on a piece of paper that [two allegedly healthy inmates who later assaulted doctors] found themselves in the prison hospital without any legal grounds for that ...” 14.  the minister further noted that the director of the medical department was “the one who... [relied on] jishkariani’s illegal notes ... not signed by the members of the [medical] commission... to transfer the inmates [to the prison hospital].” he noted that “therefore he [was] the suspect in these illegal arrangements and “[would] become an object of the investigation along with jishkariani.” the minister continued to note that “there are not only these two facts and the investigation is pending because it was mariam jishkariani who was the most important figure and [whose opinions were guiding the director’s actions]...” 15.  the minister also criticised the public defender and accused his representatives of having a vested interest in transferring certain inmates to the prison hospital.to the prison hospital based on [the applicant’s] medical conclusion [in the journal] ... and in doing so he violated ... all the relevant rules concerning the prisoners’ transfers to the medical establishment.” 20.  on 27 december 2007 the investigation into the incident of 10 september 2005 was discontinued on the grounds of the absence of a crime, as provided under article 28 § 1 (b) of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 32 below).the court concluded that the applicant was a public figure for the purposes of the act (see paragraph 30 below) in view of her activities in prison (see paragraph 7 above), and that the burden of proving the existence of the three cumulative conditions set out in section 14 of the act (see paragraph 30 below) to classify the minister’s statements as defamation had rested with her.[the minister] scheduled the inspection of a department within the scope of his competence and thus he took measures to verify the information.” 26.  the tbilisi city court concluded that the statements in question had been made as part of an important public discussion surrounding the management of medical facilities in the penal system.regarding the third criterion of whether the minister had known that the impugned statements were false or had acted with apparent and gross negligence, the court noted the following: “the appellate chamber shares the reasoning of the [lower court’s] judgment that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that [the minister] was either aware of the falsehood of the disseminated facts, or that [he] acted with apparent and gross negligence which led to the dissemination of a statement containing a substantially false fact.
9.  the version of the german website which could be reached via the link on the austrian website included the following statement: “equating the babycaust to the holocaust would mean relativising today’s abortion murders” (den babycaust mit dem holocaust gleichzusetzen würde bedeuten die heutigen abtreibungsmorde zu relativieren.)14.  on 9 february 2010, the karlsruhe regional court ordered the applicant to desist from using and/or allowing the use of the term “aggravated murder” on the german website or the austrian website to describe abortions performed by dr f., who was named on those websites.even though the applicant had made his statements in the context of a public debate of fundamental importance and freedom of expression protected polemical and sharp criticism, the applicant’s comments on the german website and the austrian website had not been posted as broad criticism but specifically against the doctors mentioned on those sites.moreover, the court took into account that the applicant had persistently made these or similar statements and had not been dissuaded by orders to desist issued against him, such as the decision of the karlsruhe court of appeal of 28 february 2007 (6 u 98/06) to which the website referred (see paragraph 11 above), or the inclusion of the website on the list of publications harmful to minors by the federal review board.the regional court had correctly taken into account, to the detriment of the applicant, that he had failed to observe the legally binding decision of the karlsruhe court of appeal of 28 february 2007. the court further clarified that – for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation to be awarded – it was irrelevant whether dr f. was jewish and that his family had been persecuted under the nazi regime.
6.  on 25 november 2004 and 7 december 2004 the applicant distributed leaflets in the immediate vicinity of the medical practice of dr s. the leaflets contained, inter alia, the following text on the front page: “did you know that dr s. [full name and address] performs abortions that are unlawful according to the case-law of the federal constitutional court?” (wussten sie schon, dass dr s. ... abtreibungen durchführt, die nach der rechtsprechung des bundesverfassungsgerichts rechtswidrig sind?)8.  subsequently dr s. applied to the karlsruhe regional court for a civil injunction ordering the applicant not to claim on the internet that the plaintiff performed unlawful abortions and not to disseminate leaflets containing his name and the assertion that unlawful abortions were performed in his medical practice.[emphases in original] farther down the leaflet read: “i’m simply unable to understand that medical personnel and doctors, who are supposed to help and save lives, stoop to take part in aggravated murder.” (noch weniger kann ich verstehen, dass mediziner und ärzte, welche helfen und leben retten sollen, sich für’s morden hergeben) 10.  on 4 november 2005 the karlsruhe regional court granted the requested injunction and ordered the applicant to desist from asserting publicly, both in writing and orally, on the internet as well as on leaflets, that the plaintiff performed unlawful abortions in his medical practice.the court came to this conclusion based on the facts that the applicant had singled out dr s. by mentioning him by name and distributing the leaflets in the vicinity of his practice, that he had quoted the federal constitutional court’s judgment only in parts and had omitted the parts that stated that doctors had not been subject to criminal liability, that he had implied by defining aggravated murder that dr s. had committed this criminal offence and that he had associated dr s. with the holocaust.15.  on 29 may 2007 the federal court of justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid for his complaint against the denial of leave to appeal on points of law on the grounds that the applicant’s intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success.
14.  on 7 october 2016, pursuant to article 209 §§ 1 and 4 and article 210 of the code of criminal procedure (“the ccp”), a prosecutor of the state prosecutor’s office decided to appoint a team of international and national forensic experts with a view to carrying out autopsies on the bodies of eighty-three victims of the crash (the bodies of nine victims had already been exhumed and four victims had been cremated).the prosecutor asked the experts to: “(1) carry out the medical imaging, examination and autopsy of the victims’ remains; (2) determine the cause of death, and the manner and circumstances in which the victims sustained their injuries, including whether the injuries were sustained before or after their death, as well as to ascertain whether the injuries occurred at the place and time of the crash; (3) ascertain whether the established injuries indicate that they came about as a result of the aircraft’s impact with the ground and the disintegration of the aircraft parts ...; (4) ascertain whether the victims’ bodies have injuries typical of an explosion of explosive or flammable material, or of some other sudden release of energy; (5) ascertain whether the method used by the russian experts to examine the corpses and carry out the autopsies was consistent with the current standards, and whether the conclusions of their forensic report with regard to the injuries, the circumstances in which they had occurred and the cause of death correspond to the conclusions of the report established by the [current] team of experts; (6) determine the identity of the victims by comparing the results of the genetic testing with their genetic profiles, established at an earlier stage of the proceedings ...; (7) take samples from the victims’ remains for further toxicological, histopathological, physicochemical and genetic examination.” the prosecutor further ordered (point iv of the decision) that for the purpose of carrying out the above-mentioned measures, the bodies of eighty-three victims be exhumed on dates to be determined in separate orders.30.  the government informed the court that the exhumation of the applicants’ husbands had initially been planned for 24 and 26 april 2018. the exhumations had been planned in line with the wishes of the families and the bodies of those victims whose families had not complained had been exhumed first.31.  on 13 april 2018 the prosecutor issued two orders setting the dates of the exhumation of the bodies of the applicants’ husbands for 14 and 16 may 2018. the prosecutor stated that those orders were being issued in execution of the decision of 7 october 2016. the reasoning was limited to a brief reference to the ongoing investigation and the decision of 7 october 2016.34.  the government submitted that in accordance with the code of conduct adopted by the investigative team of the state prosecutor’s office, the prosecutors in charge of the investigation had taken steps to arrange a meeting with the applicants and their lawyers in order to explain the reasons for the intended investigative actions, to clarify the aim of the autopsies and to elucidate other important issues, such as the families’ participation in the investigative actions and the issue of reburial.
the association was also involved in the preparation of applications to the court and the submission of communications to the committee of ministers in the context of the execution of the court’s judgments.these people, some of whom are traitors and some weak-minded, will at last answer before the law.” 14.  on 15 august 2014 a.h., the head of the department of social and political issues of the presidential administration, stated the following in an interview with trend news agency: “the most deplorable thing is that such ngos and individuals and some journalists, relying on foreign circles funding them, placed themselves above national law, evaded registration of their grant projects, filing financial statements, taxes and other legal requirements.” 15.  in an interview published on 2 september 2014 y.m., a member of parliament from the ruling party, who was also the director of the institute of history at the academy of sciences, stated the following in respect of the recently arrested ngo activists and human-rights defenders: “people who betray their motherland cannot be forgiven.... therefore, the activities of a number of non-governmental organisations must be investigated very seriously, and if any illegality is discovered, such organisations must be immediately banned and their leaders punished.” 16.  on 3 september 2014 an online news portal vestnik kavkaza published an interview with r.m., the head of the presidential administration who stated, inter alia, the following: “such ngos as the institute for peace and democracy, institute for reporters’ freedom and safety, legal education society, monitoring and teaching democracy center and others use big grants from foreign organisations under the guise of human‑rights protection to send reports to different quarters and organise anti‑azerbaijani campaigns in international structures where azerbaijan is represented.” 17.  on 3 december 2014 state-owned news agencies published a sixty‑page manifesto written by r.m., the head of the presidential administration, entitled “the world order of double standards and modern azerbaijan”.the acts with which the applicant was charged appear as follows: – the applicant, acting in his capacity as chairman of the association, had failed to inform the relevant executive authority of his appointment as head and representative of a legal entity in accordance with article 9.3 of the law on state registration of legal entities and the state register; – he had failed to register with the relevant executive authority various grant agreements which had been concluded since august 2012 with ned, norway’s human rights house foundation and other donor organisations and which had allocated to the association for various projects certain sums in the total amount of 74,911.29 new azerbaijani manats (azn – approximately 71,343 euros (eur) at the material time); – he had signed the said agreements on behalf of the association without having legal authority to do so and had placed the above allocated sums in the bank accounts of the association and then, by withdrawing cash, had made payments to himself and other people involved in the projects in the guise of salaries and service fees; – by failing to register the above grant agreements with the relevant executive authority, the applicant had been conducting illegal entrepreneurial activity and had thus profited in the amount of azn 66,204.58 (approximately eur 63,051 at the material time) and had avoided in this context payment of taxes in the amount of azn 8,706.71 (approximately eur 8,291 at the material time) which were due in accordance with articles 124, 150.1.6, 218, 219 and 220 of the tax code.the court considers that for the purpose of conducting a comprehensive, thorough and objective investigation it is necessary to conduct a search and seizure [of the association’s] office located at [office address] ... and other places of storage.” 38.  on 8 august 2014 the investigator carried out a search of the applicant’s home on the basis of the nasimi district court’s decision of 7 august 2014. according to the search record of 8 august 2014, the search was carried out in the presence of the applicant’s lawyer, members of his family and two attesting witnesses (hal şahidləri).
when sustaining the injuries to the skull and the area of the left shoulder girdle, levon gulyan had been facing, with the left part of his head and the area of his left shoulder girdle, towards the object that had caused the injuries, whereas when sustaining the injuries to his thorax and the shoulder and lower spine, levon gulyan had been facing with the back surface of his thorax towards the object that had caused the injuries.apart from the above‑mentioned injuries there were also bruises on the left side of his abdomen, the left elbow joint, the dorsal surface of the left wrist and the outer surface of the right ankle joint, as well as scratches in the areas of the right elbow joint, the dorsal surface of the wrist joint and the palm, the anterior surface of the left elbow joint, the outer surface of the right ankle joint and the frontal surface of the left knee joint, which had been caused by blunt objects while still alive and could be qualified as minor injuries.the distribution of the lesions and the position of the body at the scene suggested that the deceased had hit the ground with the head and the upper part of the body first, and that he might have hit an object on the way down, possibly the pipe seen on the outside of the building under the window.in its decision, reasoned in detail, the district court found, inter alia, that: (a) the investigating authority had failed to determine the lawfulness of taking levon gulyan and others between 10 and 12 may 2007 to the law-enforcement agencies and keeping them there for extended periods of time; (b) the allegations raised in the press and by some of the witnesses, including barman h.m., that levon gulyan had been ill-treated with the purpose of coercing a confession during his stays at the law-enforcement agencies had not been investigated, including the allegation that such acts had been committed in g.t.’s office and had led to his being thrown out of the window; (c) not all reasonable steps had been taken to secure evidence, including questioning police officers, to prevent their possible collusion and preserve the scene of the incident; (d) no proper assessment had been made of the fact that levon gulyan had neither been summoned nor gone voluntarily to the pdci; (e) the events preceding the incident had not been properly clarified, in view of the multiple discrepancies in the statements made by the police officers, which also cast doubt on their credibility and the validity of the conclusions reached by the investigating authority on the basis of those statements; (f) no proper assessment had been made of the alleged behaviour of the deputy head of the homicide unit, a.m., upon his return to g.t.’s office, specifically his reaction to the open window; (g) it had not been clarified whether levon gulyan had been able to move about freely while at the pdci; (h) no investigation had been carried out into the fact that his shoe laces had been missing at the time of the incident and had been found in his trouser pockets; (i) no convincing evidence had been obtained concerning levon gulyan’s fall and the preceding events; the investigating authority from the very outset had carried out the investigation on the premise that levon gulyan had attempted to escape and had died as a result of a fall, but had failed to carry out a complete and objective investigation into his motives, including the fact that he had only been a witness and that the window had been more than 7 m high and there had been numerous obstacles in the police building; (j) while, according to the official version, levon gulyan had hit an obstacle or obstacles during the fall, which could have been the gas pipe, no explanation had been provided for the absence of any particles on his clothes and under his fingernails of the pipe in question or any other possible obstacle, such as the entresol shed, or vice versa; nor had it been clarified whose fibres had been discovered on levon gulyan’s clothes and no samples had been taken in that connection from police officers; (k) no explanation had been provided or samples taken from police officers in relation to the palm print found on the window, which had not belonged to levon gulyan; (l) the investigation had not clarified the mechanics of levon gulyan’s fall and had not carried out in that connection an investigative experiment because of the absence of a suitable dummy, despite the fact that such an experiment had been ordered by the prosecutor general’s office; no measures had been taken to obtain such a dummy from the prosecutor general’s office of russia within the framework of inter-state legal assistance; (m) no investigation had been carried out in connection with the findings of foreign experts concerning the other injuries found on levon gulyan’s body, such as small bruises and scratches; (n) it had not been clarified how a lock of hair belonging to levon gulyan had been found lying at a distance from his body; (o) the applicant and other victims in the criminal case had not been involved in any investigative or other procedural measures and had had no possibility to pose questions to the police officers or the experts; and (p) the remains of a cigarette found in the ashtray in g.t.’s office had not been seized and examined to determine whether it had been levon gulyan who had smoked it.57.  by letter of 18 march 2011 the prosecutor general’s office replied that the fact of levon gulyan’s death as a result of an attempted escape through a window had been established and it was impossible to guarantee the objective legitimacy of results by carrying out the investigative experiment, since levon gulyan, from the moment he had climbed onto the windowsill and until his collision with the ground, had performed conscious and intentional actions characteristic exclusively of his physical fitness and mentality, which were impossible to replicate with the help of a dummy or through any other experiment and research, and it was objectively impossible to approximate the circumstances of an investigative experiment to the actual event and to establish through such investigative experiment any circumstances having evidentiary value.
on 1 march 2008 at around 6 a.m., when the police took measures aimed at forcibly ending the public events held in violation of the procedure prescribed by law, in compliance with the requirements of section 14 of the assemblies, rallies, marches and demonstrations act, the organisers and participants of the events, disobeying the lawful orders of the [police officers], who were performing their official duties, committed a life- and health-threatening assault on them with clubs, metal rods and other adapted objects, which had been in their possession for that purpose, causing the police officers injuries of varied severity.” 16.  it appears that, after freedom square was cleared of demonstrators, some of them relocated to the area near the french embassy, the yerevan mayor’s office and the yerevan press building, situated at grigor lusavorich and arshakunyats streets about 1.7-2 km from freedom square, where they were later joined by thousands of others who apparently poured into the streets of yerevan in response to the events of the early morning in order to voice their discontent.], and others, not willing to concede defeat at the election, with the aim of casting doubt on the election, instilling distrust towards the results among large segments of the population, creating illusions of public discontent and revolt and discrediting the election and the authorities, from 1 march 2008 in the area of the yerevan mayor’s office and central streets organised mass disorder involving murders, violence, pogroms, arson, destruction of property and armed resistance to public officials, with the use of firearms, explosives and other adapted objects.” 18.  it appears that on the same date a number of police officers who had been involved in the events of 1-2 march 2008, including officers a.arsh.the most active of these citizens were brought in to the police station from the streets adjacent to the square.” 30.  a memorandum signed by the chief of kentron police station in yerevan and the chief of the yerevan police, entitled “assaults and insults of a public official; organisation of public events in violation of the procedure prescribed by law; mass disorder within the territory of kentron police station”, stated: “as a result of mass events organised and held at yerevan’s freedom square in violation of the procedure prescribed by law, on 1 march 2008 at around 7 a.m. officers of the armenian police, having received an order, demanded the persons gathered at the square to vacate the square and to terminate the mass event that they had been holding for days[.thereafter, on 1 march 2008 at around 6 a.m., when [the police officers] demanded the participants in the demonstration at freedom square to give a possibility to verify the veracity of the information that they possessed arms and ammunition, and once again warned them to end the unlawful event, he and other demonstrators, disobeying the police officers’ lawful orders, committed life- and health-threatening assault on [them].” 42.  on 4 march 2008 the applicant’s lawyer filed a complaint with the chief of the special investigative service, alleging that the applicant had been unjustifiably taken to kentron police station under the so-called procedure of “bringing-in”, subjected to ill-treatment and then unlawfully kept there the whole day on 1 march 2008. the record of his “bringing-in” had never been presented to him.86.  on 10 november 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal in which he argued, inter alia, that the charge against him was trumped-up and politically motivated; that he had been ill-treated both at the time of his apprehension and at the police station and that no investigation had been carried out into his allegations of ill-treatment; that the interference with his freedom of peaceful assembly had been unlawful, unjustified and accompanied with use of excessive force by the police; that the only witnesses in the case were police officers who, being interested in the outcome of the case because of the brutal and unlawful force used against the demonstrators, including his ill-treatment, were not impartial and trustworthy witnesses and had made contradictory statements which were then coordinated towards the end of the investigation and which constituted the sole basis for his conviction; and that the principle of equality of arms had not been respected since his request to call and examine witnesses on his behalf had been groundlessly dismissed.
14.  the district court decided to allow the investigator’s application, taking into account the dangerousness of the imputed offence and the fact that if the applicant remained at large, he could abscond, obstruct the proceedings, commit another offence and influence witnesses.it appears that an argument erupted between, on the one hand, the applicant and his lawyer, who insisted that the judge take a decision on the applicant’s request or otherwise withdraw from the case, and on the other hand, the judge and the prosecutor, who objected to the demand that the judge withdraw.the judge decided to penalise the applicant by removing him from the courtroom on the grounds that he was obstructing the normal course of the hearing, abusing his procedural rights and disrespectfully refusing to follow the judge’s orders.the beginning of his sentence was to be calculated from 2 march 2008. the periods from 23 to 29 september and from 29 september to 3 october 2008, during which the court hearings were adjourned because of the applicant’s removal from the courtroom, were not to be calculated as part of his sentence, pursuant to article 314.1 § 6 of the code of criminal procedure (ccp).24.  on 27 february 2009 the criminal court of appeal, taking into account that article 314.1 § 6 of the ccp had been amended in the meantime (see paragraph 35 below) and as a consequence the periods during which the trial court hearings had been adjourned were to be calculated as part of the applicant’s sentence, decided to release him on the grounds that he had already served his one-year sentence.
in convicting the applicant the court relied, in particular, on the applicant’s statements made during the pre-trial investigation, which the trial court interpreted to mean that the applicant had realised that the house he had set on fire had been the victims’ home and that they might have been inside at the time, in particular the applicant’s statement to the effect that he had seen lights on in the house.in the course of the enquiries the prosecutor’s office took statements from the applicant, the police officers, lawyer o. and the medical expert who had issued the report of 29 july 2010, and examined the premises of the police station where the alleged ill-treatment had taken place and its entry records.28.  police officers stated that the applicant had been arrested and handcuffed on 19 july 2012 but had then been released and invited back for a new interview on either 21 or 22 july 2010. officer f. stated that he could not explain the discrepancy between the date of the applicant’s initial confession, 21 july 2010, and the date of his official arrest, 22 july 2010, insisting that the applicant had been handed over to the investigator, who had put him under arrest immediately following his confession.the court of appeal also held that the trial court had not erred in admitting the applicant’s statement given during the pre-trial investigation, since the applicant’s rights had been explained to him prior to questioning, a lawyer had been present and the applicant had not told him of any ill-treatment.33.  the applicant appealed on points of law, raising the same arguments as those raised before the court of appeal and also arguing that the discrepancies between his statements made during the pre-trial investigation and the testimony given during the trial were due to the ill-treatment to which he had been subjected.
the court ordered the applicant to desist from speaking to passers-by in the immediate vicinity of the medical practice and labelling the abortions performed by the plaintiff unlawful with the objective of irritating female patients and preventing them from visiting dr st.’s practice.10.  the regional court as well as the court of appeal both referred to a previous decision of the federal court of justice in which it had confirmed a civil injunction against similar conduct by the applicant (see paragraph 13 below).in so far that the doctor in the present case was slightly more well-known than the doctor in the original case, the court of appeal held that this was of minor relevance.this interference was not justified by the applicant’s freedom of expression in view of the massive “pillory effect” the applicant had created by singling out the plaintiff and criticising him in a harsh way in the immediate vicinity of his practice.11.  on 29 may 2007 the federal court of justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid on the grounds that the applicant’s intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success.
at the very bottom of the same page, under the highlighted text “german contemporary history in brief”, a sentence read: “perverted doctors murder unborn children at the request of the mothers” (pervertierte ärzte ermorden im auftrag der mütter die ungeborenen kinder) on the same page, clicking on the button “close page” forwarded the user to a page where it was stated: “pray, if possible regularly, for the doctors ... who personally undertake the aggravated murder of abortion killing” (beten sie – wenn möglich regelmäßig – für die mediziner ..., welche den mord der abtreibungstötung selbst vornehmen ...) (emphasis in original).8.  on 23 may 2006 the mannheim regional court rejected dr q.’s application on the grounds that it was a fact that dr q. performed abortions and that the remainder of the website’s content was covered by the applicant’s freedom of expression.while the term “aggravated murder” did not have to be understood in a merely legal sense but could also be understood as a moral judgment, the overall presentation of the website at the very least did not exclude a reading that dr q. had perpetrated the criminal offence of aggravated murder.in addition, the applicant had emphasised the term “aggravated murder” in the relevant parts of the website and had compared abortions with the holocaust.11.  on 29 may 2007 the federal court of justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid on the grounds that the applicant’s intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success.
17.  on 14 june 2011 the hcj examined the case in the applicant’s absence and decided to dismiss him from the post of president of the court, relying on section 20 of the judiciary and status of judges act and section 32-1 of the high council of justice act.it stated that “the improper organisation of the court’s work was the result of the failure by the president of the court, mr a. denisov, to comply with the provisions of the applicable laws concerning the fulfilment of his administrative duties”.it also found that “administrative documents issued by mr a. denisov regarding the distribution of duties between the vice-presidents of the court, the setting-up of court chambers and panels and the distribution of cases among judges, as well as personnel-related and other documents in certain cases, [violated] the provisions of [the domestic legislation]”.the applicant then asked the hac to take into account the fact that his judicial career had exceeded thirty-five years, that he had held positions of president at several courts for twenty-five years, that he had been given awards for his judicial service and that during the initial period of his presidency of the kyiv administrative court of appeal that court had moved from a demolished military barracks to premises in the city centre with proper equipment and a sufficient number of hearing rooms.the hac then reiterated the failings attributed to the applicant and concluded that the hcj’s decision had been lawful and that the applicant’s right to participate in the proceedings in person had not been violated because the hcj had taken all the necessary measures to inform him about the hearings and the applicant had not had any valid reason for being absent from the hearings.
within the context of the exhibition, photographs of deceased members of the pkk (an illegal armed organisation), deceased members of the security forces who had been killed in security operations, persons who had lost their lives in prison, victims of enforced disappearances and victims of assassinations by unknown assailants in south-east turkey were publicly displayed.10.  throughout the proceedings before the diyarbakır assize court the applicants repeated their previous statements and contended that photographs of deceased members of the security forces had also been displayed in the exhibition alongside those of members of the pkk.in its judgment, the court observed that the invitations to the exhibition had referred to the armed conflict between the security forces and the pkk as a “war”, and the pkk members as “guerrillas”, thus glorifying the deceased terrorists and inciting young people to become members of the pkk.12.  on 9 june 2009 the court of cassation quashed the judgment in respect of the second applicant, holding that the case should be reviewed in the light of article 231 of the code of criminal procedure (law no.13.  on 22 october 2009, in accordance with article 231 of the code of criminal procedure, the diyarbakır assize court decided to suspend the pronouncement of its judgment in respect of the second applicant on the condition that he did not commit another intentional offence for a period of five years.
7.  on 17 october 2007 the malatya public prosecutor filed an indictment with the malatya assize court, charging the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of the dhkp/c (revolutionary people’s liberation party/front), an illegal armed organisation, under section 7 (2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no.the public prosecutor noted that the applicant had chanted the following slogans during the concert: “mahir, hüseyin, ulaş; fight until emancipation”[1] (“mahir, hüseyin, ulaş; kurtuluşa kadar savaş”); “martyrs of the revolution are immortal” (“devrim şehitleri ölümsüzdür”); “revolutionary prisoners are our honour” (“devrimci tutsaklar onurumuzdur”); and “victory on mountains, emancipation at the front; long live victory, long live resistance” (“dağlarda zafer, cephede kurtuluş; yaşasın zafer, yaşasın direniş”).8.  during the investigation and the proceedings against him, the applicant stated that he had attended the concert in question and chanted the slogans “music shall not stop, dance shall continue” (“türküler susmaz , halaylar sürer”) and “we will not be defeated by oppression” (“baskılar bizi yıldıramaz”).in its judgment, on the basis of a police report on a police video recording of the concert of 5 april 2007, the indictment, the applicant’s defence submissions, and the public prosecutor’s observations on the merits of the case, the court considered it established that the applicant had chanted the slogans noted in the indictment.the court considered that the concert, for which legal and administrative authorisation had been obtained, had become a propaganda activity in favour of the dhkp/c, and that the applicant had chanted slogans used by that organisation.
6.  on 27 march 2003 the applicant was arrested on charges of illegal possession of firearms, two armed robberies of local post offices, murder of three russian post service cash messengers and attempted murder of the fourth one.on 14 october 2003 the case was sent to the supreme court of the buryatia republic (“the regional court”) for trial.on 12 september 2008, in the course of the third round of jury trial, the regional court decided, upon a request by a representative of the russian post, to close proceedings to the public.on 4 june 2009 the supreme court quashed the conviction on one count and upheld the remainder of the verdict and sentence.the court of appeal held, in particular, that the decision to dispense with a public hearing had been lawful and rejected, in a summary fashion, the relevant arguments by the applicant.
11.  on 25 january 2007 the district court dismissed the application, finding that the supreme court’s decision of 8 may 2001 had become res judicata and that, consequently, the applicant could not be tried a second time for the same offence.as regards his complaint about the unfairness of the proceedings in absentia, and the domestic courts’ dismissal of his application for leave to appeal out of time, the constitutional court noted that the applicant had not complained about the domestic courts’ decisions taken in absentia (see paragraphs 6-8 above).in addition, it noted that although the appeals before the supreme court against the lower courts’ decision were lodged by the co‑accused and not the applicant, the supreme court had examined and amended the lower courts’ decisions of 17 april and 1 june 1999 also in respect of the applicant.15.  on an unspecified date in 2007 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal against the district court’s decision of 17 april 1999, the court of appeal’s decision of 1 june 1999 and the supreme court’s decision of 8 may 2001 complaining about his conviction in absentia.16.  on 21 september 2007 the constitutional court dismissed the appeal as having been lodged out of time, considering that the two-year time-limit had started to run as from 8 may 2001. the decision was communicated to the applicant’s lawyer on 25 september 2007.
6.  on 30 september 2007 a reading out of a press statement and a march were held in diyarbakır in order to protest about the conditions of detention and alleged poisoning of abdullah öcalan, the leader of the pkk (kurdistan workers’ party), an illegal armed organisation.the protesters gathered in front of the building of the diyarbakır branch of the democratic society party (demokratik toplum partisi) (dtp) where a press statement was read out.the applicant, as a member of the dtp, participated in the gathering and the ensuing march.8.  on 17 october 2007 the diyarbakır public prosecutor charged the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no.the court found it established, on the basis of an expert report on the police video footage, that the applicant had been together with other persons who had chanted the slogan “be serok jiyan nabe” (“there is no life without the leader”) and that she had carried a banner which read “the humanity is being poisoned”.
it firstly held that the time‑limit for claiming damages was three years after the damage arose, and accordingly dismissed the part of the applicant’s claim concerning the period before 27 july 2009 as time‑barred.the court then examined various documents provided by the prison authorities and found that, during the remaining period, for about one year and seven months the size of the personal space afforded to the applicant had not complied with the domestic requirements (until 11 may 2010 the minimum personal space in prison cells stipulated by domestic law was 5 sq.9.  the court also found, on the basis of reports submitted by domestic public healthcare authorities, that the temperature and the amount of natural light in some of the cells in which the applicant had been detained had not complied with domestic hygiene norms.15.  however, the court noted that the applicant had been allowed to move freely around the correctional facility during the day, except when he had been serving disciplinary penalties, and that the material conditions of his detention had been appropriate.the court considered that, despite the fact that the applicant had been allowed to move freely during the day and that the material conditions of detention had been appropriate, there were grounds to award him non-pecuniary damages.

6.  by a decision of 4 december 2006 of the cantonal prosecutor of the hercegovina-neretva canton (hercegovačko-neretvanski kanton; one of the ten cantons of the federation of bosnia and herzegovina) the applicant was granted the reimbursement of costs which she had incurred as a witness in the amount of 519 convertible marks (bam)[1].12.  on 18 february 2011 the municipal court partly accepted the objection against the writ of execution specifically as regards the interest on the main debt calculated from 4 january 2007, and the interest on the total costs of the enforcement proceedings.15.  on 23 december 2013 the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina partially accepted the applicant’s appeal and thereby found a violation of her right to a trial within a reasonable time, due to the non-enforcement of the decision of the municipal court of 18 february 2011 (see paragraph 12 above).18.  by a judgment of the municipal court of 3 april 2009, which became final on 16 december 2009, a certain p.m. was ordered to pay the applicant the costs of civil proceedings in the amount of bam 1,959.23.  on 17 september 2013 the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina found a violation of the applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time, due to the duration of the enforcement proceedings before the municipal court.

13.  with regard to the first quote, the court referred to the conclusion of the expert report that the expression “dumped” contained a negative assessment of the claimant as an immoral person and found that, therefore, the passage contained information damaging to his honour and reputation.15.  with regard to the third and fourth quotes, the applicant argued that under articles 34 and 35 of the constitution (see paragraph 24 below) everyone had the right to exercise an entrepreneurial activity and dispose of his or her property and that the quotes in question therefore contained no allegations of unlawful activities and could not be considered as defamatory.16.  the court dismissed the applicant’s arguments and referred to the conclusions of the expert report, which stated that the third and fourth quotes contained information which showed the claimant in a negative light.in that regard the court referred to section 6 of the law on the state of a deputy of the bryansk region duma (see paragraph 26 below) and noted that the claimant had provided it with a certificate from the tax authorities showing that he had not been an individual entrepreneur since 2005. it also took into account certificates from his employer about four business trips in official cars to orel between 2005 and 2007 and concluded that the passages in question contained information damaging to the claimant’s honour and reputation.17.  lastly, with regard to the fifth quote, the court again relied on the findings of the expert report, which stated that the impugned passage contained information damaging to the claimant’s honour and reputation as it implied antisocial conduct on his part by suggesting that he had pursued his own enrichment instead of defending the interests of the public.
33.  pursuant to a decision of the president of the supreme court, the case was referred to the lugansk regional court of appeal (“the lugansk court”) as a first-instance court, which started the trial on 22 february 2010.it observed that, while the issue of a preventive measure had not been dealt with within that set of proceedings, the applicant was already detained in a different context under the judgment of 20 march 2012. accordingly, the rubizhne court ordered his pre-trial detention as the most appropriate preventive measure pending trial in respect of the severed charge also.38.  on 12 december 2012 the higher specialised court for civil and criminal matters (“the higher specialised court”) modified the lugansk court’s judgment of 20 march 2012. it held that the applicant was to be absolved from serving the sentence altogether, given that the only charge which had entailed the imposition of that sentence (abuse of office on account of the falsification of the case file in respect of v. – see paragraph 36 above) had become time-barred as well.the documentary was about the agreement between v. and the law-enforcement officials, and the subsequent murder of v. and b. the applicant was named as the person who had proposed the agreement and as b.’s murderer.46.  the government submitted that they were not in a position to provide a description of the material conditions of the applicant’s detention in the lugansk sizo given that, following the outbreak of the armed conflict in the eastern ukraine in 2014, lugansk was on non-government controlled territory.

on 21 september 2011 the municipal court upheld on appeal this judgment in respect of the tenant but quashed it in respect of the state on the grounds that the publication of the plenary opinion in 2009[1] should have been taken into account for the calculation of the beginning of the three-year statutory limitation period under section 32(1) of the state liability act.29.  in a judgment of 17 june 2010 the district court ordered the tenant to pay czk 17,223.30 (eur 678), which corresponded to the difference between the payments that the tenant had actually made during the relevant period and the amount which was supposed to be paid according to the previous judgment of the prague 8 district court (see paragraph 26 above).34.  on 7 october 2004 he brought an action against the state, represented by the ministry of finance, for damages in the amount of czk 772,524 (eur 30,414), corresponding to the difference between the regulated rent and the market rent in the locality in question for the period from 1 january 2003 until 31 december 2003. he submitted that the state was responsible for his loss of profit owing to its inactivity and continuing unlawful interference with his proprietary rights.46.  on 31 may 2007 he brought an action against the state ( represented by the ministry of finance) and his tenant for damages in the amount of czk 129,448 (eur 5,096), corresponding to the difference between the regulated rent and the market rent in the locality in question for the period from 1 june 2004 until 31 march 2006. on 20 august 2009 he withdrew the action against the tenant but maintained his claim against the state.51.  the state lodged an appeal on points of law with the supreme court, which quashed the decisions of the lower courts in respect of the award of damages and legal costs on 23 april 2013. the rest of the decision of the district court, namely the part concerning unawarded interest in the amount of czk 31,240 (eur 1,230), became final, as no appeal was lodged against it.

the letter also cited a statement from the ministry of health and social welfare (ministarstvo zdravstva i socijalne skrbi republike hrvatske - hereinafter “the ministry of health”) issued in august 2011 and published on the croatian chamber of midwives’ website: “having regard to the current circumstances, where the requirements for organising a system of professionally conducted home births do not exist (education and training of personnel) and where the other accompanying elements (availability of emergency transport and proper admission [to a medical facility] in the case of complications) which would enable safe delivery at home are lacking, we are of the opinion that in this area of healthcare the lawmaker has ensured, as far as possible, all the conditions for the care of mothers and the right of children to life and health.considering the above, we are of the opinion that the protection of children, who do not choose the circumstances of their coming into this world, takes precedence over respect for a woman’s right to freely choose to give birth outside a medical facility.” the croatian chamber of midwives thus declined to assist with the applicant’s planned home birth.in the event of a delivery outside a medical facility and where a woman claiming to be the mother did not have any medical documentation, the doctor carrying out the first examination of the child was obliged to make note of the absence of such documents.13.  on 25 august 2011 the ministry of administration (ministarstvo uprave republike hrvatske) sent a letter in reply to an enquiry from the parents in action - roda ngo (roditelji u akciji – roda) stating that the law provided for the possibility to register the civil status of a child born outside a medical facility.17.  in the concluding observations on the combined fourth and fifth periodic reports on croatia issued on 24 july 2015, the committee on the elimination of discrimination against women expressed concern regarding the lack of oversight procedures and mechanisms for ensuring adequate standards of care, the protection of women’s rights and their autonomy during deliveries and the lack of options for giving birth outside hospitals.
the procurator general opposed suspension of the applicant’s detention, arguing that there was a high risk of absconding, given that the applicant was a wealthy businessman in whose home two identity cards from columbia and the dominican republic had been found during a search, and that he had use of a private jet in the united states of america.he argued, inter alia, that the prospects of his extradition being found permissible were at best highly doubtful, in the absence of guarantees by the italian authorities that he would be allowed to serve a possible prison sentence in sint maarten or elsewhere in the kingdom of the netherlands and that a sentence imposed in italy would be converted into a penal sanction prescribed by dutch law for the same offence.19.  on 12 april 2017 the joint court rejected the applicant’s request of 21 march 2017. it noted that the procurator general opposed the request, submitting that it was a fact of common knowledge that the prison infrastructure of sint maarten offered room for improvement, but that this was the responsibility of the minister of justice of sint maarten.21.  on 20 june 2017, following a hearing held on 16 may 2017, the joint court declared the applicant’s extradition permissible on the basis of the facts as set out in the decision of 21 november 2016 of the civil and criminal court of rome, facts which also constituted criminal offences under the laws of sint maarten.in respect of the duration of his detention at that facility, the joint court noted that, although on legal grounds it had prohibited the sint maarten prosecution department from transferring the applicant – who had fiercely opposed such a transfer – to a place of detention in another country within the kingdom of the netherlands, it remained open to the applicant to consent voluntarily to such a transfer.
the court further noted that the public sale by tender in 2008 had been conducted in contravention of certain regulations (in particular, the announcement concerning the sale had not been published in the newspapers indicated in the state-approved list) and refused to apply the three-year statute of limitations to the agency’s claims.the court considered that the district court had erred in the interpretation of the applicable legislation and that the plot of land with the lake could be owned by a private party.in this connection the court referred to the fact that (1) the state had been aware that the contested property had left its possession back in 2003 when the plot of land had been sold by the state farm to a private company and the new owner’s title to the property had been registered in the state land register and (2) the state had been aware that the applicant had owned the plot of land since 2008 when the applicant’s title to the property had been registered in the state land register.it rejected the applicant’s request to apply the statute of limitations, considering that the agency had learnt about the infringement of the state’s rights in respect of the plot of land only in 2012 after receiving a letter from the federal water resources agency (федеральное агентство водных ресурсов россии).it noted that the applicant had been the owner of the plot of land in 2011 and that the parties had not furnished any evidence to the contrary.

6.  on 8 march 2008 the applicant was summoned to a local police station in abovyan where he was questioned about the leaflets that he had prepared and distributed among the demonstrators during the rallies.8.  on the same date the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan (the district court) ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention for a period of two months, namely until 8 may 2008, taking into account the nature and the gravity of the imputed offence and the severity of the punishment prescribed for it.10.  on 21 march 2008 the criminal court of appeal decided to dismiss the applicant’s appeal, holding that the fact that the applicant had been accused of a grave offence punishable by up to ten years’ imprisonment increased the probability of his evading criminal punishment.furthermore, it was unacceptable to release the applicant on bail in view of the fact that, if at large, the applicant could abscond, obstruct the proceedings, commit another offence, evade responsibility and punishment, and continue to breach public order.13.  on 10 december 2008 the trial court decided to set the case down for trial, ruling in the same decision that the applicant’s detention was to remain unchanged.
the applicant, who was present at freedom square at that time, was arrested and later charged under article 316 § 1 of the criminal code (cc) with assaulting police officers.6.  on 4 march 2008 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention for a period of two months, namely until 1 may 2008, on the ground that the applicant, if at large, might abscond and obstruct the investigation by exerting unlawful influence on the persons involved in the criminal proceedings.8.  on 21 march 2008 the criminal court of appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that the fact that the applicant was accused of a grave offence punishable by up to ten years’ imprisonment increased the probability of his evading criminal liability and punishment and was sufficient to conclude that the applicant, if at large, might commit a new offence.10.  on 13 may 2008 the district court decided to set the case down for trial, ruling in the same decision that the applicant’s detention was to remain unchanged.11.  on 11 june 2008 the district court found the applicant guilty under article 316 § 1 of the cc of assaulting police officers and sentenced him to a suspended term of one and a half years’ imprisonment.
8.  the applicant submitted that throughout his detention in kielce remand centre, he had been held in overcrowded cells in which the space per person had been below the polish statutory minimum standard of 3 m².however, they emphasised that the space in each cell had exceeded 2 m² per person and that the hardship caused by staying in an overcrowded cell had been compensated by adding 30 minutes to his daily walk as well as additional cultural and educational classes or sports activities.10.  in the course of civil proceedings instituted by the applicant, the domestic courts established that for twenty-eight days the applicant had been detained in an overcrowded cell (see also paragraph 13 below).cells were equipped in compliance with the relevant law; they were properly ventilated and the toilet area had been separated from the rest of the living space in the cells.it confirmed, however, that temporarily (from 6 september to 4 october 2012) the applicant had been detained in cells in which the space per person had been below the polish statutory minimum standard of 3 m², but not below 2 m².
the court applied this measure due to the high probability that the applicant had committed the offence with which he was charged, the severity of the maximum sentence provided by law for such offence (up to at least eight years’ imprisonment) and the fact that the likelihood of such a penalty might induce the applicant to obstruct the proceedings, as well as the fear that the applicant might influence other persons to present a version of events favourable to him.the court again relied on the severity of the anticipated sentence and possibly adverse consequences that the applicant’s release could have for the ongoing investigation.17.  in the meantime, the warsaw regional court extended the applicant’s detention on remand on 13 march, 4 july and 20 september 2012. the two latter decisions were upheld by the warsaw court of appeal (sąd apelacyjny) on 31 july and 4 october 2012 respectively.18.  the warsaw court of appeal extended the applicant’s detention on 4 october 2012, 15 january, 13 june and 28 october 2013, 13 march, 29 july and 30 december 2014, 25 june and 22 october 2015 and on 26 january 2016. the court relied on a high probability that the applicant and other accused had committed the offences with which they had been charged and on the complexity of the case.the relevant decisions were often phrased in general terms and no particular instances of the applicant’s conduct during the investigation or at the judicial stage was provided to substantiate the extension of detention on remand.
and the austrian christian social working group [christlich soziale arbeitsgemeinschaft österreichs] wish to make known their opposition to the press release issued by the university of bonn on 13 december 2007, which bears the signatures of eighteen well-known professors and in which the professors express their outrage at the comments made by bishop f. [name abbreviated by the court] comparing modern-day stem-cell research to the experiments on human beings carried out by the nazis.in its judgment the court acknowledged the applicant’s right to freedom of expression and to impart to others his beliefs that the fusion of an egg and a sperm represented the beginning of human life and that research using imported stem cells from terminated embryos involved the destruction of human life.the court based this decision on the fact that the implication that the scientists had been guilty not just of committing murder but of doing so for deeply despicable motives had been a central theme running through the press release and had escalated in the phrase “the time has finally arrived to overcome the spirit of auschwitz”.the court concluded that this was not applicable in the case at hand, since the applicant’s past behaviour and the content of the press release showed that the focus had been on “the issue” rather than the individual doctor against whom allegations had been made.the regional court took into account that the press release had represented the applicant’s contribution to the formation of public opinion, but believed that referring to prof. dr b. by name had been equivalent to linking his professional conduct to the atrocities committed by the nazis.
it emphasised, however, that the public prosecutor’s office was not affected by the guarantee of the right to an impartial tribunal and that the president’s powers of appointment had not infringed the right to a fair trial: “... the fact that, in the present case, the public prosecutor’s offices both of nanterre and of versailles had endeavoured to ensure that the case was examined as quickly as possible, and exceptional means of investigation were deployed (serious crime squad and fraud squad), could no doubt be attributed to the identity of the victim, but also to the fact that members of his family were affected by the same offences, those factors suggesting that a large-scale action targeting the head of state and his family was likely to have been organised on account of their identity.moreover, ... article 64 of the constitution states ... that the president is the guarantor of the judicial authority, and this provision legitimises, at the highest level of the hierarchy of legal norms – and even when the president of the republic is a party to the proceedings – his powers over the public prosecutor’s office, while also ruling out any doubt as to the independence of the judiciary ... [the applicant] cannot dispute the president’s capacity to act as an ordinary citizen.in those conditions, as there is nothing to show that the public prosecutor’s office or the power to appoint judges and prosecutors caused any concrete impairment of the independence or impartiality of the judges, the objection is unfounded.” 12.  the applicant appealed on points of law and, in addition to complaining of a breach of his right to a fair trial, argued that article 2 of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 31 below) was unconstitutional as it did not preclude the president of the republic from joining criminal proceedings as a civil party.in the meantime, in pleadings of 16 august 2010, the applicant asked the court of cassation to refer a question to the constitutional council for a preliminary ruling on constitutionality (question prioritaire de constitutionnalité – “qpc”) relating to the compatibility of the above-mentioned article 2 with the principle of the separation of powers and the rights of the defence, and with the right to a fair trial.the question raised does not have any serious merit in so far as it seeks, in reality, to clarify the scope of article 2 of the code of criminal procedure, in the light of article 67 of the constitution, and thus falls within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts.” 14.  in his opinion before the court of cassation, the advocate-general called for the partial quashing of the judgment of the court of appeal in so far as it had not stayed its ruling on mr sarkozy’s civil action until the end of his term of office.
based on the evidence, the court accepts as fact that the copenhagen police had received intelligence prior to the international football match between denmark and sweden on 10 october 2009 that danish and swedish hooligan groups had arranged to meet in connection with the match and that the police had seen the first large fight between danish and swedish football fans at amagertorv square at 3.41 p.m. this implied a concrete and imminent risk of disturbance of public order, and the police were under a duty to attempt to prevent such disturbance; see section 5(1) of the police act.according to the evidence given by police constable p.w., compared with the police report prepared by the same witness on 11 october 2009 (exhibits 47 and 48), the court accepts as fact that [the second and third applicants] were detained after the witness had specifically seen the persons concerned talking with an activist from the local brøndby faction of south side united on 10 october 2009 and issuing orders to others, in combination with the fact that the persons concerned were known to the police for having been detained several times previously in connection with similar football events.based on the evidence, the court accepts as fact that during the afternoon and evening, about 138 persons were detained, half of them being detained pursuant to the police act; that the unrest continued for the rest of the afternoon and all evening; and that the detention of the plaintiffs was ended as soon as the city centre had become quiet, in the assessment of the police, after a group comprising thirty-five danes was arrested towards midnight.the court finds, in the circumstances of the present case, that there is no basis for invalidating the assessment made by the police, according to which the release of the detainees before the city centre had become quiet would have entailed a concrete and imminent risk of further unrest, including clashes with spectators who had been let out of the national stadium after the end of the match and who were still in the streets in large numbers.whilst the legislative intent of the provision is to extend detention to more than six hours only in exceptional situations, if an extension is not justified by practical issues related to the detention of a large number of people that render it impossible to observe the maximum period, the court finds on the above grounds, in view of the purpose of the detentions compared with the organised nature, scope and duration of the unrest, as well as the length of the specific periods by which the maximum periods had been exceeded, that the conditions for detaining [the applicants] pursuant to section 5(3) of the police act for more than six hours were met.
1638/03) that, where the person to be expelled is a young adult who has not yet founded a family of his or her own, the relevant criteria for the assessment of proportionately, see article 8 of the european convention on human rights, are as follows: (a) the nature and seriousness of the offence committed by that person, (b) the length of the person’s stay in the country from which he or she is to be expelled, (c) the time elapsed since the offence was committed and the person’s conduct during that period, and (d) the solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the host country and with the country of destination.when an assessment is made of the length of the person’s stay in the host country and the solidity of the ties with the host country, it evidently makes a difference whether the person concerned had already come to the country during his or her childhood or youth, or was even born there, or whether he or she only came to the host country as an adult.[the applicant] has furthermore been convicted of robbery twice after he has attained the age of 18. the first of those sentences was imposed on 11 june 2008 when he was found guilty of a street robbery and a robbery at a shop contrary to section 288, subsection 1 (i) and (ii) of the criminal code and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years and suspended expulsion from denmark.against this background, the court finds that altogether such very serious reasons exist that the defendant must be expelled and permanently banned from re-entry as set out in section 22, subsection 1(vi), section 26, subsection 2) and section 32, subsection 2 (v) of the aliens act, in which connection it is observed that the expulsion order is deemed not to be contrary to denmark’s international obligations.” 20.  on appeal, by a judgment of 26 august 2013 the high court of eastern denmark (østre landsret - henceforth “the high court”) upheld the conviction, the sentence and the expulsion order.22.  in december 2013, pursuant to council framework decision 2008-909-jha of 27 november 2008 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty for the purpose of their enforcement in the european union, as amended by council framework decision 2009-299-jha of 26 february 2009, the ministry of justice requested the croatian authorities to take over the enforcement of the sentences imposed on the applicant by the high court judgment of 9 november 2010 and the high court judgment of 26 august 2013.
11.  following an appeal by the applicant, on 5 march 2013 the tartu court of appeal quashed the above-mentioned decision because, contrary to the ccrp, the first-instance court had not examined the case in oral proceedings.the court of appeal noted that under article 402-1 § 3 and article 403 § 5 of the ccrp (see paragraph 21 below), the ordering of a new expert report had not been compulsory and the first-instance court had been entitled to rely solely on the written opinion of the medical committee or to question the attending doctor at a hearing.it observed that there was no reason to doubt the conclusions of the medical committee’s opinion of 11 december 2012 or the reliability of the head of the coercive treatment department.the court of appeal held that in a situation where the state of o.t.’s health and adherence to the treatment had not improved and the discontinuation of his inpatient treatment or its replacement with outpatient treatment was in the doctors’ opinion excluded, ordering another expert examination would have been irrelevant.19.  on 18 september 2017 the government notified the court that the psychiatric treatment of the applicant’s son had been terminated, at the request of the applicant, by a decision of the tartu county court of 21 september 2016.
10.  throughout the proceedings the trial court ordered the continuation of the applicants’ detention on remand.between the hearings, with regular intervals of one month, the court ex officio examined the applicants’ detentions on the basis of the case-file and decided to extend.11.  at the end of the hearing held on 13 october 2008, the trial court decided once again to prolong the applicants’ detention.subsequently, their lawyer filed an objection against the decision of 13 october 2008. on 11 november 2008 the 13th chamber of the istanbul assize court dismissed the objection, without holding an oral hearing and based on the written opinions of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicants or to their representative.the court also ordered the continuation of the first applicant’s detention and the release of the second applicant.
8.  on 26 december 2011 the kragujevac appellate court (“the appellate court”) quashed the decision of 20 may 2011 and remitted the case to the first instance court.12.  on 21 august 2014 the appellate court rejected the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of 20 march 2013. thereafter, the applicant filed an appeal on points of law, which was rejected by the supreme court of cassation only on 21 december 2016.13.  in the meantime, on 7 february 2013, the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court complaining about the length of the pending civil proceedings, seeking non-pecuniary damages in the amount of 3,000 euros and publication of the decision of the constitutional court.the constitutional court transferred the case-file to the appellate court, as a competent court to deal with the length complaints of the pending cases, pursuant to article 8a of the law on the organization of the courts.15.  on 22 january 2015 the supreme court of cassation rejected the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of 28 november 2014. it also partially adopted the applicant’s complaint concerning the length of the proceedings and awarded him 200 euros for non-pecuniary damage, whereas the rest of claim rejected.
11.  on 30 december 2003 the municipal court annulled the decision on the applicant’s dismissal of 26 may 2003 by partial judgment, establishing that everyone charged with a criminal offence should be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a court of law, and that a broad interpretation of article 45 of the ministry of interior act 1991 in regards to the persons who were not found guilty could be only to their detriment.it found that the dismissal of 26 may 2006 had been in accordance with the article 45, read in conjunction with article 34 (1)(2) of the ministry of interior act 1991, and that the mere fact that the criminal proceedings had been pending against the applicant was sufficient reason for the applicant’s dismissal.however, the municipal court, the district court and the supreme court, by their judgments of 27 october 2005, 10 may 2007 and 18 december 2007, respectively, all ruled against him and upheld his dismissal on the basis of article 45, read in conjunction with article 34 (1)(2), of the ministry of interior act 1991.in regards to the court judgments of 31 october 2003, 17 june 2004 and 9 march 2005 the constitutional court established that the his complaints were inadmissible ratione temporis given that the serbian constitution had come into force on 8 november 2006, i.e. after the first set of the proceedings concerning the applicant’s dismissal.on the other hand, with respect to the judgments of 27 october 2005, 10 may and 18 december 2007, the constitutional court found that they were not arbitrary, and upheld the legality of the applicant’s second dismissal on the basis of article 45, read in conjunction with article 34 (1)(2), of the ministry of interior act 1991. in the constitutional court’s view, the fact that the applicant was ultimately dismissed on 4 july 2005, instead of on 26 may 2003, was only in the applicant’s favour, and that fact alone could not affect the legality of his “dismissal as such”.
7.  on 8 october 2010 the applicant was charged with contempt of court and criminal libel of the judge who presided over the appeal proceedings in the first criminal case (“the second criminal case”).8.  on 29 august 2007 the investigator made the applicant sign an undertaking to stay in novosibirsk for the duration of the proceedings in the first criminal case.her decision was upheld on appeal by the district court on 27 january 2009 and by the regional court on 16 march 2009. the regional court justified its decision in the following manner: “mr manannikov stated at the hearing that, should the travel restriction be lifted, he would move freely in the russian territory and also go abroad.at the preliminary hearing on 1 july 2011, the novosibirsk regional court accepted that the rights of the defence had been undermined by reason of the investigator’s failure to address the applicant’s objections to the participation of the legal-aid lawyer.they told the applicant that he would be taken to another judge of the same court who would decide on the investigator’s application for his placement for an in-patient psychiatric assessment in the framework of the second criminal case.
5.  on 30 may 2000 the belgrade third municipal court ordered a socially-owned company kmg trudbenik (hereinafter “the debtor company”), based in belgrade, to pay to the applicant a specified amount on account of salary arrears, plus the costs of the civil proceedings (judgment no.6.  on 13 march 2002, upon the applicant’s request to that effect, the fourth belgrade municipal court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor company to pay the applicant’s enforcement costs (enforcement order no.7.  on 7 october 2003 the enforcement proceedings were suspended due to the institution of compulsory settlement proceedings before the belgrade commercial court (“the commercial court”).11.  on 6 august and 27 october 2014 the applicant complained about the inactivity of the acting judge in the insolvency proceedings.13.  on 28 january 2015 the commercial appellate court rejected the applicant’s appeal, and upheld the commercial court’s decision of 13 october 2014.
6.  on 20 december 2014 the bratislava iv district court ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention in the context of criminal proceedings in which he was prosecuted for committing the criminal offence of manslaughter.9.  the applicant’s lawyer lodged a written interlocutory appeal with the district court within the statutory three-day period, namely on 24 april 2015. the case file was transferred to the bratislava regional court on 29 april 2015 and the applicant’s appeal was dismissed in chambers on 7 may 2015. the written version of that decision was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 18 may 2015.he formally challenged the proceedings held before the district curt, the decision of the regional court of 7 may 2015 and the proceedings preceding this decision.11.  on 30 march 2016 the constitutional court declared the part of his complaint in respect of the proceedings held before the district court admissible and the remainder inadmissible.with respect to the financial compensation, the constitutional court referred to “the principle of fairness”, “the particular circumstances of the case”, the duration of the delays and the intensity of the interference, and concluded that the finding of a violation of the applicant’s right constituted a sufficient redress.
the moscow city department of the federal registration service (the “registration service”) registered the deed and ya.’s title to the rooms.9.  on 11 july 2008 the preobrazhenskiy district court of moscow issued a seizure order in respect of the rooms within the framework of the criminal investigation on the charges of fraud against m. 10.  on 16 july 2008 the registration service registered the sale agreement between ya.the court established that m. had tricked n. into signing the deed of gift in respect of the two rooms whilst m. had actually sold the rooms to ya.13.  on 7 february 2014 the department of housing of the city of moscow (the “housing department”) brought a civil action seeking restitution of the title to the two rooms to the city of moscow and the applicant’s eviction.the court transferred the title to the rooms to the city of moscow and ordered the applicant’s eviction.
6.  on 10 august 2011 the competition protection office (“the office”) initiated proceedings against the applicant company under section 23 of the prevention of the restriction of competition act (hereinafter “the competition act”, see paragraph 25 below), following a complaint from two television stations that the applicant company had abused its dominant position.8.  on 21 september 2011 the office issued an inspection report which indicated that on 11 august 2011 officers of the office had arrived at the applicant company’s premises at 9.05 a.m. mr v., the applicant company’s director, had not been present and none of the applicant company’s employees had allowed the inspection to be carried out.in particular, the four witnesses, who had been present at the premises on the day of the alleged obstruction, would prove that the applicant company had not obstructed the inspection or refused to cooperate with the officers.the court emphasised that although the applicant company had contested the facts as established by the office (see paragraph 10 above), it had not challenged the fact that the officers could not immediately after their arrival at the company’s premises secure the evidence.the agency also ordered the applicant company to end the above infringement of competition rules, notably section 9 of the competition act and article 102 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu).
the court considered that the detention was necessary because the applicant was accused of a serious offence and there appeared to be a risk of his interfering with the investigation, absconding and re-offending.10.  on 11 july 2014 the ialoveni district court examined the prosecutor’s request for a prolongation of the applicant’s detention and a habeas corpus request lodged by the applicant.14.  on 17 september 2014 the prosecutor’s office lodged an application for the prolongation of the applicant’s detention arguing, inter alia, that between 22 july 2014 and 25 august 2014 the applicant had absconded from the investigating authority.19.   on 22 october 2014 the applicant requested access to the casefile with a view to obtaining a copy of the materials filed by the public prosecutor together with his application of 7 october 2014. he argued that the public prosecutor’s application was accompanied by a set of documents, while he had only received a copy of the application.20.  on 22 october 2014 the ialoveni district court upheld the public prosecutor’s application and ordered the prolongation of the applicant’s detention for thirty days on the ground that there was a risk of absconding and interfering with the investigation.
it held: “having analysed the entirety of the evidence in the case file, including the child authorities’ opinions on the merits of the case, [the district court] made a reasoned finding that granting a residence order in respect of [x] to the father was not in the interests of the child who, after the parents’ separation, had been brought up by his mother.furthermore, the refusal to examine the first applicant’s counterclaim had not breached his rights as the domestic courts had to give a residence order to the parent who could better meet the needs of the child, irrespective of which of the parents had been the first to apply for a residence order in his or her favour and of whether the other parent had lodged a counterclaim or not.46.  on 18 april 2017 a judge of the supreme court of the russian federation refused to refer the first applicant’s cassation appeal against the contact order of 27 april 2016, as upheld on appeal on 25 october 2016, to the civil chamber of the supreme court, finding no significant violations of substantive or procedural law which had influenced the outcome of the proceedings.there had been important delays in the proceedings attributable to the district court, in particular excessively long intervals between hearings, adjournments caused by repeated failures to inform the parties of the dates of scheduled hearings and substantial delays in serving the reasoned judgment of 4 april 2014 and the hearing record on the parties and in forwarding the parties’ statements of appeal to the regional court.56.  on 27 november 2015 a judge of the supreme court of the russian federation refused to refer the first applicant’s cassation appeal against the decision of 8 may 2015, as upheld on appeal on 8 july 2015, to the administrative chamber of the supreme court, finding no significant violations of substantive or procedural law which had influenced the outcome of the proceedings.
accordingly, we find that it cannot lead to a revocation of the expulsion order that [the applicant] and his spouse living in denmark, whom he married in a muslim ceremony, have three minor children from their marriage, that he has received visits from his spouse and children about once a week since his arrest and that his spouse cannot enter jordan because of her debt to the former authorities.in this respect we have emphasised that the information about the children, including the disease of the eldest child, was known at the time of the judgment delivered by the high court on 25 november 2009. the immigration service also finds that the unsubstantiated information provided by [the applicant’s] counsel, that several of [the applicant’s] children suffer from mental problems as a result of the separation from [the applicant] cannot lead to a revocation of the expulsion order either...” 21.  in connection with the case, the applicant’s ex-wife, x, gave statements to the police on 7 and 12 september 2012. her statements, reproduced in two police reports, were read out in the district court and stated, inter alia: “x stated that she and the applicant had been married from 1997 to 2001. x was now a danish national, but was originally a stateless palestinian from lebanon.from thursday to sunday of the same week, he would live in the institution and go to the special school from there....” 22.  before the district court, x confirmed the statements that she had given to the police.as material changes in his circumstances, [the applicant] has referred to the circumstances that the health of his children has deteriorated, that his wife’s possibility of accompanying him to jordan following his deportation has been reduced, and that during the period since the high court judgment of 25 november 2009 the risk has increased that he will also be punished in jordan for the drug offence for which he has served a sentence in denmark.as article 8 of the european convention on human rights has accordingly not been violated either, the court cannot allow his claim that the expulsion order be revoked.” 26.  the applicant filed an appeal against the decision with the high court, before which the applicant and x were heard, and the ministry of foreign affairs was consulted anew.
the proceedings were brought against the attorney general (hereinafter referred to as “the ag”), the prime minister (hereinafter referred to as “the pm”) and the king’s own band club (the lessee).keeping in mind the estimated rental values presented before the court, and the income that the kobc was generating from its bar, the court awarded eur 300,000 in damages to the applicants (to be paid half by the ag and the pm jointly, and half by the kobc).however, in line with domestic case-law the constitutional court concluded that, because the agreement had been entered into voluntarily with full knowledge of the consequences it would lead to (that is, that the rent due could not be raised and the rent agreement could not be terminated), then the applicants could not allege a violation of their rights.the constitutional court further held that the amendments to the law of 2009, mentioned by the applicants, did not affect their position which remained the same as that when the rent agreement had been entered into [in 1946], and therefore there was no reason for the principle of pacta sunt servanda (“agreements must be complied with”) not to be given full effect.20.  the regulations provided that the rent payable to the owners by the band clubs holding the property under title of lease was to be increased by 10% (from the previous year) every year until 2016 and as from 1 january 2016 the rent was to be increased by 5% (from the previous year) every year until 2023, following which it would increase every year according to the index of inflation.
35.  in november 2007 the investigators obtained statements from the police officers on duty at the time of the arrest, mr kh.v, and mr a.d. they stated that on 21 may 2004 officers from the north-caucasus regional operative military headquarters and/or the federal security service (“the fsb”) had arrived at their traffic police station and arrested three persons on suspicion of their being members of an illegal armed group.in the meantime, in september and november 2003 the investigators examined the crime scene and questioned the applicants’ neighbour, ms r.a, who had witnessed the events of 1 december 2001. her statements were similar to those of the applicants before the court.84.  from the material in the case file it appears that between 2003 and 2005 the investigative authorities took some steps, the nature of which is unknown, as the copies of the relevant documents submitted by the government are illegible.120.  after the first applicant lodged a complaint with the government of the chechen republic the investigation was resumed on 20 january 2006. on the same day the authorities carried out an examination of the crime scene.172.  on 6 april 2005 the investigator in charge of the case issued an information note describing the course of the proceedings and the main versions of the events, according to which mr zayndi dudarkayev had been variously abducted by servicemen, members of an illegal armed group, or private persons aiming to extract information/obtain a ransom or to pursue a blood feud.
they were to travel to moscow by train, however, x did not show up at the train station at the time of leaving and the applicant left for moscow alone with the money he had previously obtained from x in the amount of 520 euros.8.  since the prosecutor in charge of the case could not locate the applicant, he applied to an investigating judge for a detention warrant in respect of the applicant for a period of thirty days.in support of its decision, the court argued that the applicant had been absconding from the investigating authorities and that he could hinder the investigation and influence witnesses.at the border he was informed that he was being wanted by the police and that he had to present himself at the râșcani police station.12.  on 15 october 2015 the applicant appealed against the order of 8 february 2013. he argued, inter alia, that he had not been aware of the criminal investigation against himself and that he had learned about it upon his return to moldova.
35.  five years later, on 28 february 2014, the investigation was resumed, particularly, due to the need to examine the applicants’ consistent allegation of the involvement of state servicemen in the abduction, which had not been duly examined since the beginning of the criminal proceedings.76.  on 16 october 2004 an officer of the valerik traffic police informed the head of the achkhoy-martan district police that on the night of the abduction a convoy of military vehicles, consisting of two apcs and two ural lorries without registration numbers, had left valerik, passed through a checkpoint, and driven off in the direction of urus-martan.82.  on 2 july 2010 the first applicant asked the authorities to inform her about the progress in the investigation and to resume the proceedings in the criminal case.123.  on the same date, 27 july 2002, the investigators questioned the second applicant, who stated, in particular, that a few days after the abduction she had seen the abductors’ uaz vehicle entering the premises of the shatoy district police station.127.  on 16 february 2008 the first applicant requested that the investigators inform her about the progress in the proceedings, and sought information from the federal service for the execution of sentences on the possible detention of mr aslambek abdurzakov in russian detention facilities.
14.  on 24 october 1994 the diyarbakır public prosecutor issued an indictment charging the applicant and twenty-one others under article 125 of the former turkish criminal code with seeking to destroy the unity of the turkish state and to remove part of the country from the state’s control by killing and injuring numerous individuals.16.  at the second hearing held on 23 january 1995 the applicant gave evidence in the presence of his lawyer and retracted the statements he had made to the police and the public prosecutor, alleging that they had been obtained through torture.24.  while the criminal proceedings against the applicant were pending, on 18 june 1999 the constitution was amended and the military judge sitting on the bench of the diyarbakır state security court was replaced by a civilian judge.26.  at the hearing of 20 july 1999, the diyarbakır state security court, composed of three civilian judges, read out the previous reports as a result of the change in the composition of the trial court.the trial court relied on, inter alia, the statements the applicant had given to the police and the public prosecutor, the reports of the reconstruction of events and the on-site inspection, as well as the statements of some of the co-accused and the witness f.e.
it first of all reiterated and expressed its agreement with the conclusions of the milan court in its decision of 3 october 2014. it referred to the reports prepared by the medical staff at san paolo hospital and the independent medical experts appointed by the milan court in concluding that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the applicant’s medical conditions, he was not being detained in a correctional facility, but rather in a civilian hospital, and was responding to the treatment administered in that setting.54.  by a decision of 9 june 2015 the court of cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal lodged against the milan court’s decision of 3 october 2014. it considered that the reasoning of the milan court hinged on the need to safeguard the detainee’s right to health to the fullest extent possible, and could not be deemed to be at odds with the provisions of the criminal code regulating stays of execution of prison sentences for health reasons.60.  on 8 march 2013, in an application addressed to three different courts for the execution of sentences (bologna, rome and parma) as well as to the minister of justice, the applicant’s counsel sought revocation of the special prison regime provided for by section 41 bis of the prison administration act, a key argument being that, in the light of the deterioration in the applicant’s cognitive functioning, the reasons as to why the regime had been applied originally were no longer relevant.76.  the order acknowledged that the caltanissetta and florence ddas had confirmed their previous negative opinion as to the renewal of the regime with regard to the applicant, and that the caltanissetta dda had relied on the deterioration in the applicant’s health to reach its conclusions, while the florence dda’s opinion had hinged on the finding that there were no longer any ongoing criminal investigations involving the applicant.with regard to the applicant’s health, the dna reiterated the content of its 2014 opinion on the extension of the special prison regime and quoted extracts from it to the effect that the imposition of such a regime in no way interfered with the applicant’s medical care, and modifying the regime would not have an impact on his health.
in addition, the court found that because of the public nature of the seminars, which had not been limited to members of the freedom party, it was conceivable that at least some of the participants might have been disturbed by the statements.however, the manner in which religious views were attacked could engage the state’s responsibility in order to guarantee the peaceful exercise of the rights under article 9. presenting objects of religious worship in a provocative way capable of hurting the feelings of the followers of that religion could be conceived as a malicious violation of the spirit of tolerance, which was one of the bases of a democratic society.18.  the court of appeal stated that the reason for the applicant’s conviction had not been that the events had purportedly taken place more than a thousand years ago and similar conduct would no longer be tolerable under today’s criminal law and contemporary moral and value concepts, but because the applicant had accused muhammad of paedophilia by using the plural form “children”, “child sex”, “what do we call it, if it is not paedophilia?” without providing evidence that his primary sexual interest in aisha had been her not yet having reached puberty.as to the applicant’s argument that those who had participated in the seminar knew of her critical approach and could not be offended, the court of appeal found that the public seminar had been offered for free to young voters by the austrian freedom party education institute, and at least one participant had been offended, as her complaints had led to the applicant being charged.22.  applying the above considerations to the applicant’s case, the supreme court held that she had not aimed to contribute to a serious debate about islam or the phenomenon of child marriage, but merely to defame muhammad by accusing him of a specific sexual preference, based on the assumption that he had had sexual intercourse with a prepubescent child, in order to show that he was not a worthy subject of worship.
5.  the applicants or their close relatives participated in demonstrations and were injured or killed by gunfire during the events of december 1989 in bucharest, slobozia, târgoviște and reșița, which led to the fall of the communist regime.8.  on 1 november 2016 the military prosecutor ordered the initiation in rem of a criminal investigation for the offence of crimes against humanity in respect of the same circumstances of fact.up to february 2017 further steps were taken in gathering information from domestic authorities, the prosecutor’s office contacting 211 civil parties, questioning members of the political party which took over the presidency at the time of events, planning the taking of evidence from military officers and other participants in the events, verifying the activity of the relevant military units and the audio/video recordings broadcast by radio and television.they questioned military personnel involved in the december 1989 military operations and fifty-one members of the political party which ruled at the time and of other authorities.10.  at the date of the latest information communicated by the parties to the court (29 march 2018), the criminal investigation was still ongoing.
from march to december 2012 the prosecutor and the applicants, along with the other defence counsel in the proceedings, repeatedly submitted arguments in further preliminary hearings about various issues, such as the evidence submitted by the prosecution, the deadline for the defence to file pleadings and the defence’s request to dismiss the case.8.  on 19 december 2012, after consulting the prosecution, the applicants and the other defence counsel, the district court judge decided that the trial would take place from 11 to 23 april 2013. the same day, the second applicant replied to the judge’s email stating that, although it was reasonable to decide dates for the trial, he wanted to remind the judge that the case was not ready for trial at that time because the prosecution had not submitted the requested evidence and issued a witness list.the applicants stated, inter alia, that they had not been informed about the deadline to submit their pleadings to the supreme court before its ruling of 4 april 2013, the prosecution had neglected to send them a copy of its pleadings, the defence had not had adequate access to important documents, the prosecution had tapped telephone conversations between them and their clients and the whole procedure had in general violated their applicants’ rights under the constitution, the cpa and the convention.for reference see the judgment of [the court] in the case of weber v. switzerland from 22 may 1990 and the judgment in the case of t v. austria from 14 november 2000. accordingly, with reference to the reasoning of the appealed judgment, the decision on the fines imposed on [the applicants] must be upheld.” 29.  the minority shared the majority’s opinion that the applicants’ conduct in not attending the trial in the criminal case against their clients had not been in accordance with the law and had been a violation of their duty as defence counsel.30.  however, the minority held as follows: “when it became clear that [the applicants] would not attend the hearing, a hearing should have been convened immediately, according to provisions of [chapter xxxv of the cpa], and [the applicants] given notice of the charges and the opportunity to object to the decision to impose the fines.
on many occasions during the daytime, while the prisoners were absent, searches were carried out in the applicant’s cell, as a result of which the cell was left in a mess and some personal belongings and documents from the applicant’s case file went missing.for example, his letter of 23 february 2009 to the court (which the court, in fact, received in due time) was not sent by the prison administration and the court’s letter of 21 january 2011 was received by him a month after being dispatched by the court.in support of their account of the facts, the government submitted: information notes concerning living conditions in the prison, issued by the prison governor in reply to a request from the government; an extract from the applicant’s detention card concerning the provision of bedding; and records of completed disinfection operations carried out in the prison in july and october 2011.(c)  other issues relating to the applicant’s detention 26.  the government could not provide any factual information about whether any force had been applied to the applicant by prison guards, or about the searches conducted in his cell, because the time-limit for keeping the relevant documents had expired and the records had been destroyed.33.  by a letter dated 14 january 2009, the court invited the applicant to submit a copy of the judgment of the supreme court of 23 october 2007. further to this letter, on 7 february 2009 the applicant submitted requests to the brovary town court and the supreme court, asking for a copy of their refusals to provide him with the judgment requested or a copy of his request with an acknowledgment of receipt.
the court granted the prosecutor’s request and decided to hold the trial in camera in order to protect the interests of the witnesses.11.  on 12 october 2011, having heard the judge rapporteur, the prosecutor, the first applicant and her counsel, the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the first applicant’s conviction in part (one count of abuse of power and one count of bribery in respect of ts.’s attempt to purchase a plot of land) and quashed it in part (one count of abuse of power and one count of bribery in respect of k.’s attempt to purchase a plot of land) remitting the matter for fresh consideration.12.  on 8 october 2013 the regional court found the first applicant guilty as charged, as regards charges of abuse of power and bribery in respect of the bribe paid by k., and sentenced her cumulatively to 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment and a monetary fine.15.  on 31 march 2011 the savelovskiy district court of moscow fixed the trial for 14 april 2011. the court decided to hold the trial in camera in order to ensure security for the parties to the proceedings and their family members.17.  on 14 december 2011, having heard the judge rapporteur, the prosecutor, the second applicant and his counsel and the counsel for the civil party, the moscow city court upheld, in substance, the second applicant’s conviction on appeal.
according to the report, there were two primary reasons for the problematical situation of minorities in turkey: a theoretical reason tending to define the supra-identity in terms of “race” (ırk) and religion as turkish (türk) and not as türkiyeli (“coming from turkey”, “citizen of turkey”), which resulted in alienating the infra-identities of citizens who do not belong to the turkish “race” or the muslim religion; and an historical/political reason stemming from the paranoia (paranoya) inherited from the dismantling of the country in the recent past, a syndrome referred to in the report as “the sèvres syndrome”[1].9.  having explained that the governments in the 1920s and 1930s had attempted to create a homogeneous and monocultural nation, the report stated that, having regard to the presence in the country of a patchwork of different cultures and identities, and in the light of global developments as regards the organisation of society up until the 2000s, now was the time to revise the citizenship concept and to adopt, like all the european nations, a multi-identity, multicultural, democratic, liberal and pluralist societal model.it consequently proposed rewriting the constitution and the relevant legislation from a liberal, pluralist and democratic angle, including the participation of the organised fringes of society; guaranteeing the rights of persons laying claim to different identities and cultures to preserve and develop those identities on the basis of equal citizenship; making central and local administrations more transparent and democratic such as to ensure participation and oversight by the citizens; signing and unreservedly ratifying the international treaties laying down the universal standards of human rights, and in particular the council of europe’s framework convention for the protection of national minorities; and, as regards international treaties, discontinuing the practice of entering reservations or interpretative declarations tending to negate infra-identities in turkey.26.  on 26 october 2004 a.t. published an article in the daily newspaper yeniçağ including the following passages: “the rapporteur for the second set of sèvres negotiations, prof. dr baskın oran ...”, “the treasonous report (ihanet raporu) penned by baskın oran”, “when the time is ripe, they will be held to account for having prepared a treasonous report ...” 27.  another article by a.t., published on 31 october 2004 in the same newspaper, contained the following passage: “... the report, concerning minority and cultural rights, [was drafted by] twenty-four leftist, separatist, subversive [persons] unhappy about the unity of the country [who deserve] the death penalty ...” 28.  on 4 november 2004 the yeniçağ newspaper published another article signed by a.t. which included the following sentences: “f.y.like little dogs rolling over and wagging their tails when their food is served in their dog-bowls or when [they are promised] a bone, they begin their subtle attacks ... those who pose as the eyes, ears and spleen of the trojan horse infiltrating our country, the fools and idiots posing as smart alecs ...; in this report on minorities prepared by this insolent, perfidious and pathetic minority, the losers, who would never have dared commit this type of treason before, are clearly targeting the indivisible integrity of the state and the nation ...; some losers who, their whole lives long, have never got rid of their paranoia about turks ... designate as ‘sèvres paranoia’ the watchful and persevering attitude of those who represent the heart, head and intelligence of our nation against the new sèvres dictates and are attempting to insult them, driven on by their wilfulness; their shared characteristic is apostasy ...; someone has said ‘he who is not a communist at the age of twenty is an ass, and he who is not a capitalist at the age of thirty is the ass’s son’.
in this statement, which was in romanian and signed by the applicant, the lawyer, the interpreter and the prosecutor, the applicant reiterated the previous statement given to the police (see paragraph 9 above) but this time stated that he had not known about the lsd in his luggage until he had unpacked at the dormitory.the court further held that: “the nature of the case and the people involved, in a special location – a university campus – required urgent investigative measures, therefore it cannot be claimed that the presumption of innocence had been breached or that the defendants had been deprived of their right to defence.” 20.  the applicant filed an appeal on points of law (recurs).22.  the court undertook a fresh analysis of the evidence in the file and decided that the guarantees of a fair trial within the meaning of article 6 of the convention had been respected as regards both defendants since they had been provided with legal assistance and had benefited from adversarial proceedings in which all their arguments had been examined and replied to.... were in compliance with the legal requirements ... for the respective stages of the investigation, they reflected their wishes at the relevant time, both defendants having the capacity to understand the rights presented to them, being students and even in the absence of legal studies, they could have understood the extent of their rights and obligations.” 24.  the court further observed that o.d.a.it also noted that the file included the prosecutor’s decision appointing an english language interpreter in the case and minutes signed by the applicant and the interpreter attesting that the applicant had been informed of his right to be represented by a lawyer of his choice and of the right to remain silent (see paragraph 10 above).
furthermore, in her reports of the sessions, the social worker noted that the foster parents encouraged e. to establish contact with the applicant and the relatives present at the sessions, and that they were accessible and communicative with respect to the applicant and her questions about e. following a request made by the applicant at the ipt meeting in february 2014 for help in establishing her relationship with e., the social worker and the foster parents offered her help with regard to future contact sessions and encouraged her to engage more actively in establishing the relationship.30.  as requested by the applicant in may 2016, the inspection authorities of the ministry of labour, family, social affairs and equal opportunities carried out an inspection with a view to determining whether the cerknica centre had impeded contact between the applicant and e. their report and the documents in the file show that on at least on five further occasions the cerknica centre informed the applicant that she should institute proceedings before the ljubljana district court if she was not satisfied with the existing arrangements.34.  on 15 february 2016 the cerknica centre sent the applicant some photos of e. 35.  on 7 march 2011 the cerknica centre lodged an application with the ljubljana district court seeking that the applicant and g. be divested of their parental rights, on the grounds that they had neglected and abandoned e., had not taken care of her basic needs, had repeated the problematic behaviour, and had jeopardised the well-being of the child.acknowledging that the illness could be controlled and the symptoms managed by medication, as well as noting that the course of the condition depended on each individual, dr m. stressed that the prognosis for the applicant’s illness was not good, and therefore it was not possible to expect her to be able to take care of e. in particular, it was noted that, notwithstanding the episodes of remission, schizophrenia, like some other mental illnesses, led gradually to a permanent deterioration in a person’s capacities, and such a process would occur despite the applicant’s medical treatment.55.  in its assessment, the court relied on dr z.’s expert opinion (see paragraph 53 above) and the statements of the social worker who had supervised the contact sessions in the past and observed that, during the sessions, the applicant had been largely passive and there had been no proper interaction between her and e. it concluded that there was no personal connection between the applicant and e. having regard to the nature of the actual relationship between the applicant and e., the applicant’s health situation at that time, her inability to form a relationship that would be beneficial to e., her negative attitude towards the adoptive parents, and the consequences the contact would have for e., the court found that the contact would not be in her interests.
the applicants found out about that decision on 14 october 2009. on 15 october 2009 their lawyer challenged the decision, noting that the investigation had not been prompt or thorough; that they had not undergone any expert psychological examination to verify whether it could be concluded that they had suffered psychological trauma; that the decision had been based solely on the declaration by the officers involved that they had not been at work on the relevant day, without verifying whether they had been urgently called in to work to deal with the emergency situation on 7 april 2009; and that no criminal investigation had been launched by that date.the court found that the investigation had been superficial and listed a series of actions which had not been carried out, such as interviewing the arresting officers and those responsible for escorting them and registering their arrest; verifying the reasons for their transfer to drochia police section, the person who had ordered the transfer and the reason why the prosecutor had not established a breach of applicable legislation as a result of that transfer; determining the reason for the prosecutor’s failure to examine the applicants’ complaint within the statutory seventy-two hours.from the beginning of the trial, that court had held four hearings and postponed five others for various reasons such as the absence of the prosecutor, of one of the applicants or of their lawyers, as well as annual leave taken by the prosecutor and the judge.however, it upheld the judgment adopted since the applicants had not indicated any specific errors in the application of the law by the lower court, which had taken a lawful and reasoned decision and had properly individualised the sentences in view of the nature and seriousness of the offence.(ii)  proceedings against officer a.c. 32.  on 16 april 2010 the criminal investigation that had started on 2 february 2010 against the three police officers (see paragraph 21 above) was discontinued in respect of a.c. the prosecutor summarised the applicants’ statements and referred to the results of the identity parades during which each of the applicants had identified a.c. as the person who had taken them to the room in which they had been ordered to undress and do sit-ups.
the decision was accompanied by an order (korraldus) of the same date which detailed how the prison leave would be organised, specifying that the applicant had to be escorted by at least three prison officers and that, as a preventive measure, he had to wear both hand and ankle cuffs.9.  on 15 may 2013 the applicant and his brother (also a prisoner in the same prison), were to be transported to the funeral service in the same prison van.his brother was thereafter transported to the funeral at 10.02 a.m. and reached the cemetery at 10.57 a.m. 11.  on 9 september 2013 the applicant lodged a request with tartu prison, asking for compensation in the sum of 7,500 euros (eur), claiming that the use of hand and ankle cuffs had been unjustified and that the prison authorities had wished to expose him to the public and to his family in such degrading circumstances.with regard to the conditions in the transport van, the court noted that the applicant had refused to be transferred and therefore had never been subjected to the conditions described.he claimed, inter alia, that there had been no reason to conclude that he would have been embarrassed to be in shackles in front of his family, and that the main reason he had decided not to go to the funeral had been the transport conditions.
10.  the fact-finding commission established by the batman governor’s office consisted of, among others, the governor, deputy governor and mayor of batman, the director of the batman security directorate, the director of the local office of the ministry of public works and settlement, the directors of the tüpraş refinery and the turkish petroleum corporation (türkiye petrolleri anonim ortaklığı – hereinafter “tpao”) and the presidents of the local chambers of architects, mechanical engineers and geological engineers.the following findings were made in the report: (i)  the product that had leaked underground was gasoline; (ii)  it was highly likely that the contamination had been caused by an underground accumulation of gasoline that had leaked from one or more sources over a long period; (iii)  given the location and movement of the underground contamination slick and the ground water flow direction, the source of the leak must have been in the south, where the tüpraş facilities were located; they stated that any leak originating from the ant pipeline would have generated a contamination slick in a northwesterly/northerly direction alongside the pipeline, which had not been the case; this left the tüpraş refinery as the only plausible source of the leak.it also claimed, inter alia, that: (i)  given the proximity of the site of the explosion to the tüpraş facilities, many wells had been dug around the tüpraş oil tanks to locate the source of the leak; however, none of those wells had revealed any oil leaks; on the other hand, wells dug around the perimeter of the refinery had revealed the presence of oil that had leaked from elsewhere towards the refinery; (ii)  the scientific analysis of the samples obtained from the site of the explosion showed that the leaked material had not been produced by tüpraş; (iii)  the expert reports submitted to the criminal case file found that tüpraş could not be held liable for the explosion; (iv)  although the pipeline between tüpraş and ant had officially been out of use since 1992, it had been noted after the explosion that the pipeline in question had actually been full of oil; moreover, the pressure tests carried out subsequently showed that the pipeline had been punctured and was leaking oil; (v)  the complaints arising from the security measures taken in toptancılar sitesi after the explosion, such as the ceasing of commercial activity and the denial of occupation licences, were outside the competence of tüpraş.the experts carried out an on-site inspection at the applicant’s property on 7 march 2007, and reported their findings on 12 march 2007. they mainly noted the following: (i)  the impact of the explosion had been equivalent to that of an earthquake with a magnitude of 9 on the richter scale; (ii)  the applicant’s property, which was used as business premises, had been mostly repaired by the time of the on-site inspection and commercial activity had resumed; some cracks were nevertheless visible on the walls; (iii)  the infrastructure of the building, including water, electricity and telephone connections and the sewer system, had had to be repaired as a result of the damage sustained in the basement; (iv)  leaving aside the estimated wear and tear of the property since its construction, the structural damage was noted to be try 13,278.36; (v)  given the magnitude of the explosion, it was inevitable that the walls and structural joists of the property would sustain cracks; moreover, the explosion had considerably slowed down real estate sales in the area; having regard to these factors, it was estimated that the applicant’s property had lost 50 % of its value, corresponding to try 66,483.25; (vi)  a drop of 60 to 70 % had been noted in the rental income of property owners in toptancılar sitesi subsequent to the explosion; in these circumstances, the applicant’s loss of rental income for the eighteen months following the explosion was calculated to be try 5,400.he mainly made the following arguments: (i)  the court of cassation’s ruling that merely guessing, or being in a position to guess, the tortfeasor was sufficient to trigger the article 60 § 1 time‑limit ran counter to the doctrine and settled practice of the court of cassation on the issue, which unambiguously required certain and exact knowledge of the tortfeasor before the time-limit could start running; the applicant relied in this connection on a judgment of the joint civil chambers of the court of cassation dated 22 november 1974, as well as to some articles drafted by legal scholars and practitioners dating as far back as 1992; (ii)  the studies conducted in the aftermath of the explosion showed that the explosion had not been a simple accident, but had involved very complex elements; bearing in mind that it had taken even the experts in the field almost one year of scientific studies to establish the exact cause of the explosion, and another year after that to identify its source, a simple layman such as him could not be expected to have known the tortfeasor on the very day that the explosion took place; (iii)  in these circumstances, he had only acquired the requisite knowledge of the tortfeasor upon the finalisation of case no.
she submitted in particular: (a)  that the csm had not taken into consideration a number of facts on which she had relied in her defence and which were corroborated by various items of evidence; (b)  that in its establishment of the facts the csm had made no reference to the intentional element of the disciplinary offence; (c)  that the disciplinary penalty was based on insufficient or irrelevant evidence; (d)  that the conduct complained of had not amounted to a disciplinary offence, that she had simply been exercising a legitimate right and that the authorities had disregarded the principle of administration in good faith; (e)  that the csm had failed to give reasons for its decision not to suspend enforcement of the penalty; and (f)  that the penalty imposed had been disproportionate to the acts of which she had been accused.it is not the task of the supreme court to reconsider this decision, but merely to verify whether it was appropriate to the offence committed and whether the penalty imposed was proportionate to that offence ... the determination of the penalty falls within what is known as the technical and administrative [margin of] discretion, which is not subject to judicial scrutiny except in cases of gross and manifest errors and particularly of failure to comply with the principle of proportionality as regards the appropriateness of the penalty ... having regard to the foregoing, and since it has been established that a fine, set at twenty days, should be imposed by way of a penalty, there is no basis for finding that the sanction imposed is disproportionate to the disciplinary offence or to the relevant legislative framework.” 33.  on 29 march 2011, following information received from the judicial investigator f.m.j., the permanent council of the csm decided to open a second set of disciplinary proceedings against the applicant (case no.48.  with regard to the applicant’s remaining arguments, concerning the procedural safeguards in proceedings before the csm, the supreme court found: (a)  that the fact that the judicial investigator had not proposed a penalty until the final report was in line with the statutory requirements and had been sufficient in view of the fact that the report had been duly notified to the applicant so that she could make whatever comments she deemed necessary; (b)  that the rights of the defence, and in particular the right to be heard, had not been infringed in the applicant’s case, given that her defence had related to the facts of the case rather than to the proposed penalty and the fact that it had been open to the csm to impose a heavier penalty than the one proposed; and (c)  that the legal reclassification of the facts had likewise not damaged the defence, given that it was in the context of the same facts that the applicant had breached her duty of honesty.if that were the case the supreme court would repeat and add to the examination of the evidence produced in the disciplinary proceedings in order to ... form ... its own opinion as to the conclusions to be drawn from it ... however, as it follows from the uniform, settled case-law of the judicial division, this is manifestly not the legal position that is continuing to emerge, primarily, from the reinforced law represented by the status of judges act.” with regard to the evidence which the applicant proposed to produce during the hearing, the supreme court found that it was inadmissible and irrelevant, stressing in particular (a)  that the applicant’s request for evidence to be heard from the witness had been aimed at establishing the content of the draft decision of the plenary csm in the applicant’s disciplinary case; this ran counter to the confidentiality of the proceedings leading to the final decision; and (b)  that the documents submitted by the applicant went beyond the subject-matter of the disciplinary proceedings.65.  on the merits, the supreme court noted (a)  that there had been no manifest error or inconsistency in the establishment of the facts, or any indication that the evidence had been obtained unlawfully; (b)  that the csm had considerable discretion regarding the definition of the disciplinary offence, which was described in broad terms in the act, and that the supreme court could alter that legal classification only in the event of a gross, manifest error, which was not the situation in the present case; and (c)  that the applicant’s arguments that the proceedings before the csm had been unfair were unfounded, as the refusal to provide certain items of information had been duly reasoned.
he stated that two to three days prior to the attack, the applicant had called the police to report x who had been “causing him problems” (stvarao mu problem) and who had told the applicant that he “would see who the boss in the neighbourhood was”.relying on section 148(1) of the obligations act, the court held as follows: “the court dismisses as factually and legally unfounded the applicant’s submissions that the state ought to have hospitalised x before the event here in issue, as the state bodies did order his hospitalisation as soon as the conditions for that had been met.the constitutional court reiterates that it is not competent to substitute the regular courts in assessing the facts and evidence, but that it is the task of the regular courts to [do so] (see the european court’s judgment in the case of thomas v. the united kingdom, 10 may 2005, no.the task of the constitutional court is to examine whether the proceedings as a whole were fair within the meaning of article 6 of the european convention and whether the decisions of the regular courts violate constitutional rights.20.  before 24 june 2013 (see paragraph 12 above) x had been hospitalised on several other occasions: (a) for an unspecified period in 1997; (b) from 29 november to 19 december 2001; (c) from 25 july 2003 to 8 july 2004 (following a court decision of 21 july 2003 to that effect, after he had set his flat on fire; once it was considered that he had achieved a stable clinical condition, x was discharged from the hospital); (d) from 31 january to 21 february 2006; (e) from 23 july to 29 september 2006; (f) on 15 february and 13 march 2007 (on the recommendation of the healthcare centre in podgorica following complaints from x’s neighbours); (g) from 5 june to 25 july 2008; and (h) from 24 september 2012 to 3 october 2012. that period of hospitalisation would appear to have been prompted by an attempt by x to commit suicide by taking a large quantity of medication.
7.  in his statement taken at the samandıra police station on 20 november 2007 the applicant told the police that his sons had apparently not gone to school after leaving home the previous day, and that they had left their mobile telephones at home.8.  on the same day, the police informed the kartal public prosecutor of the disappearance of the applicant’s sons.12.  on 27 november 2007 the kartal public prosecutor’s office asked the turkish telecommunication institution to provide a record of the individuals who had called aykut aka’s mobile telephone in the past three months, together with their complete identity information and addresses.22.  according to a report prepared by the police on 28 december 2007, the cctv footage from 19 november 2007 of the place where the bodies were recovered did not reveal any information that could shed light on the circumstances of the applicants’ sons’ suspicious deaths.the lack of an effective investigation into the incident had impaired his trust in the justice system, which had compelled him to participate in a live tv show in the hope of gathering information that could shed light on the circumstances of his sons’ deaths.
2491/2011) of 2 november 2011, the high court of justice of castilla-león (administrative chamber) ruled against the regional administration of castilla-león, ordering it to pay compensation to the plaintiff in the amount of eur 14,500. it concluded that the situation suffered by her amounted to workplace harassment and that the education authorities, despite being aware of the situation, had not taken effective measures to bring it to an end.the high court of justice included the following reasoning concerning the applicant, who was frequently identified by name: “... from the documentary, witness and expert evidence [in the proceedings] [the court] can find that ... a situation of psychological harassment in the workplace has been shown [to exist] on the basis that the head of department’s conduct towards the claimant met the material element – unjustified professional harassment – the temporal element – regular and repeated – and the element of intent – malicious and not by chance – of the so-called bullying (mobbing) ... a) not all the acts or behaviour that the plaintiff attributed to mr vicent ... constitute psychological harassment towards her ... b) ... although it should also be considered established that the behaviour ... of mr vicent ... was to a certain degree general or collective, ... in the particular case of the plaintiff ... this general behaviour of a lack of respect and manners was translated, more intensively and strongly, into repeated and conscious professional discredit, of underestimation and mockery of her teaching ability, that resulted not only from the documented complaints already described ..., but particularly from the expressive witness evidence ...” 11.  on 15 december 2011 the applicant requested to have access to the file and to become a party to the proceedings.the high court of justice of castilla-león dismissed it by a decision of 2 march 2012. on the one hand, the court held that the request for annulment of the proceedings had been made outside the time-limit prescribed by law, since an “appeal for annulment” (incidente de nulidad) should have been submitted within twenty days of the date the applicant became aware of a possible breach of his rights.the court took into account that the applicant had claimed that he had learned of the judgment through the publication of information in a newspaper on 9 and 10 december 2011, and that in any case on 15 december 2011 (the date on which he had requested access to the file and to become a party to the proceedings) he had clearly known the decisive elements for his complaints.despite acknowledging that public officials’ professional conduct was being judged and that their honour and moral integrity could be affected, the court held: (i) that the proceedings involved disputes exclusively between the public administration and alleged victims of the acts of its public officials; (ii) that the authorities and staff allegedly causing the damage could not be considered to be interested parties for the purposes of section 31 of law 30/1992; and (iii) that both liability and compensation are sought from the public administration, as opposed to the public officials concerned.
the supreme court stressed the following: “the significance of the judge’s action...cannot be reduced to an isolated assessment of the question raised by her, yet it must be put in direct connection with the comment that she made after the appellant refused to give an answer, as well as the nature of the charges, their legal characterization and the moment the question and the answer take place... the question put by the presiding judge and, very particularly, her reaction to the appellant’s refusal to give an answer, can be interpreted, from an objective perspective, as an expression of a previously formed opinion...about the significance assigned to the words spoken by the appellant...the appellant had objectives reasons to think that the judge was precipitately voicing out a value judgment on the criminal nature of [his statements]” 9.  the supreme court, assessing the proceedings as a whole, found that there were “objective reasons” to consider that the presiding judge (and judge rapporteur of the case) was expressing a prejudice against the first applicant about the significance that should be given to the phrases and words expressed by him, which had also led to a preconceived idea as to his guilt.these proceedings were allocated to the fourth section of the audiencia nacional, whose composition consisted of the same judges that had taken part in the first set of criminal proceedings followed against the first applicant, which ended with the judgment of 2 march 2010, finally declared void by the supreme court on 2 february 2011. this time the presiding judge was not the judge rapporteur.the first and fifth applicants contested in particular the impartiality of the panel of the fourth section of the audiencia nacional reiterating the same arguments that were brought during the challenging proceedings before the audiencia nacional.however, the supreme court rejected the applicants’ arguments concerning the alleged violation of the their right to an impartial tribunal by declaring that the bias displayed by the presiding judge against one of the applicants during previous and different proceedings did not reach the necessary threshold to believe that the judges (and, specifically, the presiding judge) had become again biased or prejudiced, not only against the first applicant but against all of them.the constitutional court observed that the doubts on the presiding judge were in connection with previous proceedings dealing with a different subject, i.e. the determination on whether the first applicant had committed the crime of encouragement of terrorism, which differed from the charges they were all accused of in the framework of the second set of criminal proceedings.
i would like this meeting not to turn into something which aggravates inter-ethnic relations.” 10.  at the close of the meeting the council decided, in particular, to “support the decision of the meeting of the village residents to expel persons of gypsy ethnicity from the village”.17.  applicants identified in the appendix asserted in their statements to ms duducehava, mr stoyanov or to the police in the course of the subsequent criminal investigation that they had been away from the village at the time of the events of 7-10 september 2002 and of the attack and had only learned about it later.19.  according to a report published on 20 september 2002 in the regional newspaper porto franko and information given at a press conference held on 12 september 2002 by the secretary of state (державний секретар) for the ministry of the interior and by the head of the odessa regional police department (“the regional police”), police officers had been present in force and had observed the attack.the villagers generally stated that there had long been tensions in the village between the roma and non-roma populations (many mentioning that this was connected with the alleged involvement of roma residents in the drug trade), and that on the night of 9 september 2002 several hundred individuals had ransacked the houses of the roma residents.45.  on 21 march 2003 the ivanivskyy district court (“the district court”), having heard an appeal by the dpo, quashed the village council’s decision of 9 september 2002 on the grounds that it was contrary to the constitution and had been taken under the pressure exerted by a crowd of angry villagers in order to calm them down and prevent the lynching of the roma.
on the same day, at the request of the police, the investigating judge of the zadar county court (županijski sud u zadru), mr b.b., issued a warrant for police to search through the camera used by a.m. and through narodni list’s computers with a view to finding photographs of ms z.s.-k. during the search, which was carried out on the same day between 2.45 p.m. and 4.05 p.m. on the applicant company’s premises, seven police officers in the presence of two witnesses inspected the camera in question and seven computers belonging to the company.the relevant part of that judgment reads as follows: “it is undisputed between the parties that the impugned text constitutes a value judgment ... ... section 21(1) of the media act prescribes that a publisher who causes damage to another person by [publishing] information in the media is obliged to compensate [that person], except in cases prescribed by the same act (section 21(4)).... ... this court finds that the defendant [company], as the publisher, ... by publishing the impugned text entitled ‘judge b. should be put in the pillory’ and the [accompanying] photo of the plaintiff, exceeded the bounds of the freedom to publish information, to the prejudice of the plaintiff.for these reasons the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for non-pecuniary damage sustained by the breach of his rights of personality [prava osobnosti] within the meaning of section 22(1) of the media act and section 1100(1) and (2) of the obligations act – that is to say to just financial compensation in the amount claimed by the action.when determining the level of just financial compensation the court, guided by the principle of proportionality, took into account the consequences of the defendant [company]’s statements, which exceeded the bounds of acceptable criticism ...” 15.  by a judgment of 3 december 2010 the split county court (županijski sud u splitu) dismissed an appeal by the applicant company and upheld the first-instance judgment, which thereby became final.
on the same date, the minister of education issued a decision informing the educational coordinators that they were to remain in their posts until the completion of the next selection procedure.on 27 may 2010 the applicant sent a memorandum to the court, requesting that the case be heard speedily, adding that an eventual discontinuation of the trial would violate her rights under article 6 § 1 of the convention.11.  on 13 december 2010 the applicant submitted a memorandum requesting that the examination of her application for annulment be continued despite the expiry of the administrative act, arguing that she had special locus standi to continue to pursue the annulment process.as regards the applicant’s arguments that the eventual rejection of her application would violate article 20 of the constitution and article 6 § 1 of the convention, the domestic court held that the provision of article 32 § 2 of presidential decree no.having also regard to the possibility provided for by law to continue the trial if the individual could prove that he or she still suffered from unfavourable consequences that could be removed only by the annulment of the contested act, the right to judicial protection remained intact.
7.  the charges against the applicant and the brothers were based on a statement given by the victim’s father, mr v.n., who claimed to have witnessed the crime, and on other evidence, namely a hand grenade seized from the brothers’ home, as well as several forensic reports.15.  the applicant’s argument that he had an alibi for the presumed time of the crime in the light of the statements given by some of the defence witnesses (see paragraph 10 above) was dismissed by the court.the applicant further claimed to have an alibi to the effect that he had been seen alone in the centre of the village around the time of the murder, and noted that mr v.n.in upholding the lower court’s verdict, the supreme court fully relied on the statement of the victim’s father, the statements of the other witnesses who were told by him that the applicant had killed his son, and the forensic evidence, without addressing any of the applicant’s arguments, including that none of the cited evidence had implicated him, and that the lower court had failed to address his arguments in that regard.on 17 december 2008, in view of the applicant’s complaint that the government had allegedly left his medical complaints – including those concerning headaches – unaddressed, the president of the section decided to indicate to the government, under rule 39 of the rules of court, to implement all necessary measures to assess his state of health.
13.  having been surrendered to the belgian authorities at 10.40 a.m. on 31 december 2007, the applicant was interviewed by the criminal investigation police from 11.50 a.m. to 3.55 p.m. 14.  as shown by the police interview record, in accordance with article 47bis of the code of criminal procedure (code d’instruction criminelle) (see paragraphs 62-65 below), the applicant was notified that he was entitled to request the verbatim transcription of all the questions put to him and his answers, to request any investigative act or the conducting of any interview, and that his statements could be used in evidence.on 5 november 2007] the jury considered decisive the consistent and mutually corroborative testimony of the youngsters who had seen only the defendant and the victim at the scene of the crime, without any other person being present, the threats previously made by the defendant against his victim and the various steps taken by philippe beuze (in particular the fact of hiding the axe in a bush) in preparation for the crime.on 17 september 2007] the jury found that the following evidence proved both the actual occurrence of the acts and the homicidal intention which had driven the defendant: – the defendant had deliberately arranged to be alone with a pregnant woman, whom he knew was thus placed in a weakened position; – he violently struck c.l., as shown by the medical findings, and left her for dead; – he then fled the scene without calling for help, even though he had the means to do so; – he subsequently sent text messages clearly showing his intention to kill c.l.5.  in the light of the following elements, there can be no automatic finding that it is irretrievably impossible for a person questioned by the police and the investigating judge without a lawyer to have a fair trial: the formal requirements laid down for the questioning of a suspect in article 47bis of the code of criminal procedure, the brevity of the police custody period, the immediate issuance to the person charged (upon notification of the arrest warrant) of all the documents referred to in sections 16(7) and 18(2) of the law of 20 july 1990, the right of the person charged to communicate immediately with his lawyer in accordance with section 20(1) and (5) of that law, access to the file as governed by section 21(3) of the law, the lawyer’s presence at the recapitulatory examination provided for in section 22(1), (2) and (3), and the rights set forth, in particular, in articles 61ter, 61quater, 61quinquies, 136 and 235bis of the code of criminal procedure.as can be seen from the following findings of the judgment appealed against [of 1 february 2010]: (i)  the appellant made no self-incriminating statements while in police custody; (ii)  prior to his first interview by the french gendarmerie, he expressly waived the legal assistance to which he was entitled under article 63-4 of the french code of criminal procedure; (iii)  the appellant was assisted by a lawyer from the time of his appearance before the investigation division of the douai court of appeal and for the two years of his pre-trial detention; (iv)  the appellant was at no point compelled to incriminate himself, and at all times expressed himself freely.
7.  on 22 june 2010 the sovetskiy district court of voronezh granted the applicants claim against the municipal transport company and awarded them 40,020,000 russian roubles.8.  on 9 january 2013 the prosecutor of the voronezh region applied to the district court for the extension of the time-limits for an ordinary appeal against the judgment of 22 june 2010.10.  on 8 august 2013 the voronezh regional court quashed the decision of the district court and extended the time limit for an ordinary appeal.the court found that the public interest had been concerned as far as the judgment had been executed by means of the municipal budget.11.  on 12 november 2013 the voronezh regional court granted the appeal lodged by the prosecutor and quashed the judgment of 22 june 2010 and ordered the reversal of execution.
9.  in that hearing, the applicant’s representative left it to the court’s discretion for an expert to be appointed concerning the determination of the amounts that were already paid.in that hearing, the court noted that the expert report had been submitted in the case-file and read its contents out in the presence of g.f.’s legal representative.the latter asked the court to rule in accordance with the findings in the expert report, which had concluded that all the relevant alimony payments had been made.there is no indication in the transcript of the hearing that suggests that the court examined whether the applicant’s representative had been notified in due time.13.  on 31 july 2006 the applicant’s representative lodged an appeal before the court of cassation, arguing that the notice for the court hearing of 21 june 2006 had been served on him only on 26 june 2006, resulting in him and her client missing the opportunity to participate in the hearing and submit their observations on the findings of the expert report.
17.  according to the applicant, the prison officers had been aware that the visiting hours at the hospital were from 12 noon to 7 p.m., but he had been transferred to the hospital at around 11 a.m. his visit with his daughter had lasted only ten minutes because he had been there during the time that medical procedures were being performed on the patients.according to the escort plan, the applicant had arrived at the hospital at 10.50 a.m. and the visit had ended at 11.15 a.m. 19.  the government submitted an explanation drafted on 2 april 2012 by the head of the escort team on duty on the day of the visit.in the “facts and proceedings” (asjaolud ja menetluse käik) part of the judgment the court noted that the applicant had complained about the prison officers remaining in the examination room during the medical procedures and about his visit to see his daughter having taken place at the wrong time and being of limited duration.it noted that in his appeal the applicant had claimed that the administrative court had failed to address the obligation to wear prison clothing, the manner in which the prison officers had carried their weapons and special equipment and the breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s complaint about the prison officers’ presence during his hospital visits, as the prison officers had had a duty under the regulation of the minister of justice “prisoner escort duties and procedures” (see paragraph 36 below) to escort and guard him.
7.  according to a report drawn up by the police officers and signed by the applicant, on 19 november 2002 at 1.30 p.m., the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the hizbullah following an hour long armed conflict with the police officers during which he had resisted, had thrown a grenade and had fired back at the police officers.8.  on the same day at 1.50 p.m. the applicant was examined at the silvan state hospital, in diyarbakır, by a doctor who observed the following on the applicant’s body: 2 cm-long scrape on his lower left chest, handcuff marks on his wrists, a traumatic scrape on the front side of his right leg.on the same day the applicant was brought before the investigating judge at the diyarbakır state security court, who took his statements in the absence of a lawyer in which he had accepted most of the statements he had given to the police.according to his submissions before the court, the applicant claimed that he had admitted being a member of the hizbullah before the public prosecutor and the judge on account of the duress and the intimidation exerted on him by the police.16.  on 22 june 2007 the diyarbakır assize court found that, inter alia, on the basis of the applicant’s statements to the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge that the applicant had committed the offence under article 146 of the former criminal code and sentenced him to life imprisonment.
to the contrary, some witnesses among the chinese students submitted that they had been next to the applicant during the fight and that he had not been the one who had injured m. 22.  furthermore, several of the chinese witnesses told the police that w. had been particularly nervous after the incident, had destroyed the clothes he had been wearing on 1 may 2009 and had asked his parents for a considerable amount of money.with a metal skewer, but that it had been unlikely that he might have also injured m. next, the court referred to the statement of the police officer who had been on duty on 1 may 2009, that the applicant had been there all the time after the arrival of the police and that he had been calm, clean and without any injuries.the court therefore holds that the reference by the applicant and his lawyer to the witness statements documented in the investigation’s reports and made either to the investigator or to the prosecutor outside of court hearings and not in accordance with the procedure [established by] article 225 of the ccp [2012], cannot be regarded as proper and admissible defence evidence.” 36.  the trial court further held: “..the court has no doubts regarding the circumstances of the case which it considers established ... the statements of the witnesses [sa., su.furthermore, the applicant referred to article 8 of chapter 11 of the transitional provisions of the ccp 2012, which stipulated that the issue of the admissibility of evidence obtained prior to the entry into force of the new ccp was to be decided in accordance with the procedure applicable prior to its entry into force (see paragraph 45 below).given that under the ccp 1960 evidence obtained in the course of a pre-trial investigation was admissible in criminal proceedings (see paragraph 44 below), the applicant complained that it had been unlawful and unfair to exclude the witness evidence for the defence and that by doing so the trial court had substantially aggravated his situation and had deprived him of the opportunity to defend himself.
their property was damaged in the course of a counterterrorist operation in 1999-2000. the applicants did not pursue criminal remedies in order to determine the exact circumstances or identify the perpetrators of the damage.11.  in june 2010 the applicant was informed that her application had not been examined by the commission since the building in question had not been entered in the register of destroyed buildings.on 12 august 2010 the staropromyslovskiy district court of grozny rejected the first applicant’s claim, pointing out that the commission was unable to proceed in the absence of the corresponding entry in the register.on 21 march 2013 the leninskiy district court of grozny rejected the first applicant’s claim, referring to the expiry of the time-limit and the lack of legal grounds for such claims.in respect of the first applicant, the letter stated that her house had been inspected by the technical unit, which had confirmed its destruction (without specifying the date or any reference to the inspection record); however, for unknown reasons the building had not been entered in the register.
he argued that the prosecutor and the court which had ordered his detention had applied an extensive interpretation of the provisions of the criminal code concerning the offence of pimping.the court did not respond to the applicant’s argument about a lack of reasonable suspicion and the allegation of extensive interpretation of the criminal law.12.  during the proceedings the applicant explained that, prior to starting the video-chat business, he had consulted a lawyer to make sure that the activity was legal in moldova, and he had been assured that it was not illegal.14.  in deciding the case, the court sought an opinion from the state agency for the protection of morality as to whether the acts committed by the female models employed by the applicant could be qualified as prostitution and, thus, whether the applicant’s activity could be qualified as pimping.the opinion of 21 october 2015, which was the key element in convicting the applicant and was subsequently used in other similar cases, stated that the actions of the female models employed by the applicant could be considered acts of prostitution, in that their clients could obtain sexual gratification as a result of the models’ performance and because the models were paid for those acts.
the authorities also provided a detailed summary of incidents, altogether seventeen, which had occurred in prison between february 2002 and the incident of 11 february 2012 and which involved unlawful activity, disruptive behaviour and insubordination, and repeated violence or the threat of violence on the part of the applicant against the prison officers.14.  taking this into account, as well as the fact that on 30 may 2012 the applicant had, in a telephone call to the ministry of justice, said that he would be left with no option but to assault a prison officer, the prison authorities held that it would not be possible to discontinue the additional security measures.15.  by the first decision of 10 august 2012 the following additional security measures were imposed on the applicant: (i)  placement in a locked isolation cell to better monitor him and prevent contact with other prisoners, towards whom he might become violent; (ii)  restriction on his freedom of movement and communication inside the prison to prevent contact with other prisoners, whose health he might endanger; (iii)  a ban on using the prison’s sports facilities, as it was not possible to ensure the restrictions on his freedom of movement and communication while escorting him to these facilities.19.  on 2 march 2013 the applicant lodged an appeal with the tartu court of appeal, requesting that the judgment of the tartu administrative court be quashed and that the decisions of 10 august 2012 be declared unlawful, as it was no longer necessary to annul them as they had ceased to have effect six months after they had been adopted.it upheld the remainder of the judgment of the tartu administrative court of 4 october 2013. in doing so, the court relied, inter alia, on the information gathered by the prison security department (see paragraph 25 above), which the court examined in closed proceedings as the material was confidential.
9.  in the meantime, on 21 july 2000 the police asked the canadian interpol office to check whether the applicant’s car and two other vehicles were being sought by the police in canada, under whose name they had been registered, whether they had been registered for export, and whether the car documents were genuine.18.  the courts held that the temporary seizure of the applicant’s car had been lawful as it had been based on articles 177, 184 and 218 of the code of criminal procedure, and that therefore the state could not be held liable for damages.20.  in his appeal on points of law the applicant asked the supreme court to pronounce itself on a legal question which he considered important for the uniform application of the law, namely, whether the owners of objects temporarily seized for the purposes of criminal proceedings were entitled to compensation for the inability to use those objects, in a situation where, eventually, no criminal or minor-offence proceedings had been instituted.23.  on 23 january 2014 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint and served its decision on his representative on 7 february 2014. the court examined the case primarily under article 29 § 1 of the croatian constitution, which guarantees the right to fair procedure, and held that the contested judgments had not been arbitrary.as regards the applicant’s argument that his right of ownership guaranteed by article 48 of the constitution had been violated, the constitutional court held as follows: “the constitutional court protects the right of ownership at the constitutional level in a manner that prevents any restriction or taking of [property] by the state authorities, unless the restriction or taking is provided for by law ... ... interferences with ownership by other legal subjects (natural or legal persons) are property disputes of a private-law nature.
8.  on 16 august 2012, in the context of the procedure for the execution of the court’s judgment, the government submitted an action plan indicating that the applicant had sought the reopening of the case against the police officers implicated in the incident (s.p., v.b., d.k.12.  on 13 june 2014 the state attorney’s office informed the applicant that it had opened an investigation in respect of the police officers concerning his allegations of ill-treatment during his arrest on 11 august 2006. the applicant was also served with the decision on the opening of the investigation, which indicated that in the further course of the proceedings it would be necessary to question him, his parents and his common-law wife, ms t.v., as well as the relevant police officers, and that a forensic expert report concerning the injuries which the applicant had sustained in the incident would be ordered.stated that he had seen the applicant and the police officers talking in the flat and that at one point the applicant had tried to punch one of the police officers, after which the police officers had engaged in suppressing his resistance.25.  the state attorney’s office found that the forensic expert, d.m., needed to be questioned concerning his report and that he should be presented with some further evidence obtained during the investigation, namely photographs of the crime scene and the individuals concerned taken immediately after the incident, the statements of the relevant police officers and the statement given by the paramedic.the latter stated that the injuries to the applicant’s face could not have been caused when the police officers had attempted to prevent the applicant from self-harming by holding his face, but that it was possible that he had banged his head against the stretcher while being transported by the paramedics.
on the basis of the written statements and testimony of two police officers the justice of the peace found the applicant guilty of taking part in an irregular public gathering conducted without prior notification and fined the applicant 1,000 russian roubles (rub), equivalent at the material time to about 25 euros (eur), under article 20 § 2 of the code of administrative offences.the justice of the peace rejected the statements of the three eyewitnesses, on the grounds that they had given different estimates of the number of people present at the venue, the number of police officers who arrested the applicant, and the time of his arrival at the meeting.the three eyewitnesses examined at the applicant’s request testified that the applicant, after ending his picket, had walked down the street while speaking with a fellow activist, surrounded by journalists; he remained on the pavement, did not chant slogans, and carried no banners; several other participants in the picket remained standing with their banners, at a certain distance from each other; the police arrested the applicant without any warning or explanation.on the basis of written reports by two police officers the justice of the peace established that the applicant had organised and led a group of thirty people, thus holding a march without the approval of the local authorities; that they were heading from lubyanskaya square to lefortovo detention facility, and that at 9 maroseyka street the group had obstructed the road, thus halting traffic.on the basis of the written reports by the two police officers, the judge found the applicant guilty of taking part in a meeting which had not been notified to the competent authority in accordance with the procedure provided by law, and fined him rub 10,000 (equivalent to about eur 200) under article 20 § 2 of the code of administrative offences.
the relevant part of the decision read as follows: “having examined the material in the criminal case and having agreed with the submissions of the first deputy prosecutor general of the republic of azerbaijan that the accused, a. aslanov, attempted to commit a particularly serious crime, that it was needed to prevent his unlawful actions, that there were sufficient grounds to believe that, if released, he would abscond from the investigation and disrupt the establishment of the truth about the case and relying on articles ... decided ...” 12.  on 22 june 2007 the first applicant appealed against that order, claiming that his detention was unlawful.the relevant part of the decision reads as follows: “the court bench considers that the first-instance court, having taken into account that a. aslanov could obstruct the investigation, the nature of the criminal act, and the fact that the punishment for committing such an act is over two years’ imprisonment, was correct in considering it necessary to apply the preventive measure of remand in custody in respect of him.the part of the decision regarding the first applicant’s medical care in detention reads as follows: “in accordance with the forensic report’s findings, in the medical facility where he was detained the accused a. aslanov was placed under the full control of the doctors specialising in the medical fields indicated in the report and the continuity of his [dialysis] has, until now, been ensured.” 27.  on 27 september and 11 october 2007 the first applicant’s lawyer asked the ministry of justice to provide him with a copy of the document listing the serious illnesses precluding the detention of prisoners.in particular, the lawyer asked the court to acknowledge a violation of the first applicant’s right to medical assistance in detention and declare unlawful the ministry of justice’s decision not to provide him with the document listing the serious illnesses precluding the detention of prisoners.29.  on 26 january 2008 the first applicant’s lawyer received a copy of a decision dated 3 december 2007 by the sabail district court refusing to examine on the merits the complaint lodged on 23 november 2007. the sabail district court refused to admit the action on the grounds that the first applicant had failed to specify the rights that he considered had been breached.
on 25 april 2008 the trade union committee decided that the staff of russian railways in two suburban moscow sectors should participate in the strike as from 4 a.m. on 28 april 2008. the trade union committee’s decision referred to minimum services which would be provided during the strike, although the parties have not made any submissions in this regard.the strike caused delays in circulation of the trains in the sector where the applicant worked.regarding the applicant’s participation in the strike, the court relied on the railway acts of 1995 and 2003 (articles 17 and 26 (2) respectively – see paragraphs 15 and 17 below).relying on a report dated 29 april 2008 issued by the moscow interregional transport prosecutor’s office, the district court furthermore noted that the strike had caused a number of cancelled and delayed trains which had resulted in “massive violations of the rights and lawful interests of citizens, leading to their belated arrival at their workplaces and educational institutions, at medical facilities providing health care, [and] for long-distance trains, bus runs and flights”.the district court did not discuss the question of whether advance notice of the strike had been given or other issues related to the lawfulness of the strike of 28 april 2008.

2 of the krasnosulinskiy district of the rostov region (“justice of the peace”) sent a letter rogatory to the courts of tyumen region, asking them to interview the applicant and to establish whether he wished to attend the hearing in person.10.  on 10 september 2009 the tyumen courts informed the justice of the peace that it had been impossible to reach the applicant.on the same day the justice of the peace decided to hold a hearing in the applicant’s absence, noting that although the applicant had his registered residence at the address mentioned by the plaintiff, he had not appeared for an interview before the justice of the peace.12.  on 20 november 2013, the applicant learnt of the judgment of 18 september 2008. he asked for an extension of the time-limit for lodging an appeal against it.13.  on 26 december 2013 the justice of the peace heard evidence from the applicant’s former wife who claimed that the applicant should have been aware of the divorce proceedings in 2008 because his mother had received the final judgment of 18 september 2008. the justice of the peace held that an excerpt of the judgment had been served on the applicant in person on 31 october 2008 and refused the applicant’s application to extend the time limit for lodging an appeal.
6.  on 26 june 2012 mr n. reported to the inter-district investigative committee that, since 2010, his minor daughter, the applicant in the present case, had been repeatedly forced to have oral and anal sex with eleven men over a period of almost two years from october or september 2010 to june 2012. the men had filmed the events and had threatened to disclose this information to the public should the applicant refuse to comply with their demands.7.  in response to a complaint lodged by the applicant’s father, the authorities instituted a preliminary inquiry during which p., an investigator, questioned the applicant (who provided a detailed account of the above-mentioned events), subjected the applicant to a gynaecological examination (which did not detect any traces of sexual assault on the applicant’s body), conducted an inspection of the locations where the alleged rapes had taken place and collected wet towel wipes found at the location of the “t.l.” area (the applicant having explained that one of the rapists had wiped himself with a towel wipe).10.  having examined the material obtained in the course of the inquiry, p., the investigator, discerned no evidence to support the applicant’s allegations of rape and on 26 july 2012 issued a decision declining to open a criminal investigation against the alleged perpetrators.11.  on 2 august 2012 the head of the inter-district investigative committee quashed the decision of 26 july 2012, noting that the investigator had not questioned all the alleged perpetrators and had failed to obtain the results of the forensic examination.31.  on 29 january 2015 the district court dismissed the applicant’s complaint against the decision of 16 may 2014. on 1 april 2015 the supreme court of the dagestan republic upheld the decision of 29 january 2015 on appeal.
59); struck with a book to the head, ears and back of the head and made to kneel on small objects spread out on the floor (by ch., k. and p. during the search in his apartment); punched, kicked and dragged to the ground and spat upon in the face (during the search in the garage); punched in the head, abdomen and chest, nearly suffocated with a plastic bag placed over his head, struck several times in the torso and kicked in the left kidney (by ch., k. and p. from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. in d.’s office at the st petersburg investigative committee), and threatened with a gun by ch.3575 p, which was carried out in the absence of the applicant from 13 to 18 september 2013 on the basis of the investigator’s order of 2 september 2013, and which comprised an analysis of the applicant’s medical records, the applicant had the following injuries: (i) bruising on his forehead; (ii) bruising on his chest and abdomen; (iii) an abrasion on his abdomen; (iv) abrasions on his right elbow joint and both knee joints, recorded on 5 july 2013; and (v) bruising on his arms, recorded on 8 july 2013. the expert concluded that the applicant’s injuries, as recorded on 5 and 8 july 2013, had been caused within the last fourteen to fifteen days.it was carried out in the absence of the applicant on the basis of the investigator’s order of 15 october 2013, and comprised an analysis of the applicant’s medical documents and photographs in which he could be seen lying on the ground face down after his arrest in the presence of several police officers of the special rapid response unit.the expert further reiterated the conclusions made in the previous report about the other possible causes of the injuries such as being struck and, in particular, that he did not exclude the possibility that the applicant’s injuries to his abdomen, taking into account their nature and localisation, could have equally been caused by being kicked in that area one or more times, as was alleged by the applicant.as to the abrasions on his limbs, head and abdomen, the investigator concluded that they had most probably been caused during the arrest as a result of the use of combat techniques on the applicant by the officers of the special rapid response unit and the applicant’s position (нахождение) on the ground.
the statement read as follows: “the wave of revolution that started in kobani must spread throughout kurdistan, and on that basis, we call for an uprising by the kurdish youth ... all those among our people who can make it to suruç must go there immediately without wasting a second, and every inch of kurdistan must rise up for kobani ... we call upon all our people, from 7 to 70, to make life unbearable for daesh and their collaborators the akp wherever they are, and to take a stand against these gangs [responsible for] massacres by fostering rebellion [serhildan in kurdish] up to the highest level.” (“kobani ile başlayan devrim dalgası tüm kürdistan’a yayılmalı ve bu temelde kürt gençliğinin ayaklanması çağrısında bulunuyoruz... bütün halkımız suruç’a gidebilecekler hemen bir saniye zaman kaybetmeden gitmeli ve kürdistan’ın her karış toprağı kobanê için ayağa kalkmalıdır... tüm halkımızı yediden yetmişe bulunduğu her yerde yaşamı işi̇d ve işbirlikçisi akp’ye dar etmeye ve serhıldanı en üst düzeyde geliştirerek bu katliamcı çetelere karşı durmaya çağırıyoruz.”) 18.  on 7 october 2014 the following statement by the kck executive council was published on the same website: “our people must carry on the resistance they have started against this terrible and insidious massacre, by spreading it everywhere and at all times.the magistrate ordered his continued detention, having regard to the existence of grounds justifying it; the nature of the alleged offences and the fact that they were among those listed in article 100 § 3 of the ccp; the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed a criminal offence within the meaning of article 5 of the convention; the strong suspicion against the applicant for the purposes of article 19 of the constitution; and the factual evidence grounding a strong suspicion that he had committed an offence for the purposes of article 100 of the code of criminal procedure.(vi) the applicant was in charge of the political wing of the kck illegal organisation; the public prosecutor presented evidence against him including the following: –  two documents, entitled “documento” and “ikram ark”, discovered on a hard drive seized from the home of a certain a.d., who had been sentenced to eighteen years’ imprisonment for leading a terrorist organisation; according to those documents, the kck leader in turkey, s.o., had given instructions to several people, including the applicant, to visit the relatives of i̇.e., who had been mistakenly assassinated by the pkk; –  the records of intercepted telephone conversations between s.o.in a decision of 14 march 2017 the diyarbakır assize court dismissed the objection on the basis of the nature of the alleged offences, the state of the evidence, the period that the applicant had spent in detention, the strong suspicion that he had committed the offences in question and his refusal to appear before the investigating authorities during the investigation.82.  on 21 may 2018 the ankara 19th assize court, by a majority, dismissed the objection, on the following grounds: –  the existence of evidence grounding a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences of which he was accused; –  the fact that the offences in question were among those listed in article 100 § 3 of the ccp; –  the severity of the sentences prescribed by law for the offences concerned; –  the finding that alternative measures to detention appeared insufficient; –  the applicant’s refusal to appear before the investigating authorities; –  the fact that the applicant’s defence submissions had not yet been obtained.
summarising the content of the records drawn up until that point and referring to all the correspondence between her and the applicant company, she maintained that the company’s representatives had acted in a hostile manner and tried to obstruct the work of the inspectors by hiding information such as their names and the official address of the company, as well as by unjustly accusing her.25.  on 23 january 2001 the tax inspectorate requested an extension of the audit period, on account of the substantial number of documents seized during the search and the fact that the applicant company had not submitted the missing documents until 23 december 2000. it also stated that the applicant company had not yet presented some of the documents requested.reiterating the content of the records drawn up during the visits to that latter address, the report noted that after having obtained a search warrant from the magistrates’ court, the inspectors had had to seize the relevant documents and take them to the tax inspectorate, as the audit could not be carried out there due to the staff’s behaviour and as it was not the applicant company’s registered business address within the meaning of section 139 of the tax procedure act (law no.32.  the applicant company brought two sets of proceedings before the istanbul tax court, requesting the annulment of the income tax and the penalty imposed in respect of different periods of year 2001. it stated that both the tax and the penalty had resulted from the payment made to it by the iron and steel company following the judgment of the commercial court to that effect, and that the amount was not yet subject to any tax as proceedings were still pending before the court of cassation.44.  on 27 april 2004 the supreme administrative court partially quashed the judgments, finding that although the annulment of the provisional taxation was in line with the relevant legislation, as the set-off period had elapsed, under the relevant provisions a penalty could still be imposed for failure on the part of the taxpayer to declare the correct amount.
the physical torture that i am going to describe ... was very subtle so that it did not leave marks, but it caused intense pain ... and the other torture, well, it left marks ... above all the first one on my colleague ... the first act of torture was carried out by national police officers, as i say, as soon as they came ... they grabbed my colleague’s arm, the free one, and they fixed a rope to his wrist quite tightly and they took the rope out of the tunnel and three national police officers ... pulled him to try to get him out ... with the purpose of causing him pain, frightening him, you know.well this was physical torture ... psychological torture was repeated eh, well it was continuous ... psychological torture was repeated several times and it was mainly perpetrated by fire fighters and consisted of brief psychological mistreatment ... they told us that it was impossible to take us out alive ..., that we would be killed by rubble because there was a bulldozer working right above us, [and] we were listening to the bulldozer ... [t]hey used the famous ‘oxygen measuring device’ which indicated that we were about to pass out ... they told us that the police were going to inject us with a sleep serum ... [t]hey told us that the police were going to introduce gas through the ventilation system, they did not specify which type of gas ... [t]hey also told us that they would release rats inside the tunnel ...” 18.  a female journalist asked the applicant whether the medical report had revealed any kind of physical or psychological damage, to which the applicant answered “not psychological” yet “physical”.additionally, the criminal judge observed that the authorities had then taken the decision to tie the applicant’s right hand to his ankle in order to immobilise him, in view of the risk of the walls collapsing and the applicant’s threat to kick down the unstable wooden posts that had been installed by the fire fighters as a preventive measure.in this case “the applicant [had] exceeded the bounds of his right to freedom of speech ... by violating other people’s rights.” 24.  the criminal judge noted that the behaviour of the police officers did not disclose all the elements under the legal classification of torture within the meaning of article 174 of the spanish criminal code, which clearly defined torture as follows: “torture is committed by a public authority or official who, in abuse of office, and in order to obtain a confession or information from a person, or to punish him or her for any act he or she may have committed, or is suspected of having committed, or for any reason based on any kind of discrimination, subjects that person to conditions or procedures that, owing to their nature, duration or other circumstances, cause him or her physical or mental suffering, suppression of or decrease in his or her powers of cognisance, discernment or decision-making, or that in any other way attack his or her honour”.27.  in reply to the argument that the word “torture” had been used colloquially, the judge considered the following: “[t]he applicant’s repetition of the word torture reveals that it was not an occasional and exceptional use of such word in place, but it was exposed and expressed in full awareness and repeatedly in order to get the message across to listeners, i.e., that the applicant had been subject to torture by police officers and fire fighters.” 28.  the applicant lodged an appeal with the seville audiencia provincial, which on 28 june 2013 partially ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the fine to be reduced to twelve month fine with a daily amount of eur 10. the audiencia provincial upheld the remaining elements of the first-instance judgment.
the applicant, who had applied for access to, and been given copies of the file prior to the issuance of the penal order, lodged a timely objection against that order and asked to be given access to the file again, which was granted.the district court orally heard s. as well as b. and m., the latter two having been present at the event in question, as witnesses and also evaluated a medical certificate concerning the injuries sustained by s. it convicted the applicant of libel and two counts of assault and sentenced him to a fine of 90 day-fines of eur 15 each.in a written submission of 11 july 2011, he stated that he wished to pursue the appeal lodged by the applicant as an appeal on points of law (resulting in the competency of the berlin court of appeal, rather than of the regional court).the legislature had deliberately chosen to limit the presumption that an accused cannot defend himself to cases where the competent court had appointed counsel for the victim for the private accessory prosecution in accordance with articles 397a and 406g §§ 3 and 4 of the code (see paragraph 20 below).it considered that the applicant had knowledge of the parts of the file relevant for the decision, which did not give rise to factual or legal difficulties, that the nature of the offences and the potential sentence at stake were not significant, and that the factual background and the taking of evidence were easily understandable.
had bequeathed the apartment to her by the will certified by a public notary back in 1991, she had been informed that the applicant had submitted another will in respect of the same apartment according to which the apartment was to pass down to him.21.  at the hearing of 25 september 2008, the applicant’s representative requested again the examination of the expert witnesses but his request was orally rejected by the trial court judge.the judge reasoned this decision by stating that as the subsequent expert opinions already explained the content of the first opinion issued by a.d., it was not necessary to call the expert witnesses.in doing so, it mostly relied on the trial statements of the victims’ relatives and neighbours, who confirmed that the applicant had visited the sisters in their apartment several times; on the expert opinions; and on material evidence seized from the applicant’s apartment, namely the originals of the ownership certificate in respect of v.g.’s apartment, v.g.’s will drawn up on 5 april 2006 and a duplicate of v.g.’s death certificate.24.  on 12 february 2009 the criminal court of appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal without addressing the complaint about his inability to have the experts examined during his trial.
the government submitted that electricity was supplied round the clock but, to reduce power consumption as part of a nationwide energy‑saving strategy, the voltage of the general lighting in the institution had been reduced from 220 to 110 v. the applicant submitted that that meant that, even when the lighting had been on, the cell had been dimly lit and the light insufficient for activities such as reading and sewing.12.  the applicant alleged that he had been repeatedly ill-treated by prison guards, that the prison authorities had intercepted, reviewed, blocked and delayed his correspondence, particularly that with the court and the parliamentary commissioner for human rights, and had persecuted and threatened him for having applied to the court.14.  registers of incoming and outgoing mail from the correctional colonies submitted by the government show that, in the period from 17 june 2008 to 1 december 2011 – the only period of the applicant’s detention for which specific information in this regard is available – the applicant sent and received more than sixty letters to and from various public entities, most notably various domestic courts, disciplinary commissions of judges, members of parliament and the presidential administration.for instance, in a cover letter of november 2011 to the judges qualifications commission of ukraine the governor of the second colony stated that he was forwarding a letter by the applicant concerning the initiation of criminal proceedings against the judges of the trial court that had convicted him.18.  in subsequent correspondence between the registry, the applicant and the lawyer it transpired that the applicant was apparently upset about the lawyer’s inability to help him with matters unrelated to the proceedings before the court, such as sending him various goods and representation in unrelated domestic judicial and pardon proceedings.
10.  on 15 january 2009 the court examined the admissibility and merits of the case and held unanimously that there had been a violation of article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) of the convention in that the applicant had not received effective legal assistance during the appeal proceedings in his criminal case.13.  on 13 october 2011 the president of the supreme court, referring to the court’s judgment in the applicant’s case, asked the presidium of the supreme court to reopen the proceedings.she did not submit fresh grounds for appeal and made submissions to the court that appeared to be based on the grounds for appeal originally filed by the applicant and counsel a. the applicant, who was detained in novosibirsk, took part in the hearing by means of a video link.in particular, the court held as follows: “regard being had to the evidence submitted, [it follows] that during the period under consideration the personal space afforded to each inmate in the cell where the applicant was detained ... was 2.6 sq.1 in novosibirsk was below the standards set forth in the national legislation and in the case-law of the echr.” 25.  according to the applicant, he received the compensation awarded to him by the judgment of 10 september 2013 in july 2016.
in the former two, she proactively informed the court that the land office had taken decisions in respect of her restitution claim on 23 december 2011 and 12 january 2012 and contended that these decisions did not determine her claim in relation to all the plots concerned and that they had been taken with the aim of creating a false impression that there had been no unjustified delays in the proceedings.as to the latter ruling, it summarised the applicant’s claim as pertaining to three acts of legal assistance (the first consultation with a lawyer, the formulation of the action, and the formulation of the submission of 2 january 2012).there is no reference in the regional court’s decision to the remaining two acts of legal assistance in the summary of the applicant’s claim, in the courts’ reasoning, or in the operative part of its decision.however, in determining the issue of legal costs, the regional court had made no use of that provision and, in any event, no such circumstances pertained, in particular because the case concerned unjustified delays in proceedings before a public authority lasting more than seven years; her efforts to ensure an out-of-court solution had been futile and had left her with no alternative to asserting her rights in the regional court; legal representation before that court was mandatory, the applicant was disabled, and she was living on the allowance specified above.however, it was necessary to take into account that the value of the remaining two acts of legal assistance was only some eur 270. this was less than three times the statutory minimum wage, the limit that was otherwise applicable to admissibility of appeals on points of law.
following the last question, the applicant stated that m.k., one of the alleged members of the tdp at the time, had asked him to provide him with a fake identity card in order to escape abroad and he had provided him with the identity information of his brother.according to the applicant’s submissions to the court, after his lawyer was forced to leave, the police officers coerced him into signing self-incriminating statements which he had made while his lawyer was present, by indicating to him that they would involve his brother in the case if he refused to sign the statements.at the same hearing, the court noted that the investigation file relating to the allegations that the police officers had ill-treated the accused and had not allowed them to see their lawyers had been sent to the fatih public prosecutor’s office.20.  a document provided by the ptt (the postal, telegraph and telephone service) to the erzurum assize court shows that on 26 january 2007 the forthcoming hearing date was served on the secretary of the applicant’s lawyer.the prosecutor stated that they had ill-treated the applicant and other suspects in police custody between 17 and 21 march 2004. it further held that they had not allowed the lawyers to examine certain documents, had not given them copies of those documents and had terminated the interviews on the grounds that the lawyers had interfered with the free will of the suspects and reminded them of their right to remain silent in the course of the interviews.
the relevant parts of the judgment read as follows: “the applicant and other civil servants holding various posts in the district have been the subject of a disciplinary investigation in connection with their alleged acts of ‘disrupting the peace, tranquillity and working order of the institution for ideological and political purposes; participating, provoking, encouraging or otherwise assisting in acts such as boycotts, occupations, obstructions, slowdowns and strikes or being collectively absent from work.’ the ministry of education’s investigation report dated 30 june 2000 recommended the applicant’s dismissal from public service because [he] was a member of the hizbullah terrorist organisation.hence, following an examination of the case file and investigation report, the court finds it established that the applicant committed the disciplinary offence in so far as he gave the organisation his profile and attended its lessons and meetings.” 25.  on 21 june 2005 the first applicant appealed against the judgment of the diyarbakır administrative court to the supreme administrative court, requesting a stay of the decision ordering for his dismissal from service.he complained, inter alia, that the criminal proceedings on charges of membership of an illegal organisation were still pending before the diyarbakır state security court and that, therefore, his dismissal without a conviction on the basis of abstract accusations infringed the presumption of innocence; that the allegations that he had disturbed the peace and order at the workplace remained completely unproven and unsubstantiated; and that in delivering its decision, the supreme disciplinary council had failed to comply with the six-month time‑limit set out in law no.referring to the second applicant’s statements given to the police, his cv obtained from the hizbullah safe house in istanbul and the bill of indictment filed against him by the mardin public prosecutor, the supreme administrative court then found it established that the second applicant was a member of a terrorist organisation who in addition had recruited members to the organisation and pursued the ideology of the terrorist organisation in the classroom.657. the relevant parts of the judgment read: “notwithstanding the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings against the applicant on charges of membership of an armed organisation and his acquittal on charges of murder and battery, the investigation and [criminal] case file reveal that the applicant’s profile was discovered in the organisation’s [safe] house in istanbul and that his statements to the police and the bill of indictment demonstrate the fact that he was a member of the organisation, recruiting new members and lecturing on its ideologies, facts which were corroborated by his statements and [cv].
in particular, the district court established the following: (i) the building in question was federal property; it was used as a dormitory building under the operative management of the treasury; (ii) the dormitories had been designed for the temporary accommodation of persons during the period of their work, service or studies; (iii) the adult female applicants had been moved into the dormitory building by their husbands when the old housing code had been in force, prior to 1 march 2005; (iv) the ministry of finance had never issued any decision providing the adult female applicants with accommodation in that dormitory building; (v) no tenancy agreements had been concluded with the adult female applicants’ husbands in respect of the premises which they occupied; (vi) social tenancy agreements could be concluded with people living in dormitory buildings only in the event that the property was liquidated, however such a decision had not been taken in respect of the dormitory building in question.in particular, the district court referred to its findings in the judgment of 14 september 2007, with reference to articles 301 and 305 of the civil code (see “relevant domestic law” below), and found that: (i) irrespective of their status as family members of their husbands, the adult female applicants had no right to reside in the dormitory building, since it had been designed as temporary accommodation for persons working for the security service; and (ii) no tenancy agreement on occupying the dormitory building premises had been concluded with their husbands, and therefore the provisions of article 100 § 5 of the housing code, which allowed tenants to be joined by family members, were not applicable to them.the city court referred to the findings of the district court in the judgments of 14 september 2007 and 14 april 2010. the city court found that the district court had duly assessed the adult female applicants’ arguments and dismissed them on the basis of the applicable domestic law.the city court further held that the adult female applicants’ argument that the eviction order had de facto prohibited their families from living together had aimed to reassess the conclusions of the judgment of the district court and, given the fresh conclusion that the district court had duly assessed the arguments before it, could not serve as a basis for quashing the judgment.in particular, the court established that the adult male applicants had been moved into the dormitory building by their employer, the security service of the ministry of finance, between 1990 and 1995. therefore, on the date the new housing code had entered into force, they had already worked for the security service for more than ten years.
8.  on the basis of this report the applicant, while reserving the right to increase his claims in due course, made an initial request for compensation to the ministry of interior, claiming 20,000 turkish liras (try) in pecuniary damages and try 5,000 in non-pecuniary damages.9.  following tacit dismissal of the claim by the ministry, the applicant brought a case for compensation before the istanbul administrative court for the amounts he had specified in his request to the ministry.10.  during the course of the proceedings, the court decided of its own motion to order an expert report to determine the exact amount of pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant.the report, which was submitted to the court on 26 september 2005, indicated the applicant’s pecuniary damages as 157,077 try.the applicant did not submit a request to the court to increase his initial claims in the light of that report.
the founding members adopted several documents concerning the applicant association, including its charter, the relevant parts of which read as follows: article 1 “the church of real orthodox christians of macedonia [hereinafter “the church”] is a voluntary association of individuals, who exercise, through their religious beliefs and doctrinal sources, the freedom of religion ... through preaching; prayer; religious rituals; and other forms of expression.” article 3 “the seat of the [applicant association] is [the street name].” article 8 “the aims of the church are the following: ... -  to promote, stimulate and educate the members about the spiritual life and development; -  to hold and organise religious education; educative religious discussions and lectures; public religious debates; visits to monasteries ... to hold preaching sessions; prayer meetings ... and other orthodox rituals; -  to organise humanitarian funds and actions for the well-being and support of people; -  to take care and support all who are in a need of help ...; ... -  to inform the orthodox followers about religious holidays and culture; -  to publish bulletins, material, publications, books and advertising material with orthodox content; -  to organise and hold joint meetings, rituals and other religious activities with other orthodox churches in the state and abroad with whom the church is in union.” ...” article 9 “as part of its activity, the church will publish literature with orthodox content and establish funds, in particular, for: -  publication of bulletins and periodicals ...; -  publication of chronicles concerning the work of the members; -  publication of books; -  creation of funds for financial aid.” article 11 “the publication and humanitarian activity of the church, as well as the funds that it will establish, shall be financed by: -  sponsors; -  donations; -  contributions; -  funds gained by its own economic activities.” article 27 “the church will be financed by: -  economic activities; -  sponsorship; -  donations; -  voluntary contributions and funds, and so forth.” 6.  on 26 november 2008 the ministry of justice granted permission to the applicant association to use the word “macedonia” in the name.in this connection, the court held that: (a) the text of article 1 of the charter was not identical to the text of section 2 of the 2007 act; (b) articles 9 and 10 of the charter specified that the applicant association would publish literature with religious content and would create funds, which, according to the court, was contrary to the aims specified in section 2 of the 2007 act.in this connection it was noted that articles 11 and 27 of the charter specified that the applicant association would be financed, inter alia, by economic activities (стопанска дејност), which was contrary to sections 30-33 of the 2007 act; (c) there was no evidence that the founding members and the second applicant were macedonian nationals; and (d) despite the fact that the founding members had adopted the required documents for registration of the applicant association, they had not discussed the issues specified in section 13(1)(2-6) of the 2007 act.10.  referring to sections 7 and 8 of the 2007 act, the court also found that: “the registration of the voluntary association of physical persons under the name ‘church of real orthodox christians of macedonia’ ... would violate the freedom of religion ... of all physical persons-believers who exercise the[ir] freedom of religion through already registered religious communities and, in particular, the lawful legal status of other registered voluntary associations of physical persons ... and their managing bodies; hierarchy; their competence; titles; religious activity and everything that is regulated by their rules ... ... the free manifestation of religion cannot endanger ... human rights and freedoms of others ...” 11.  the second applicant lodged an appeal with the skopje court of appeal in which he complained on behalf of the applicant association that the reasons given by the registration court were unclear and contradictory.in this connection he argued, inter alia, that he had submitted copies of nationality documentation for the founding members; that section 31 of the 2007 act provided that religious entities could publish relevant literature; that the sources of income provided for in the charter corresponded to those set forth in the 2007 act; and that the registration court had not explained how and why the registration of the applicant association would affect the religious beliefs and managing bodies of other registered religious communities.
8.  according to the subsequent findings of the domestic court which convicted the applicant of aggravated robbery (see paragraph 18 below), the applicant had attacked g., whom he had known previously, and seized a certain amount of cash belonging to her employer, the company that ran the shop.12.  on 23 july 2005 a number of reports were drawn up: (i) an arrest report according to which the applicant was arrested on suspicion of robbery; (ii) a record stating that the applicant’s procedural rights as a suspect had been explained to him, including the right to remain silent, to have a legal aid lawyer appointed and to consult him prior to the first questioning; (iii) a record stating that the applicant, having been informed of the right to legal assistance, had decided to waive it; (iv) a transcript of the applicant’s questioning as a suspect: the applicant’s account of events was as set out in paragraph 9 above.the court relied on, inter alia: (i) the applicant’s admissions in the course of the trial; (ii) the victim’s court testimony, denying, in particular, having borrowed any money from the applicant, as well as her statements incriminating the applicant given in the course of a reconstruction of the crime scene and confrontation with the applicant; (iii) money and clothes with brown spots seized from the applicant on 22 july 2005;[1] (iv) testimony given by d., the applicant’s girlfriend, who denied any knowledge of the applicant having lent any money and stated, on the contrary, that he himself had been borrowing money from her; (v) the testimony of the victim’s sister and son, equally denying knowledge of any debt.the sister stated that at 7 p.m. on 22 july 2005 in the hospital, the victim had told her that she knew the attacker; (vi) the pre-trial statement of m., a sales clerk in a neighbouring shop, who had stated in the course of the pre-trial investigation that he had seen someone looking like the applicant enter the victim’s shop and then run away from it after the alarm had gone off; he had then discovered the victim injured.33.  in a letter to the court of 12 december 2008, the applicant submitted that the domestic authorities were refusing to provide him with certain documents, which could prove his innocence, for his application to the court, namely: (i)  the statement by m. and documents concerning the court’s efforts to summon that witness (see paragraph 18 (vi) above); (ii)  the statement of the victim; (iii)  documents concerning a civil claim for damages made by the shop that had been robbed; (iv)  the transcript of a particular hearing before the trial court; (v)  statements made by the applicant in the course of the investigation on 22 and 23 july 2005; (vi)  search and seizure records of 22 july 2005. the applicant added that he did have copies of the documents from the criminal case file but they were of poor quality, preventing him from sending them to the court.
6.  the relevant parts of the founding decision read as follows: article 1 “this decision serves (the purpose of) the registration of stavropegic monastery of saint john chrysostom in the register of churches, religious communities (верски заедници) and groups (религиозни групи) in the republic of macedonia, as a voluntary, non-profit association of christians who do not belong to any religious community and, in particular, have nothing in common with the macedonian orthodox church.” article 3 “because it is a christian religious community ...” 7.  the relevant parts of the charter read as follows: article 1 “the stavropegic monastery of saint john chrysostom is a voluntary association of individuals who exercise, through their religious beliefs and doctrinal sources, freedom of religion ... through preaching, prayer, religious rituals, and other forms of expression.” article 2 “the stavropegic monastery of saint john chrysostom is a religious community founded by nuns (completely devoted to god) and private citizens (световни лица), whose religious beliefs correspond to the old and new testament (the bible).it found that the application for registration did not meet the requirements laid down in sections 1 and 2 of the 2007 act on the legal status of a church, religious community and association (“the 2007 act”, see paragraphs 14 and 15 below) in that (a) it referred to a form of voluntary association of physical persons which was not covered by the act and (b) the registration of the applicant association “would violate the freedom of religion ‑ provided for in the convention and the constitution ‒ of other lawfully registered voluntary associations of physical persons”.as to the former, the court held that the 2007 act provided for the registration of churches, religious communities and groups but not of other religious entities, in this case a “monastery” (манастир), as specified in article 1 of the applicant association’s charter.lastly, the court stated that the complainant had requested that it review the application of the law by the registration court in the proceedings for the registration of the religious community, which, according to the constitutional court, was beyond its jurisdiction (u.br.189/09).
34.  on the same date, on 23 december 2004, during a court hearing regarding the application of the preventive measure, which was held in the presence of v., from 10 until 12 a.m., the applicant submitted, inter alia, that on the morning of 14 november 2004, at the police station, she had denied having participated in the thefts and had unsuccessfully requested the assistance of a lawyer.the court based the applicant’s conviction on: her voluntary surrender to the police and the self-incriminatory statements that she had made on 14, 17 and on 23 november 2004 (see paragraphs 12, 14, 18 and 26 above); confessions given by her accomplices during the pre-trial investigation; the records of the crime scene examinations; and statements by the victims (that is to say farm owners) and witnesses confirming the fact that animals had been stolen from the farms.it noted in this respect that the police officers concerned had denied all allegations of ill-treatment; a surgeon, n., who examined the applicant on 25 november 2004 (see paragraph 55 below) had submitted that he had found no bodily injuries when he had examined her; the forensic expert who had examined the applicant on 22 november 2004 had also attested that no injuries had been found by him on the applicant’s body (see paragraph 52 below); and attesting witnesses who had been present at the crime reconstructions (in which the defendants had participated) had submitted that the applicant and other defendants had given evidence of their own free will.in doing so the court referred to (i) the applicant’s voluntary surrender to the police and to the further self-incriminatory statements that she had made during her questioning, which had been corroborated by those made by her alleged accomplices, and (ii) the fact that remains of animals had been found at the place pointed out by the applicant during the reconstruction of the crime.according to the government, the decision was based on the results of the applicant’s medical examination of 22 november 2004 (see paragraph 52 above), the police officers denial of ill‑treatment and on the fact that the applicant had not raised any complaint about her ill-treatment during a court hearing on the application of a preventive measure.
it had regard to: (i) a request lodged by the nuremberg general public prosecutor on 20 july 2011 requesting the dismissal of the applicant’s appeal; (ii) the findings of fact made by the regensburg regional court in its judgment of 22 june 2009; (iii) the findings of two medical experts in the proceedings leading to the judgment of 22 june 2009; (iv) the findings of two other experts in previous proceedings regarding the applicant’s mental condition and the level of danger that he posed; and (v) the new restrictive standards set by the federal constitutional court in its judgment of 4 may 2011.the applicant alleged that judge p. had remarked to the applicant’s female defence counsel on 22 june 2009, immediately after the delivery of the regional court’s judgment ordering the applicant’s subsequent preventive detention, in reference to the applicant: “be careful that after he is released, you don’t find him standing in front of your door waiting to thank you.” he claimed that the remark had been made in the course of a discussion in camera between the judges of the regional court and the applicant’s two lawyers concerning the applicant’s possible transfer to a psychiatric hospital following the regional court’s judgment.33.  the regional court based its 164-page judgment on sections 7(2)(1) and 105(1) of the juvenile courts act, read in conjunction with the federal constitutional court’s judgment of 4 may 2011. it considered, firstly, that a comprehensive assessment of the applicant, his offence and, in addition, his development during the execution of the sentence relating to young offenders revealed that there was a high risk that the applicant, owing to specific circumstances relating to his person or his conduct, could commit the most serious types of violent crimes and sexual offences, similar to the one he had been found guilty of, if released.having regard to the case-law of the federal court of justice and the federal constitutional court, it considered that, whereas a mere “accentuation of the personality” was not sufficient to constitute a mental disorder within the meaning of the said act, such disorder did not have to be so serious as to exclude or diminish the criminal responsibility of the person concerned for the purposes of articles 20 and 21 of the criminal code (see paragraphs 82-83 and 88-89 below).38.  in an appeal on points of law against the regional court’s judgment of 3 august 2012, the applicant complained of the unlawfulness of his “retrospective” preventive detention and of the fact that the judgment had been delivered with the participation of a biased judge, p. 39.  on 5 march 2013 the federal court of justice dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as ill-founded.
the checkpoint logbook had an entry which recorded the passage of the car through the checkpoint at 8 p.m. on 19 june 2003. subsequently, the time was changed to 7 p.m. servicemen manning the checkpoint told the applicants that at about 9 p.m. on 19 june 2003 they had seen something burning not far from the checkpoint.35.  on 20 november 2002 the ingushetia minister of the interior informed the deputy head of the ingushetia government that the operational search activities conducted into the disappearance of mr sultan saynaroyev showed that the latter had been abducted by unidentified military servicemen, who had taken him in a military vehicle in the direction of the chechen republic.40.  on 10 january 2003 the acting head of the criminal investigation department of the ingushetia ministry of the interior reported to the investigators that on 29 november 2002 the united group alignment had confirmed that mr sultan saynaroyev had been detained by servicemen of the fsb, but that the fsb in a letter of 3 january 2003 had denied any involvement in the incident.73.  at about midnight the special operation was completed and the servicemen left ersenoy and drove to the settlement of vedeno; they travelled in a large group of military vehicles, including several apcs, ural military lorries and the uaz minivan containing mr alash mugadiyev and mr s.a. 74.  the applicant followed the servicemen to the settlement, where she met the commander of the vostok special battalion, mr y.d., who confirmed that her husband and several other residents of ersenoy had been detained by his battalion’s servicemen.having sent several requests to various state bodies for information, the investigators suspended the proceedings on 24 june 2013. on 13 november 2013 that decision was declared unlawful by a higher investigating authority and ill-founded on account of the investigators’ failure to establish the identity of the owner of the vehicle with the registration number 798ax95rus.
16.  following the meeting of 14 august 2014, on 9 september 2014 the bucharest child protection authority asked the bucharest district court to order a two-month psychological counselling programme for the children, under the provisions of article 912 of the code of civil procedure (psychological counselling for children who refuse contact with the estranged parent).on 22 january 2015, she drafted a final report, recommending as follows: “bearing in mind the numerous relationship problems identified, i consider it opportune to recommend an immediate[1] clinical psychological evaluation of the children and the parents, of the current relations between them, as well as their continued psychological counselling.” 18.  on 28 january 2015 the first applicant contacted the bucharest child protection authority again and explained that the behaviour exhibited by the children during their recent encounter made her fear that they were suffering from parent alienation syndrome because of their father’s influence over them.590a/5 may 2014, in so far as the romanian state had a positive obligation to urgently take all necessary legal measures in order to protect the [first applicant]’s right to family life, by immediately returning the children to their mother’s home, in order to avoid the parental alienation exhibited by the children towards the [first applicant].... the court notes that the first-instance court’s decision to set the children’s home with their father on the grounds that they were attached to him by strong affection and that they refused to communicate with [the first applicant], is the direct consequence of the non-enforcement of decision no.... the break of the family ties between the mother and her children will without any doubt become permanent if the children are to live with their father, and therefore any visiting programme for the mother and the children will be illusory and formal in so far as the mother was unable to obtain the enforcement of a final decision for more than four years and as during that time she practically could not even speak with the children.”
in 2006 the city inter-departmental commission responsible for the state housing certificates program of the department of the housing policy and housing fund of moscow (the moscow housing commission) rejected his request and annulled its decision of 2002, referring to a change of legislation concerning the financing of the resettlement from closed administrative units.the court confirmed the applicant’s and his four family members’ right to housing provision in the form of the housing certificate, to be performed at the expense of the federal budget and at the place of the claimants’ registration as persons in need of housing.11.  on 10 february 2011 the department of the housing policy and the housing fund of moscow conducted a campaign for re-registration of persons in need of housing and sent the applicant a letter setting out a list of eleven documents to be provided, including, among others, a duly certified copy the decision to dismiss the applicant stating the reasons for the dismissal, as well as documents confirming his title to the flat in znamensk.the authority established that a number of documents were missing from the applicant’s, namely, a duly certified copy of the decision to dismiss the applicant stating the reasons for the dismissal, as well as documents confirming his title to the flat in znamensk, and invited the applicant to provide the documents.14.  according to the letter of 22 august 2016 by the department of the housing policy and the housing fund of moscow to the representative of the russian federation to the court, the authority has not received a copy of the judgment of 9 april 2007, and the applicant had not applied “with documents” for a housing certificate.
7.  in july 2006 the applicant instituted proceedings in the malyn district court against m., challenging the paternity of k. the applicant claimed that, even though he had been married to another woman at the relevant time, he had had relations with m. and he had been sure that he was the father of the child and so accepted the paternity.the court noted that the applicant had a right to challenge his paternity given that there was no evidence in the file to suggest that he had known that he was not the father of the child when accepting paternity of k. 9.  m. appealed, stating that from january 1993 she and the applicant had lived together without being married and that she had never had any doubts about the applicant’s paternity of k. she argued, inter alia, that the genetic expert’s opinion was not reliable.10.  on 29 may 2008 the zhytomyr regional court of appeal quashed the first-instance court’s decision and held that, under article 56 of the family and marriage code, the applicant had not had a right to challenge his paternity because at the time that he accepted paternity of k., he was aware that he was not k.’s father.in support of that finding the court of appeal noted that before k.’s birth, the applicant and m. had not been married, they had not lived together (noting, in particular, that between february and april 1993 the applicant lived in another town), and the applicant had been married to another woman at the relevant time.11.  the applicant appealed on a point of law, contending that there were no grounds for the court of appeal to find that at the material time he was aware that he was not the biological father of the child.
6.  in february 2014 the first applicant lodged a petition with the parliamentary commission on petitions (“the commission”), requesting a change to the wording of the provision of the code for the execution of sentences in order that it would read that electronic items could be given to inmates by their friends and acquaintances as well as by their spouses, partners and close relatives.addressing the first applicant’s proposal that article 96 § 1 of the code for the execution of sentences be amended so that it would permit inmates to receive electronic items from their acquaintances or friends, as well as from their spouses, partners or close relatives, the commission held that the existing regulation was aimed at preventing inmates from receiving items acquired by criminal means – for example, by their accomplices in crime.9.  on 19 may 2014 the vilnius regional administrative court ascertained that the second applicant had been confined to the prison hospital from 22 march until 13 april 2010, from 25 february until 4 march 2011, from 21 until 27 september 2011 and from 17 until 24 january 2014. the court also applied the three-year statutory time‑limit to part of the second applicant’s complaint.the court held that it was impossible to determine how much personal space the second applicant had had between 21 and 27 september 2011; accordingly, it calculated in favour of the second applicant the number of days during which he had not had enough personal space (that is to say the court calculated the number of such days and, in the absence of specific data, stated that the applicant had been held in overcrowded cells for more days than he probably had been held there).19.  it appears from the information provided by the government that the second applicant received a personal computer in january 2011 (which he returned to his relatives in june 2011); another personal computer, a monitor and headphones in june 2011 (which he returned to his relatives in july 2016); and a usb key (which was destroyed at the second applicant’s request in december 2016) and a laptop in august 2016.
8.  on 8 may 1998 the slavyanoserbskiy district prosecutor’s office of the luhansk region (прокуратура слов’яносербського району луганської області  “the prosecutor’s office”) refused to institute criminal proceedings against two asylum employees (orderlies), n. and l. when questioned about the incident, the orderlies testified that on the morning of 2 april 1998 they had been cleaning the rooms when they had heard someone crying.other patients had told n. and l. that b. had beaten the applicant with a mop because she had hit b. the prosecutor noted that (i) b. was “without legal capacity because of a mental disorder” (недієздатна внаслідок психічного розладу) and thus could not be held criminally responsible for assaulting the applicant, and (ii) even though it appeared that orderlies n. and l. had been negligent in their duties (according to the asylum orderlies’ list of duties submitted by the government they were not allowed to leave patients unsupervised), which could possibly constitute a crime under article 167 of the 1960 criminal code (see paragraph 27 below), they were not considered to be “officials” who could be prosecuted under that provision.that decision was identical to the one of 8 may 1998 (see paragraph 8 above) and referred to the investigator’s findings (i) that b. had been “without legal capacity because of a mental disorder” (недієздатна внаслідок психічного розладу) and thus could not be held responsible for assaulting the applicant, and (ii) that even though it appeared that the orderlies n. and l. had been negligent in their duties, which could constitute a crime under article 167 (negligence of duties by officials) or article 140 of the new 2001 criminal code (negligent performance of duties by members of the medical profession), they were not considered to be “officials” or “members of the medical profession” who could be prosecuted under those provisions of the law.the applicant claimed that following negligence on the part of the asylum employees l. and n. she had been beaten by b. the applicant also indicated that the asylum should not have placed b. in one room with the applicant since b. had been known for her violent behaviour.the court also noted that even though b. had not been declared to be without legal capacity, at the time of the incident both she and the applicant had been under the supervision of the asylum, which should accordingly have been held responsible for the incident.
he complained of: overcrowding; of there being no partition wall between toilets and cells; of insufficient ventilation; of insufficient time in the open air; of insufficient time for showering; of the presence of cockroaches; of inmates smoking in the cells; of no long-stay or short visits; of the fact that he had not been allowed to go home; of the low energy value of the food provided; of the prohibition on receiving food from relatives and friends; and of the prohibition on having his own blanket and a music player.the court further held that the presence of toilets in the applicant’s cell had not corresponded to the requirements of domestic law, that the lighting had been insufficient and the temperature had been too low, and that the food provided had had insufficient energy value.the court also held that inmates could be allowed to go home for up to five days in the event of the death or serious illness of a spouse, partner or close relative, or in the event of a natural disaster that had caused serious pecuniary damage to the inmate, his or her spouse, partner or close relatives.8.  the applicant appealed, and on 11 february 2015 the supreme administrative court held that it was impossible to calculate for how many days the applicant had had sufficient personal space at his disposal, and decided to hold that for 245 days the applicant had not had sufficient personal space, and that this had been a breach of article 3 of the convention.the court accepted the argument of the šiauliai remand prison that remand detainees had been held in prisons or correctional facilities for short periods of time and they were not in a similar situation to convicted inmates.
... the objective sanctions for the violation of inherent rights: pursuant to paragraph 1 of section 84 of the civil code, a person whose inherent rights have been violated shall have the following options under civil law, depending on the circumstances of the case: a) demand a court declaration of the occurrence of the infringement; c) demand that the perpetrator make restitution in a statement or by some other suitable means and, if necessary, that the perpetrator, at his own expense, make an appropriate public disclosure for restitution; d) demand the termination of the injurious situation and the restoration of the previous state by and at the expense of the perpetrator and, furthermore, to have the effects of the infringement nullified or deprived of their injurious nature.with regard to the restitution in accordance with paragraph 1 c) of section 84 of the civil code, the court ordered the defendants - pertaining to the infringement they have realized by their proceedings - to make public in the affected websites the first and second paragraphs of the judgment that contain the establishment of the infringement and at the same time affect the plaintiff and declare the falseness of the statement that was made publicly available.based on paragraph 1 d) of section 84 of the civil code, the court ordered the fifth defendant to deprive its related report of its injurious nature, but it rejected the same claim the plaintiff submitted against the eighth defendant, since it can be established by the facts of the case that the eighth defendant’s report available on hvg.hu merely links to the report that appeared on the website 444.hu maintained by the fifth defendant, therefore the latter’s deprivation of its injurious nature effectively results in the deprivation of the report on hvg.hu of its injurious nature.with regard to the first defendant, the court established the fact of imputability out of the conditions of indemnification for non-material damages.... in the case of the other defendants, the court did not establish their imputability with regard to the violation of law, and consequently, the court rejected the plaintiff’s claim for indemnification for non-material damages against the other defendants, as follows: in their own online news websites maintained by the fifth [the applicant company], sixth and eight defendants, the defendants in question published reports that presented the events of 5 september in the most realistic way, and they used the available information channels and forms of control in the expected manner.the fact that the defendants also included [mr j.gy.’s statements] does not violate the procedure expected from the staff of the press in such a situation [is] not regarded as a deliberately false publication, and therefore does not call for the establishment of whether the employees of the given defendants failed to examine the veracity of the facts, and in relation to this, failed to act with the precision necessary for the responsible practice of the constitutional right to freedom of expression.
6.  on 7 april 2005 the kyivskiy district court of kharkiv found the applicant guilty of theft and of two counts of deliberately causing bodily harm to his wife and g., and sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment for the theft, one year’s imprisonment for deliberately causing bodily harm to g. and seven years’ imprisonment for deliberately causing bodily harm to his wife.in addition, as the applicant had continued to plead his innocence in relation the episode with g. and had objected to closing the proceedings in relation to that matter, and in view of the fact that meanwhile the offence had become time-barred, the court of appeal absolved the applicant from having to serve the sentence in respect of the episode with g. the remainder of the sentence, namely a term of seven years’ imprisonment for deliberately causing harm to the applicant’s wife, was upheld by the court of appeal.the applicant referred in this respect to the relevant reports of the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment (hereinafter, “the cpt”) in respect of their visits to ukraine.16.  according to the government, in 2004 and 2005, following the applicant’s requests, he had studied the case file in detail and had been served with copies of procedural documents in his case, save for a copy of his appeal on points of law, which was not available in the case file at the time.18.  the applicant alleged that the prison administration had deliberately delayed sending certain of his letters to the court, had monitored his correspondence and had withheld documents attached to some of the complaints, which he had asked them to send to the court.
5.  on 20 february 2003 the applicant, a bank manager at that time, was placed in pre-trial detention by the bucharest anti-corruption department of the prosecutor’s office, on a charge of taking a bribe in order to favourably influence the acceptance of a loan requested by m.g.6.  by a final judgment delivered on 13 april 2012 the high court of cassation and justice (“the high court”) convicted the applicant of taking a bribe.7.  the conversation had been intercepted on the basis of a warrant issued by the prosecutor under the provisions of law no.8.  the applicant complained before the domestic courts about the lawfulness of the interception of his phone conversation and the accuracy of the transcript.however, the high court merely replied that the impugned interception had been lawful and within the scope of law no.
the event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at bolotnaya square which was supposed to end at 7.30 p.m. the march was peaceful and held without any disruptions, but when the marchers arrived at bolotnaya square it transpired that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue, allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting.[the applicant] did not react to the multiple lawful demands of the police to cease these actions and actively resisted while being taken to the police van, thereby demonstrating his refusal to obey the lawful orders of the police officers and preventing them from fulfilling their service duties, in breach of article 19.3 § 1 of the code of administrative offences.” 13.  on 29 may 2012 the justice of the peace of circuit no.on the basis of the statements of two police officers the court established that the applicant had committed an administrative offence under article 19.3 § 1 of the code of administrative offences, as described in the administrative offence record.the court questioned two police officers, who stated that the applicant, together with other participants of the demonstration, had pushed through the police cordon and tried to approach the kremlin; had pushed the police officers away; had thrown stones, glass bottles and smoke bombs; had disregarded multiple demands by the police to cease his actions; and had resisted arrest.20.  the logbook of persons brought to the khoroshevskiy district police station indicated that the second applicant was taken there at 7.50 p.m. and released at 10.35 p.m. on 6 may 2012. the administrative file contained no record of the applicant being escorted to the police station.

5.  on 5 november 2009 a resident of gavar, h.h., reported to the police that at around 6.20 p.m. his car had been shot at by someone travelling inside a black sports utility vehicle (suv) on a street in gavar, as a result of which his son h. and his friend (who had been with him in the car) had received gunshot injuries and had been taken to hospital.9.  a.s., a person close to the applicants’ family and employed by them in one of their businesses, stated in his interview that on the day of the events in question he had met the applicants and h.p.17.  on 5 may 2010 the proceedings were stayed on the grounds that the identity of the perpetrator of the attempted murder was unknown and, as regards the incident of hooliganism, the accused had absconded.in particular, the investigator stated that the confrontations requested by the applicants could not be conducted at that stage of the proceedings because (a) a warrant had been issued for a.s.’s arrest and his whereabouts remained unknown, and (b) h.p., exercising his rights as an accused, had refused to take part in a confrontation with the applicants.the regional court also referred, inter alia, to the testimony of more than twenty witnesses obtained during the pre-trial and trial stages; the records of confrontations conducted as part of the investigation; a forensic medical examination report; a complex ballistic and fingerprint examination report; a complex ballistic and forensic chemical examination report; the record of an investigatory experiment; records of an operative-investigative measure; a vehicle inspection report concerning h.h.’s and the second applicant’s cars; a crime scene inspection report; a number plate recognition report concerning the second applicant’s car; transcripts of calls to and from several telephone numbers; and a complex forensic fibre examination report.
11.  on the same day the absheron district court, relying on the official charge brought against the applicant and a request by the prosecutor to apply the preventive measure of remand in custody, ordered the applicant’s detention pending trial for a period of two months, calculating the period of detention from 29 august 2014. the court justified the application of the preventive measure of remand in custody by referring to the risk of the applicant reoffending and obstructing the investigation’s functioning by influencing other participants in the criminal proceedings.the relevant part of the decision reads as follows: “... having examined the preliminary material of the case file (witness statements and forensic expert reports), the court considers that there are sufficient grounds to believe that there is a likelihood that the accused haziyev seymur mashgul oglu will obstruct the investigation’s functioning by influencing other participants in the criminal proceedings and reoffend.” 12.  on 1 september 2014 the applicant appealed against that decision, claiming that there had been no justification for the application of the preventive measure of detention pending trial, and that his pre-trial detention amounted to a violation of article 5 of the convention.he also argued that he could not in any way obstruct the investigation’s functioning, as all the protagonists involved in the incident had already been identified and examined by the forensic expert.in particular, the appellate court dismissed the applicant’s complaint relating to the legal classification of his action as hooliganism, but remained silent as to his above-mentioned specific complaints concerning the lack of justification for his pre-trial detention.17.  on 27 october 2014 the prosecutor in charge of the case filed the bill of indictment with the absheron district court for trial.
here, in the applicant’s absence, the warsaw regional court imposed on him a disciplinary custodial penalty of fourteen days for contempt of court (“for the breach of the solemn nature, serenity and the course of court proceedings, to the degree making the announcement of the judgment impossible”).since only a copy of the first page of the applicant’s appeal has been submitted to the court, it is unclear whether the applicant had also raised the argument of the lack of impartiality of the judges who had punished him for contempt of court.25.  on 2 february 2012 – the fourteenth day of the applicant’s detention – the prison board of the warsaw remand centre decided that the applicant should be detained under a semi-open regime (with the possibility to leave his cell during the day).29.  on 22 march 2012 the warsaw court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s interlocutory appeal, finding that the applicant’s disrespectful behaviour had interfered with the solemn nature of court proceedings and with the court’s dignity, and had disrupted the proceedings.the court also considered that the applicant’s behaviour could not be explained by an emotional disagreement with the court’s ruling because at the time of the incident the applicant had been unaware of the outcome of the trial.
5.  he had been employed by the national security service, at the regional office of blagoevgrad, as an agent since 1998. on account of the nature of his duties, he had held a security clearance permitting him access to classified information constituting state secrets.the reason given for the termination of his employment was the revocation of his security clearance, possession of which was an indispensable precondition for him to be able to perform his duties.he contested the lawfulness of the dismissal procedure, arguing that he was not able to challenge, in the course of the procedure before the state commission for information security, the facts on which the revocation of the security clearance permit was based.10.  by its judgment of 19 march 2015, the blagoevgrad administrative court rejected the applicant’s claims, reasoning that the decision of the director of the national security service to revoke the applicant’s security clearance was a final and valid administrative act, and it rendered the applicant’s dismissal inevitable because he was no longer able to perform his duties.the court added that the applicant had exhausted the remedy provided by law by challenging the revocation decision, and that the latter had become final; in addition, the court was not competent to examine, within the framework of the dismissal proceedings, any questions related to its lawfulness.
3.  the list of applicants and the relevant details of the applications are set out in the appended table.4.  the applicants sued different state and municipal unitary companies (the debtor companies) in several unrelated sets of court proceedings.5.  on the dates set out in the appended table domestic courts by separate judgments made pecuniary awards in favour of the applicants to be paid by the debtor companies.34145/11 the courts also ordered the debtor company to take certain action in favour of the applicant, as specified in the appended table.7.  on various dates insolvency proceedings were opened in respect of some of the debtor companies.

(d)  the indictment 25.  on 11 december 2012 the special prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the specialised criminal court (špecializovaný trestný súd) (hereinafter “the scc”), charging mr j. with (i) premeditated first-degree murder under article 144 § 1 and § 2 (c) of the criminal code, with reference to article 138 (j) of the criminal code, partly accomplished and partly attempted (zločin úkladnej vraždy, sčasti dokonaný a sčasti v štádiu pokusu), and (ii) the offence of carrying a concealed weapon under article 294 § 1 and § 2 of the criminal code, in concurrence with the offence of illegal entry into a dwelling under article 194 § 1 and § 2 (a) of the criminal code, with reference to article 138 (a) of the criminal code.26.  the special prosecutor referred to, inter alia, the testimony of mr j., of the applicants, and of other witnesses, as well as the expert reports and the statements given by the experts when they had been interviewed, including the psychologist’s statements concerning the earlier violent confrontation between mr j. and roma children, and mr j’s growing feelings of helplessness, his fear of the roma, and his belief that in acting as he had he had believed that he was solving an issue with the roma.27.  as regards the legal classification of the offence of murder, the bill of indictment reads, in the relevant part, as follows: “it is necessary to classify ... the action of the accused, as far as it concerns the shooting [and killing] of the five members of the lakatoš family ... as ... the offence of first-degree murder within the meaning of article 144 §§ 1 and 2 (c) of the criminal code ... in the present case, there was no accidental behaviour (murdering) caused by the arising of a situation (for example, an argument or ... outburst at the place in question); rather, the murder was premeditated (that is to say a motive had been considered in advance).39.  they furthermore complained of the ineffectiveness of the criminal prosecution owing to the questionable quality of the expert report and the alleged bias of its authors, the court’s refusal to order a second expert opinion, the fact that it had been impossible for their lawyer to ask questions and cross-examine the expert witnesses, the absence of any reasoning in the final judgment, and the lack of any assessment of the racial overtones of the crime.the constitutional court can assess other applicants’ complaints only generally on the basis of other documents from the [respective] case file (in particular, the expert opinion and minutes from the main hearing).” 41.  in so far as the applicants complained of the failure of the criminal justice authorities to address the racial motive of the attack, as well as their inability to challenge the conviction and the sentence, the constitutional court considered that these complaints were directed against provisions of the code of criminal procedure and the position of an injured party under slovak criminal law.
9.  on 31 december 2007 the bakırköy juvenile assize court ordered the continuation of the applicant’s pre-trial detention on the basis of the case file, and decided that it had no jurisdiction ratione loci and that the case should be heard by the beyoğlu juvenile assize court and referred the case file to the latter.on the same date the court also ordered the continuation of the applicant’s pre-trial detention on the basis of the case file.13.  on 13 august 2008 the trial court held a preparatory hearing and ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention on the basis of the case file.15.  during the hearings held on 21 january 2009, 14 april 2009 and 21 july 2009, at which the applicant was present, the trial court ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention on remand.between the hearings, which were held with regular intervals of one month, the court ex officio examined the applicant’s detention on remand on the basis of the case‑file and decided to extend it 16.  on 3 november 2009, at the end of the fifth hearing before the court, the applicant was released pending trial.
the witness stated at the hearing that he was 50-60% certain that the second applicant had been the one who had got off the bus at aurometal (the witness had been able to observe him from the bus for about thirty seconds); the third applicant could have been the other one, but the witness was not sure because he had seen him only from behind.o.s., one of the experts who examined the dna evidence collected from l.m.’s home and from the car found in the vicinity of l.m.’s home, explained his report of 8 july 2008 according to which the material matched the dna profiles of l.m.119/08 concerning the severed case of r.k.; judicial records according to which the first applicant had three prior convictions, the second applicant had no prior convictions, the third applicant had two prior convictions, and, lastly, r.k. had nine prior convictions; and a police report of 14 march 2008 (see, in this regard, the witness statements of u.đ.42.  on 9 march 2010 the novi sad court of appeal (apelacioni sud) upheld the judgment of 30 march 2009. it acknowledged that the statement of r.k. made on 4 april 2008 had been the sole evidence against the first applicant and that the only corroborative evidence against the second and third applicants had been the statement of u.đ.it relied, in this regard, on article 337 § 1 of the code of criminal procedure as well as the fact that r.k. had made the statement in question in the presence of his counsel, v. juhas đurić, who had shortly thereafter become counsel for the applicants.
13.  neither the applicants, nor their late father ever accepted any rent paid by couple s. on the following grounds: the rent due as calculated according to the law was far less than the rental market value of the apartment; the law in question (article 12 of the housing (decontrol) ordinance) was in breach of their rights as stipulated in article 1 of protocol no.furthermore, the rent payable to the applicants did not reflect the value of the property in question ‑ the court‑appointed expert had established that the rental value of the apartment in 2014 was eur 3,000 annually, and that the rental value of the apartment in 1998 had been eur 2,000 annually.the calculation of the rent due for the lease (upon conversion of the temporary emphyteusis to a lease), did not only depend on the inflation rate but also on the ground rent that had been payable at the time of the temporary emphyteusis.the constitutional court considered that the ground rent payable at the time of the temporary emphyteusis for the property at issue should have been eur 1,476.27 a year (based on the inflation index for 1981 as being 408.16, and in the light of the fact that the inflation index for 1998 was 580.61 ‑ time when the court expert had estimated the rental value of the apartment for that year at eur 2,100) and not mtl 120 (around eur 280) as the parties had agreed.21.  the constitutional court therefore concluded that the owners of the apartment (which had now been inherited by the applicants) knew that: i) they were agreeing on a ground rent that was relatively low in amount; ii) when the temporary emphyteusis ended it would be converted into a lease that could be inherited and renewed (because article 12 of the housing (decontrol) ordinance as amended by act xxii was already in effect at the time the temporary emphyteusis agreement was entered into); and iii) that the value of the rent would be worked out on the basis of the ground rent that was being paid, in proportion to the rise in living standards.
8.  on 4 december 2013 the applicant’s wife was granted the status of a “special witness” in the investigation; in line with the code of criminal procedure (hereinafter “the ccp”), she was questioned about her own possibly criminal activity and was exempted from liability for refusing to testify or giving false testimony (see paragraph 27 below).he refused to give testimony in relation to his wife’s actions and the payment of ltl 120,000 received by company a. from company m. 10.  on 26 may 2014 a prosecutor from the klaipėda regional prosecutor’s office gave the applicant a fine of ltl 650 (approximately eur 188) for refusing to testify, as provided for in article 163 of the ccp (see paragraphs 31 and 32 below).12.  on 9 june 2014 a senior prosecutor from the klaipėda regional prosecutor’s office dismissed the applicant’s complaint on the grounds that, in accordance with the ccp, only the family members of a suspect or an accused were exempt from liability for refusing to testify, but the ccp did not extend such a privilege to the family members of a “special witness” (see paragraph 19 below).he also asked the court to refer the matter to the constitutional court for a ruling on whether the ccp provisions which exempted the family members of a suspect or an accused from liability for refusing to testify, but not the family members of a “special witness”, complied with the constitution.his wife worked as the financial director of company a., and from may to november 2012 she had provided accounting services to company m. the applicant stated that he had not known how or why ltl 120,000 had been transferred to the bank account of company a. he knew only that that entire amount had been returned to company m. within a week, in a transfer carried out by his wife.
19.  on 31 december 2015 the first applicant appealed to the syktyvkar town court (“the town court”) against the annulment of his residence permit, stating that the komi fsb’s request of 2 december 2015 to annul his residence permit had been made on national security grounds which were unknown to him, and that the subsequent decision of the komi fms complying with that request and annulling his residence permit was unlawful and disproportionate.the first applicant’s representative invited the applicants’ neighbour, ms ch., to the hearing, who testified that she had known the first applicant for twenty years, that he was a well-respected man who helped local orphans, that he worked for the good of the local community, and that he had a wife and son and was the breadwinner of the family.therefore, the federal security service is not supposed to provide the court with documents substantiating the grounds for its decisions concerning the undesirability of the residence of a foreign citizen in the russian federation, as such documents contain state secrets, and the court does not have authority to request those documents ...” 26.  amongst other things, the fsb’s further submissions to the court of 15 april 2016 stated the following: “... the information concerning the annulment of the residence permit was provided to the federal migration service by the federal security service on the basis of classified decision no.18577c of 27 november 2015 concerning the applicant’s actions posing a threat to the national security of the russian federation and its citizens, [actions] which serve as the basis for the annulment of the residence permit, in accordance with section 9(1) of the foreign nationals act ... the [komi] fsb provided the court of first instance with [only] information whose disclosure was not limited ...” 27.  on 5 may 2016 the komi supreme court examined the appeal and upheld the annulment.within administrative proceedings, the court does not have the right to assess the [information relating to] factors threatening national security which has been obtained in respect of a foreign national ...” as for the first applicant’s allegations regarding the adverse effect of the measure on his right to respect for family life, the court stated as follows: “the annulment did not represent an inadmissible interference by the authorities with the right to respect for family life”.
6.  on the same day, the judge at the i̇stanbul assize court decided to restrict access to the investigation file, under article 153 § 2 of the code of criminal procedure (the “ccp”), law no.on the same day, the 10th chamber of the i̇stanbul assize court, relying on the public prosecutor’s written opinion, which had not been communicated to the applicants or their representative, dismissed the objection without holding a hearing.on 28 november 2008 the 11th chamber of the i̇stanbul assize court dismissed the objection, without holding an oral hearing and based on the written opinions of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicants or their representative.17.  at the hearings held on 19 march 2009 and 16 july 2009, in which the applicants were present, the trial court ordered the continuation of the applicants’ detention on remand.20.  on 1 july 2016 the court of cassation quashed the judgment of the first instance court in so far as it concerned the convictions of the first and third applicants.
lodged a complaint with the superior council of the magistracy (“the scm”) seeking the commencement of a disciplinary investigation against the applicant in connection with the manner in which he had informed the media about the incident of 21 october 2008. she contended that at the time of the incident she had been the judge delegated to baia mare prison and because of the applicant’s press release and interview with axa tv it was suggested by the media that she might be the alleged recipient of the money.the relevant part of the letter sent by the national audiovisual council read as follows: “on 11 november 2008 the council, convened in a public meeting, examined the report prepared by the inspection department and watched a recording of the broadcast mentioned in your complaint.... it was noted that the news item had been broadcast on 22 october 2008 at 9.30 p.m. as the information broadcast did not contain any specific reference to you, the item could not infringe your right to a protected public image.from the way in which the press release was drafted, “the circle of magistrates who could have been the recipients of the money was restricted and limited and made possible the identification of the judge delegated to baia mare prison in the person of judge g.e.” as the six-month term of her delegation expired just at the time of the events in question, the mass media made speculative suggestions that the termination was connected with the influence‑peddling case.33.  they noted, among other things, that: (i)  the names of the persons who were allegedly to receive money from the influence peddler were not mentioned in the press release or in the television interview; there was only a general, impersonal reference to the judges and the prosecutors who were involved with the conditional release of detainees; (ii)  individuals in this sphere included not only the judge delegated to the prison but also the judges who examine requests for conditional release at first instance and on appeal, as well as the prosecutors who attend the hearings concerning these requests.axa tv’s reference to the judge whose involvement with the prison had just ended was made in an additional comment that was not included in the press release; (iii)  the reference to the delegated judge made possible the identification of the magistrate, but since this statement was attributable exclusively to the television channel, the latter should bear responsibility for all subsequent comments and speculations; (iv)  only the additional information concerning the end of the delegated judge’s mandate allowed the identification of judge g.e.
had not performed any transactions through its bank account in a period of twelve consecutive months, on 19 january 2001 the ljubljana district court – acting in its capacity as the registry court – initiated proceedings to strike off the company from the court register pursuant to the financial operations of companies act 1999 (hereinafter “the foca”; paragraphs 41-52 below).at the request of the creditor, on 30 november 2004 the court expanded the writ, ordering the payment of the judgment debt by direct deduction from the earnings of the applicant and of three other members of l.e.the court established that with his 11.11% share in the company, the applicant had enjoyed the rights of a minority member, and furthermore, he had been employed by the company and actively involved in its management since april 1993. in his capacity as acting director and later managing director, he had been authorised to act on behalf of the company.it observed, inter alia, that the constitutional court had found the measure of lifting the corporate veil under the foca to be in line with the principle of the separation of a company’s assets from those of its members and thus consistent with the constitution.the court noted that, in contrast to section 6 of the companies act 1993 which required the creditors of a company to prove that a member of the company had abused the corporate form (see paragraph 34 below), the foca had introduced a “non-rebuttable” presumption that the members of a struck-off company were deemed to have undertaken joint and several liability for any outstanding debts of the company.
5.  the first applicant was born in 1988, the second applicant was born in 1994 and the remaining applicants were born in 2010-2016. according to the last letter sent by their representative to the court on 20 may 2018, they currently reside in poland, where their asylum applications are under consideration.in the space for a signature on each of the seven decisions, the first and second applicants wrote “azul’” in cyrillic (азуль) – they submitted to the court that that word was often used by chechen asylum seekers to mean “asylum”.16.  the border officer who was on duty at the kena checkpoint that day submitted the following official report to a senior officer: “i hereby inform you that on 11 may 2017 ... when i was examining the train [from moscow to kaliningrad], at around 12:00 p.m., the following russian nationals [the applicants] submitted their documents for inspection.seven refusal of entry decisions were issued in respect of these individuals ... at 3.10 p.m. the individuals were transferred to border officers of belarus via the medininkai border checkpoint.” 17.  the applicants were detained at the border checkpoint for several hours and then they were returned to belarus.at around 10.50 p.m. ..., upon the arrival of a passenger train [from minsk to vilnius], it was detected that nationals of the russian federation did not have valid schengen visas or residence permits ... ... the above-mentioned individuals were returned via the medininkai border checkpoint on 23 may 2017, at 4.24 a.m.” the report mentioned the names of the second applicant and three of the children.
it appears that the applicant’s restitution process took two directions: at first she agreed to receive part of the land in the vilnius region and then she asked to receive another 0.32 hectares in the vilnius region, and she wanted to receive some land in the city of vilnius (see paragraphs 8-22 below).the court held that the decision regarding the applicant’s right to the restitution of 0.32 hectares of land had not yet been adopted and that the applicant had been offered the option of monetary compensation.she also claimed that she had lost the right to the restoration of her title to 0.2 hectares of land in the city of vilnius because ‒ after a change in the domestic regulations ‒ the maximum plot size that could be restored for the construction of an individual house was now fixed at 0.12 hectares (see paragraphs 28 above and 37 below).the court noted that the process of restoration of the applicant’s property rights had been carried out in several stages: in 2005 she had received a plot of 0.0937 hectares in pašilaičiai, vilnius (see paragraph 18 above); in 2006 a document confirming that she had a right to receive 0.32 hectares of state redeemable land had been drawn up; and in 2006 and 2013 her property rights had been restored to 0.0544 hectares and 0.0005 hectares respectively (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above).it held that although the applicant claimed that the authorities had failed to execute the decisions of the courts to restore her property rights, she had never challenged the authorities’ decisions to restore her property rights to certain plots of land.
at the time of the events, the applicant was a student; d. was an acquaintance of the applicant, studying at the same university.10.  in his first statement to the police, given on 26 june 2005, the applicant disclosed that the dealer who had sold him the drugs was called b. and helped the police to set up an operation to catch him in the act of committing a crime.12.  the applicant maintained his allegations in a statement given in the presence of two lawyers of his choice on 19 july 2005. he added that he had accepted to provide d. with the ecstasy tablets in the hope of having an intimate relationship with her during his stay in constanţa.in convicting the applicant, it relied on his own statements, corroborated by the statements made by the friends who had accompanied him on his trip to constanţa on 25 june 2005, as well as on reports produced by the undercover agent and the police following the police operation organised on 25 june 2005 when the applicant had been caught in the act of committing a crime.17.  the applicant appealed against the judgment of 5 june 2007. his lawyers reiterated that he had been entrapped by the police and that d. should be heard by the court.
it was emphasised that there had been contradictions in the evidence; the scene of the accident had not been inspected properly; br.’s car had not been seized; the circumstances of the accident had not been noted carefully; and the witnesses had not been identified.17.  on 1 september 2009 the prosecutor quashed the decision of 23 june 2008, noting that the applicants had objected to the grounds for termination of the proceedings, and therefore it had been for the court to take a final decision in the case.18.  on 29 september 2009 the investigator asked the gornyanskyy district court of makiyivka (“the district court”) to close the criminal case concerning the traffic accident in which the applicants’ son had died.19.  on 23 june 2010 the district court rejected the investigator’s request and sent the case back to the prosecutor’s office, finding that there had been procedural errors in referring the case to the court.25.  on 7 april 2014 the donetsk regional court of appeal quashed the above judgment, finding that the first-instance court had violated the applicants’ right to defence, and remitted the case for a fresh examination by the same court.
7.  on 8 march 2004 the vilnius county administration (hereinafter “the vca”) restored the property rights of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants, as well as p.m. and n.m., by giving them all joint ownership of 5.80 hectares of agricultural land and 3.20 hectares of forest in naujakiemis, an area in the vilnius city municipality.9.  on 29 august 2008 the prosecutor of the vilnius region (hereinafter “the prosecutor”) lodged a claim with the vilnius regional court, seeking to have the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants’ property rights to the nine hectares given to them annulled.the court held that the applicants could not be considered as having acquired their property rights in good faith (sąžiningi įgijėjai) because the information about the presence of forests on their land had been available in a public register and any diligent person should have known that, under the constitution, forests of national importance could only be owned by the state.13.  on 23 february 2012 the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants received a letter from the national land service (the institution which took over the relevant functions of the vca after an administrative reform – hereinafter “the nls”) confirming that, after the courts had annulled their property rights to nine hectares of land, they had retained the right to have those property rights restored.19.  on 28 august 2017 the nls adopted decisions to restore the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants’ property rights to the remaining 4.5885 hectares by means of monetary compensation of eur 5,307, corresponding to the indexed value of the land (that is to say, the value established by relevant public authorities).

8.  in a ruling of 18 march 2008 the donetsk regional court of appeal (“the court of appeal”) examined the appeal lodged by the fund, rejected it as unsubstantiated and upheld the judgment of 17 january 2008. the ruling did not mention the applicant’s appeal, and only stated that at the hearing, which was held on the same day, the applicant and his representative had contested the fund’s appeal and had asked the court to reject it.9.  according to the transcript of the court hearing on 18 march 2008, the applicant’s representative stated during the hearing that the applicant had lodged the statement of intent on 25 january 2008 and the appeal itself on 13 february 2008. she also stated that they were not challenging the judgment of 17 january 2008 as regards the application of the law but rather were merely seeking an award of the full amount of damages claimed by the applicant.the applicant submitted that at the hearing his representative had also produced a copy of his appeal and had asked the court of appeal to join it to the case file; however, the latter refused to do so.a copy of the appeal in cassation submitted to the court shows that the applicant had dated it 17 may 2008. in it the applicant stated that he had lodged an appeal against the judgment of 17 january 2008 but that when he had arrived at the appellate hearing on 18 march 2008, it transpired that his appeal had been mislaid and his submissions had therefore not been examined by the court of appeal.it stated that the court of appeal had examined the appeal lodged by the fund, but that the applicant had not personally appealed against the judgment of 17 january 2008 and for this reason the case could not be reviewed in cassation.
the document analysed the amount of preventive social work performed by the applicant in connection with minors in 2002 and concluded that the applicant, as the head of the juvenile service department of the administration, had no knowledge of the relevant law and displayed an irresponsible attitude towards her professional duties.on 14 may 2003 the administration informed the prosecutor’s office of the actions taken in consequence of their consideration of the prosecutor’s statement.8.  on 10 april 2004 the applicant brought civil defamation proceedings against the grebinkivskyy district prosecutor’s office, prosecutor mr b., the poltava region prosecutor’s office and the state treasury of ukraine, alleging that the prosecutor’s statement contained untrue information relating to her professional activity and that this negative evaluation of her attitude to work had damaged her honour, dignity and professional reputation.however, it disagreed with the application of the civil code of 2003 and applied the old civil code of 1963. it partly allowed the claim and increased the level of compensation awarded to the applicant for non-pecuniary damage.7 of the plenum of the supreme court of ukraine dated 28 september 1990, entitled “on the application of legislation by the courts regulating defence of honour, dignity and reputation of citizens and organisations” (“the resolution”), it was not possible to file a civil defamation claim in respect of statements contained in courts’ decisions or decisions of various investigative bodies.

11.  on 15 december 2008 the prosecutor lodged a further claim with the vilnius regional court, seeking to have p.s.’s property rights to 0.15 hectares of the 8.17 hectares given to him annulled, on the grounds that it was covered by a forest of national importance, as well as to have the applicants’ property rights to that part of the plot annulled.15.  on 14 november 2008 the prosecutor lodged yet another claim with the vilnius regional court, seeking to have p.s.’s property rights to 0.87 hectares of the 8.17 hectares given to him annulled, on the grounds that it was covered by a forest of national importance, as well as to have the applicants’ property rights to that part of the plot annulled.19.  on 23 february 2012 the applicants received a letter from the national land service (the institution which took over the relevant functions of the vca after an administrative reform – hereinafter “the nls”) confirming that, after the courts had annulled p.s.’s property rights to 3.52 hectares of land, he had retained the right to have those property rights restored.20.  on 24 july 2012 the applicants received another letter from the nls which stated that there was a possibility for the applicants to receive a plot of land for the construction of an individual home in the vilnius city area, but as there were 4,806 other candidates waiting to receive plots in the area, the restitution process would take a long time.they submitted that the annulment of their property rights to 3.52 hectares of land had caused them pecuniary damage in the amount of ltl 627,630 (approximately eur 181,770), consisting of the value of the 2.50 hectares of land which had been taken away from them (see paragraph 9 above), according to a private assessment, as well as the amounts which the applicants had been ordered to pay to s.m.
three neurosurgeons who examined the applicant stated in their report of 11 december 2009 that they had observed atrophy (wasting away of the muscle) of the applicant’s thigh muscles and sensory loss on the front of the thighs.14.  the applicant lodged an objection against the assize court’s decision and argued, in particular, that the decision to suspend the pronouncement of the conviction would encourage other police officers to carry out similar acts against members of the public.16.  in the meantime, the applicant instituted proceedings against the ministry of the interior before the i̇zmir administrative court and claimed 11,000 turkish liras (try) in respect of pecuniary damage and try 50,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.in its decision of 17 june 2010 the i̇zmir administrative court found the ministry responsible for the damage suffered by the applicant and awarded him try 712 (approximately 370 euros (eur) at the time) in respect of pecuniary damage and try 50,000 (approximately eur 26,000) in respect of non‑pecuniary damage, plus statutory interest.17.  on 21 april 2014 the supreme administrative court upheld the i̇zmir administrative court’s decision insofar as it concerned the pecuniary damage but quashed the part of the decision concerning the non-pecuniary damage because it considered that the applicant had also been partly responsible for the incident.
the gup undertook to provide the applicant with the flat and to transfer it to the applicant’s ownership once it was accepted for exploitation, and the applicant was to pay the price of the flat.on 25 march 2002, acting on the applicant’s appeal, the tambov regional court (“the regional court”) quashed the lower court’s judgment and remitted the case for a new examination, for the court’s failure to establish substantial facts of the case and to examine some items of evidence referred to in the judgment.15.  on 28 january 2003 the district court allowed the claim in part and awarded the applicant a sum of money which was larger than that pursuant to the judgment of 11 september 2002. on 26 march 2003, on the appeal of the applicant’s counsel, the regional court quashed the judgment, in particular, for a failure to address the important circumstances of the case, and remitted the case for a fresh examination.on 20 august 2003 the regional court annulled the judgments, having found that the lower court had incorrectly applied the norms of substantive law, and ordered a new examination of the case by the first-instance court.the court ordered the dissolution of the shared-construction agreement between the applicant and the state unitary enterprise “united direction for construction of the kamchatka region” concerning the construction of housing.
in view of this claim, in october 2006 the sales contract between the applicant and t. was annulled by the parties and the applicant returned the money to t. on 23 november 2006 the zalishchytskyy local court of ternopil region found that the shed belonged to s. and thus the bailiffs had unlawfully seized and sold it.the applicant referred to provisions on compensation of damage of the civil code of ukraine, in particular article 1174, and to article 11 of the law of ukraine “on the state bailiffs’ service” according to which damage caused to an individual by actions or omissions of a state official, in particular, by a bailiff during enforcement proceedings, had to be compensated by the state (see paragraphs 19 and 21 below).the court held that since the applicant was not a party to the enforcement proceedings in the case against company u. he could not claim damages from the bailiffs under article 11 of the law of ukraine “on the state bailiffs’ service” (see paragraph 21 below).the court further noted that the applicant failed to demonstrate that the shed had been in fact seized from him without any compensation, or that the sales contract with company m. in charge of the auction had been dissolved.17.  the applicant appealed in cassation stating that he no longer owned or used the shed as its seizure and sale were found unlawful by the court decision of 23 november 2006 (see paragraph 11 above) and it had been returned to s. he noted that the money he paid at the auction had not been reimbursed.
7.  on the same day the prosecutor’s office attached to the high court of cassation and justice authorised the police division responsible for combatting organised crime and drug trafficking to use an undercover agent in order to identify members of the network.according to the report drafted by the agent on the same day, the applicant confirmed that he had a small amount of cannabis and hashish in his possession and offered to sell it to the agent.19.  on 12 september 2007 the prosecutor’s office attached to the high court of cassation and justice issued an indictment naming the applicant and five co-accused, and the case was registered with the dolj county court.25.  the court based its findings on (i) the statements given by the co‑defendants, the undercover agent and witnesses, (ii) the transcripts of the recorded phone conversations, and (iii) technical and search reports.30.  the applicant submitted that – as was clear from the transcripts of the recorded phone conversations – all the drug transactions had taken place at the initiative of the undercover agent.
9.  on the day after his arrival at the prison, he asked the prison governor to authorise a short meeting with four family members – his sister, two cousins and aunt – without a physical partition between him and the visitors or the presence of prison officers.he relied on article 89 of the code of execution of sentences (ces) and emphasised that the remand prison was equipped with rooms for long-stay visits which could be used by convicted prisoners serving their sentence in that prison.11.  the applicant subsequently asked the authorities in charge of the criminal case to authorise short visits from his family members.they informed the applicant that “the authorities in charge of the investigation were not preventing [him] from having short visits from his family members as long as it did not contradict russian law, including the code of execution of sentences”.13.  according to a certificate issued by the governor on 27 april 2017, the applicant did not have any short or long-stay visits during his time in the khabarovsk remand prison.
13.  during the following months the first applicant applied to the russian consulate in uzbekistan, to the russian embassy in uzbekistan and to the russian ministry of international affairs for assistance in recovering his daughter.he also submitted the following documents from the usa: x’s school records; x’s and his own character references from the neighbours, x’s teachers and the parents of her school friends; certificates from his employer confirming his income and health insurance covering himself and his daughter, and stating that his post was based in washington, dc, and did not require frequent travel; an opinion by the doctor who had treated x’s mother that, in view of an increased hereditary risk of cancer, x needed regular medical supervision in a specialised clinic; and a description of the first applicant’s flat in washington, dc, by a real‑estate agent.34.  at the end of the hearing of 21 june 2011 the cheremushinskiy district court decided to send a request for assistance to the uzbek courts, asking that x be questioned about the following matters: –  whether her grandparents were preventing her from seeing or contacting her father; –  when she had seen her father for the last time; –  whether she missed her father; –  whether she wanted to live with her father; and –  whether she talked to her father over the telephone and, if so, on whose initiative the telephone calls were made.40.  the hearing of 1 february 2012 was adjourned until 27 february 2012 because the first applicant and his counsel did not appear and because the childcare authority needed additional time to prepare a new opinion on the case, taking into account the child’s wishes.46.  on 8 october 2012 a judge of the moscow city court refused to refer a cassation appeal lodged by the first applicant to the presidium of that court for examination, finding that no significant violations of substantive or procedural law had influenced the outcome of the proceedings.
8.  the judgment was based, in particular, on (i) the victim’s statements made at the pre-trial stage; (ii) the statements of a number of witnesses (comprising nannies, a classmate and a psychologist) made during the court hearings, who had reported incriminating statements that a. had made to them.witness k. had testified that, in the relevant period, she had had sexual relations with the applicant; (iii) the conclusions of experts who had examined the applicant and the victim.the experts had concluded that the victim’s hymen had been broken and it was unlikely that that had been caused by unintentional actions; the victim and the applicant both had a fungal infection on their genitalia; the examination of the applicant’s genitalia had not revealed any obstacle to his having sexual relations; the victim suffered from a light mental retardation and the applicant did not suffer from any psychiatric illness.15.  on 27 november 2008 the court’s registry asked the applicant to provide copies of his appeal, his appeal in cassation and the decision of the supreme court in his case, to supplement his application.17.  on 19 january 2009 the court of appeal advised the applicant that he needed to address his request for the copies to the trial court.
18.  a transcript of the conversations on the video tapes recorded at the flat showed that the applicant had been proselytising islam to v. and ku., discussing her hatred for russians and the need for a “holy war” against them, praising the leaders of the chechen insurgency, and telling her flatmates about the insurgent camps in the caucasus.i do not admit my guilt on any of the charges ...” the defence’s closing arguments contained one-off statements about the explosives having been planted by the police in the applicant’s handbag, but did not refer to the alleged double fingerprinting or the applicant’s lack of control over her possessions prior to the search, or to any matters concerning the choice and participation of the two attesting witnesses.it referred to the testimony by the patrol officers and the officers at the police station, who had denied those allegations, and to the fact that, according to the official report, the personal search of the applicant had preceded the taking of her fingerprints, and there had been no evidence that the fingerprints had been taken twice, as the applicant had alleged.no one can recall who invited the attesting witnesses and how, and when ... according to the testimony by witness a., read out during the hearing and relied upon by the court in the judgment, he talked on the phone not only with murtazaliyeva, but also with arresting police officers; [these were not the police officers questioned during the hearing, since they did not mention talking to a. in their multiple statements at the pre-trial and trial stages of proceedings].in respect of the attesting witnesses the complaint stated that “the examination of the attesting witnesses could have resolved the significant contradictions in the statements [and] could have served as the basis to corroborate or disprove the circumstances immediately prior to the search.” 69.  on 13 september 2005 the supreme court rejected the supervisory review complaint.
11.  on 23 february 2012 the applicant received a letter from the national land service (the institution which took over the relevant functions of the vca after an administrative reform – hereinafter “the nls”) confirming that his mother had retained the right to have her property rights to six hectares of land restored.12.  on 24 july 2012 the applicant received another letter from the nls which stated that there was a possibility for the applicant to receive a plot of land for the construction of an individual home in the vilnius city area but as there were 4,806 other candidates waiting to receive plots in the area, the restitution process would take a long time.he submitted that the annulment of his property rights to six hectares of land had caused him pecuniary damage in the amount of 251,217 lithuanian litai (ltl – approximately 72,760 euros (eur)), according to an assessment of the value of the land carried out in may 2012. in the applicant’s view, being put on the list with 4,806 other candidates and being made to wait for an undetermined period of time for restitution was unacceptable.according to the minutes of the meeting, which were approved by the nls, he stated that the question of the restoration of his property rights was pending before the european court of human rights, that he was dissatisfied with the available vacant land and that he refused to choose any plots (žemės sklypų nesirinko).according to the minutes of the meeting, which were approved by the nls and signed by the applicant, he was dissatisfied with the size and location of the plots which had been offered to him.
they contended that the application of muslim customs and sharia law to greek nationals of muslim faith was laid down in the provisions of article 14 § 1 of the 1920 treaty of sèvres (ratified by decree of 29 september/ 30 october 1923) and articles 42 and 45 of the treaty of lausanne (ratified by decree of 25 august 1923) (see paragraphs 65-68 below).the court added that although the application of sharia law was based, inter alia, on international law, and in particular on the combined effect of articles 42 and 45 of the treaty of lausanne, it should not result in the islamic law of succession being applied in such a way as to curtail the civil rights of greek muslims, because the aim of the treaty had not been to deprive the members of that minority of such rights, but to strengthen their protection.examining the reasoning of the court of appeal’s judgment, it concluded that that court’s determination of the case had breached the relevant legislative provisions, because the law applicable to the deceased person’s estate had been the islamic law of succession, which formed part of domestic law and applied specifically to greek nationals of muslim faith.it noted that the estate in question belonged to the category of property held “in full ownership” (mulkia) – public land which had belonged to the ottoman administration, the full ownership of which had been transferred to private individuals and which had been governed by sharia law during the ottoman occupation – and that, consequently, the impugned public will had to be deemed invalid and devoid of legal effect on the grounds that sharia law recognised no such institution.183/2015 of 15 december 2015 the court of appeal set aside the judgment delivered by the rodopi court of first instance on 1 june 2010. in line with the court of cassation’s judgment, it held that the relevant legislative provisions had been intended to protect greek nationals of muslim faith, constituted a special body of law and did not breach the principle of equality secured under article 4 of the constitution or the right of access to a court as guaranteed by article 6 of the convention.
in february 2009 the execution of the remainder of the sentence of the judgment of 9 july 2007 was suspended on probation and the applicant was released from prison.it found that the expulsion order did not contravene the binding force of the judgment of the court of appeal of 14 january 2005 (see paragraph 15 above) since it was essentially based on events subsequent to that judgment, in particular the judgments of the district court of 9 july 2007 (see paragraph 11 above) and the judgment of the regional court of 9 december 2010 (see paragraph 13 above).21.  the administrative court essentially based its conclusions on the seriousness, the frequency and the drug context of the criminal offences, as well as on the expectation that the applicant would be likely to commit such offences again.not even favourable conditions, such as the drug therapy as of august 2008, the suspension of the remaining sentence, further therapy, the expected paternity and finally the birth of his child brought about substantial changes in the applicant’s life.making explicit reference to article 8 of the convention and the court’s case-law, the administrative court established that the reasons at the heart of the expulsion were sufficient to justify it, even though the expulsion might cause hardship for the daughter, who did not live with the applicant.
the applicant’s conviction was based on the victim’s statement in court, the results of the identification parades, and the statement which the victim’s friend had made in court.having heard the parties’ arguments, the appeal court concluded the following: “... the examination of the case should continue, since as it appears from the victim’s ... application submitted to the court, she cannot appear in court because of her pregnancy, which is also confirmed by an extract from her medical file; hence, the court cannot compel her to appear.however, the applicant’s guilt had been proved by the victim’s consistent statements during the pre-trial investigation stage and before the trial court, by the results of the identification parade, and by the evidence given by the victim’s friend.26.  on 3 november 2008, under rule 54 § 2 (a) of the rules of court, the president of the chamber requested that the government provide the court with a specific treatment plan aimed at safeguarding the applicant’s eyesight.27.  on 18 november 2008 the government submitted the applicant’s medical file to the court, and also gave an account of the treatment which he had been receiving in prison as of january 2007. according to the submitted information, on 14 november 2008 the applicant was seen by an ophthalmologist, who recommended that he receive treatment for conjunctivitis before a decision was made about surgery.
27.  on 19 november 2009 a prosecutor from the chief prosecutor’s office who was supervising the investigations carried out by the investigative department of the ministry of prisons forwarded the applicant’s appeal against the investigator’s refusal to grant her victim status to the director of that department, “for an appropriate response”.as regards his involvement in the dots+ programme, one of the experts noted that it was only in february and april 2009 that the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis had become possible in the ksani facility and the prison hospital respectively.2. as the handwriting examined in the forensic examination did not resemble the handwriting of any of the doctors at the prison in question, the investigator concluded that g.t.’s sister’s allegations were manifestly ill-founded.35.  the relevant national and international materials concerning the problem of tuberculosis in georgian prisons at the material time, the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in georgian prisons at the material time, and the world health organization guidelines for the management of drug-resistant tuberculosis are summarised by the court in the case of makharadze and sikharulidze v. georgia (no.36.  at the material time, the management of prisons, including the provision of medical care to prisoners was a responsibility of the prison department of the ministry of prisons (see order no.
8.  on 6 september 2012 the supreme court of the russian federation quashed the verdict on appeal, in view of contradictory conclusions contained in the jury’s verdict, and remitted the matter to the trial court for fresh consideration.14.  on 28 february 2013 the trial judge asked the bailiffs’ service to conduct an inquiry in response to the statement made by juror v. 15.  on 18 march 2013 the deputy head of the bailiffs’ service responded to the trial judge as follows: “it follows from the reports submitted by the bailiffs ... and the bailiffs’ group supervisor that on the relevant dates the jurors were supervised by the bailiff ... while they were in the courtroom or in the jurors’ room.none of the jurors contacted [the bailiffs’ service] as regards the [jurors’] security or interference with the fulfilment of the jury’s duties.” 16.  following an appeal lodged by the applicant and two other defendants, on 8 august 2013 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the applicant’s conviction.had exerted undue influence on the jury, the court stated as follows: “[the court] rejects as unsubstantiated the argument ... that the jury’s verdict was ... a result of unlawful influence exerted by ch.[the court] discerns no violations of the rules of criminal procedure, including those alleged by [the defendants], that would justify the quashing of the verdict.”
the event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at bolotnaya square which was supposed to end at 7.30 p.m. the march was peaceful and held without any disruptions, but when the marchers arrived at bolotnaya square it transpired that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue, allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting.the administrative-offence record reiterated the reports and notes of the police officers, stating as follows: “... [the applicant], acting as part of a group of 1,500 citizens, took part in an authorised meeting ... during the event [the applicant] committed a breach of the rules on holding public events, [that is to say] she broke the police cordon ... thereby preventing police officers from carrying out their service duties, in breach of article 19.3 § 1 of the code of administrative offences.” 13.  according to the applicant, at the police station she was not allowed to make a phone call, despite making insistent requests.on the basis of the police officers’ reports and explanations and the records of administrative transfer and arrest, the court established that the applicant had committed an administrative offence under article 19.3 § 1 of the code of administrative offences, as described in the administrative-offence record.17.  on 26 july 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint under chapter 25 of the code of civil procedure with the dorogomilovskiy district court of moscow about her allegedly arbitrary arrest on 6 may 2012 and detention until 7 may 2012, the termination of the rally at bolotnaya square and the conditions of her detention at the police station.18.  on 3 september 2012 the court refused to examine the complaint on the grounds that the contested acts of the police had been the matter of the administrative proceedings and could not be challenged separately.
the court held that even if it was not the applicant who had produced or distributed the leaflets, there was a causal link between the publication of the article and the harm caused to m.i.-i.’s reputation because if he had not produced his article in the first place, there would have been no leaflets and no amplification of the negative effects on m.i.-i.’s image.it considered that the manner in which the applicant had acted proved that he had not complied with the duties and responsibilities inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression: “the seriousness of his allegations and of the acts imputed to m.i.-i.hold him [the applicant] responsible for showing the highest rigour and a special caution, the lack of which would breach the rights of others.” 15.  the county court confirmed that the lower court had correctly estimated that it had been necessary to balance the right to private life on the one hand and freedom of expression which contributed to a debate of public interest on the other, holding that: “to insult, to defame a person cannot be justified and legitimate when one party aims to unilaterally expose in the press private litigation of a commercial nature involving two private parties.in assessing the existing conflict between the exercise of freedom of expression in the press and the necessity to protect the reputation and the rights of others, the court estimates that even though the applicant’s allegations made in a press article during an electoral campaign, concerned a potential member of the romanian parliament, thus were of public interest, there are limitations to freedom of expression, the applicant having been bound to act within the limits given by the public interest in protecting the reputation and the rights of another person, including his or her right to be presumed innocent.undoubtedly, when the article was published in the newspaper f., the applicant did not comply with the minimum requirements of diligence prescribed by article 10 § 2 of the convention, in the sense of acting in good faith and in accordance with the journalistic ethics so as [to ensure that] the provided information be trustworthy, notwithstanding the dose of exaggeration or provocation allowed in such situations.” 16.  nevertheless, the county court allowed the applicant’s appeal in part and reduced the damages to eur 5,000, considered to be more proportionate to the damage sustained by m.i.-i.
the court found that witness statements had been corroborated by the bank accounts showing disbursements, the sums of money deposited by the applicants in their bank accounts in the relevant years (2005‑12), and the testimony of another person, who had stated that she had often seen the officials come to the office to meet m. (the formal administrator of a company which was owned and actually controlled by b.)14.  as to the penalty, the judge stated, in general terms, that he had calculated it on the basis of parameters such as the number of acts of bribery, the type of acts which had been the subject of the bribery, the role of each accused person and the time‑frame in which they had carried out the criminal act.16.  by a judgment filed in the registry on 12 january 2016 the judge of criminal appeals (giudice d’appello penale) upheld the first‑instance judgment in the part relating to the applicants, but reduced the sentence to five years’ imprisonment, a four‑and‑a‑half‑year prohibition on holding public office and exercising political rights, and a fine of eur 20,000. the judge did not apply the increased penalty provided for by article 50 of the criminal code (for a continuing offence), which had been applied by the first‑instance judge, because the first‑instance judge had not indicated the specific extent of the increased penalty he had applied, solely stating that the penalty had been determined with regard to the several acts of corrupt conduct.the prolonged nature of the act in question had had various consequences: (i) third persons who had not been involved in the original pact had nevertheless become accomplices in the offence of bribery; (ii) limitation periods had to start running from the date of the last payment involving the accused and (iii) as in the case of continuing offences, an amendment to the relevant law during the period of the crime had to be applied also to the continuing offence of bribery of which the applicants had been accused.19.  the court noted that if the acts ascribed to the applicants had amounted to bribery inducing omission (that is, a private “corruptor” had paid the public officials to fail to do their duty), then it was true that such acts could have been considered as not constituting a crime at the time, or more precisely, that they had constituted the offence of indirect bribery, covered by paragraph 2 of the old law.
10.  by a letter of 13 july 2012 the state education authority (staatliches schulamt – hereinafter “the education authority”) informed the competent family court that the applicants were deliberately and persistently refusing to send their children to school and provided a chronological list of administrative fines and criminal investigations against the applicants – amongst others for hitting one of the daughters – as well as of other incidents since 2005. the education authority concluded that the children were growing up in a “parallel world” without any contact with their peers and that they received no attention of any kind which would enable them to have a part in communal life in germany.already in a previous written submission the applicants had confirmed their unwillingness to send their children to school and had stated that the authorities would have to remove their children from the family home and take them away from them entirely if the children were ever to go to a state school.however, staff of the education authority were not allowed to enter the family home when they arrived for the appointment in january 2013. the father spoke to the members of staff and explained that he believed that the family court’s decision had been unlawful and that he alone was authorised to decide whether his children attended school or not.as to the law, the court outlined that the decision to withdraw parts of parental authority under articles 1666 and 1666a of the civil code (see paragraphs 25 and 26 below) presupposed a significant endangerment of the best interests of the children, which the parents were unable or unwilling to prevent.however, the court continued, the situation had changed in comparison to that of august 2013, at which point – according to the information provided by the youth office – several elements had led to the children’s removal from the family home: a risk emanating from the children’s father to their physical integrity could not be excluded; failed attempts to bring the children to school by the police had led to the risk of the children internalising the attitude that laws had had no bearing on them; attempts to carry out a learning assessment had failed owing to the resistance of the applicants; and according to the information available at the time, it had been possible to assume that the children had had no contact with anyone outside of the family whatsoever.
she claimed that, by donating his part in the immovable property in 1997, her grandfather had infringed her right to a “reserved share” in his inheritance, given that the immovable property in question represented his entire estate.in a decision of 2 march 2005 the court upheld her claim by diminishing the part of the estate donated to the applicant’s cousins and restoring the applicant’s “reserved share” in her grandfather’s inheritance.9.  following an appeal by the other party, on 20 september 2007 the sofia city court quashed the first instance court’s judgment and rejected the applicant’s claim for restoration of her “reserved share” in her grandfather’s estate.1 of 4 february 2005 by the supreme court of cassation (“scc”), the court found that the applicant had not complied with the statutory requirements for claiming her reserved share.the court held that, given that her cousins to whom the real estate had been donated could not be considered “heirs-at-law”, the applicant should have claimed the reserved share of the inheritance by means of an “inventory”.
28.  according to the applicant, during the meeting in her flat on 19 march 2012, mr n.j. admitted, in the presence of the investigators, the applicant, her lawyer and three of her friends, that in july 2011, on a day off work, saturday (either 2 or 9 july 2011), on the instructions of his supervisor, he had installed a second telephone line and connected the wires from the ats to the telephone box outside the applicant’s flat.32.  between april 2012 and august 2013, the investigator issued a series of decisions ordering expert examinations of the following items: the still images sent to the applicant and the yeni müsavat newspaper; wires found in the applicant’s flat; a disc containing the video recording published on “mustavat.tv”; the postal packaging in which the threatening letter and the still images had been sent to the applicant and the yeni müsavat newspaper; and a disc containing the video recording published on “ictimaipalatka.com”.thereafter, in order to discover the traces of crime and material evidence and to determine other circumstances important for the case, [the investigating authorities] conducted, with the participation of an expert, a criminalist, [the applicant], her representative and attesting witnesses, an inspection of the place of the incident, namely the flat located at ..., and owned by ..., where the applicant lived as a tenant, took relevant material evidence from the place of the incident, ordered and obtained expert reports, and made relevant inquiries and issued instructions relating to the case.” 50.  the status report then provided information about the period during which the applicant had rented the flat, as well as the identities of individuals to whom she had subsequently sublet the flat, and the financial arrangements between them.53.  the status report concluded as follows: “on 13 and 17 april 2012 [the applicant] was invited to the investigation department in connection with the necessary investigative steps, but she did not appear; she only appeared for questioning on 26 april 2012. since the beginning of the investigation, in addition to [the applicant] and her representative being summoned by the investigation, on 17 march, 3 april and 14 april 2012 the administration of the baku city prosecutor’s office received visits from her and her representative during which they heard her requests and gave specific instructions to the investigation team for full, impartial and comprehensive conduct of the investigation.” 54.  as to the information mentioned in paragraphs 50 and 52 above, according to the applicant she herself had reluctantly provided much of the above information to the investigators at the request of a prosecutor, in order to assist the investigation, expecting that the information would be kept confidential.therefore, the information in [the status report] cannot be considered damaging to the plaintiff’s reputation or her private and family life.” 58.  the court also held that the applicant had been unable to demonstrate that she had suffered any non-pecuniary damage under the provisions of the civil code and the code of civil procedure as interpreted by the plenum of the supreme court.
7.  following an expert report into the applicant’s mental condition at the time of the commission of the alleged offences, on 2 january 2014 the relevant state attorney’s office amended the indictments, arguing that he had committed the offences in a state of mental derangement caused by paranoid schizophrenia which he had been suffering from for a number of years.17.  after the criminal court’s judgment became final, on 19 march 2014 the file was forwarded to the zagreb county court (hereinafter “the county court”) as the court with competence to rule on the applicant’s involuntary placement in a psychiatric hospital under the protection of individuals with mental disorders act (see paragraphs 34 and 36 below).in the decision opening the proceedings, it noted that the applicant was represented by a legal aid lawyer, r.t. 19.  on 21 march 2014 the county court found that the applicant had not appointed a lawyer to represent him in the proceedings and, as legal representation was mandatory, it appointed him a legal aid lawyer, t.ž.the representative of the hospital reiterated its request for the applicant’s further psychiatric confinement (see paragraph 21 above) and the judge conducting the proceedings read out the note of her visit to the applicant (see paragraph 23 above).30.  the applicant’s father then lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court, arguing that the legal aid lawyer appointed for his son in the proceedings before the county court had acted as an extended arm of the institutions rather than a lawyer protecting his interests.
15.  on 9 july 2008 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint, arguing that section 504(1) of the sentence enforcement code was discriminatory on the grounds of sex, in breach of article 91 of the constitution.the applicant also pointed out that within the context of discrimination the burden of proof was shifted – namely, after a person had demonstrated a difference in treatment, it fell for the respondent to show that this difference had not amounted to discrimination.with respect to the first sentence of article 91 of the constitution, which addressed the principle of equality, the constitutional court pointed out that the following criteria had to be examined – the existence of comparable groups, a difference in treatment between those groups, and a lack of objective and reasonable justification for that difference in treatment.as the legal reasoning advanced by the applicant was based on the assumption that men and women who had committed similarly grave crimes were in comparable situations, the constitutional court considered this reasoning evidently insufficient for the claim to be allowed.with respect to the prohibition of discrimination enshrined in the second sentence of article 91 of the constitution, the constitutional court pointed out that the applicant had failed to specify the human right in conjunction with which the discrimination complaint had been made.
28.  at the hearing of 2 february 2011, and the further hearing on 20 may 2011, the judge interviewed several witnesses: (i) p.s., who had been serving a sentence in sremska mitrovica prison at the same time when the applicant had been there; (ii) d.ž., who had represented the applicant in the criminal proceedings and was familiar with the events in prison; and (iii) m.č., the applicant’s uncle.as regards the court of first instance, the court of appeal stated the following: “[it] failed to properly evaluate the evidence in accordance with article 8 of the law on civil procedure, in accordance with which a court must decide on the facts established as proven, but on the basis of a conscientious and meticulous assessment of each particular piece [of evidence] and of all the evidence together, as well as in relation to the outcome of the whole proceedings.given that such an evaluation was not carried out in this particular case, the findings of the first-instance court that it had not been proved that the claimant had been ill-treated and molested by other cellmates during his time in detention – causing him to sustain different types of non-pecuniary loss for which the [state] could be held responsible as defined in article 172 of the obligations act (zakon o obligacionim odnosima) – cannot be accepted with any certainty.” 37.  in the reopened proceedings, the court of first instance re-examined the applicant’s first lawyer, d.ž., as well as the two expert witnesses.however, the court of appeal awarded the applicant an additional rsd 50,000 (approximately eur 450) for the fear arising from the events during his detention, and explained its reasoning in the following manner: “taking into account the established factual situation and all the circumstances of the present case, as well as the findings of the neuropsychiatrists, according to which the claimant suffered post-traumatic stress during and after his detention, this being, in itself, a complex reaction when a person’s physical and personal integrity is threatened, which [in this case] lasted for days and involved fear, emotional distress, a feeling of sadness, distraction and despair, and being a reaction which, by its nature, is more complex than a fear of strong intensity, the court of appeal finds that, in accordance with article 200 of the obligations act, the claimant is entitled to a just award for non-pecuniary damage for the fear he experienced.” 40.  on 18 january 2014 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal.in particular, his complaint was as follows: “the domestic courts have unlawfully and unconstitutionally rejected the claimant’s clearly justified claim for compensation in respect of the non-pecuniary damage he suffered on account of the violation of his human dignity after being placed in illegal detention, where he was molested for days by a group of prisoners as a person of croatian and albanian origin, being beaten and kicked all over his body, drenched with water, beaten with wet towels, tortured, battered, raped and thereafter shaved all over his body, which was the symbol of a raped person, and being subjected to real and serious threats that he would ‘commit suicide by hanging [himself] over the door handleʼ, or be cut with a razor blade and similar items.
in an attempt to prevent further beatings and to protect himself, [the applicant], while falling down, had turned and taken an aimless swing in the direction of the persons who had continued hitting him.” 11.  on 18 november 2008 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the judgment on appeal.the investigators had questioned the warders b. and l. mentioned in the acquittal judgment of 2 september 2008, who had testified that they had indeed administered up to six truncheon blows to the applicant’s buttocks because he had refused to go through a body search and had hit warder l. in the face.the investigator analysed the depositions of warders and other witnesses, and the findings of the medical examination of 2 october 2007, and concluded that the applicant had not obeyed the warders’ lawful orders and had been aggressive.(b)  challenging of the investigator’s decision of 22 december 2009 and other decisions 25.  on an unspecified date the applicant asked the court to declare unlawful the investigator’s decisions of 28 september 2008, 11 november 2008, 22 december 2009 and an opinion of 12 october 2009 justifying suspension of the investigation.29.  the applicant brought a civil action against the prosecutor’s office of the chelyabinsk region, the treasury and the ministry of finance, seeking compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by the unlawful institution of criminal proceedings.
driver g. and major v. were seated in the front, and officers k. and d. were riding in the rear part of the cabin next to the prisoner cells.he found no indications of gross negligence arising from the decision to transport two prisoners in excess of the van’s design capacity and that not putting the applicant in a cell had been motivated by “considerations of budgetary austerity and saving money allocated for the purchase of fuel”.ten days later the investigator refused to institute criminal proceedings: “... it does not appear possible to establish with certainty that the bullet which hit [the applicant] was shot from the handgun of officer v., rather than from [the handgun of] officer d., while it was in the possession of prisoner mu.besides, under article [41] of the criminal code, causing damage to interests protected by criminal law is not a criminal offence if the act causing such damage was based on a reasonable risk assessment and sought to achieve a socially useful objective, such as preventing an attempted escape in the instant case.” 19.  on 8 february 2016 the deputy head of the regional division upheld the investigator’s decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings.20.  on 5 may 2016 the supervising deputy prosecutor of the bashkortostan republic set the decision aside and ordered a forensic assessment of the applicant’s injury.
1 to the convention, and requested that the requisition order be annulled, that the property be returned to them and that compensation be awarded for any damage suffered as a result of the occupation of the premises and the breach of their right to property.on 8 april 2010 the government offered the owners eur 4,507.30 as rent for the occupation of the premises from 9 april 1986 until 11 february 2010. the owners refused the offer which they considered was too low compared to the rental value of the property and the long number of years during which it had been occupied by third parties.indeed the award of eur 7,535 reflected the sums that the owners would have been entitled to as rent for the premises according to the provisions of chapter 158 of the laws of malta, and thus it was not an award in compensation for the violation of their property rights, nor did it reflect an award for the occupation of the premises at undervalued rents.bearing in mind the social aim pursued by the measure and the fact that the rent paid had been in accordance with the law, as well as the fact that the measure persisted for twenty-four years during which the owners received a low rent compared to its market value, it awarded non-pecuniary damage of eur 5,000 to be added to the pecuniary damage already awarded.according to the same report the sale market value of the property with vacant possession, as it stood, was eur 145,000 and the market value upon completion of works would be eur 175,000. the estimated rental value of the property (in an unspecified state) in 2014 was eur 665 a month (eur 7,980 a year).
it confirmed that the applicants were the legitimate owners of the property, it declared the requisition order null and void, and ordered the release of the premises with vacant possession in favour of the applicants, as well as the eviction of mr and ms a. from the property within one month.17.  the constitutional court confirmed that the applicants had proved ownership of the property and noted that as a result of the requisition order the applicants’ father lost possession of the property and had no means of regaining possession as long as the requisition order remained in force.21.  on 31 october 2014, the applicants wrote to the housing authority requesting that a declaration be made on whether the premises were vacant and requesting the housing authority to prepare a condition report detailing the state of the premises at the end of the requisition period.the applicants refused to withdraw the keys in the absence of the drawing up of a condition report in the presence of the authorities since ‑ as had already transpired in the domestic proceedings ‑ the property had suffered huge damage while subject to the requisition order.the applicants thus wanted a condition report to be drawn up, in the presence of the authority, to enable them to obtain compensation for the damage incurred which was the responsibility of the state in line with article 5 of the housing act (see relevant domestic law below).
6.  on 3 december 2004 the applicant was brought before the judge at the istanbul assize court who placed him in detention on remand taking into consideration the nature of the offence, the state of evidence and the risk of absconding.10.  on 19 july 2007 the 10th chamber of the istanbul assize court held a further hearing, in which both the applicant and his lawyer were present.at the end of that hearing, the court ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention.11.  on 25 july 2007 the applicant’s lawyer filed an objection against the decision of 19 july 2007. on 7 august 2007 the 11th chamber of the istanbul assize court dismissed this objection without holding a hearing.in delivering its decision, the court took into consideration the written opinion of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative.
10.  on 5 october 2015 the applicant was charged with the offence of theft in the amount of eur 47,000. it was alleged that, together with other employees of the bank, she had stolen the aforementioned amount of money from the bag in question.12.  on 5 october 2015 the buiucani district court found that the prosecutor in charge of the case did not specify in his application the reasons giving rise to the suspicion that the applicant might have committed an offence.nevertheless, the court noted that during the hearing the prosecutor had indicated that the other co-accused had stated that the money could have been stolen by the applicant because she had taken bags from the stack of bags in which the unsealed bag had been found and she had had a suspicious behaviour.13.  the applicant appealed against the above decision and argued that the measure of house arrest was unnecessary because even the court of first instance had found that the reasons adduced by the prosecutor had not been convincing.the court observed that unjustified manifestations of clemency would encourage anti‑social behaviour of the sort and would affect the peoples’ trust in the law enforcement organs and that the measure of pre-trial detention was called to punish and discourage anti-social behaviour.
in 2006, ms e.m.t and maria became the sole owners of the property by way of privatisation, while mr v.a.v., mikhail, dmitry and yelena declined in writing to exercise their right to obtain their shares of the privatised flat.failed to appear in court, on 2 april 2008 the oktyabrskiy district court in lipetsk struck out the counterclaim and granted the applicant relief in the form of an order compelling state registration of her full title to the property.and maria, as they were no longer owners of the property, but dismissed the claim in respect of yelena, mikhail and dmitriy on the following grounds: “according to the parties, the contested property contains personal belongings and chattels of the defendants [mikhail, dmitriy and yelena]; it appears from their written statements that, in declining their shares of the contested property during its privatisation, they did not intend to stop using the flat.since there was no arrangement between the owner of the contested property and the defendants regarding the discontinuation of the right to use the property, the court considers that [mikhail, dmitriy and yelena] had a right of use over the flat which was identical [in its scope] to that of the owner; accordingly, there are no legal grounds for allowing [the applicant’s] claim to declare their right of use over the flat terminated.a change in ownership of the contested property cannot serve as an independent ground for terminating [their] right to use the flat ... the plaintiff’s argument to the effect that [mikhail, dmitriy and yelena] do not actually live in the contested property cannot serve as an independent ground for terminating [their] right of use over the flat ... since the defendants’ right of use over the flat is not terminated, there are no grounds for ordering their eviction ...” 11.  on 27 may 2009 the lipetsk regional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, endorsing the district court’s judgment.
according to him, the aim of the protest was to draw public attention to the corruption and the control exercised by politicians over the prosecutor general’s office.the court based its findings on the statements of several prosecution witnesses who had stated that they had disliked the sculptures exposed by the applicant and had considered them to be indecent and obscene.moreover, the accusations meant to be made by the applicant by means of his protest against the officials concerned lacked a factual basis and had been contrary to the principle of presumption of innocence.13.  the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the supreme court of justice in which he reiterated his position that his conviction had been contrary to the provisions of the convention and stated that the sculptures had represented a form of artistic expression which was to be protected under article 10 of the convention.the applicant admitted that the form of the protest chosen by him had been striking, however he considered this manner of protesting as the only way possible to make himself heard in a society which was oversaturated with subjects of discussion.
6.  on 26 january 2004 the applicant obtained from the state a deed of title to an agricultural plot of land (an official land registry title) based on a decree issued by the varvynska local administration on 22 december 2003. this amounted to the official registration of her title to the land in accordance with the domestic procedures.10.  on 20 january 2006 the applicant lodged a civil claim with the domestic courts against the local administration and company b. claiming that the lease agreement of 26 july 2004 infringed her property rights and should have been declared invalid, she sought compensation for the use of the land by company b. she argued that the amount of compensation to be paid to her should correspond to the value of the crop that had been harvested from her land.it also noted that despite the fact that the boundaries had not been marked out, the local administration should have learned about the applicant’s title to the land in question from the land registry and local land plans.the court added that after lodging her request on 4 october 2004 for the boundaries of the plot to be marked out, the applicant had tried to accelerate the process by applying to the local administration and other authorities, to no avail.the court further stressed that under article 125 of the land code of ukraine, the right of the owner of a plot of land to use it arose only once its boundaries had been marked out and after receipt by the owner of the document certifying that right.
one of the conclusions set down in the visit report drawn up by the european union safety committee was that the casa failed to demonstrate the ability adequately to enforce and implement the relevant safety standards.11.  on 22 june 2007 the applicant company wrote to the casa and asked it to reverse its decision on the grounds that it had not explained exactly what irregularities formed the basis for the withdrawal of the aocs and that the casa had not afforded it enough time to remedy the alleged irregularities.the applicant submitted, inter alia, that according to section 23 of the law on civil aviation, the casa was entitled to suspend or withdraw the aocs only if the companies failed to remedy the irregularities found by the casa within the prescribed time-limit.the court also found that the applicant company had failed to comply with the casa’s order of 1 june 2007 prohibiting flights to iraq and afghanistan as of 15 july 2007. the applicant companies challenged the decision before the supreme court of justice.14.  on 29 april 2009 the supreme court of justice dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of the court of appeal after finding that the casa was entitled to revoke the aoc since the applicant company had failed to comply with its instructions concerning the ban on all flights of aircraft registered in moldova to iraq and afghanistan, with effect from 15 july 2007.
5.  on 21 may 2004 the state council of the komi republic appointed ms g. to the office of justice of the peace of lesozavodskiy judicial district of syktyvkar for three years.7.  on 19 november 2009 the acting president of the supreme court of the komi republic appointed ms g. as acting justice of the peace for kutuzovskiy district in syktyvkar as of 23 november 2009 pending the appointment of a permanent justice.8.  on 8 april 2010 the acting president of the supreme court of the komi republic appointed ms g. to the office of justice of the peace in vylgort as of 16 april 2010 for a period of one year.11.  on an unspecified date the applicant appealed against the five judgments of 4 june 2010, arguing, inter alia, that the justice of the peace who had considered his cases had been appointed to the office in contravention of the applicable laws.19.   on an unspecified date the applicant appealed against the two judgments, arguing, inter alia, that the justice of the peace who had considered his cases had been appointed to the office in contravention of the applicable laws.
9.  on the same night the applicant’s lawyer called the hotline of the office of the prosecutor general of georgia, complaining that the applicant had been ill-treated.having visually examined the applicant, the medical expert concluded on 10 september 2008 that the applicant had multiple scratches and bruises all over his body and face, as well as black eyes and a fracture of the right maxillary sinus.they both confirmed that the applicant had had multiple injuries when he had arrived at the detention centre, and that in reply to their question he had claimed that he had sustained those injuries during the arrest.by a letter of 15 january 2009 the prosecutor dealing with the case informed the applicant’s lawyer that the investigation was still pending, and that in view of the conflicting evidence it was impossible to establish whether the force used against the applicant during the arrest had been proportionate or not.the applicant’s lawyer was also informed that the surveillance cameras in question had not been working on the day of the applicant’s arrest, so no video recording could have been obtained.
in support of his application he submitted copies of a medical report by a surgeon at the specialist clinic in belgrade (see paragraph 7 above) and referred to the paper entitled “human rights and gender identity” of october 2009 issued by the commissioner for human rights of the council of europe (see paragraph 34 below) and the yogyakarta principles on the application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity.10.  in a decision of the same date, the civil status registry (“the registry”) – a body within the ministry of justice (“the ministry”) ‑ dismissed the applicant’s application, stating that “no certificate [has been] issued by a competent authority [attesting to the fact] that [the applicant’s] sex [had] been changed, the application having been corroborated only with a certificate that gender reassignment surgery [was] in preparation, which cannot be regarded as proof that it [would] take place.” 11.  the applicant appealed to the ministry, alleging that there was no statutory provision that regulated the matter in hand.in a decision of 17 october 2011 the ministry dismissed the appeal, finding that the impugned decision had been based on section 23 of the civil status registration act (закон за матичната евиденција) (“the act”; under the 2016 amendment this provision became section 22(2) – see paragraph 25 below) and that the evidence produced had not been “sufficient and relevant” in respect of the alteration (промена) sought.since the applicant’s request had not been in the case file, the court could not ascertain whether the applicant had sought the rectification or alteration of the sex/gender marker only or also of the personal code, the latter having not been addressed in the impugned decision.although there is no statutory regulation ... and the second genital surgery has not been carried out, [the experts] consider that [the applicant] should be provided with a document attesting to his new sex ...” 16.  the registry also requested that the ministry of health specify the nature of the certificate and the authority competent to attest to the change of the applicant’s sex.
9.  on 5 may 2008 the applicant’s lawyer filed a written request with the trial judge complaining that the pre-trial investigation into the circumstances of the armed robbery of the taxi driver had been incomplete and one-sided.the applicant’s conviction was based on the evidence given in court by the taxi driver, the investigator in charge of the case, the results of the identity parade and the results of two forensic examinations.the court also relied on the report on the examination of the crime scene, and the reports on the arrest and the searches of the applicant’s person and his apartment.he alleged that the pre-trial investigation and the first-instance court proceedings had been unfair, in violation of article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the convention; and specifically that his defence rights had been violated as he had been prevented from showing his innocence by proving his alibi before the court, and in that connection had not been allowed to examine witnesses on his behalf.the court concluded that the applicant’s guilt had been proven on the grounds of the statement of the taxi driver, the statement of the investigator, the report on the identification parade, the report on the applicant’s arrest and the search of his person, the report on the search of the applicant’s apartment, and the forensic conclusions, among other grounds.
65.  on 30 october 2009 the deputy district prosecutor again criticised the investigators, noting that their failure to carry out confrontations between witnesses, to establish the persons allegedly detained with mr askhab soltagirayev in the rovd, or to check whether former servicemen from the “vostok” battalion of the russian ministry of defence had been involved in the abduction.136.  on 19 july 2003 the department of the federal security service of the chechen republic (“the chechen fsb”) in the shali district of chechnya confirmed at the investigators’ request that the third and fourth applicants had been arrested between 10.20 p.m. and 11.05 p.m. on 20 april 2002. the arrest had been carried out by major k., who had left the chechen republic and could therefore not be questioned.142.  on 18 may 2010 the investigators replied that the criminal case had been transferred to the main investigations directorate of the investigative committee of the russian federation in the south federal circuit and that the applicants would be able to access the file once it had been returned.on 7 june 2010 the investigators asked the chechen fsb to send them a copy of the criminal case file related to the arrest of the third and fourth applicants on 20 april 2002. on 24 july 2010 the fsb replied that the case file had been sent to the chechnya prosecutor in 2003. the investigators searched for that file in the archives, but to no avail.179.  between 2003 and 2007 the second applicant lodged a number of requests with various authorities for them to assist in the investigation and in the search for her son: on 16 july 2003 she contacted the chechnya prosecutor; on 16 february 2004 she contacted the russian president; on 24 january 2005 she contacted the chechen president; on 29 june 2005 she contacted the russian state duma; on 3 february 2006 she contacted the chechen president and the chechen government; and on 3 august 2007 she contacted the achkhoy-martan prosecutor.
5.  on 14 march 2014 a judge of the nitra district court remanded the applicants in detention pending trial on the charge of continuous criminal offence of insurance fraud.with respect to the second applicant, the district court concluded that there was a reason to suspect that he would interfere with witnesses and his co-accused to influence the evidence they would give.8.  on 1 april 2014 the nitra regional court dismissed the applicants’ interlocutory appeals, referring to the findings of the district court.it quashed the relevant part of the decision of the regional court and awarded each of the applicants eur 1,000 as just satisfaction in addition to their legal costs and expenses in the amount of eur 284. the constitutional court noted that where the ordinary courts used only formal and standard phrases in their decisions on detention (as was the case with the applicants), suspicion arose as to whether they had looked properly at the specific circumstances at hand.furthermore, the regional court had not dealt with some of the applicants’ core arguments and thus had not remedied the shortcomings of the district court’s decision.
6.  on 16 july 2008 the ialoveni district court found the applicant guilty of disrespectful conduct towards a police officer and sentenced him to five days’ administrative arrest.7.  on 12 august 2008 the chișinău court of appeal quashed the above‑mentioned judgment and returned the case for a re‑examination on the merits.8.  on 11 february 2009 the ialoveni district court discontinued the proceedings against the applicant as a result of the expiry of the time-limit for applying an administrative sanction.9.  on 13 march 2009 the chișinău court of appeal quashed the judgment of the district court and discontinued the administrative proceedings in respect of the applicant for lack of corpus delicti.on 11 may 2011 the supreme court of justice concluded that the applicant’s administrative arrest had been unlawful and thus awarded him mdl 8,000 (equivalent to eur 500) as compensation for the damage caused.
11.  pursuant to the judgment in favour of mr medinskiy (appendix iii) the authorities decided to allocate a flat to the applicant on 6 november 2015. according to the transfer and acceptance act, the applicant accepted the flat on 20 november 2015. on 21 january 2016 he registered his title to the flat.12.  pursuant to the judgment in favour of mr vedernikov (appendix iii) the authorities decided to allocate a flat to the applicant on 27 october 2015. according to the transfer and acceptance act, the applicant accepted the flat on 13 november 2015. on 11 january 2016 he registered his title to the flat.18.  in the meantime, the defendant twice applied to the domestic courts with a request for termination of the enforcement proceedings, as the applicant’s name had been removed from the list of persons in need of housing, and there had “no longer been a possibility to enforce the judgment”.27.  as regards the absence from the first-instance hearing, the appeal court noted that the notifications of the hearing had been sent to the applicant by registered mail and by telegram to his known address, but had not been delivered as the flat had been closed and the applicant had failed to collect the telegram pursuant to a notification thereof.the judge found, in particular, that the decisions of the presnenskiy district court referred to in paragraphs 19 and 20 had not had a res judicata effect on the proceedings as the domestic law did not prohibit the debtor from lodging a repeated request for termination of the enforcement proceedings.
in the course of the questioning a representative of the prosecutor’s office, mr kh., and the head of the criminal investigation department of the sunzhenskiy rovd confirmed that mr girikhan tsechoyev had been detained by the fsb and was being held on the latter’s premises in ingushetia.20.  on 18 february 2008 the applicant complained to the court of the investigators’ inaction and their decision to suspend the investigation on 4 june 2007. on 24 march 2008 the court dismissed her complaint referring to the fact that the decision to suspend the investigation had already been overruled by a higher investigating authority.55.  in the meantime, the investigators asked various authorities, including the fsb in ingushetia and the ministry of the interior to provide them with information about the special operation in nazran, the alleged detention of mr murad zakriyev and mr rustam muradov on the premises of local law-enforcement agencies and about the owners of the vehicles with the registration plates noted by mr b.g.185.  on 8 april 2004 the investigators from the urus-martan rovd questioned the first applicant and the sister of mr abdula demelkhanov, who confirmed that the latter had been missing since 28 march 2004. later that day the investigation was transferred to the oktyabrskiy rovd, which had to take the decision on the merits of the case.188.  in the meantime, on 22 april and 9 june 2004 the oktyabrskiy rovd, apparently following the applicant’s allegation that her husband had been abducted by state agents, contacted the fsb in chechnya and the commanding officer of the army in chechnya to check if mr abdula demelkhanov had been arrested in the course of a special operation.
12.  as a result of the constitutional court’s judgment, the proceedings before the lab were ceded by the col on 8 april 2003. as a result of the col’s action, no compensation was ever determined for the taking of the applicants’ remaining land (a and b).1 to the convention and article 6 of the convention, they asked the court to declare the declaration of the governor general null, to return the unused parts of the land, to award compensation in respect of the land which had been used, and to redress the violations found.in particular they argued that the land had not been expropriated for a public purpose, but for a commercial purpose given that the col had transferred the land to the malta freeport corporation and in 1989 with the introduction of the freeport act, the land became part of the freeport.14.  during these proceedings, on 4 november 2008, a doubt was raised by the government and the technical expert as to the exact size of land b, in so far as the site plans (attached to the applicants’ application to the domestic courts) drafted by the architect included an extra area which appeared to be owned by the government.according to the conclusions of a technical report drawn up on the matter by a court‑appointed architect in june 2009, land b as shown on the plans which were submitted by the applicants with the application to the civil court (first hall), included a piece of land which pc had already sold to a third party, the remaining parts which were expropriated were the property of the applicants.
22.  on 23 july 2008 the applicant company’s representative sent a request for information to the president of the arbitration tribunal, asking whether the arbitration clause contained in the contracts concluded between the parties was sufficient for the tribunal to accept the claim for examination, and whether the decisions of the commercial court to leave the claim unexamined on the grounds that the determination of the dispute fell within the jurisdiction of a commercial arbitration court provided sufficient grounds for accepting the claim.the relevant parts of the letter read as follows: “... the promissory note of 8 november 2002 and the agreement of 28 october 2005, on which your claim was based, do not contain an arbitration clause and, moreover, the parties have not concluded any agreement to submit the disputes arising out of the performance of the above-mentioned promissory note and the agreement to the permanent arbitration institution of the chamber of commerce and industry of armenia for determination.consequently, in the absence of an arbitration agreement between the parties, the [arbitration tribunal] cannot start arbitration proceedings.” 27.  in view of the fact that the commercial court had been abolished by that time, on 17 october 2008 the applicant company lodged a claim with the yerevan civil court, seeking to recover eur 116,600 from the llc, representing the amount of the loan and interest.in doing so, it stated the following: “... as for the letter of the president of the arbitration tribunal of the chamber of commerce of 7 october 2008 concerning non-acceptance of the claim lodged by [the applicant company], it was based on the grounds that [the applicant company] had not submitted the original arbitration agreement or a certified copy, as required by the commercial arbitration act and [the provisions contained therein], in the absence of which arbitration proceedings could not be started.the court of cassation finds that, taking into account the failure to submit to the arbitration tribunal of the chamber of commerce and industry the original arbitration agreement or a certified copy ... and non-examination of [the applicant company’s] claim, [the applicant company] is not deprived of judicial protection in accordance with the general provisions of the code of civil procedure ...”
they included, for example, the recording of his attendance at the trades union congress (“tuc”) conference in brighton in september 2006; at a demonstration at the labour party conference in bournemouth in september 2007; at a pro-gaza demonstration in brighton in january 2009 and at a demonstration against “new labour” organised by a number of trade unions in september 2009. in the great majority of cases, the information recorded about mr catt was his name, presence, date of birth and address.18.  in a witness statement dated 6 june 2011 prepared in the context of the proceedings introduced by the applicant before the high court, the then national coordinator explained the functions of the national public order intelligence unit (npoiu) and the position as regards retention of data relating to the applicant.in his witness statement, the national coordinator clarified that the material which had been disclosed to the applicant following his subject access request of march 2010 was not all the material held in respect of the applicant: a considerable amount of further information had not been disclosed on the grounds that disclosure would prejudice the investigation or detection of crime and that the material was thus exempt from disclosure under section 29 of the data protection act (see “relevant domestic law and practice”, below).22.  following a two day hearing during which legal representatives for the applicant, an ngo, the nhri for england and wales, acpo and the secretary of state presented their arguments, the court of appeal unanimously allowed the appeal in a judgment of 14 march 2014. it found that the inclusion of the applicant’s personal data in the database constituted an interference with his article 8 rights which was not justified.its value can only be judged in hindsight, as subsequent analysis for particular purposes discloses a relevant pattern ... the most that can be done is to assess whether the value of the material is proportionate to the gravity of the threat to the public ...” 28.  lord sumption further considered that the retention in a nominal record or information report of information about third persons such as the applicant did not carry any stigma of suspicion or guilt.
7.  in january 2005, the applicant and the owners of the other three properties instigated independent evidentiary proceedings before the regional court against the property developers on the basis of alleged defects in the residential property units, in particular the water drainage system.9.  over the following months, after the applicant had made an advance payment on the court fees, the regional court forwarded to the other parties to the proceedings the applicant’s statement of claim and the defendants’ statement of defence; extended the deadline for the applicant to make further submissions; forwarded the submissions of the applicant’s neighbours (in which they (i) declared their wish to join the proceedings by way of intervention and (ii) sought eur 8,000 in damages); held an oral hearing, in which it discussed the factual and legal situation and suggested a friendly settlement; waited for the applicant to propose the basis for a friendly settlement agreement; and forwarded further submissions made by the parties.invited the parties to participate in another onsite visit, which was scheduled for 28 october 2010. however, the visit had to be rescheduled several times – once because the defendants were unable to attend and three times because the applicant was unable to attend; eventually the visit took place on 17 january 2011. on 4 may 2011, the applicant complained about the length of time it was taking for the expert to prepare his opinion.on 30 august 2011 the applicant lodged an objection to the method of calculating the fee for the expert opinion and applied for an extension of the deadline in order to be able to prepare substantial submissions in the light of the content of the expert opinion.26.  in application of these principles, the court of appeal assessed all phases of the proceedings and reasoned that the regional court had generally expedited the proceedings sufficiently and that it had caused a delay only in the summer of 2010 because it had failed to sufficiently instruct the expert at the time in question and had failed to undertake the measures necessary to ensure that the expert submitted his opinion in good time.
defence counsel submitted a brief containing the grounds for the appeal on points of law in november 2011 and subsequently submitted four additional briefs, the last of which was received by the regional court on 12 january 2012. on 24 february 2012, the public prosecutor’s office instructed that the file, along with the submissions by the public prosecutor’s office in response to the defence counsel’s submissions, be transferred to the federal court of justice, which was competent to examine the appeal on points of law.the defence had made excessive use of their right to make statements under article 257 § 2 of the code, often repeating arguments already made several times, and had filed around 500 applications for the taking of evidence, a large number of which had been directed at evidence that had either already been taken or that was impossible to obtain, such as the examination of deceased persons.against this backdrop, it is not equitable, even in the absence of a conclusive finding of guilt, in the context of the discretionary decision to be made, to order that the accused’s necessary expenses be reimbursed by the treasury....” 10.  counsel for the late accused filed an immediate appeal against the regional court’s decision of 5 april 2012. he submitted, inter alia, that the decision not to reimburse the accused’s necessary expenses, and its reasoning, breached the presumption of innocence guaranteed by article 6 § 2 of the convention.it was permissible, in view of the establishment of the late accused’s guilt by the trial court, to find that there continued to be, at the time the proceedings were discontinued, a state of suspicion against the late accused, and to apply article 467 § 3, second sentence, number 2, of the code of criminal procedure on that basis.
6.  in the course of her employment the applicant had two children, born on 27 march 2008 and 7 may 2010. the applicant spent her maternity leave in the united states and regularly sent requests to extend that leave every six months for the duration of her absence.we also inform you that your employment contract shall be terminated ... considering the fact that you did not return to work after the completion of your unpaid maternity leave, which was to end on 1 september 2011, as indicated in your letter sent to us by fax on 17 march 2011. the employment contract shall be considered terminated as of 1 december 2011.” 9.  it appears that the applicant sent emails to the management of the british council in relation to the early termination of her employment.in particular, the email stated that the termination of the applicant’s employment had been in full compliance with domestic law and the terms and conditions of the british council.15.  on 16 january 2012 the british council was notified by the district court of its taking over of the examination of the case and the judge appointed.in doing so, the court of appeal did not address the applicant’s arguments regarding the alleged lack of impartiality of judge a.m. in the proceedings before the district court.
10.  following a declaration that the death penalty was unconstitutional by a decision of the constitutional court of ukraine in december 1999 and amendments to the criminal code in february 2000, on 4 october 2000 the odessa regional court commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment.22.  according to the government, on 1 march 2009 the prison received the relevant medication from the penal authorities, and the applicant started the art course.38.  upon arrival at the ladyzhynka colony on 22 february 2007, the applicant was examined by the colony’s medical personnel and placed under monitoring as a person with residual changes in the upper part of the left lung in the form of dense focal lung lesions (щільні вогнищеві тіні), category 5.1.the guards then opened the cell door, took the prisoners out of the cell and performed a search of the inmates and the cell.upon completion of the search, the applicant was taken back to the cell, the handcuffs were removed and he was allowed to stand up straight once the cell door had been closed.
4.  the applicant was born in 1978. according to the most recently available information, at the time of the events in june 2016 the applicant was detained in kirovograd pre-trial detention facility no.16.  according to the government, on 8 october 2015 the prison governor issued a decision on the applicant’ placement in a disciplinary cell for consumption of alcohol.17.  on 12 october 2015 the applicant’s lawyer complained to the kirovograd regional prosecutor’s office that the applicant was not receiving the requisite medical care in detention.on 27 january 2016 the prison service took a decision on the applicant’s transfer to the hospital for the required surgery.21.  on 12 february 2016 the applicant informed the prison governor that he had refused the treatment offered to him in the hospitals within the dnipropetrovsk and kharkiv sizos because of lack of trust in the doctors of those facilities.
however, in the original criminal complaint filed by the applicants, no mention had been made of any such blow; and no corresponding injury had been recorded in the ensuing medical report – in which it had, on the other hand, been recorded that the first applicant had not become unconscious and had been able to remember the events clearly.similarly, the criminal complaint filed by the applicants had not contained any reference to what the first applicant stated in his subsequent testimony, namely that he had been kicked in the head – his left temple – on the flight of steps leading to the entrance of the police station.in the forensic expert’s opinion, the medically documented injuries of the fourth applicant – epithelial abrasions of the forehead, the left eyebrow, the area anterior to the left ear and both knees (see paragraph 24 below) – could have been caused when he had been handcuffed, a measure that he had resisted; the injuries had not been typical of a beating and had only indicated a weak impact.in relation to the first applicant, the fourth applicant mentioned assaults that the first applicant himself had not mentioned during his questioning and which were not described in the criminal report filed by the first applicant either: namely that upon arrival at the police building he had been pulled out of the car and kicked in the spine.23.  neither the police officers, nor the security guard on duty at the police station, nor the petrol station staff had provided any support for the allegation that the applicants, who had been under the influence of alcohol and talking to the officers in an extremely rude way, had been assaulted either at the petrol station or in the police building.
the wording of the court judgment read as follows: “...the brothers of the deceased suffered non-pecuniary damage, consisting of the pain caused by the loss of their nine-year-old sister in violent circumstances and by their sister’s suffering in the hospital until her death; from the evidence adduced before the court (the statements of the civil parties were corroborated by the statements of three witnesses) it can be determined that between the civil parties and the nine-year-old girl there was a strong emotional relationship.therefore, having regard to the negative consequences, the importance of the infringed moral values, the way in which they were perceived by the civil parties, and the impact of their loss on the stability of their family, the court will grant to each civil party the equivalent of 100,000 euros”.the court further dismissed the applicants’ claim for non-pecuniary damages on the ground that at the time of their sister’s accident they had been younger than fourteen and had therefore been unaware of the negative consequences of her death.the wording of the court judgment read as follows: “the court will dismiss the civil claims lodged by cosmin mihai deaconu and alexandru bogdan deaconu on grounds other than those invoked by the insurance company.in the present case, the applicants’ situation should be assessed in a different way, having regard to the fact that at the time of their minor sister’s accident they were younger than fourteen and therefore they were not aware of the negative consequences of her death.
11.  following a deterioration in the applicant’s health, on 23 may 2017 the court indicated to the government under rule 39 of the rules of court that they should immediately ensure that the recommended treatment was available and provided to the applicant and that the applicant was placed in a specialised medical institution for medical treatment – including surgery, if appropriate.in view of the complexity of the applicant’s state of health, before the cardiac ventriculography test the hospital requested that the applicant have an additional consultation at the amosov cardiology institute.14.  according to the government, the sizo administration offered the applicant transportation to the kyiv sizo in a prison van with a view to his undergoing a further medical examination at the amosov cardiology institute.16.  the case file contains an extract from the applicant’s medical file bearing no date and signed by the head of the sizo medical unit; according to the extract, the sizo had no cardiologist on its staff and high-quality medical treatment was not possible at the sizo.17.  on 10 july 2017 the court reiterated its previous decision (see paragraph 11 above) indicating that the authorities were to ensure that the applicant was transported promptly, and in conditions commensurate with his state of health, to a specialised medical institution to undergo the necessary medical examinations, such as a cardiac ventriculography test, in order that a correct diagnosis could be made and the applicant could receive medical treatment, if necessary.
7.  on 7 march 2005 the competition council decided to broaden the scope of the investigation and to find out whether the applicant company’s activities had affected trade between the european union member states, as defined in article 82 of the treaty establishing the european community (“the tec”) – now article 102 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (“the tfeu” – see paragraph 43 below).it submitted that the investigation of the applicant company’s activities had covered the period between 2002 and 2004. although the initial investigation had not mentioned the end date of the actions examined, it could be presumed that the last investigated action had been undertaken on 31 december 2004. domestic law provided that economic entities could only be held liable for breaches of the law on competition up to three years after the date of the violation in question or, if the violation was continuous, three years after the date of the last action that had been contrary to the law on competition (see paragraph 27 below).the court then emphasised the importance of the principle of res judicata – that is to say the factual and legal aspects had been examined in another decision of the court and had to be accepted, and that a party to the proceedings or another person who had participated in the case (where the parties to the proceedings were the same) could rely on that court’s decision without having to prove the same circumstances again.a520‑2136/2012 the court has examined the legality of the decision of the competition council whereby the economic entity was suspected of a breach of the provisions of the law on competition and in the instant case the applicant company is suspected of breaching both the law on competition and the tfeu.in the opinion of the extended composition of the court, this circumstance also determined the conclusion that the two cases are substantively different and the decision, taken in one of them, cannot be a precedent in determining the other one.” the court thus decided that the competition council’s ruling that (i) the limitation period had not expired and (ii) the applicant company could be held liable for the breaches of the law on competition had been lawful.
moreover, following the amendment of the integration act, the cooperative credit institutions were obliged to deposit an amount equivalent to the value of the share capital they had had at the time of the establishment of their membership in the integration organisation to a separate account at the savings bank for 730 days (sections 11(7) and (8), and 20/a(12) and (13) of the integration act; see also paragraph 43 below).following the entry into force of the integration act, the savings bank’s capital was increased by huf 654,986,000 to huf 3,389,704,000 (approximately eur 10 million) from the previous amount of huf 2,735,038,000. out of this capital increase, the state-owned hungary post (magyar posta) exercised its statutory subscription rights and acquired ordinary shares with an aggregate par value of huf 654,666,000 (approximately eur 2 million), almost 20% of the savings bank’s shares (see section 20 of the integration act, cited in paragraph 39 below).28.  the shareholders of the cooperative credit institutions may take, inter alia, the following resolutions subject to consent/approval of the savings bank: - the adoption of the annual financial report of the company (section 15(11) and 17/j(2) of the integration act); - the issuing of bonds (section 17/k(1) of the integration act); - decreases or increases of capital (ibid.32.  as to the actual application of the measures provided for by the integration act, the government submitted the following information: (i)  there have been altogether 151 cases in which cooperative credit institutions sought the consent of the integration organisation for the appointment of board members; in ten cases the consent was refused, affecting seven cooperative credit institutions.(iii)  in eight cases the savings bank refused to consent to the payment of dividends; the reasons were: (a) non-compliance with the relevant legislation (two cases, including kinizsi bank (see paragraph 35 below)), (b) the risk of not fulfilling the business plan (four cases), (c) the risk of not fulfilling the business plan but allowing for the payment of a limited amount of dividends (two cases, including mohácsi bank (see paragraph 35 below)).
6.  on 7 february 2014 the kirovskiy district court in st petersburg found the applicant guilty of illegally residing in russia, which was an offence article 18.8 § 3 of the code of administrative offences, imposed a fine on him and ordered his administrative removal from russia.pending his removal, the applicant was to be detained in the special facility for the detention of aliens (сувсиг уфмс по спб и ло) located in krasnoye selo in the leningrad region.8.  on 19 may 2014 a bailiff asked the district court in st petersburg to discontinue the enforcement proceedings because the applicant could not be issued with travel documents or removed from russia.9.  by a judgment of 17 july 2014, as upheld on appeal on 30 october 2014, the st petersburg courts refused to discontinue the proceedings, finding that the bailiff had not shown that she had taken sufficient measures to secure the applicant’s removal.10.  on 7 august 2014 counsel for the applicant asked the st petersburg city court to review the kirovskiy district court’s judgment by way of supervisory review, to annul the sanction of administrative removal and to release the applicant.
10.  as transpires from the medical records and the prosecutor’s decision of 19 december 2014 (also see paragraph 44 below), at 8.08 a.m. on 15 april 2008 officers at biržai police station called an ambulance, which arrived at the scene within a couple of minutes, at 8.12 a.m. the paramedics indicated in the medical report and also later testified during the pre-trial investigation that they had examined m.p.’s body at 8.12 a.m.: the body had been found lying on the floor, had shown no signs of breathing or a pulse, the pupils had been dilated and had not reacted to light, the neck had shown signs of strangulation, post-mortem discoloration had set in, as had rigor mortis.23.  as to the possible criminal liability under article 229 of the criminal code (see paragraph 52 below) on the part of the police, the prosecutor took into account the conclusions of the internal investigation to the effect that the officers d.m.25.  having performed an additional examination of the bed sheet in the light of all available evidence, such as the witnesses’ statements, the photographs from the scene and expert reports, by a decision of 6 september 2010 the prosecutor again discontinued the pre-trial investigation into the circumstances of m.p.’s death.on the basis of the documentary evidence – photographs of m.p.’s corpse from the scene, the bailiff’s statements of 16 april 2008 (see paragraph 15 above) and the additional autopsy report (see paragraph 14 above) – the experts also categorically and officially stated that there had been no bruising around m.p.’s eyes, unlike what had been claimed by the applicant.48.  having examined the available material, which included both the criminal case-file regarding the theft and the material of the criminal case-file concerning the circumstances of m.p.’s death, the internal investigator concluded that there was no information which could lead to a conclusion of any kind of abuse of m.p.
6.  on 14 august 2014 the directorate of the federal migration service for the arkhangelsk region declared applicant’s stay in the russia undesirable (“the exclusion order”).7.  since the applicant failed to depart voluntarily, on 2 october 2014 the plesetskiy district court in the arkhangelsk region found him guilty of failing to leave russia within the specified time-limit, which was an offence article 18.8 § 1.1 of the code of administrative offences, imposed a fine on him and ordered his administrative removal from russia.9.  replying to an inquiry from the federal migration service, on 12 november 2014 the embassy of tajikistan confirmed that the applicant was not a national of that state.10.  on 8 may 2015 counsel for the applicant asked the plesetskiy district court to discontinue the enforcement of the removal and detention order.the district court discontinued the execution of the removal and detention order and ordered the applicant’s release.
8.  having learnt that a site division and urban development plan (plano de pormenor) encompassing the land of company f. had been drawn up by the municipality of aveiro, former employees of the company, including some of the applicants, applied to the aveiro court on 12 december 1997, requesting that it wait for the plan to be approved before ordering the sale of company f.’s assets.21.  in the absence of any reply to the two previous requests, on 17 april 2012 the court ordered the judicial liquidator to provide information on the state of the proceedings, and also ordered that he would be fined if he did not provide such a reply.26.  following the aveiro commercial court insisting that the judicial liquidator provide information on the progress regarding contact with real-estate companies by way of three notifications (sent to him on 27 september, 19 october and 19 november 2012), on 16 january 2013 he informed the court that only one real-estate company had expressed interest in mediating the sale of the property.37.  on 11 september 1996 the applicants and other individuals (represented in the present case by their heirs) identified by numbers 1 to 131 in the annex lodged an application with the court to complain about the duration of the proceedings at issue before the aveiro court.38.  in a judgment of 8 june 2000, the court found a violation of article 6 § 1 of the convention on account of the excessive length of the proceedings, awarding each applicant the sum of 900,000 portuguese escudos (pte – about eur 4,489) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and pte 313,840 (about eur 1,565) to the first applicant for costs and expenses.
6.  on 24 january 2004 the investigator of the snizhne prosecutor’s office, following the pre-investigation inquiries, refused to initiate criminal proceedings on the grounds that no elements of a crime had been established in relation to the death of the applicant’s son.8.  on 5 april 2005 the donetsk regional prosecutor’s office quashed the decision of 24 january 2004 (see paragraph 6 above) as premature and unfounded, finding that further pre-investigation inquiries were necessary given that the possible reasons for suicide had not been examined, and other relatives as well as acquaintances of the deceased had not been questioned either.the applicant’s husband informed the authorities that when he had seen his dead son in the barn, the corpse of his son had been in a sitting position and the rope loop had not been tightened.she advanced different theories, suspecting notably: police security guards who had allegedly taken the applicant’s son from a local bar, following which he had been found dead; a local police officer who had engaged in a dispute with the applicant’s son; a woman who had been employed by the applicant’s son in his textile business and her husband; the applicant’s son’s brothers-in-law; a business partner of the applicant’s son; and people from a local gambling club (the applicant’s son had been engaged in transporting money from the club to another town).the court noted the theory of the possible involvement of the local police had not been properly examined, the role of the applicant’s son’s brother-in-law had not been clarified even though he might have been the first to find the dead body, the applicant had not been questioned on all the issues which were relevant to the case, and the evidence relating to the applicant’s son’s suicidal tendencies had not been assessed.
9.  on 11 february 2013 the director of the public registry (also defendant in the proceedings) requested the court to order that the parties submit themselves to the genetic tests as provided by article 100a of the civil code, and for the applicant to submit his details, which would be required to make the relevant changes to x.’s birth certificate, if the court had to find in x.’s favour.neither had it looked at the lawfulness of the measure and the legitimate aim – in this connection he contended that since the requirement to order the test was mandatory (unless it concerned a minor), it deprived the judge making such order of any possibility to balance out the interests at play and to decide according to his or her discretion.on the other hand the applicant had not put forward reasons which were sufficiently valid to find that the application in his case of article 100a would breach his rights under article 8. reiterating the findings in pascaud (cited above), the constitutional court emphasized that the interest of a presumed father was not, alone, a sufficient argument to deprive the applicant [a person seeking to establish paternity] of her article 8 rights.thus, the application of the relevant law to the applicant’s case would be justified given that the aim was precisely to establish the identity of the x. and safeguard her patrimonial interest, if it were to be found that she was the applicant’s daughter.26.  in that light and bearing in mind the applicant’s submissions that article 70a(2) of the civil code excluded any exercise of discretion by the court ordering the test, the constitutional court considered that while it was not excluded that there might be cases where the necessary application (applikazzjoni tassativa) of article 70a(2) of the civil code may result in a breach of article 8, namely where a fair balance has not been reached between the interests at play, in the present case it was not so, given the factual circumstances of the present case.
18.  in consequence, the cds issued the following conclusions: “it is undisputed that the detainee speaks only german, and that the medical, welfare and prison staff in the institution in which he is detained are unable to provide him with any therapeutic or welfare assistance; that he has been abandoned to his fate without any treatment since his arrival in paifve (on 21 january 2004), although some individuals have, on a voluntary basis, made considerable efforts to explain to him his situation, which he experiences as an injustice; in the present case, the two-fold legal aim of the compulsory confinement, namely protection of society and of the patient’s health, can only be achieved if the deprivation of liberty is accompanied by the treatment necessitated by the detainee’s mental health; since this dual condition is not fulfilled, [mr] rooman’s detention is unlawful; ...” 19.  the cds postponed its examination of the application for conditional discharge until a hearing to be held in september 2006, pending the appointment of german-speaking employees to the paifve eds.no satisfactory follow-up has been given to the requests by the [social protection] board for an end to be put to this unlawful situation for mr rooman, who is deprived of his freedom in order, on the one hand, to protect society from possible dangerous conduct by him, and on the other, to provide him with the treatment necessary for his reinsertion; ... in the light of the authorities’ failure, the question now before the board is whether there exists, outside the social-protection facility, a unit or persons who could provide home-based therapy for mr rooman; ...” 26.  in consequence, and pointing out that german was one of the national languages of belgium and that the applicant was thus entitled to speak, be understood and receive treatment in that language, the cds asked the eupen remand prison to search in and around verviers and eupen for either a mental health unit, or a doctor or clinic, which could provide home‑based therapy for the applicant in his mother tongue.it found as follows: “it follows from the report [from the psychosocial department] of 30 march 2010 that, except for occasional meetings with a welfare officer “who speaks german”, the detainee has no social contact in his language and that he has had no opportunity for several months to converse and to gain a fresh perspective in the outside world; the doctor and psychologist who signed this report do not seem particularly convinced of progress in the ‘ongoing measures (taken) by the department to enable a german‑psychologist to intervene occasionally to provide care for the german‑speaking patients in the eds’; mr rooman’s situation is deadlocked: an ill individual, he is detained in a prison medical institution where no one is able to provide the treatment to which he is entitled; the minister and his departments are turning a deaf ear, with no concern for the despair to which this manifestly unjust attitude may lead; in spite of the unlawfulness of mr rooman’s detention, his health condition means that discharge cannot be envisaged unless it is accompanied by therapy and practical support; the [social protection] board has no powers, firstly, to restore the detainee’s basic rights, namely, the rights to liberty, health care and respect for his humanity; and secondly, to compel the minister to put an end to this situation, which his administration has been fully aware of for more than six years.” 30.  the cds decided, while “remaining open to any proposals”, to leave the applicant’s situation unchanged; in other words, it rejected his application for discharge.the continued compulsory confinement in an eds suited to his medical condition of an individual who would represent a danger to the public in the event of discharge, when his mental condition has not sufficiently improved and the conditions for his social rehabilitation are not met, is not unlawful and does not amount to a violation of the provisions of the [convention].” 42.  on 25 june 2014 the court of cassation quashed the decision by the csds on the grounds that it had not addressed the applicant’s argument that he was not receiving care appropriate to his situation, in view of the fact that he spoke and understood only german and that no german-speaking staff members were available in the facility where he was being held.he had had access to an external german-speaking psychologist between may and november 2010. the president noted that the consultations with that psychologist had ended, not because the applicant no longer wished to attend them, as alleged by the state in its pleadings, but because of the belgian state’s late payment of the psychologist’s fees and expenses, and that the consultations had resumed in july 2014. he noted that, until april 2010, the applicant had benefitted from the presence and care of a german-speaking nurse, who had in the meantime left the paifve eds, but that since august 2014 the same nurse had been authorised to accompany the applicant on outings.
the poor organisation was reflected in three aspects: a) the lack of fencing around the boundaries of the hospital, which allowed inpatients to leave the hospital easily without any supervision, b) the lack of a mechanism for checking the presence of inpatients which would allow the hospital staff to notice an absence immediately, and c) the lack of an emergency procedure capable of detecting an inpatient’s absence, which would allow the hospital staff to adopt the effective measures required to ensure that the inpatient was returned safely without endangering the lives of others or his own life.in a patient who wanders around the hospital and whose symptomatology is not suggestive of imminent suicide, where that probability (of suicide) is higher but is not so increased at that moment (considering the background and the characteristics of the patient), prevention is much more difficult.” 34.  the first hearing took place on 8 october 2008. the applicant and the psychiatrist who had issued the above medical opinion gave evidence at the hearing.in this regard it held that the lack of security fences or walls was: “in line with modern theories of psychiatric science according to which the treatment of patients suffering from mental disorders must take place in an atmosphere of trust and mobility of movements, in physical conditions which promote the freedom and autonomy of movements, and which favours the interaction and the conviviality between patients and the staff in order to encourage [the patient’s] reintegration; monitoring of these patients must be conducted in a discreet way”.– a regime which could be suited to preventing any possible exit from the hospital, ... this enhanced surveillance, which aims at protecting the patient, is part of the therapeutic obligation of the hospital and it does not conflict with the open-door regime as a treatment method applied to patients in the circumstances in which it is considered suitable.” 43.  regarding the facts which the applicant had relied on concerning several hsc inpatients who had left without permission and the resulting tragic consequences, the opinion noted that those elements should not be taken into consideration.the first five articles below had already been submitted to the domestic authorities (see paragraph 44 above where the administrative supreme court found the information contained therein to be irrelevant to the decision in the instant case): (i)  on 9 march 2008 the body of an inpatient who had escaped two weeks earlier was found close to the hospital grounds (in diário de coimbra); (ii)  on 29 october 2008 a man escaped from the hsc and was hit by a car after jumping in front of it (in diário das beiras); (iii)  on 31 july 2008 the body of an inpatient who had escaped from the hospital the previous month was found in a river (in diário de coimbra); (iv)  on 14 august 2008 a patient who had been involuntarily hospitalised in the hsc escaped (in diário de coimbra); (v)  in early march 2010 three different inpatients escaped from the hospital; one of them was located by the police after stealing a car and another was found dead in a nearby river (in bombeirospontopt); (vi)  on 16 october 2011 an inpatient escaped from the hsc’s grounds and attacked two police officers with a hoe (in correio da manhã); (vii)  on 1 march 2015 two inpatients escaped from the hsc and stole a car (in tvi24).
6.  on 7 may 2007 the applicant company and company s. concluded a contract, under which the applicant company had to carry out construction work on the premises of company h. 7.  on 18 january 2008 the applicant company initiated compensation proceedings against company s. in the yerevan civil court (“the civil court”), arguing that it had completed the construction work as required by the contract of 7 may 2007, but company s. had failed to make full payment for the work.10.  on 11 march 2008 the expert in charge of conducting the forensic examination filed a letter with the civil court, stating that it was necessary for the civil court to ensure his access to the premises of company h. for the purposes of the examination, as that company was not a party to the civil proceedings.18.  on 23 april 2009 the civil court of appeal quashed that judgment and remitted the case, reasoning, inter alia, that in the absence of an expert opinion on the questions posed by the civil court as regards the disputed construction work, that judgment was unfounded.30.  on 28 february 2015 the applicant company submitted another letter to the bureau, reminding it that the examination had not yet been carried out and informing it about the delay that the lack of an expert examination had caused in the civil proceedings.32.  on 20 may 2015 the minister of justice responded by stating that even though it would take one day to carry out the expert examination and approximately five days to complete the report, the examination had not been carried out for reasons such as the lack of an expert in the bureau, the expert’s inability to access the premises of company h., the excessive workload in the bureau, and so on.
the relevant part of the decision read as follows: “on 12 january 2002, at approximately 6 p.m., a number of unidentified criminals murdered, using firearms, mr alvi bugayev near [the building at the address] 5 sovetskaya street in the town of urus-martan in the chechen republic; [after the murder] they left the crime scene in a white vaz car (model 2106).” 13.  on the same date (12 january 2002) the investigators questioned mr bugayev’s wife, ms z.s., who stated that the perpetrators of her husband’s killing had been those servicemen who had threatened to kill him.55.  for instance, on 21 july 2005 the applicants’ representatives complained to the staropromyslovskiy district prosecutor of the lack of information concerning the investigation and the investigators’ failure to inform the applicants of the most important steps taken, such as the results of the expert examination of evidence and the questioning of key witnesses.90.  on 18 march 2005 the investigators requested that the commander of the west battalion of the chechen ministry of the interior provide (for the purposes of their being questioned) a list of the servicemen of that unit who had been manning the checkpoint at the time of the shooting.100.  on an unspecified date between 1 and 12 may 2005 the applicants lodged a complaint with the staropromyslovskiy district prosecutor, stating that the investigators had failed to take the following steps: “ ... [they have failed] 1.  to clarify the reasons for which on 27 or 28 january 2005 the television news broadcast stated that two illegal fighters had been killed and one had managed to abscond and to find out who provided the television channel with this information; 101.  on 12 may 2005 the investigators issued a plan of steps to be taken within the criminal investigation.108.  on 20 october 2005 the deputy staropromyslovskiy district prosecutor again overruled the suspension as premature and unlawful and ordered that the investigation be resumed in order for a number of steps to be taken, including the establishment of the identities and questioning of mr adlan g. and mr vakha t. it appears that those orders, other than the sending of formal requests for information to various law-enforcement agencies regarding whether they had conducted special operations on the date of the incident, were not complied with by the investigators.
the landlord was under obligation to perform a major overhaul of the apartment block, and the applicants had to make regular payments for the major overhaul.8.  on the dates listed in the appendix the orenburgskiy district court of the orenburg region granted their claims, having noted from expert reports that the apartment block was “64%‒dilapidated” and its state was “unsatisfactory”, and that the flat was 64%‒dilapidated.the court ordered the federal state institution of the privolzhsko-uralskiy military circuit to perform the major overhaul of the applicants’ flat, as well as of the common property of the apartment block and of the “devices situated in the living premises and serving for provision of communal services” in the apartment block, and to pay each applicant 3,000 russian roubles (rub) in respect of non‑pecuniary damage.they did not enclose a copy of the judgment or further details as to either the defendant, or the exact list of claimants, the scope of the judgment or its subsequent challenge on appeal by any of the parties.by the final judgment of 5 february 2013 the orenburg regional court rejected their claims in full, having found that they were based on an incorrect interpretation of the domestic law and that the applicants had failed to submit a calculation of the penalty.
11.  the attorney general (hereinafter referred to as “the ag”) appealed against part of the decision of the court of magistrates, requesting the court of criminal appeal to order the confiscation of the toyota; he also appealed with respect to the punishment imposed.1, that the confiscation of the peugeot in the first set of criminal proceedings and the decision of the court of criminal appeal in the second set of criminal proceedings rejecting the request to release the toyota, pending the appeal proceedings, had been ‘unlawful’.1, the court held that the confiscation of the peugeot had been ordered by a final judgment of the court of criminal appeal in the first set of criminal proceedings and therefore there could be no doubt that the confiscation was in compliance with the law (article 3 of the ordinance).the cost of the appeal proceedings before the constitutional court filed by the applicants were to be borne in the proportion of one fifth by the applicants and four fifths by the ag, and the costs of the appeal proceedings before the constitutional court filed by the ag were to be borne by him.28.  in regard to the alleged violation of article 6 of the convention, the court noted that the fact that measures resulting from an act for which a third party (in this case m.) was prosecuted, affecting in an adverse manner the property rights of the applicants, could not in themselves lead to the conclusion that, during the course of the criminal proceedings complained of, any “criminal charge”, for the purpose of article 6, was brought against the applicants.
after the expiry of the statutory period for the authority’s reply, on 28 april 2015 the applicants wrote a letter to the mayor’s office stating that they considered the event of 6 may 2015 to have been approved by the mayor.11.  according to the records of transfer to the police station (протоколы доставления) and the administrative arrest records, the first applicant was brought to the police station at 7.40 p.m. on 6 may 2015 and placed under administrative arrest at the same time.the second applicant was taken to that same court on 7 may 2015 at 4.10 p.m. 13.  at the police stations both applicants were accused of organising and holding a group public event without notifying the authorities in advance, in breach of article 20.2 § 2 of the code of administrative offences (hereinafter “the cao”).the court reiterated the description of the administrative offence imputed to the first applicant, found the second applicant guilty under article 20.2 § 2 of the cao, and sentenced him to ten days’ detention.referring to the statutory definition of a “meeting” (the presence of people in a specific place in order to publicly express their opinions, essentially on social and political issues), the appellate court considered that some fifty people had been present in bolotnaya square, including the applicants, who had called on others to shout political slogans.
the record indicated that the applicant had been escorted to the police station at 9.55 a.m. and released at 12.20 p.m. on 1 september 2012. after that the on-duty officer compiled an administrative-offence record, according to which the applicant had used foul language at the premises of school no.17.  in november 2012 the applicant brought civil proceedings (in accordance with article 254 of the code of civil procedure) challenging the following actions on the part of the public authorities and officials: the police order to stop the demonstration and distribution of leaflets, in breach of his right to impart information; their recourse to physical force and use of handcuffs; taking him to the police station; and his prosecution under the cao.the court also relied on the statements of a representative of the regional department of the ministry of the interior in that regard, who had testified that the administrative-offence file against the applicant had been lost.19.  on the basis of several testimonies, the district court concluded as follows: “in the present case the police officers intended to put an end to the breach of public order, consisting of [showing] disrespect to society accompanied by the use of foul language in a public place [by the applicant], disturbing citizens in an insulting manner and refusing to obey an order by a public official ... the police officers ... acted within their powers and did not violate the applicant’s rights.furthermore, in the applicant’s view, the court had failed to specify the factual details concerning his showing of “disrespect to society”, the content and the alleged victims of the foul language allegedly used by him, the details of his “disturbing others” and “the order by a public official” and the lawfulness of any such order.
the court ordered the police to submit a video recording showing the events of 12 december 2010. by two judgments of 3 march 2011 the justice of the peace found that the applicants had held solo demonstrations and had not breached the public events act (hereinafter “the pea”), including its prior notification requirement applicable to group events.the administrative cases against the applicants were discontinued for lack of the elements of the offences under article 20.2 §§ 1 and 2 of the cao.by a judgment of 15 july 2011 the tsentralniy district court of kaliningrad found that taking the first applicant to the police station had been unlawful, and awarded him rub 10,000 (equivalent to 250 euros (eur) at the time) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.12.  the first applicant appealed against the judgment of 15 july 2011, complaining, inter alia, about the amount of the compensation and the first‑instance court’s failure to make specific findings in relation to the violation of his freedom of expression on account of the police intervention in his solo demonstration.relying on article 27.1 § 2 of the cao and article 1070 § 2 of the civil code, it ruled that it followed from the discontinuation of the cao case that placing the first applicant under administrative escort and arrest had been unlawful under russian law as well as “unjustified” (необоснованные).
6.  on 18 december 2009 the drochia district court found in favour of the applicant and ordered the defendant company to pay him 24,957 moldovan lei (mdl) (the equivalent of 1,413 euros (eur)) for pecuniary damage and mdl 749 (the equivalent of eur 42) for costs and expenses.9.  on 10 february 2010, in a different set of proceedings concerning the insolvency of the defendant company, the company’s insolvency administrator updated the list of creditors by making express reference to the judgment of 18 december 2009 and to the exact amounts awarded in that judgment.10.  on 26 april 2010 the insolvency administrator of the defendant company lodged an appeal against the judgment of 18 december 2009. the applicant objected to the appeal by arguing that it had been time-barred.he indicated that the time-limit for lodging the appeal had expired twenty days after the serving of the impugned judgment and that the insolvency administrator of the defendant company had been aware of the judgment of 18 december 2009 since in february 2010 he had informed the court dealing with the insolvency proceedings about the judgment in question.11.  on 28 september 2010 the bălţi court of appeal admitted the appeal lodged by the insolvency administrator of the defendant company and quashed the judgment of 18 december 2009. the court of appeal did respond to the objection raised by the applicant and, after re-examining the merits of the case, dismissed the applicant’s action against the defendant company.
6.  at the end of 2014 the russian television and radio network informed the private regional television company tv-2 that its contract for broadcast services would be cancelled as of 1 january 2015. at the same time, the federal service for the supervision of communications, information technology and mass media (роскомнадзор) did not renew the company’s broadcast licence, which was due to expire on 8 february 2015. as a result, tv-2, one of the leading channels in the tomsk region which had been reporting on everyday life in the region since 1990, stopped broadcasting at the beginning of 2015.the judge’s assistant later reported that the applicant had not studied the file for the hour which she had been given; instead, she had talked on the phone and chatted with the other people present in the courtroom.by a decision of 13 april 2015 the appellate court excluded the reference to the applicant being the organiser of the events, but upheld the remainder of the trial judgment.the court considered that the applicant had conspired with others to hold a static demonstration on 6 august 2014; the applicant had been the event organiser, and he had failed to give the authorities prior notification of the event.the appellate court noted that the available evidence did not confirm that the applicant had been the event organiser; however, he had still been a participant in the public assembly, an assembly of which the authorities had not been given notice.
the police station logbook indicated that the first applicant had been brought there at 4.20 p.m. and released at 6.30 p.m., and that the second applicant had been brought there at 4.45 p.m. and released at 6.45 p.m. 11.  at the police station both applicants were accused of organising and holding a public event without giving prior notification to the authorities, in breach of article 20.2 § 2 of the code of administrative offences (hereinafter “the cao”).22.  it appears that the appellate court heard further evidence from the witness o., who stated that around 3 p.m. on 15 september 2012 she had approached the lenin monument with the intention of expressing her views on the situation in the country; she had seen the applicant standing alone with a banner close to the monument.this refutes [the applicant’s] argument about her solo demonstration.” 25.  on 4 december 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint with the rostov regional prosecutor’s office, seeking the institution of criminal proceedings against the police officers under articles 149 and 286 of the criminal code (unlawful impediment to a public assembly and abuse of powers).29.  the justice of the peace found that the applicant had held a group public event together with three other participants and concluded that in the circumstances of the case it was appropriate to issue her with the minimum statutory fine of rub 20,000.she asked for the fine to be reduced to below the statutory minimum, in accordance with a ruling of the russian constitutional court made on 14 february 2013. on 6 march and 29 may 2013 the deputy president of the rostov regional court upheld the judgments, stating, in particular, that the amount of fine was “within the scope of the statutory requirement”.
7.  according to the decisions of the domestic courts, p., apparently a private individual recruited by the police as an undercover agent, was supplied with cash in front of attesting witnesses and, subsequently, out of their sight, made three purchases from the applicant and returned with syringes filled with opium, which he handed over to the police in the presence of the witnesses.at the opening of his subsequent trial the applicant admitted that at the time of his arrest he had had a drug-filled syringe in his sleeve and, in trying to get rid of the drug, had ejected the liquid over his sweater and had thrown it on the ground near him.the court found that the applicant had sold drugs to p. on three occasions in february and march 2007. the court relied on: (i) the in-court statements by the police officer who had arranged the test purchase and one of the attesting witnesses who had certified the records of that operation (see paragraph 7 above).the police officer gave largely similar evidence; (ii) written statements by p. and another police officer involved in the organisation of the test purchase, obtained at the pre-trial stage; (iii) the fact, documented in a police report, that a banknote used by the police for use in the test purchase had been found on the applicant at the time of arrest.the court of appeal went on to note that, in addition to the evidence cited by the trial court, the applicant’s guilt was also evidenced by the investigator’s report on the examination of the video recording of the test purchase (see paragraph 15 above).
1279-n approving the expropriation zones of territories situated within the administrative boundaries of the rural communities of shnogh and teghout in the lori region to be taken for state needs and changing the category of land use.according to the decree, armenian copper programme cjsc or teghout cjsc, founded by the former for the purpose of the implementation of the teghout copper-molybdenum deposit exploitation project, were to acquire the units of land listed in its annexes.he further submitted that the evaluation of his property had not been carried out correctly since no account had been taken of the number of fruit trees, their profitability and the existence of a fence and a water pipeline on the territory in question.14.  in the course of the proceedings, teghout cjsc submitted another evaluation report of the applicant’s property stating that, after the institution of the proceedings, oliver group llc had prepared a corrected report according to which the market value of the applicant’s plot of land was estimated at amd 137,000 (approximately eur 298).17.  on 19 march 2009 the civil court of appeal upheld the regional court’s judgment, finding that the latter had properly determined the market value of the property based on the corrected evaluation report prepared by oliver group cjsc.
1279-n approving the designation of territories situated within the administrative boundaries of the rural communities of shnogh and teghout in the lori region as expropriation zones, to be taken for state needs, thus changing the land use category.according to the decree, armenian copper programme cjsc or teghout cjsc, founded by the former for the purpose of the implementation of the teghout copper-molybdenum deposit exploitation project, were to acquire the units of land listed in its annexes.13.  in the proceedings before the lori regional court, the fourth applicant represented the other applicants and argued that the market value of their land had been underestimated.15.  during the proceedings teghout cjsc submitted another valuation of the applicants’ property, stating that oliver group llc had prepared a corrected report according to which the market value of the property was amd 900,000 (approximately eur 1,960).18.  on 29 january 2009 the civil court of appeal upheld the regional court’s judgment, finding, inter alia, that the market value of the property to be taken for state needs had been correctly estimated, on the basis of the valuation report contained in the case file.
14.  in the course of the proceedings teghout cjsc submitted another valuation report on the applicants’ property, stating that oliver group llc had prepared a corrected report according to which the market value of the land was amd 262,000 (approximately eur 570).21.  on 27 april 2009 the applicants’ counsel requested the regional court to order a forensic expert examination to determine the market value of the applicants’ plot of land, and to order that this examination was to be performed by experts of the state non-profit organisation “expertise center of the republic of armenia” (“հայաստանի հանրապետության փորձագիտական կենտրոն” պետական ոչ առևտրային կազմակերպություն).26.  according to the case file, on 10 july 2009 the notifications of the hearing of the court of appeal scheduled for 24 july 2009 were sent to the applicants, but they did not appear at that hearing.the court of appeal further found that the amount of compensation had been correctly determined, on the basis of the corrected valuation report prepared by oliver group llc, given that that report was the only lawful and acceptable piece of evidence produced during the proceedings.additionally, he requested to have the missed time-limits for lodging an appeal on points of law restored, explaining that the reason for late submission was the failure of the court of appeal to serve on him a copy of the decision of 7 august 2009, despite the fact that he was the applicants’ authorised representative in the proceedings.
6.  in november 2002, 14 years after receiving the vaccine, the applicant’s mother instituted proceedings on his behalf against four defendants; the local health authority, the state, the attorney general (collectively described in the domestic proceedings as the state defendants) and the doctor who had administered the vaccination, h. 7.  on 5 august 2003, the high court issued a limited order of discovery addressed to the local health authority seeking all relevant records about the applicant in its possession, as well as information about the vaccine used, about any adverse effects noted at the time with this vaccine, about the manner in which the mother’s consent was obtained, and about the health of the other members of the applicant’s family.8.  the applicant appealed the scope of the order of discovery of 5 august 2003, leading to the grant of a further limited order of discovery by the high court on 30 january 2004, addressed to all four defendants.the applicant brought another appeal against the order of discovery of 30 january 2004, but in july 2006 the supreme court dismissed the appeal, making only a minor amendment to the order granted by the high court.10.  in june 2008 the applicant’s lawyer wrote to the local health authority to complain that the long delays in litigating the case had caused grave prejudice to the case.in its conclusions, the court of appeal stated that, by taking the case at its highest, the trial judge had adopted the correct approach on the question of striking the case out.
the investigator also noted that u.m.’s bed had been made by other soldiers after u.m.’s transfer to the hospital and the floor of the dormitory had been cleaned with chlorine and kerosene in the morning before the beginning of the inspection.in particular, the following injuries were mentioned in the record: a blue-violet bruise (qançır) of an elongated shape, measuring 8 x 3 cm, on the right side of his lower back; a scratch (cızıq), measuring 0.8 x 0.1 cm, on the left side of his back; a subcutaneous haemorrhage (dəridaxili qansızma), measuring 5.5 x 1 cm, on his upper right hip; and two abrasions (sıyrıq), measuring 0.3 x 0.1 cm and 0.5 x 0.2 cm on the fingers of his left hand.21 on the forensic medical examination (meyitin məhkəmə-tibbi müayinəsi) of the body, which was considered as an annex to the record of 14 july 2010. the report was based on the examination of the body on 14 july 2014, as well as on the results of the biological and histological forensic examinations of the samples taken from the body and the opinions of two other specialists.k/82, which mainly reiterated the findings of the report of 12 august 2010. the experts concluded that u.m.’s death had probably resulted from severe dysfunction of the respiratory system caused by swelling of the thymus gland and the development of a brain tumour, because there was no potentially lethal injury on his body.relying on the forensic medical reports, the investigator concluded that the death had probably resulted from severe dysfunction of the respiratory system caused by swelling of the thymus gland and the development of a brain tumour.
according to the decree, armenian copper programme cjsc or teghout cjsc, founded by the former for the purpose of the implementation of the teghout copper-molybdenum deposit exploitation project, were to acquire the units of land listed in its annexes.10.  on an unspecified date teghout cjsc addressed a letter to the applicant containing an offer to buy his eight plots of land for 194,000 armenian drams (amd, approximately 422 euros (eur)), amd 422,000 (approximately eur 917), amd 417,000 (approximately eur 907), amd 555,000 (approximately eur 1,207), amd 328,000 (approximately eur 713), amd 426,000 (approximately eur 990), amd 409,000 (approximately eur 890), and amd 240,000 (approximately eur 522) respectively, plus an additional 15% on each amount offered as required by law, making the final offer amd 3,439,650 (approximately eur 7,478) in total.14.  in the course of the proceedings, teghout cjsc submitted other valuation reports in respect of the applicant’s property, stating that after the institution of the proceedings oliver group llc had prepared corrected reports according to which the market value of the applicant’s eight plots of land was estimated at respectively amd 187,000 (approximately eur 407), amd 456,000 (approximately eur 991), amd 437,000 (approximately eur 950), amd 535,000 (approximately eur 1,163), amd 343,000 (approximately eur 746), amd 411,000 (approximately eur 893), amd 427,000 (approximately eur 928), and amd 268,000 (approximately eur 583).the final amounts of compensation would therefore be equal to the amounts mentioned in the corrected reports for those plots of land valued higher than previously, and would stay the same as in the initial offer for the rest, together with the additional 15% required by law.17.  on 18 march 2009 the civil court of appeal upheld the regional court’s judgment, finding that the latter had properly determined the market value of the property on the basis of the corrected valuation reports prepared by oliver group cjsc.

19.  in regard to matters of procedure, the supreme administrative court noted that the concept of “criminal charge” had an autonomous meaning in the established case-law of the european court of human rights on article 6 § 1 of the convention, and that therefore certain sanctions imposed in administrative-law proceedings fell within the scope of article 6. the court stated that in the light of that case-law, the procedure for imposing a penalty payment under the restriction of competition act had to be considered to fall within the scope of article 6 (see jussila v. finland [gc], no.the court further noted that the court of justice of the european communities, when applying article 6 as a part of the general principles of community law, had held that the proceedings under community competition law had to comply with the requirements of article 6. the supreme administrative court, citing the case of jussila, considered that while article 6 of the convention under its criminal limb thus applied to proceedings imposing a penalty payment, in such cases the article 6 requirements were not necessarily identical to the requirements which were applicable in the core areas of criminal procedure.it further cited case-law of the court of justice of the european union according to which it is incumbent on the commission as competition authority to prove the infringements of competition rules and to adduce evidence capable of demonstrating to the requisite legal standard the existence of the circumstances constituting an infringement, and where such evidence had been presented the court was entitled to consider that it was for the defendant to provide another explanation for the incriminating circumstances.taking into account what is generally known about the functioning of cartels on the basis of earlier experience and research, the most credible explanation for the similarity between the events which had occurred in different regions and the observations made by the witnesses was that the asphalt companies had agreed about the territorial allocation of the asphalt markets in the whole of finland, as well as about the measures for implementing the agreed allocation in practice.26.  as to the applicant company’s participation in the cartel, the supreme administrative court held that: “(1274)  [o]n the basis of [the three witness] statements adduced before the market court and the supreme administrative court and the written evidence consisting of the [chart on the geographical division of the markets], it has been shown that [the applicant company] took part in the cartel, in particular in lapland and the north karelia region.
in his statement, which was fifteen pages long, the applicant admitted that he had become a member of the pkk/kadek in 1996 and gave a detailed account of all the activities he had carried out for that organisation since then, including the killing of m.y., opening fire on a police armoured vehicle during a demonstration organised in the aftermath of abdullah öcalan’s arrest, and receiving training at the organisation’s camp in iraq.12.  on 17 november 2003, the applicant underwent a further medical examination at the branch of the forensic medicine institute responsible for the istanbul state security court at 10.30 a.m. the doctor who examined the applicant also observed the same abrasion, adding that the applicant had told him that it had happened when he had hit the window.15.  on 4 december 2003 the public prosecutor at the istanbul state security court filed a bill of indictment with that court against the applicant and four other persons, charging the applicant with the offence of breaking up the unity of the state and seeking to remove part of the national territory from the state’s control, under article 125 of the former criminal code.34.  on 13 february 2009 the twelfth chamber of the istanbul assize court found the applicant guilty as charged, convicted him under article 125 of the former criminal code of breaking up the unity of the state and seeking to remove part of the national territory from the state’s control, and sentenced him to life imprisonment.36.  lastly, in the “conviction” part of its judgment, the trial court held that the applicant had been a member of an illegal organisation, had taken military training in its mountain camps, had participated in the demonstration on 16 february 1999 on behalf of that illegal organisation and had opened fire on a police vehicle, had been involved in the injury of five policemen on 20 february 1999, and that the three bullet casings found in the scene of that incident had been fired from the pistol that the applicant had used to kill m.y.
19.  on 18 november 2008 the kyiv shevchenkivskyy district court (hereinafter, “the local court”) quashed the decision of 16 september 2008. it held that, in the course of the inquiry, the investigating officer had failed to question the applicant and officer g., the police officer whom the applicant had pointed out.the court held that the investigating officer had failed to interrogate and/or properly analyse the statements of: - the people who had been detained with the applicant in the cell at the kyiv shevchenkivskyy district police station in february 2008; - the itt and sizo staff, in relation to the applicant’s alleged ill‑treatment and the sizo’s alleged refusal to admit him after the court had ordered his arrest; - the medical personnel from the emergency service who had provided the applicant with medical assistance in february 2008; - the surgeon from buchanska prison hospital who had performed an operation on the applicant on 20 january 2010; - the police officers who had arrested the applicant in vinnytsya on 9 february 2008.the court held that the investigating officer had failed to comply with the instructions given by the local court in its decision of 7 may 2013 (see paragraph 31 above), and in particular had failed to establish the origin of the injuries sustained by the applicant in february 2008.59.  on 9 november and 16 november 2009, in reply to the requests of the applicant’s lawyers concerning his hospitalisation, the sizo administration advised that it was not competent to decide on the applicant’s placement in an outside medical facility, and suggested that the lawyers should address the requests to the court dealing with the applicant’s case.64.  on 4 december 2009, in the light of additional information from the respondent government on the applicant’s state of health and the treatment provided to him in the sizo, the court decided to lift the interim measure under rule 39 of the rules of court (see paragraph 55 above).
the government did not specify the frequency of the treatment or the nature of the diet provided to the applicant.18.  according to the applicant, during his detention he submitted numerous applications to the domestic authorities, including the donetsk regional court of appeal (“the court of appeal”), seeking to obtain copies of various documents to be submitted to the court in substantiation of his application.on 2 october 2009 the court of appeal sent the requested copies to the applicant, but excluded copies of the court hearing records, on the ground that their transmission was not covered by the legislation that was applicable at that time.on 21 april 2011 the office of the government agent before the european court of human rights sent copies of the court hearing records to the applicant.21.  by letters dated 12 and 17 january 2017, the court of appeal refused the applicant’s applications for a copy of his request for an extension of the time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal against his conviction of 25 november 2004 and a copy of a court ruling of 26 october 2016 dismissing that request.
13.  in the course of the pre-trial investigation a certain t.v.s., who was apparently an employee of the applicant’s agency, stated that, on an unspecified date, apparently prior to p.’s complaint to the police, the applicant had asked her to show the premises in question to p. 14.  the attesting witnesses made formal statements to the investigating authority describing the events of 21 february 2002 which they had observed.16.  in the course of the trial the applicant pleaded not guilty and argued that the banknotes had been planted on the agency premises by the police, who had also smeared his hand and pocket with the luminescent substance to frame him.the court records submitted to the court show that the hearings were adjourned and rescheduled on at least thirty-three occasions due to the “witnesses’ failure to appear” (судовий розгляд відкладено у зв’язку з неявкою свідків) and that the trial court repeatedly requested the help of police and of the prosecutor’s office in locating and escorting the witnesses to the hearings.; audio and video evidence; police reports documenting the delivery of the marked banknotes to p. and their subsequent discovery, as well as the discovery of the luminescent substance on the applicant’s hand and pocket; statements of the police officers who had organised the investigative actions in question; the results of expert analysis confirming the discovery of the luminescent substance from the same source on the banknotes, on the applicant’s hand and in his pocket; and the applicant’s confession.22.  in his appeal on points of law to the supreme court the applicant stated that the witnesses had ignored summons to appear at the trial and the trial court had failed to ensure their presence.
10.  on 25 march 1998 the local authority entered into possession of the requisitioned plots of land and paid the compensation to the applicants, who only provisionally accepted the sum, while reserving their right to bring court proceedings against the requisition orders.it held that the local authority’s decision had been tainted by a procedural irregularity, in that the local authority’s notary (who had adopted the decision of 19 january 1998) should have abstained from taking a decision in a case in which the local authority employing him had been one of the interested parties.21.  on 14 june 2017 the kúria quashed the final judgment and remitted the case to the budapest administrative and labour court for the recalculation of the compensation amount.it held that the method of assessing the valuations applied in the first-instance judgment could not be used in the context of the case; instead, the amount to be paid should be calculated by an expert on the basis of the properties’ market values on 10 january 2015, from which the compensation already received in 1998 (see paragraph 10 above) should be deducted.at the date of the latest information available to the court (2 october 2018), the proceedings concerning the amount of compensation due to the applicants were still pending before the domestic courts.
10.  on 16 july 1992 the military pension fund for the armed forces of the sfry (hereinafter “the ypa fund”) found the applicant to be entitled to an early retirement pension under sfry military rules as from 1 may 1992. the applicant maintained that he had never received any pension from the ypa fund.by a decision of 18 february 1993 the pension and disability insurance institute of slovenia (hereinafter “the institute”) refused the applicant’s application, finding that he had not fulfilled the conditions for pension entitlement under sfry military rules, namely the age requirement, by 18 october 1991 (section 2(1)(2) of the ordinance).13.  on 4 february 1994 the court of associated labour of the republic of slovenia dismissed his claim, holding that the applicant had not fulfilled the conditions under section 2(1)(2) of the ordinance (see paragraph 22 below) because he had not reached the required retirement age by 18 october 1991. the court emphasised that there had been nothing to suggest that the applicant had participated in aggression against slovenia as a member of the ypa (section 2(2) of the ordinance).15.  on 12 august 1999 the institute dismissed the appeal, holding that the applicant had not fulfilled the statutory requirements under the 1998 act because he had not continuously had permanent resident status in slovenia for the relevant period and had failed to claim his pension rights by 25 june 1991 (section 2(1)(2) of the 1998 act).19.  the applicant appealed, arguing that he should have been granted the pension as from 1 may 1992. on 3 november 2003 the institute dismissed his appeal, holding that the applicant had been entitled to an old-age pension under the general rules and section 2(4) of the 1998 act as from 4 february 2003 – when he had acquired slovenian citizenship.
8.  the government admitted that the applicants had been injured on the day of the incident, but submitted that they had sustained all the injuries either as a result of falling from a prison wall that was under construction at the time or as a result of the necessary physical force to which the prison officers had had to have recourse in order to effect their arrest.9.  on the day of the incident the investigation department of the then ministry of corrections and legal aid (“the ministry of prisons”) opened a criminal investigation into the circumstances of the applicants’ attempted escape.on the same date, the investigator commissioned an expert from the national forensic bureau who visually examined all those injured and issued reports in respect of the first, second and third applicants as well as the prison officers on 7 april 2009 and in respect of the fourth applicant on 16 april 2009. the examinations of the applicants were conducted in the presence of the investigator.14.  it was observed that the fourth applicant had multiple haematomas on the chest, right elbow, and below the left eye; abrasions on the forehead and knee; a scratch on the right thigh; and a laceration which was slightly bleeding on the crown of the head.18.  on 10 november 2009 all the applicants, except for the fourth one, complained to the chief prosecutor of georgia of ill-treatment on 30 march 2009 and requested the initiation of criminal proceedings in line with the requirements of article 3 of the convention.
5.  the list of applicants and the relevant details of the applications are set out in the appended table.8.  on 14 november 2008 the brașov county court ordered the municipality of brașov to leave a plot of land in the applicant’s full property and possession.9.  on 3 april 2009 the applicant signed a report, drafted on the occasion of the compulsory enforcement of the above judgment, which attested to the restoration of his possession over the land in dispute by placement of metal bars on the free area and by tracing a line with white paint over the area occupied by roads and bridge pillars belonging to the municipality.11.  on 22 august 2011 the bank sold the land at a public auction for eur 325,000, since the applicant had failed to repay the loan within the set deadline.in accordance with domestic law, the remaining amount after the recovery of the debt must be returned to the debtor.
21.  as the first applicant’s family had no information about his place of detention following his administrative conviction, his lawyer sent numerous letters and telegrams to the mns, the prosecutor general’s office, the ministry of internal affairs and the court of appeal asking for information about the first applicant’s place of detention.the part of the complaint concerning the first applicant’s ill-treatment reads as follows: “it appeared from the submissions that he [the first applicant] made to his representative in the presence of the investigator on 17 february 2007 that, although he had not officially asked for medical aid, he suffered from hypertension, prostatitis and poor eyesight.... n. mammadov had been threatened on several occasions and had been given false information according to which his two sons had also been arrested and detained in the next cells and his wife had been hospitalised on account of a serious heart disease ... although the application and request of his wife and representative concerning the violence against n. mammadov had been addressed to the prosecutor general’s office, those complaints had been sent first to the yasamal district prosecutor’s office and the baku city prosecutor’s office, and then again to the prosecutor general’s office.they were dealt with with delay on purpose so that the visible trace of injuries to the index finger of his right hand would disappear and recover; and the forensic examination had been ordered only in april 2007.” 27.  on 18 october 2007 the sabail district court, which examined the action under the procedure established by articles 449-51 of the code of criminal procedure concerning appeals against the prosecuting authorities’ actions and decisions, dismissed it without addressing any of the first applicant’s particular complaints.43.  on 5 march 2008, following a request from the first applicant’s lawyer, a judge at the assize court asked the mns to inform the court, inter alia, whether the first applicant had been on the premises of the mns on 2, 3 and 9 february 2007, whether he had been questioned on the premises of the mns on 9 february 2007, and whether he had been subjected to a medical examination and what his diagnosis had been.
prior to being taken to the investigator, the applicant was transferred back to sambir police station in the late evening on 7 february 2008. there he was taken to the sambir temporary detention centre (“the sambir itt”) where he drafted a statement that he had not been beaten by the police and that his foot pain had been caused by accidently twisting his foot on the stairs.the court thus concluded that “the applicant had made his confessions to the police on 7 february 2008 at sambir police station before the physical injuries had been inflicted on him.” the allegations of the applicant’s co-defendants as to their ill‑treatment by the police were also dismissed by the trial court.the prosecutors then relied on the testimony of the officers and on the statements the applicant had made on 7 and 12 february 2008. they also noted the fact that the applicant had remained silent during a court hearing on the application of a preventive measure in respect of him.46.  on 28 october 2008 the experts’ report answered those questions as follows: the applicant did sustain a fracture of the fifth metatarsus bone of his right foot; the injury could have been caused at the beginning of february 2008, as suggested by the applicant, but it was not possible to state with precision the particular date of infliction; the injury originated from a blunt object and could be classified as “light” in terms of severity; such a fracture would normally be caused by a direct impact on the bone either by inflicting a blow with a blunt object or by falling on the foot from a height, but in the applicant’s case it most likely originated from a blow to his foot with a blunt object such as a wooden stool leg or a wooden bar; the particularities of the applicant’s injury which could be observed on the x‑ray images were not typical of an accidental twisting of the foot; and the last question could not be answered.according to the report, the applicant had a fracture of the fifth metatarsus bone of his right foot which, given the absence of external injuries in the area of the fracture, could have been sustained without the application of external force to the applicant, for example by twisting the foot while walking or running.
that plea followed a ruling by the district judge that he had no power to stay the proceedings as an abuse of process on the grounds advanced by the applicant; namely, that the powers given to the police under schedule 7 had infringed her rights under articles 5, 6 and 8 of the convention and her right to freedom of movement between member states of the european union under articles 20 and 21 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union.as the respondent accepted that there had been an interference with the applicant’s rights, and the applicant accepted that the interference was “in order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law”, the only issue to be determined was whether the interference was “lawful”, and the conclusions in respect of article 8 had determined that it was.in particular, they had regard to the restriction of the power to those passing in and out of the country; the restriction to the statutory purpose; the restriction to specially trained and accredited police officers; the restrictions on the duration of questioning; the restrictions on the type of search; the requirement to give explanatory notice to those questioned, including a procedure for complaint; the requirement to permit consultation with a solicitor and the notification of a third party; the requirement for records to be kept; the availability of judicial review; and the continuous supervision of the independent reviewer.29.  lords hughes and hodge further accepted that the interference with the applicant’s private life had been proportionate: the intrusion itself had been comparatively light, as it was not beyond the reasonable expectations of those who travel across the united kingdom’s international borders, and, in view of the relevant safeguards, a fair balance could be said to have been struck between the rights of the individual and the rights of the public at large.in particular, he observed that no authorisation was required for an examining officer to have resort to the schedule 7 powers; the examining officer did not have to consider the use of those powers expedient for the prevention of acts of terrorism; there was no geographical or temporal limitation on the use of those powers, other than that they were to be used at a port of entry into or exit from the united kingdom; and there was no provision for their automatic lapse, nor was there any question of their renewed authorisation being subject to confirmation.
all the applicants offered their services on the territory of a private marketplace (l.) situated in the centre of leova and which had received its licence in 1996. the local authorities authorised the offering of services on the territory of l. from monday to saturday.8.  on 4 april 2005 the general meeting of entrepreneurs (including the applicants) expressed its disagreement with the decision of 2 march 2005. on the same day the 191 entrepreneurs working on the territory of l., including the applicants, declared a strike and decided to submit an official request for a change in their work schedule.11.  on 6 april 2005 the leova city council discussed at its meeting the demands of the entrepreneurs and of l.’s administration, made in their request of 4 april 2005. according to the applicants, l.’s director was allowed to address the councillors and spoke about the applicants’ demands.13.  on 28 may 2005 the 191 entrepreneurs, including the applicants, lodged administrative court proceedings, asking for the annulment of the decision of 2 march 2005. they argued that their rights had been affected by that decision and that its aim was the protection of u.’s interests.they annexed copies of the preliminary request addressed to the mayoralty, of their complaint made on 4 april 2005 to the leova city council, and of the reply of the mayor’s office of 12 may 2005 (see the preceding paragraph).
8.  on 18 july 2013 the organised crime prosecution in serbia opened an investigation in respect of the applicant and several other persons in relation to the murder of x. the investigation order implied that the applicant had arranged the murder of x as he had considered x’s brother responsible for the murder of his own brother.the reasoning was the same as before: there was reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the said criminal offence; if released he could influence the witnesses, given that the investigation was ongoing and several witnesses were yet to be heard; the statutory penalty for the said criminal offence was ten years’ imprisonment or more, which offence was particularly grave in view of its motive – revenge – and its consequence – x’s death; and there were exceptional circumstances indicating that his release would seriously threaten public peace and order given that the media had extensively reported on the murder of x.it also held that what was relevant for the lawfulness of the applicant’s further detention was that the indictment should be issued within six months, which had been complied with given that the investigation had begun on 9 april 2014 and the indictment had been issued on 7 october 2014. it was of no relevance that the indictment had been returned, or that it had been issued for two criminal offences whereas the applicant’s detention had been extended relying on only one of the two.he submitted, inter alia, that: (a) the courts had failed to review his detention and issue a relevant decision within 30 days; (b) his detention had already lasted for more than eight months without the indictment having entered into force even though it was statutorily limited to six months; (c) the decisions extending his detention had been insufficiently reasoned, the reasoning having been identical, merely copied from one decision to another, and the reasons set out in the first detention order could no longer suffice.the court took into account the length of detention thus far, the fact that the indictment had been returned for the third time, and that it was uncertain when and if at all it would come into force, and held that the applicant should not bear the consequences of that.
25.  on 26 september 2013 a meeting was held between the parties on the subject of the first applicant’s and n.b.’s communication with the child with the participation of the krasnenkaya rechka municipal entity, the childcare authorities, the children’s rights commissioner in st petersburg, the prosecutor’s assistant of the district prosecutor’s office, an expert specialising in conflict resolution and a psychologist of the district centre for social assistance to the family and children.an oral agreement was reached between ms z. and the first applicant to the effect that the latter’s meetings with the child were to take place on 5 october and 12 october 2013 for two hours in the presence of ms z. on 1 november 2013 ms z. and the first applicant were to come to the office of the children’s rights commissioner for a debriefing on the meetings.as regards the second applicant’s argument to the effect that the child’s adoption had led to the termination of all contact between her and the grandparents, the city court stated, relying on article 67 §§ 1 and 2 of the family code, that the grandfather, grandmother, brothers, sisters and other relatives have a right to contact with the child and that in the event of a refusal by the child’s parents to afford them such contact, they are entitled to apply to a court to have the obstacles to their contact with the child eliminated.the pushkinskiy district court therefore ordered mr and ms z. not to place obstacles in the way of the first applicant’s communication with m. and held that contact between the first applicant and m. should take place as follows: during the first six months after the finalisation of the judgment – each second and fourth sunday of the month from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. outside the parents’ and the grandparents’ places of residence in the presence of the parents, and thereafter on the same conditions without the parents present.48.  on 1 december 2015 the district court held that since the adoption judgment of 26 november 2013 did not contain an indication as to the continuation of family ties between the second applicant and his granddaughter after the adoption, the former did not have a right to claim the elimination of obstacles to contact with the child and determination of the terms of his contact with his granddaughter.
he was able to part with such a ‘promising’ employee only after the prosecutor of the region had made an official request to this end...” 7.  on 28 july 2006 the administration of the kostroma region and v.sh., governor of the kostroma region, lodged defamation claims with the leninskiy district court of kostroma (“the district court”) against the publisher of the kostroma chronometer and the applicant, seeking retraction of certain statements and claiming compensation in respect of non‑pecuniary damage.the claimants challenged, in particular, the following statements: “in the midst of the corruption scandals rocking the region, ‘the red house’ is trying to save face at all costs” and “[i]n spite of the serious nature of the criminal charges brought against his deputy, the governor tried to shield his subordinate at all costs, attempting to uphold the honour of the regiment”.the judgment read, in so far as relevant, as follows: “analysing the article’s contents as a whole and the information therein disputed by the claimants, the court concludes that ... the expression ‘to save face’ referring to the corruption scandals in the region and endeavours of the administration of the kostroma region is not defamatory for the reason that the criminal prosecution of the heads of the region’s executive bodies and unitary enterprises was a known fact.accordingly, the [defamation] claims of the governor of the kostroma region regarding the protection of his honour, dignity and business reputation are well‑founded in law and should be granted.” 9.  the applicant and the editor-in-chief of the newspaper appealed against the judgment to the kostroma regional court (“the regional court”) referring, inter alia, to the fact that the impugned statements represented value judgments which had a strong factual basis in the form of the governor’s petition to judge m. the administration of the kostroma region also appealed.its reasoning included the following: “when deciding on the claims brought by the governor of the kostroma region, the [district] court reasonably concluded that the defendants had not proven in the course of the hearing that the governor had tried to shield his subordinate by all means and in every manner, that is, at all costs, in order to uphold ‘the honour of the regiment’.
14.  during the two years which followed, investigators of the zyuzinskiy district investigation unit of the investigative committee for moscow carried out a pre-investigation inquiry and issued refusals to open a criminal case (dated 14 september 2007, 24 february 2008 and 2 may 2009) pursuant to article 24 § 1 (1) or (2) of the ccrp, either because there was no evidence that a crime had been committed or because none of the elements of a crime under article 286 § 3 of the criminal code (abuse of powers with use of violence) were present in respect of the actions of police officers a.a. and m. in doing so they relied on the police officers’ and investigator a.i.’s explanations denying any wrongdoing.15.  according to explanations by the police officers received during the pre‑investigation inquiry, on 16 june 2007 they took the applicant – who according to operative information had committed a robbery – to the police station, where an “explanation” was received from him concerning the crime, without any physical or psychological pressure being exerted on him.on 15 january 2008 the investigator’s refusal of 14 september 2007 was overruled on the grounds that it had been premature and based on an incomplete inquiry, as it did not contain an explanation of the applicant’s injuries.18.  the applicant appealed against the investigator’s decisions of 24 february 2008 and 2 may 2009. his appeal against the former decision was not examined by domestic courts, which terminated the proceedings in view of the annulment of the decision by the investigating authority (decision of 24 april 2009 of the gagarinskiy district court of moscow, as upheld on 28 october 2009 by the moscow city court).23.  the government submitted statements collected by lieutenant colonel s. from the internal security department of the ministry of internal affairs in moscow on 17 november 2016 from police officer m. and investigator a.i., in which both m., presently a senior operational police officer of the criminal search department for the south-west administrative circuit of moscow, and a.i., presently an investigator of the department for the fight against organised crime for the south-west administrative circuit of moscow, denied any unlawful conduct and ill‑treatment in respect of the applicant after the applicant’s arrest in 2007.
9.  in reply to an investigator’s question whether the injuries could have been self-inflicted, the expert stated that the injuries were within the reach of the applicant’s hands, except for the injuries on the back, which could have been received as a result of the applicant being struck by or striking himself against a blunt object with a limited striking surface (the expert’s “explanations” of 26 june 2009).when he was brought back at 9 p.m. that day (after being examined at the orel regional hospital where he was diagnosed with contusions to the soft tissues of the head and abrasions to the face) he complained about headache and had abrasions on the forehead and on the back, explaining that he had received them at the severnyy district police station.they stated that they had arrested the applicant in the night time on suspicion of having committed the crimes, that in the course of the arrest they had tripped the applicant up, twisted his hand behind his back and handcuffed him since he had tried to escape, and that they had interviewed him at the severnyy district police department before the arrival of an investigator next morning to draw up an official record of his arrest.according to statements by the applicant’s girlfriend, she heard the applicant screaming from being allegedly beaten up during his arrest and at the police station; several days later at the police station he had complained to her that police officers had beaten him up; he had had abrasions on the face; and he had lost consciousness during a confrontation between them and the ambulance had been called.16.  the most recent refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers of 29 october 2010 maintained the findings made in the previous refusals (for example, the refusal of 26 june 2009) that the police had lawfully applied force during the applicant’s arrest, that the applicant had attempted to inflict injuries on himself, which was coherent with the forensic medical expert’s conclusion that the injuries, except for the injuries on the back, had been within the reach of his hands.
14.  meanwhile, on 25 april 2006 the applicant brought a complaint against the investigator under article 125 of the code of criminal procedure of the russian federation (which provides for judicial review of decisions of investigators that might infringe the constitutional rights of participants in the proceedings or prevent a person’s access to court) challenging the lawfulness of his arrest, which had not been based on a judicial decision, and the investigator’s failure to bring charges against him within the required time-limit.17.  in the meantime, on 18 may 2006 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 18 july 2006. the district court found that the grounds for the applicant’s detention persisted and that there existed a risk that the applicant might abscond during the investigation or trial, as he had been on the wanted list for several years prior to his arrest.20.  on 16 august 2006 the regional court upheld the above extension order, noting that it was of no importance that the initial detention order had been issued by the investigator in 2000. it referred to the fact that before the entry into force of the code of criminal procedure of the russian federation in july 2002, it had been lawful for a prosecutor to issue detention orders in a criminal case.28.  on the same day officers of the special police force of the chief directorate of the ministry of the interior of russia for perm region (“the omon”) and investigators from the department of the interior of the sverdlovskiy district of perm planned the applicant’s arrest.59.  on 29 november 2012, following the communication of the complaint to the government, the head of the investigation department of the investigation committee at the russian federation’s prosecutor’s office for the sverdlovsk region quashed the decision of 18 april 2009 as premature.
this clarification was widely disseminated by different sources: in particular, the national press agency (ansa) issued a number of press releases on 17 february 2007 clarifying the events; the television news bulletins broadcast by rai2 and rai3 (italy’s public national television channels) reported that the news concerning the alleged pressure on the teenager was false; the newspapers corriere della sera and la repubblica reported the facts of the case in the same vein.14.  in a judgment of 26 january 2009, filed in the relevant registry on 20 march 2009, the district court found the applicant guilty of omesso controllo, as far as the article drafted by a. m. was concerned, and of aggravated defamation since, as head of the newspaper, he was responsible for the article published under the pseudonym “dreyfus”.the court of appeal thus increased the penalty to one year and two months’ imprisonment, and upheld the fine of eur 5,000. the court of appeal did not suspend the enforcement of the penalty and decided to record the conviction on the applicant’s criminal record.19.  in a judgment of 26 september 2012, deposited in the relevant registry on 23 october 2012, the court of cassation upheld the court of appeal’s findings, assessing, inter alia, the compatibility of the conviction and the sentence imposed in the light of the case-law of the court.in particular, the imposition of the detention measure had been justified by a set of concurrent factors, such as the existence of the aggravating circumstance of “imputing a specific fact”; the applicant’s personality, his criminal record (the applicant being a recidivist) and the fact that the publication of false information had undermined the reputation of g.c., a member of the judiciary.
and others, with whom he had close ties, at around 3 p.m. in the seaside park, [he] blatantly breached public order by making a video recording of continued and repetitive immoral actions ... in respect of a bronze statue of an old man ... and of intentionally chaotic hand and foot movements (qərəzli xaotik əl-qol hərəkətləri) carried out after having stripped to the waist, and [he] manifestly failed to comply with lawful requests [made by] public officials, ... [namely] the security officers of the seaside park department and police officers [and others] that he desist from the above‑mentioned actions, [which breached public order; [he] resisted by [insolently refusing] to cease his actions (müstəsna həyasızlıqla öz hərəkətlərini dayandırmaması ilə müqavimət göstərərək); [he] prepared video footage amounting to 6.16 megabytes from a video recording depicting actions against the ethical principles of the society in which he lives and on 1 march 2013 widely disseminated it by uploading it to the youtube website under the title of “harlem shake – park bulvar” ... through these actions, ilkin bakir oglu rustamzade committed criminal offences under articles 221.2.1 and 221.2.2 of the criminal code of the republic of azerbaijan.the prosecutor justified his request by citing the gravity of the charges against the applicant and the fact that there was a risk of his absconding and obstructing the investigation’s functioning by influencing other participants in the criminal proceedings.the court cited the risk of his absconding and reoffending, together with the nature of the criminal act, and justified its decision as follows: “having examined the request with the [aid of the] material in the case file and having heard the submissions of those who have been present at this court hearing, and taking into account the fact that there is a likelihood that the accused, ilkin bakir oglu rustamzade, will abscond from the investigation and reoffend, as well as the nature of the criminal act attributed to him, the court considers that he should be remanded in custody.” 15.  on 20 may 2013 the applicant appealed against that decision, submitting that there had been no justification for the application of the preventive measure of detention pending trial.21.  on 15 july 2013 the nasimi district court extended the applicant’s detention pending trial until 17 september 2013. the court substantiated the need for the extension by citing the likelihood that, if released, the applicant might abscond or obstruct the investigation by influencing those participating in the criminal proceedings.24.  following a request dated 10 september 2013 by the prosecutor in charge of the case for an extension of the period of the applicant’s pre-trial detention, on 11 september 2013 the nasimi district court extended the applicant’s detention pending trial by two months, until 17 november 2013. the court justified its decision by citing the need for additional time in which to carry out further investigative measures and the fact that the grounds for the applicant’s pre-trial detention had not changed.
20.  on 3 may 2007 the charges against the applicant were reclassified under articles 127.2.1 ((deliberate infliction of less serious harm (az ağır zərər) to health, in connection with the victim’s performance of his professional or public duties)), 127.2.3 (deliberate infliction of less serious harm to health, in a publicly dangerous way and with hooligan intent) and 221.2.2 (hooliganism accompanied by resistance to a state official or other person carrying out duties in protection of public order or prevention of breaches of public order) of the criminal code.the description of the acts for which the applicant was found guilty read as follows: “at 12.30 p.m. on 16 march 2007 at [the national assembly’s address] [the applicant], while making a speech during a plenary session [of the national assembly], in breach of parliamentary ethics used rude and insulting expressions violating human dignity and honour despite a warning and a call to order [by the speaker of the national assembly] in accordance with articles 45 and 46 [of the national assembly’s internal regulations.]’s health and disrupted the conduct of the plenary session [of the national assembly] for twenty minutes.” 24.  it is evident from the judgment that, in finding the applicant guilty, the court relied on the following evidence: the testimony of f.a.in addition, the applicant argued that the trial court had relied on the prosecution’s distorted version of the events rather than examining the video footage of the incident which showed that he had not been the instigator of the fight.it appears from the transcript of the hearing that the applicant applied to have the court ensure f.a.’s presence at the appeal hearing and examine the videotape of the incident.
67.  on 2 july 2008 and 13 april 2009 the applicants contacted the chechen president and the head of the chechen parliament’s committee for the search for missing persons respectively, asking for their assistance in the search for their missing relative.kham., the uncle of mr alikhan satuyev, who was working as a judge at the time, found out that alikhan satuyev had been taken to the oktyabrskiy temporary district department of the interior (“the oktyabrskiy vovd”) by the head of its criminal search department.the neighbours learnt from officers who had been manning the checkpoint on the night of the abduction that an apc had indeed parked at the checkpoint during the night, and at some point a group of military servicemen had arrived with a young man, barefoot and undressed, had put him into the apc and had driven off.161.  on 16 and 25 june 2005, 15 september 2008 and 20 april 2009 the applicant contacted the grozny town prosecutor, the chechen parliament, the russian investigative committee and the head of the chechen parliament, seeking their assistance in the search for her son.177.  on 22 february 2012 the ngo materi chechni contacted the head of the chechen parliament’s committee for the search for missing persons on the applicant’s behalf, seeking assistance in the search for mr zelimkhan dutayev.
the four men arrived at the fishing spot in the vaz-2107 car of mr z. three of them then went to the other side of the pond (in the documents submitted also referred to as a “lake”), while the applicant’s husband fished near the car.20.  from the documents submitted it transpires that following the applicant’s complaint, on 22 january 2007 a prosecutor from the chechnya prosecutor’s office requested that the investigators inform him of the reasons for the suspension of the criminal proceedings and the theories they had examined in order to identify the perpetrators; he also requested the entire contents of the relevant criminal case file.inter alia, the list stipulated that: amongst other things, for the followings steps: “... it is necessary to: 7.  send requests to the law-enforcement agencies asking for their assistance in identifying the perpetrators of or witnesses to the crime; 24.  on 5 october 2009 the investigators informed the applicant that the investigation in the criminal case had been suspended on 2 june 2006 for failure to identify the perpetrators.30.  on 10 and 13 december 2009 the applicant again wrote to the investigators and the chechen prosecutor’s office asking for information about the progress in the investigation and the outcome of the examination of her previous request, and complaining that she had not been kept informed about progress in the proceedings.55.  on 17 april 2015 the investigators’ supervisor ordered that a number of steps be taken, including the questioning again of the witness who had seen the apcs in the vicinity of the crime scene on the day of the incident.
the letter read: “... in order to rectify the deficiencies identified, it has been recommended that the management of the kherson regional office of the state department for the enforcement of sentences ensure that there is adequate natural light and artificial ventilation in the premises in which you are detained, and ensure that the outdoor walks, medical care and nutrition arrangements, as well as the choice of foodstuffs and articles of daily necessity [available] in the prison shop, comply with the legal requirements.” 13.  in 2010-14 major repairs were carried out in the prison, causing inmates inconvenience such as noise, dust and the smell of paint.in may and july 2014 the kherson regional office (“the regional office”) of the state department for the enforcement of sentences (“the prison department”) replied to her that it was a statutory security measure, of which life prisoners were aware, and that the applicant’s intimacy had not been violated given that the video camera, which was indeed placed above the toilet area, did not cover the toilet itself.specifically, prisoners were served daily: 450 g of bread, 85 g of cereals, 540 g of potatoes, 550 g of vegetables, 300 g of fruit, 21 g of oil, 200 g of fruit juice, 50 g of butter, 500 g of milk, 100 g of cottage cheese, 15 g of cheese, 1 egg, 30 g of sour cream, 310 g of chicken meat, 110 g of fish, 60 g of sugar, 5 g of honey, 40 g of sweets, 4 g of chicory, 3 g of coffee, and 1 g of tea.the standard practice was that the prison ordered the required first and second-line drugs from the central procurement service of the prison department at the end of each year for the entire year to follow.46.  on 20 january 2012 the regional office of the prison department wrote to the applicant’s lawyer stating that the applicant was receiving treatment in accordance with the prescribed regimen in its entirety, but that he was demonstrating a negative attitude to his treatment and often refused to follow it.
the supreme court then emphasised that this was even more important when the law stipulates that the assessment report of the committee limits the powers of the minister and prohibits him or her from appointing a candidate to the post of judge that the committee has considered not to be the most qualified, unless the minister receives the consent of parliament.34.  the supreme court thus found, on the basis of the file and the facts before it, that the minister of justice had violated section 10 of the administrative procedures act for failing to substantiate her proposal to parliament with an independent investigation shedding light on elements necessary to assess the merits of the four candidates she had proposed, in comparison to the fifteen candidates considered by the committee as the most qualified.50/2016, as well as temporary provision iv of the same act, however with the exception that during the parliamentary procedure on the minister of justice’s proposals on the appointment of the judges, the requirements of the second paragraph of the temporary provision were not followed in that the parliament should have voted on each and every judge separately, but not all the judges at the same time, as was in fact done.in this regard, it must also, in particular, be emphasised that it cannot be accepted, as was argued in the aforementioned memorandum of the minister of justice of 30 may 2017, that by only increasing the weight ascribed to judicial experience from that which such experience was ascribed by the evaluation committee in its internal table, relied upon in its assessment report of the 19th of the same month, but relying in other respects on the ‘sufficient investigation’ of the committee as to each assessment factor, the finding could be made that four named candidates for the post of judge in the court of appeal, but not others, would be removed from the group of the fifteen most qualified, and four specific named candidates would be moved up into that group rather than others.when assessing the consequences of the said flaws in the minister of justice’s procedure, account must be taken of the fact that the appointment of all the fifteen judges of the court of appeal for an indefinite term, which in no way has been annulled by a court, became a reality upon the signing of their letters of appointment, dated 8 june 2017. as stated above, all of them fulfilled the requirements of section 21 (2) of act no.
9.  by a judgment of 27 february 2009 the riga regional court quashed the decision of 1 december 2008. it found that the applicant had committed an offence under article 14915(4) of the code of administrative offences and imposed the following penalties: fifteen days’ administrative detention; a fine of 500 lats (lvl – approximately 685 euros (eur)); a two-year driving ban; and a ban on obtaining a licence to operate recreational crafts for two years.16.  on 23 september 2009 the police drew up an administrative offence report stating that the applicant had driven a car while disqualified and that the offence had been committed repeatedly within a year, in violation of article 1494(7) of the code of administrative offences (hereinafter “the repeat offence”).18.  the applicant appealed against this judgment arguing (i) that the judgment of 27 february 2009 was unlawful and (ii) that the repeated nature of the offence could not be established, as his appeal concerning the administrative offence report of 31 july 2009 (relating to the initial offence) was still pending.the only criterion for determining the repeated nature of the offence was whether or not the decision on the initial offence had been set aside or its legal effect suspended at the time the decision on the repeat offence was being taken.accordingly, the appeal lodged against the decision concerning the offence of 31 july 2009 (the initial offence) did not preclude the offence under consideration being classified as a repeat offence and the proceedings being concluded while that appeal was still pending.
the relevant decision stated that having examined the inquiry file (მოკვლევის მასალები) in respect of the applicant, who was suspected of possession and use of narcotic substances, the police officer had decided, under, inter alia, articles 290, 321, and 325 of the code of criminal procedure of georgia (“the ccp”) (as cited in paragraph 37 below), that a personal search of the applicant should be conducted for the purpose of seizing any unlawful substances.11.  on what appears to be the same date (the document is not dated) the head of the relevant district police department wrote a report to the tbilisi gldani-nadzaladevi district prosecutor, informing him of the personal search of the applicant that had taken place at 5.45 p.m. on 4 july 2004. according to that note, the relevant investigative measure had been conducted in urgent circumstances in the absence of a judicial warrant and before the initiation of criminal proceedings.14.  according to the case-file, the prosecutor’s request to have the personal search of the applicant legalised, as submitted to the court, included neither a copy of the decision ordering the search in urgent circumstances nor the inquiry file in respect of the applicant (see paragraph 8 above).it concluded: “having reviewed the reasoning of the request, [the court] consider[s] that the personal search of archil kobiashvili was conducted because of an exigent need, in compliance with the rules of criminal procedural legislation and that there is a legal basis for granting [the request].” the procedure was conducted in writing and the applicant was not allowed to submit his observations regarding the circumstances of the search.in support of his argument he referred to the fact that the decision to conduct a personal search had not been duly signed by a senior investigator, had not indicated the exact time at which it had been issued, and had included detailed information about the identity of the applicant, including his name and address, and the type of narcotic substance, heroin, that he allegedly had on his person, facts which had become known to the police only after the arrest and search of the applicant.
10.  in july 2006 the tezepir mosque lodged a claim against the applicant with the yasamal district court, asking that the applicant be dispossessed of her title to the flat in exchange for monetary compensation, and be evicted from the flat.the tezepir mosque argued that the area where the applicant’s flat was located was within the area of works required for the renovation and development of the mosque complex, and that the applicant and her family were the only residents who had refused to relinquish their flat in exchange for the compensation offered to them.it also referred to an order by the soviet of ministers of the azerbaijan soviet socialist republic (“the azerbaijan ssr”) dated 22 may 1986 (hereinafter “the order of 22 may 1986”), concerning renovation work on the land of the tezepir mosque and the relocation of people residing in that area to other accommodation.m. it also took note of the tezepir mosque’s submissions that, despite the fact that the applicant had purchased a flat which was located on land already allocated to the mosque and that she had subsequently carried out renovation and construction work in the flat “without obtaining rights to the land” and “without authorisation”, the mosque had offered to pay her usd 100,000, an amount which exceeded the flat’s market value.14.  by a judgment of 2 august 2006, the yasamal district court revoked the applicant’s title to the flat, ordered the tezepir mosque to pay her the equivalent of usd 100,000 in azerbaijani manats, and ordered the eviction of the applicant and her family from the flat.
1279-n approving the designation of territories situated within the administrative boundaries of the rural communities of shnogh and teghout in the lori region as expropriation zones, to be taken for state needs, thus changing the category of land use.according to the decree, armenian copper programme cjsc or teghout cjsc, founded by the former for the purpose of the implementation of the teghout copper-molybdenum deposit exploitation project, were to acquire the units of land listed in its annexes.they further submitted that the valuation of their property had not been carried out correctly, since no account had been taken of the number of trees, the beekeeper’s house situated on the second plot of land, and a number of other factors that should have affected the calculation of the amount of compensation.15.  on 28 november 2008 the regional court granted teghout cjsc’s claim, awarding the applicants compensation of amd 217,350 for the first plot of land and amd 1,987,200 for the second plot of land.17.  on 18 june 2009 the civil court of appeal upheld the regional court’s judgment finding, inter alia, that the latter had struck a fair balance between the applicants’ interests and the legitimate aim pursued, and that the market value of the property had been properly determined, on the basis of the corrected valuation reports prepared by oliver group cjsc.
7.  the applicant had regular contact with the child until 2015 when the mother informed the applicant that she had divorced her husband and that she had decided to marry a german national and move with the child to germany.9.  during the hearing the mother of the child admitted that the applicant had provided regular financial support and had taken part in the upbringing and education of the child.the applicant contended that he had delayed his lawsuit because he had not wished to disturb the child’s family situation and he had not been prevented from communicating with the child on a regular basis until 2015. only when the child’s mother had decided to emigrate to another country with the child had he decided to seek formal recognition of his paternity.10.  on 17 november 2015 the district court allowed the applicant’s claims, declaring him the father of the child and ordering the amendment of the child’s birth certificate.it took into account the applicant’s argument that he had not wished to disturb the family and cause any harm to the child with a lawsuit during the long period when the mother had in fact assisted him in having regular access to the child.
the social worker reached the same conclusion.” 11.  the social worker who was also present at the meeting noted as follows: “the father refused to bring out the child, became uncooperative but eventually agreed that [the child] sit near her mother.although the child did not show an aversion towards her mother, she refused to leave with her.” 12.  on 13 november 2014 the applicant complained to the child protection authority that the social worker who had accompanied her and the bailiff on 4 november 2014 had been unfamiliar with the case, had questioned her motives in front of the child and had not known how to facilitate their reunion.13.  on 8 december 2014, at the bailiff’s request and based on the report of the visit of 4 november 2014, the child protection authority applied for mandatory counselling under article 912 of the code of civil procedure, with a view to re-establishing a relationship between the applicant and the child.the parties must understand ... that the minor must be supported in order to adapt to her new environment... the court is not bound by the wish expressed by the minor to remain with her father, because she is of a young age and because the father has persuaded the minor not to go to her mother’s home.... to hold that the child’s opinion is binding without exception would mean that the proceedings, including the hearing of evidence, are useless and that the court’s sole role is to take note of the child’s preference and decide accordingly.” 23.  according to the applicant, on 21 march 2018, the date of her latest communication to the court, she had still not been reunited with her daughter.
must have passed in front of a petrol station on their way to the village; the forensic medical examination had revealed no injury in the genital area; as regards the bruises on the applicant’s right arm, the forensic report provided no indication as to when they had been caused; no other injuries had been found on the applicant’s body.25.  the court ordered the prosecutor to proceed to the following acts: a psychiatric examination in order to determine whether, having regard to the applicant’s diagnosis of oligophrenia, she was able to react or to fight back or whether she may have not been able to express her will; the re‑interrogation of i.s.more specifically, in the absence of a connection between the injuries to the applicant’s arm and the alleged physical coercion, and in the absence of any injuries specific to the crime of rape in the genital area, the alleged physical coercion had not been proved.the lawyer stressed that the evidence ordered by the târnăveni district court in the decision of 6 may 2009 was extremely important to the case, and that failure to collect this evidence at the relevant time was the prosecution’s fault.the court further found that the forensic report did not support the applicant’s allegations, since, on the one hand, it did not reveal injuries specific to rape in the genital area, and, on the other, the injuries to the applicant’s arm were undated.
10.  the same day, 8 november 2010, the applicant’s counsel wrote a letter to the press complaints commission, in the course of the proceedings concerning one of the above-mentioned complaints in respect of the coverage of the inheritance case (see paragraph 7 above).it remarked that several of the other comments in the forum threads in question, that the applicant had not complained about, could possibly be defamatory, as had also been indicated by the defendants briefly during the hearing, but since the applicant had not complained about any other comments, the city court could not decide on their lawfulness.accordingly, she had by way of a complaint to the press complaints commission achieved a declaration that hegnar online had breached the code of conduct for journalists because the content of the forum threads had exceeded what she had had to accept and that hegnar online should on its own initiative have discovered and removed the comments more quickly than had happened.having regard to the fact that the letter was formally made in a different context, namely the pending complaint against kapital (see paragraph 6 above), and did not contain any request that the comments be removed, the high court found it appropriate that mr hegnar had only considered the letter as a document in the kapital case.she contested the high court’s assessment that the defendants had acted with sufficient care and alleged that the high court had erred in law as its reasoning had not been clear with respect to the standard of care required, notably whether it had proceeded on the basis that negligence would suffice for liability, or whether the establishment of gross negligence had been necessary.
10.  on 15 may 2014, a claim was brought before the ljubljana district court seeking to establish nullity of the supervisory board’s resolution of 13 may 2014. company a agreed to the claim and the court consequently issued a decision annulling the impugned resolution.in particular, company p argued as follows: the applicant’s and t.h.’s conduct was unacceptable and therefore they should have not continued with their four-year mandate; there were well-founded reasons for depriving them of their membership; their membership should be terminated immediately and they should be replaced by provisional members so as to ensure lawful functioning of the supervisory board and company a; though company p had enough shares to request the management board to convene a general meeting of shareholders this was impossible due to the uncertainty as to who was the company manager; company a was undergoing reconstruction and there were deadlines to be met in this connection; calling a general meeting would thus not ensure a sufficiently prompt response to the situation; and so the court’s intervention was necessary.referring to company p’s submissions and the case file in the proceedings concerning nullity of the resolution of 13 may 2014 (see paragraph 10 above) the court established that one member of the supervisory board had not been voluntarily present at the session of the supervisory board on 13 may 2014 (see paragraph 9 above) because of the conduct of the two remaining members of the supervisory board.17.  the applicant replied to the above pleadings on 25 august 2014. he argued that the supervisory board’s member’s dismissal at a general meeting of the shareholders could not be equated with the judicial termination of his term of office, because for the latter there had to be well-founded reasons, which had not been established in his case.it noted that the appointment and dismissal of the members of the supervisory board, whose role it was to represent the interests of the shareholders, fell within the discretion of the assembly.
in the court’s view, it was evident that company v. did not plan to use the land for agricultural activity but intended to change the purpose of the land and to develop a construction project, and that company s. had purchased the land not seeking to become its owner but with the aim of gaining profit from financing company v.’s acquisition of it.14.  the court stated that, having found that the vca’s decision had to be annulled, it was not necessary to examine the agreements concluded between the applicant, company s. and company v. however, since the first-instance court had examined them (see paragraph 10 above), the court of appeal did so as well and upheld the findings made by the lower court.18.  on 23 february 2012 the applicant received a letter from the national land service (the institution which took over the relevant functions of the vca after an administrative reform – hereinafter “the nls”) confirming that, after the courts had annulled her property rights to 2.44 hectares of land, she had retained the right to have those property rights restored.20.  on 24 july 2012 the applicant received another letter from the nls which stated that there was a possibility for her to receive a plot of land for the construction of an individual home in the vilnius city area but as there were 4,806 other candidates waiting to receive plots in the area, the restitution process would take a long time.as for the remaining land, the applicant asked to be allocated a plot of land for the construction of an individual home in vilnius as a matter of priority, taking into account the fact that she had applied for the restoration of her property rights in 1991 (see paragraph 5 above) and that they had already been restored to her in 2002 (see paragraph 6 above).
4389, was unclear in that it referred to the transfer of the shares of the main shareholders and the transfer of all shares of the bank in the same sentence, making it difficult to understand the scope of the transfer covered by that provision.referring to its judgment of 27 february 2002 regarding the main shareholders’ action for the annulment of the impugned transfer, the court found that the council of ministers’ decision to transfer the bank to the fund had been lawful.in that connection, it reiterated that taking account of reports drawn up following inspections of yaşarbank over a five-year period, instructions given to the bank by the state authorities, and the failure of the bank to improve its financial situation following these instructions, it had become clear that further activity of the bank, whose assets had been insufficient to cover its liabilities, would disrupt the stability of the financial system and make it impossible for the authorities to protect its creditors’ rights.in that connection, he maintained that the deprivation of his property had resulted from the authorities’ failure to comply with their duty of supervision, and in particular the failure of the capital markets board to inform the public of yaşarbank’s deteriorating financial situation, as required by the capital markets act (law no.26.  the applicant appealed, arguing that the supreme administrative court’s judgment had merely pointed out that the transfer of the bank had been lawful, without addressing his main argument, namely the unlawfulness of the application of section 14(5) and the resulting transfer of the shares obtained on the stock market together with those of the main shareholders.
the court took into account the gravity and the number of offences at issue, the sentence provided for the offences, the circumstances in which they had been committed, as well as the fact that the defendants were relatively young and that one of the accused had absconded.relying on article 5 of the convention and the relevant case-law, he complained, inter alia, about the length of his detention, alleging insufficient reasoning of the relevant decisions, the lack of regular review of his detention pursuant to article 179 § 2 of the ccp, a lack of medical care and poor conditions in detention.29.  on 20 february 2015 the court of appeal upheld the high court’s judgment on the merits of 9 october 2012. the same day, relying on article 175 § 4 of the ccp, the court extended the four defendants’ detention, including the applicant’s, finding that the reasons for it persisted.69.  between 4 september 2015 and 9 february 2016 the high court informed the iecs on several occasions that the costs of the applicant’s medical treatment, including for vdz, and the costs of security guards at the igalo institute, would be covered by the high court upon presentation of the relevant reimbursement requests (po podnošenju zahtjeva za naknadu troškova), pursuant to article 226 §§ 2(5) and 4 of the ccp.78.  the doctors further observed that the applicant suffered from myopia, that he could not see in the left eye and he had an artificial lens implanted in the right eye, that he had a dislocation of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae and ossification of the lumbar part of his spine, ossification of his left knee, an injury to a nerve in his left calf, he walked with crutches, and had two skin infections following the administration of injections as a result of the lack of disinfectant alcohol in the prison.
6.  on 25 february 2008 the novi sad court of first instance delivered a judgment partly in favour of the applicant and ordered the defendant to pay her a certain amount in that respect.7.  on 30 october 2008 the novi sad district court partly quashed the judgment of 25 february 2008 and remitted the case, upholding the remainder of the judgment.8.  on 2 july 2010 the novi sad court of first instance rejected the applicant’s claim in the remitted part.9.  on 30 january 2012 the novi sad court of appeal partly upheld the judgment of 2 july 2010 and partly reversed it granting certain applicant’s claims.10.  on 5 february 2015 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s complaint about the length of those proceedings, taking into consideration that the civil courts had rendered four judgments at two instances and that the proceedings had been complex.
39 following inspections of the above-mentioned cells (which the government submitted to the court) – suggested that: both cells had been equipped with the necessary furniture and the applicant had been provided with his own sleeping place; the lavatory had been separated from the living area; the walls and floor in cell no.according to the statements, some of the cells lacked access to fresh air and natural lights as the windows were always closed; ventilation and heating system did not work properly, so it was too cold in winter and too hot in summer; the artificial light was too weak; some cells were located in the basement and were humid and damp; the nutrition was inappropriate and did not comply with the relevant domestic norms; the facility was infested with rats; the prisoners were often subjected to ill-treatment by the prison staff and regularly transferred from one cell to another.the applicant furthermore contested the objectiveness of the information provided by the prison governor and stated that the government’s submissions did not exclude the possibility that, before the repair works had been completed at the end of 2010, there had been smaller rooms in the facility in which he could have been held (and which following the reconstruction had been merged to create a bigger room).39. according to the synopsis of the applicant’s treatment history provided to the court by the government, the applicant was seen by a tb-specialist (only once, according to the applicant) and prescribed standard treatment in the form of a combination of “first-line” anti-tb antibiotics (streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol), vitamins, hepatoprotectors, and an appropriate diet.they provided evidence that the letter to the public prosecution office of 26 march 2010 had reached the addressee and stated that other letters referred to by the applicant had not been registered in the register of outgoing correspondence (and had therefore not been sent by the applicant via the prison’s mail office).
8.  the applicants requested that the prison administration allow them a long-term family visit on many occasions, in particular, in 2006. their requests were rejected on the grounds that article 151 of the code of execution of sentences did not provide for long-term visits to life prisoners.9.  in april 2007 the applicants lodged an administrative claim against the state department for enforcement of sentences seeking an entitlement to a long-term conjugal visit every three months.10.  according to the information provided by the government, the first applicant was disciplined on three occasions during the period of his detention from 2001 to 2016: once in 2001 following the discovery of an unreported written message on him; once in 2003 on account of his attempt to get in touch with an inmate in an adjacent cell; and once in 2013 on account of unauthorised possession of a mobile telephone.during the period from 2004 to 2012 the first applicant had regular short-term visits from his mother, sister and some other persons.since then he had regular short-term visits from ms l. on 11 july 2014 the first applicant was allowed for the first time a long-term family visit, which was from his sister.
5.  on 25 july 2002 the applicant’s 51-year-old brother aleksandr alekseyvich anoshin was murdered by a policeman in the alcohol recovery centre of the sovietsky district police department of nizhniy novgorod (медицинский вытрезвитель при советском рувд г. нижнего новгорода).officer m. punched the applicant’s brother in the head and chest five times, and strangled him until he was unconscious using a squared piece of a broken wooden chair.9.  the centre staff initially testified that they had found the applicant’s brother unwell in his bed, but then changed their story, saying that they had seen him hang himself using a bed sheet tied to the bars of his cell window.the forensic reports (on the cause of death, the nature of the injuries, the origin of blood on the wall and the presence of metallic traces on the sheet) refuted the hanging hypothesis, pointed to a violent death and incriminated the centre staff.12.  on 1 august 2008 the sovietsky district court of nizhniy novgorod convicted m. of murder and violent abuse of official power and sentenced him to fourteen years’ imprisonment and a three-year ban from police service.
he had the following injuries: (i) multiple abrasions covered in brown scabs on his forehead and the back and top of his head; (ii) swelling on the inner surface of the lips; (iii) multiple large purple and blue bruises on his chest, abdomen, left side, forearms and shoulders; (iv) purple and yellow bruises on his knee joints; and (v) abrasions covered in brown scabs on the back of the toes of his left foot.the most recent refusal of 10 june 2008 was issued in accordance with article 24 § 1 (2) of the code of criminal procedure (“the ccrp”) on the grounds that none of the elements of crimes under articles 285 and 286 of the criminal code (abuse of powers) were present in respect of the police officers’ actions.24.  in its most recent refusal to open a criminal case against the police officers dated 10 june 2008, the investigative committee briefly concluded that the applicant’s injuries had resulted from the use of force and special devices (handcuffs) by police officers of the rapid response unit during the applicant’s arrest, as the applicant had resisted arrest.29.  on 2 june 2006 and 24 february 2009 respectively, in accordance with article 24 § 1 (1) of the ccrp, officials at the sovetskiy prosecutor’s office and moskovskiy inter-district investigation unit of the investigative committee for ryazan issued refusals to initiate criminal proceedings against the police officers as none of the elements of crimes under articles 285 and 286 of the criminal code (abuse of powers) were present in respect of their actions.the most recent refusal of 26 may 2008 was issued in accordance with article 24 § 1 (2) of the ccrp, because none of the elements of crimes under articles 285, 286 and 301 of the criminal code (abuse of powers and unlawful arrest and detention respectively) were present in respect of the police officers’ actions, as the applicant’s allegations had not been confirmed in the course of the inquiry.
8.  on 6 october 2011 the sovetskiy district court of kazan (“the district court”) received the case file and set the trial date for 19 october 2011.9.  on 19 march 2012 the district court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to nine and a half years’ imprisonment.10.  during the trial, which consisted of sixteen hearings, the applicant was confined in a metal cage in the courtroom.11.  on 10 august 2012 the supreme court of the tatarstan republic upheld the applicant’s conviction on appeal.he was placed behind a floor-to-ceiling metal partition on the premises of the remand prison sizo-3 of the tatarstan republic where he was detained and communicated with the judges via a video link.
the court noted that it could only impose arrest if it was impossible to achieve the objectives of article 119 of the code of criminal procedure, namely to ensure that the suspect, the accused or the convicted person participated in the proceedings, to prevent interference with the pre-trial investigation or with the examination of the case before the court, or with the execution of the sentence, and to prevent the commission of further criminal acts by other, less restrictive measures.(b)  the applicant’s detention during his trial 41.  on 2 july 2014 the bill of indictment and the case were referred to the vilnius regional court for examination on the merits, but on 11 july 2014 the court of appeal transferred the case for examination on the merits to the klaipėda regional court, because the judges of the vilnius regional court had taken part in the investigative actions.(b)  the applicant’s detention during his trial 60.  on 2 july 2014 the bill of indictment and the case were referred to the vilnius regional court for examination on the merits, but on 11 july 2014 the court of appeal transferred the case for examination on the merits to the klaipėda regional court, because the judges of the vilnius regional court had taken part in the investigative actions.although no hearings had taken place from 2 december 2015 to 29 november 2016 there had been objective reasons for this: it had been announced during the hearing on 20 october 2015 that no hearing would take place on 19 january 2016 because one of the judges had a hearing in another case; on 2 december 2015 the court had announced that there would be a break until 29 february 2016 because there was to be a psychiatric examination of two of the accused on 19 january 2016; an additional expert report was commissioned for the same two accused on 29 february 2016; and there was a further adjournment (the results of the expert report were received on 8 and 17 june 2016); the hearing on 16 june 2016 did not take place because one of the accused was sick and another had been arrested in sweden; and there was no hearing on 25 november 2016 because three of the accused had failed to appear (one of them had been arrested in sweden and his transfer to lithuania was to take place on 18 january 2017).72.  according to the information in the court’s possession, between the transfer of the case to the court for examination on the merits on 2 july 2014 (on 11 july 2014 the court appeal solved a jurisdictional issue and decided that the case had to be examined by the klaipėda regional court, so the case was transferred to that court on 21 july 2014) and the first-instance judgment on 20 december 2017, a total of fifty-one hearings were coordinated in advance and scheduled; ten of those hearings were either cancelled or adjourned: (a) in 2014 four hearings were scheduled and held: on 11, 12 and 25 november and on 9 december; (b) in 2015 twenty-five hearings were scheduled, two of them were adjourned (on 14 april the hearing was adjourned because of the health state of one of the accused, r.v., and on 16 october the hearing was adjourned because the second applicant refused to be taken to the hearing from custody) and one was cancelled (on 15 april because of the health of r.v.).
12.  in a letter dated 4 april 2011 sent by the district aliens and immigration branch of the larnaca police to the aliens and immigration service, the issuance of deportation and detention orders against the applicant was recommended in order to ensure that the applicant would not abscond following the expiration of the detention order issued by the larnaca district court.in this connection it held that the six-month period provided in article 15 § 5 of the above-mentioned directive had started to run on 4 april 2011 and had ended on 4 october 2011. although article 15 § 6 of the directive provided for the possibility of extending detention for a period not exceeding a further twelve months if there was a lack of cooperation on the part of a third-country national, it provided that this should be applied in accordance with the provisions of the national law; however, there had been no such national law in force when the six-month period had expired in this case.36.  on the same date the applicant’s lawyer sent a fax to the minister of the interior and the chief of police, stating that the new detention and deportation orders were in conflict with the supreme court’s judgment of 22 december 2011 and infringed the provisions of the eu returns directive.it found that the applicant’s main claims – namely that (i) the aliens and immigration law, where it concerned the issuance of the deportation and detention orders, was unconstitutional, (ii) the deportation and detention orders had not been issued under the correct provision of that law, and (iii) he had the right under the refugee law to remain in the country pending the determination of his appeal by the supreme court (no.49.  in the meantime, on 12 september 2012 the applicant’s lawyer sent a fax to the minister of the interior complaining about the period of the applicant’s detention and about the failure of the minister of the interior to review the applicant’s detention order every two months, as provided by section 18 πστ(4) of the aliens and immigration law (see paragraph 101 below).
10.  next morning, from 10.30 a.m. to 2.20 p.m., investigator p. from the sverdlovskiy district prosecutor’s office questioned the applicant as a suspect in the presence of a lawyer appointed by investigator p. according to the record of the questioning, the applicant gave statements voluntarily, he had injuries from handcuffs because “he had put up resistance”, and he was not subjected to any violence.21.  it appears that on 12 march, 23 april and 17 august 2009 refusals to open a criminal case were issued in relation to the applicant’s complaint of ill-treatment by the investigative committee for the sverdlovsk district of irkutsk pursuant to article 24 § 1 (2) of the ccrp, as none of the elements of the crime under article 116 § 1 of the criminal code were present.23.  in a letter of 12 october 2011 the irkutsk regional prosecutor’s office informed the applicant that on 22 april 2011 the investigative committee for the sverdlovskiy district of irkutsk had refused to open a criminal case in relation to the applicant’s complaint of ill-treatment by the police officers from the sverdlovskiy district police department of irkutsk pursuant to article 24 § 1 (2) of the ccrp, as none of the elements of the crime under article 286 § 3 (a) of the criminal code were present.the appellate court relied on the refusal to open a criminal case of 12 march 2008, noting the applicant’s statements that the injuries on the wrists had been caused as a result of the use of handcuffs to suppress the applicant’s resistance.28.  on 24 november 2009 a judge of the supreme court of russia rejected the applicant’s request for supervisory review of his case, stating that the decisions of the courts of both instances to dismiss the applicant’s complaint that he had been coerced by violence to give his self‑incriminating statements were well-founded.
6.  on 14 december 2012 the state duma, the lower house of the federal assembly of russia, adopted at first reading a draft law which, in particular, prohibited the adoption of children of russian nationality by citizens of the united states of america.the administrative-offence record in respect of the first applicant and the police officers’ reports in respect of all the applicants indicated that the offence had been committed at 10 a.m. it was also stated that they had taken part in a non-notified group public event and had refused to end it when requested to do so by the police.the court found it established, on the basis of the administrative-offence record, the police officers’ reports and oral testimony by a police officer who had arrested the applicant that the latter had taken part in a public event (“picket”) which had involved fifty people and had been held without prior notification of the authorities.14.  on 31 january 2013 in two separate proceedings the same justice of the peace convicted the second and the third applicants under article 20.2 § 2 of the cao and sentenced each of them to fines of rub 20,000. the court relied on the administrative offence records, the police officers’ reports and oral testimony by a police officer who had arrested the applicants.the court reclassified the charges against the applicants as falling under article 20.2 § 5 of the cao, namely breach of the established procedure for the conduct of public events committed by a participant.
on 11 march 2011 the płock district court informed the applicant that he would not be transported to the hearing, and instructed him about the formal requirements in respect of requests for evidence, among other things that such requests should be lodged with the court in two copies.12.  the applicant was not present at the court hearing on 23 march 2011. on 24 march 2011 the płock district court served the applicant with a copy of płock prison’s response to the applicant’s action (odpowiedź na pozew) and ordered the applicant to clarify his pleading (sprecyzowanie powództwa), in particular as regards the period of his detention.13.  on 12 april 2011 the płock district court rejected part of the applicant’s action on the basis of res judicata, and asked the applicant to inform the court if he wished to maintain the remainder thereof.17.  on 29 may 2012 the applicant was served with the judgment and information about the time and manner of the right to appeal, which read as follows: “you may request the written reasoning of the judgment within seven days of the day on which the judgment was served on you.for the above reasons i ask the court to accept my appeal and interlocutory appeals.” 21.  on 15 november 2012 the court instructed the applicant that in order to comply with the formal requirement of his interlocutory appeal he should submit an additional copy of it, which the applicant failed to do.
11.  on 20 february 2008 the supreme court rectified its decision of 20 april 2007 based on the applicant’s request to that end, stating that the outstanding sentence for the applicant’s first conviction and the sentence for the second conviction were to be cumulative, and that the cumulative sentence of eight years and six months had to start running from 29 march 2002, namely the date of commission of the second offence rather than the date of the imposition of the later sentence, which was 12 april 2006. appellate proceedings concerning the second conviction were still pending when the supreme court adopted the two decisions.12.  on 3 december 2008, without taking note of the supreme court decisions of 20 april 2007 and 20 february 2008 (see paragraphs 10-11 above), the tbilisi court of appeal upheld the applicant’s second conviction and ruled that he had to serve a cumulative sentence of thirteen years and six months which had started to run on 29 march 2002 which was again, the date of the commission of the second offence.he noted that it was only by means of the supreme court’s final decision that he had learned about the rectified appellate decision of 3 april 2009. he submitted that the rectified appellate decision had been contrary to the final decision of the supreme court dated 20 february 2008 which had set a different starting date for his cumulative sentence, and would have resulted in a release date of 29 september 2010. he further submitted that the rectification had lacked any legal basis and had gone beyond the scope of article 615 of the ccp, as it had substantially affected the duration of his sentence.maintaining that his appeal had been the sole basis for the appellate court’s judgment of 3 december 2008, the applicant submitted that the rectified appellate decision, made by that very court, had been in violation of article 540 § 1 of the ccp which had provided a guarantee for an appellant against a worsening of his or her position in the proceedings in the absence of an appeal from the prosecuting authorities.17.  on 24 april 2009 the head of the registry of the chamber of criminal cases of the supreme court replied to the applicant, stating that the rectified appellate decision of 3 april 2009 had constituted an integral part of the appellate judgment of 3 december 2008. therefore, the supreme court was not in a position to address the applicant’s complaint.
10.  on the same day, the police (immigration branch) issued a detention order in terms of the immigration act (chapter 217 of the laws of malta) and subsidiary legislation 420.06 “reception of asylum seekers regulations” (hereinafter “the reception regulations” – see relevant domestic law below) on the grounds that the elements on which the applicant’s application for international protection had been based could not be determined in the absence of detention, in particular due to the risk of absconding.13.  according to documentation submitted by the government, on 30 september 2016, the applicant appeared before the board accompanied by one of his lawyers (of choice), but the case was put off to the next board meeting to be held on 5 october 2016, since one of the applicant’s representatives (of choice) was abroad.15.  according to the applicant, during the hearing before the board, in the presence of a representative of the malta police force who explained the circumstances of the applicant’s detention, the board informed the applicant that it had not been able to comply with the deadline provided by the law for the review of his detention since on the date required by the reception regulations (namely seven working days from the issuing of the detention order) a board member was attending a conference overseas and therefore he could not take part in the hearing.it followed that he had already presented to the authorities all the elements on which his application for international protection had been based, thus the legal basis on which the authorities had relied in order to justify his detention could not be held applicable to his case and the interference with the applicant’s liberty had not been provided by law.the board specified that: (i) the elements in question referred to the application for refugee status, which had not yet been determined; (ii) if the applicant left malta he would be unable to provide the information (elements) required by the commissioner for refugees (refcom); (iii) the fact that the applicant had been found in possession of a ticket to go to italy showed that his intention was not to remain in malta; (iv) “with the fact that he was inadmissible in the first place because he had forged a document, there is no reason to believe that appellant will not abscond”.
11.  in the course of the judicial proceedings the applicant lodged several applications and requests with the court, including a letter of 8 august 2012. the court, by an order of 28 august 2012, instructed the applicant that to comply with formal requirements he should submit an additional copy of that letter.15.  on 29 october 2012 the applicant was served with the judgment and information about the time and manner of the right to appeal, in the following terms: “a party who disagrees with the judgment has a right to request the written reasoning of the judgment within seven days of the service of that judgment and later to appeal to the second-instance court via the court that issued the judgment, within two weeks, calculated from the service of the reasoned judgment.article 369 § 1: the appeal shall be submitted to the court that issued the judgment within two weeks, calculated from the service of the reasoned judgment.” 16.  on 12 november 2012 the applicant received the reasoning of the court’s judgment of 5 october 2012.19.  on 15 february 2013 the applicant submitted a letter in which he informed the court that he was unable to comply with the order because he did not have the text of his appeal that he could copy or rewrite and he did not remember the exact wording of his pleadings.on 21 june 2013 the wrocław regional court dismissed the applicant’s interlocutory appeal, holding that the applicant, who had started a civil action and knew that he was deprived of his liberty, could justifiably be expected to keep copies of all letters he sent to the court, especially since he had been informed on 28 august 2012 that all letters to the court should be submitted in two copies.
8.  in the course of the investigation, the zagreb municipal state attorney’s office (općinsko državni odvjetništvo u zagrebu) commissioned a psychiatric expert report on the applicant’s mental health at the time of the offence, including, if appropriate, the existence of a need for his psychiatric internment.the expert noted that she had not inspected any medical documents concerning the applicant’s previous psychiatric treatment, but she had interviewed him, examined the criminal case file and a medical report from the prison administration.11.  on 27 july 2012 a three-judge panel of the zagreb municipal criminal court found that the indictment was flawed as it had been based on an incomplete expert report, which had not taken into account all the medical documentation concerning the applicant’s previous psychiatric treatment.she also argued that the evidence concerning the applicant’s mental state at the moment of the commission of the offence could not be given by his general practitioner or his psychiatrist.29.  on 7 november 2013 a three-judge panel of the zagreb county court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on the grounds that there had been nothing in his arguments to raise any doubts about the necessity for his committal to the hospital as established by the zagreb municipal criminal court.
9.  the notice went on to say that the offence in connection with which the applicant was being sought was one under article 656 of the iranian penal code (see paragraphs 38-40 below), and that the maximum penalty in respect of it was three years’ imprisonment.21.  the line of argument taken by counsel for the applicant from the outset was that the evidence enclosed with the extradition request left some doubt about the actual date and time of the offence the applicant had allegedly committed, and that he could not have committed it on the date and at the time initially specified because he had by then already left tehran.the prosecution urged the court to invite the iranian authorities to clarify the date and time of the commission of the alleged offence.22.  the court did so, in the exercise of its powers under section 17(3) of the extradition and european arrest warrant act 2005 (see paragraph 34 below), and in a diplomatic note of 5 april 2017 the iranian authorities said that the applicant had committed the offence at 1.40 p.m. on 23 june 2016.he said that doubts about the date and time of the commission of the alleged offence – 23 or 24 june 2016 – persisted, and that the available evidence gave rise to misgivings about whether the applicant had really committed the offence.
counsel for the fsin explained in the proceedings before the supreme court (see paragraph 69 below) the manner in which sixteen people were accommodated in a large compartment: five prisoners seated on each of the two lower bunks, one prisoner lying on each of the two upper bunks, and four people seated on the middle bunks joined together with the bridge bunk.29.  after the opening of the trial before the supreme court of the komi republic, she was shuttled between the remand prison and the trial court on ten or twelve occasions between 15 december 2010 and 24 february 2011. the distance was sixteen kilometres and the travel time thirty-five minutes.35.  in his letter of 6 june 2011 to a member of the public monitoring commission, the deputy head of the yaroslavl prison service explained that ms kostromina and ms n. had been placed together in the single-prisoner cubicle in order to isolate them from male offenders.62.  on 16 november 2015 the supreme court rejected the challenge, finding as follows: “the plaintiffs’ argument that the measurements of cells in prisoner vans and railway carriages, as established in the guidance, are incompatible with the requirements of international law are unfounded because no other normative act of a higher legal order provides for different cell measurements in those conveyances.the plaintiffs’ claim that the technical specifications of the guidance are in breach of the case-law of the european court in the cases of khudoyorov v. russia, guliyev v. russia, and idalov v. russia in the part concerning the conditions of transfer by road and by rail, is erroneous because it does not correspond to the contents [of those judgments].” 63.  on 25 february 2016 the appeals panel of the supreme court rejected their appeal in a summary fashion.
it follows from the material in the case file that [r.] was given into the care of the guardian after his parents’ futile attempts to provide him with due medical care and in the child’s [best] interests ... [r.’s parents] did not intend to abandon their child ... even though he was under the [first applicant’s] guardianship, [his] family took an interest in his life and health, they provided ... financial support.” 40.  the district court further referred to statements of various witnesses.it considered that the district court had thoroughly examined the case and accurately established the relevant circumstances; that on the basis of various pieces of written evidence, the report of 4 may 2010 regarding the effects of r.’s parents’ contact with him and a report on their living conditions being amongst their number, as well as on the basis of numerous witness statements, the first-instance court had taken a justified and well-reasoned decision that r.’s transfer to his biological family had been in his best interests.51.  on an unspecified date the first applicant brought an action against r.’s parents on behalf of herself and on behalf of the other applicants in an attempt to gain access to r. she averred, in particular, that for the nine years during which r. had remained in her care, she and her foster children – the other applicants – had formed a family with a special bond existing between them; she further complained that, after r.’s transfer to his parents, there had been no contact between r. and the applicants, as r.’s parents had obstructed their attempts to maintain contact.55.  the district court went on to observe that the first applicant was not a member of r.’s family or a relative, within the meaning of article 67 of the russian family code (see paragraph 66 below), nor did she have any legal ties with him after her guardianship over the boy had been terminated by a court decision, with the result that she did not pertain to the category of individuals entitled to seek access to the child under the russian family code.the resolution of a dispute by analogy would otherwise contradict the essence of the family relationship.” 59.  the court also rejected the applicant’s argument that the first‑instance court had failed to determine the degree of r.’s attachment to the applicants; it stated in this connection that the argument in question “lacked a legal basis”.
the reasoning and operative part of the decision read as follows: “it follows from the documents submitted [number and dates] that ... [t.] ali m., who stands accused of committing crimes under articles 208 § 1, 279, and 222 § 3 of the criminal code [leadership of an armed gang, organisation of an armed revolt and unlawful handling of arms and ammunition], is one of the leaders of illegal armed group “imarat kavkaz” ... at his address of registration there may be objects and documents relevant for the ongoing investigation (including firearms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices), as well as other objects and substances which are banned from free circulation ... the investigation of this criminal case is particularly complex.... the court, having examined the submitted documents and heard the opinions of the senior prosecutor and the senior investigator, authorises the search of the registered address of a.m.[t.], being satisfied that for the purposes of the investigation there is enough information to believe that there may be objects and documents relevant to the ongoing investigation (including firearms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices), as well as other objects and substances which are banned from free circulation on the territory of the russian federation.a five-page summary of the decision, forwarded to the third applicant on the same day, indicated that the following procedural measures had been taken: on 14 november 2011 a military investigator had questioned the bomb-disposal expert and the fsb investigator who had conducted the search of the premises.... noting well-established facts pointing at the commission by mr ali [t.] (“magas”) of a number of terrorist acts with the use of explosive devices, the investigator took a well-grounded decision to carry out the search with the participation of an explosives expert, who had been instructed to examine the dwellings in order to find potential explosive devices and deactivate them, in order to ensure the safety of all those present.... under such circumstances, the consequences of the detonation of the explosive device that had occurred while it was being deactivated, and the destruction of the dwellings and other possible damage to property, do not attest to unlawful actions on the part of the law-enforcement personnel, contrary to the applicant’s assertion.
the prison administration believed the contents of the package to be suspect and therefore lodged a request on 12 august 2005 with the public prosecutor for a decision to be taken by an enforcement court to determine whether the material sent to the applicant concerned defence-related documents or whether they concerned any objectionable content so as to prevent them from being handed over to the applicant.12.  on 23 september 2005, referring to its earlier decision of 25 august 2005, the edirne enforcement court in an examination carried out on the basis of the case file, without holding a hearing and without seeking submissions from the applicant or his lawyer, granted an application on the part of the prison administration and therefore held that an official was to be present during the applicant’s consultations with his lawyer.on 6 december 2010 the edirne enforcement court dismissed the applicant’s application for a hearing, holding that the new amendments to the procedure concerned only the examination of objections against disciplinary sanctions, so that in so far as the restriction of 23 september 2005 had not been a disciplinary sanction, no hearing could be held in respect of that complaint.the court dismissed that application on 11 april 2013, holding that there had not been any change in the circumstances of the applicant and the decision relating to the restriction on the consultations with the applicant’s lawyer.22.  on 1 november 2016 the compensation commission held that the edirne enforcement court’s decision not to hand over the book and the periodicals sent to the applicant by his lawyer had infringed the applicant’s right to receive information within the meaning of article 10 of the convention.
7.  at the beginning of 2012 the applicant investigated the off-duty activities of the chief of the investigation committee of the russian federation (“the investigation committee”), mr bastrykin.the investigator’s ruling read, in so far as relevant, as follows: “the request by [the applicant’s lawyer] to allow his client a.a. navalnyy to travel to moscow region should be granted; the investigator must be informed about making [such] journeys.” 10.  on 18 july 2013 the leninskiy district court of kirov found the applicant guilty of organising large-scale embezzlement in the kirovles case and gave him a suspended prison sentence of five years.it imposed a number of conditions on the applicant for the period of his house arrest, in particular: “-  [it is forbidden] to leave or change the [registered address] without authorisation by the investigator ...; -  to communicate with anyone, except for immediate family, as defined by law, legal counsel representing him in the criminal case and [investigating officials]; -  to receive or send any correspondence, including letters, telegrams, parcels and emails; -  to use any means of communication or the internet telecommunications network; -  to make statements, declarations, addresses or to give comments in connection with this criminal case in the media.” 17.  on 3 march 2014 the applicant was placed under the supervision of the department for the execution of sentences.26.  on 21 august 2014 the zamoskvoretskiy district court changed the conditions of the applicant’s house arrest as follows: “the [applicant’s] application should be granted and the ban on communication imposed when the order for his house arrest was issued [should] be lifted, [and] it should be made clear that [the applicant] is prohibited from communicating in any form with persons [given the status of] witnesses in this criminal case.” 27.  on 10 october 2014 the zamoskvoretskiy district court extended the applicant’s house arrest after lifting the prohibition on “making statements, declarations, addresses or giving comments in connection with this criminal case in the media” on the basis that it was not in compliance with article 107 of the code of criminal procedure.31.  on 14 january 2015 the zamoskvoretskiy district court refused to examine the applicant’s complaint about the extension of his house arrest on 30 december 2014 on the grounds that the measure had been ordered in the judgment on the merits of the criminal case and had not been a procedural decision concerning pre-trial issues.
nonetheless, in view of the fact that the father and the children had had no contact since june 2006 and that the contact sessions had never before been carried out with the assistance of experts, the court concluded that the negative attitude of the children was not enough to discontinue contact.the centre records show that in the course of preparing the children for contact, the caseworkers talked to the children, who firmly rejected the idea of any contact with the applicant and asked the caseworkers for permission not to attend the contact sessions.36.  the applicant appealed, maintaining, inter alia, that the solution for re-establishing contact between him and the children, as advised by dr t., was family therapy, initially with the parents alone and later with the children, which had been refused by m. he disagreed with the court’s opinion that the reasons resulting in the discontinuation of contact were no longer relevant and pointed out that the children’s alienation from him was the result of wrong decisions taken by the administrative authorities and wrong assessment of the evidence by the court.in the court’s view, the main reason for the children’s negative attitude towards contact with the applicant were his personal characteristics, as indicated by the court expert, combined with the inadequate participation of m. it found that the opinion of expert dr t. based on a paedopsychiatric examination of the children and psychiatric diagnostics had provided sufficient grounds for the decision to discontinue contact and that the court-appointed expert had concluded that further tests were unnecessary given the age of the children.the report found, in particular, that the centre: (i) had not identified the problem that the parents had not been acting in the children’s best interests as regards contact, particularly m., who had refused to cooperate with the applicant; (ii) had, consequently, not tried to resolve the problems between the parents, which was one of the reasons that supervised contact could not be established; (iii) had not offered the parents the social service of home or personal help even though the applicant had been willing to accept it; (iv) had not assessed the attitude of m.’s parents, who had been living with the children, despite this issue being raised by the applicant; (v) had not realised that, by not providing these services, it had been following m.’s wishes but failing to safeguard the children’s best interests; (vi) despite having been entrusted by the court with the task of re-establishing contact between the applicant and his children it had concluded, on the basis of an incorrect assessment of the facts regarding the alleged harmful behaviour of the applicant during the contact visits in the past, that the children’s contact with the applicant should be discontinued; (vii) had not provided proper reasoning for the request to discontinue contact, even though the discontinuation ordered by the court had been ultimately justified because the contact visits under the centre’s supervision had not been in the children’s interests; (viii) had not treated both parents equally and its officials’ methods of approach and communication, especially with the applicant, had been often inappropriate; (ix) had not drawn up a proper assessment of the situation or an action plan; (x) together with m., had burdened the then still young children with the need to make a decision concerning the desired contact even when different contact from that determined by the court could have been arranged only by the parents’ agreement; and (xi) had not assessed how well the children had been prepared for contact.
22.  later the same day k., too, wrote “a statement of surrender to the police” in respect of the robbery and murder of mr and ms s., in which he confirmed to the same investigator the account of the events given in the applicant’s related confession (see paragraph 20 above).23.  the case file contains a copy of the investigator’s decision on the admission of lawyer g. on 28 january 2005, “at the request of the accused”, to represent the applicant in the proceedings.he also insisted that the applicant had had nothing to do with the aggravated murder of the mr and ms s. the lawyer found it suspicious that on 28 january 2005 the applicant had made his “statement of surrender to the police” in respect of that murder in the criminal investigation department of dnipropetrovsk region, whereas the ongoing criminal investigation at that time had been under the responsibility of the kirovskyy police.38.  the applicant also alleged that on 28 january 2005 he had been taken to the dnipropetrovsk region criminal investigation department, where the police had ill-treated him with a view to extracting his confession to the aggravated murder of mr and ms s. the applicant provided the following account.55.  in march 2017 the dnipro (renamed “dnipropetrovsk”) prison authorities informed the government’s agent, in reply to an enquiry from the latter, that the correspondence records of the dnipropetrovsk sizo related to the period in question had been destroyed owing to the expiry of the time-limit for the storage of such documents.
in his complaint he repeated his request for a referral to the cjeu and suggested the wording for two questions, one of them being a slightly modified version of the previously suggested question: “does article 86 tec in the version of the maastricht treaty (article 102 tfeu) preclude the interpretation and application of domestic legislation enacted by a member state which categorically excludes, for legal reasons, the liability of a dominant undertaking that damages a competing joint-stock company in violation of article 86 tec (article 102 tfeu), thus putting it at risk of bankruptcy, also for damage sustained by the shareholders of the competing joint-stock company resulting from the fact that they take on new shareholders in order to avert bankruptcy, thereby reducing their own share of the company?... does article 86 tec (article 102 tfeu) preclude the interpretation and application of domestic legislation enacted by a member state as laid out in the first question for referral if the damaged shareholders are founding shareholders (investors) who, at the time of the damaging event, have a significant shareholding and, as members of the company’s executive board, decisively shape the company’s competitive conduct?” 11.  on 14 april 2015 the federal court of justice rejected the applicant’s complaint: “... because the legal matter [had] not [been] of fundamental significance, because the complaints based on violations of procedural rights [had] failed to convince and because neither the further development of the law nor the interests in ensuring uniform adjudication [had required] a decision to be issued by the court hearing the appeal on points of law (article 543 § 1 of the code of civil procedure).17.  article 267 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (“tfeu”) provides as follows: “the court of justice shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning: (a) the interpretation of the treaties; (b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the union ...; where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a member state, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the court to give a ruling thereon.the existence of such a possibility must be assessed in the light of the specific characteristics of community law, the particular difficulties to which its interpretation gives rise and the risk of divergences in judicial decisions within the community.” 19.  in the case of kenny roland lyckeskog (c-99/00, 4 june 2002, ecli:eu:c:2002:329) the cjeu decided, among other things, the question of whether a national court which in practice was the court of last resort in a case, because a declaration of admissibility was needed in order for the case to be reviewed by the country’s supreme court, was a court within the meaning of the third paragraph of article 234 ec (current article 267 of the tfeu).the court has already held that decisions of a national appellate court which can be challenged by the parties before a supreme court are not decisions of ‘a court or tribunal of a member state against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law’ within the meaning of the third paragraph of article 267. the fact that the examination of the merits of such challenges is conditional upon a preliminary declaration of admissibility by the supreme court does not have the effect of depriving the parties of a judicial remedy (lyckeskog, paragraph 16).
the following investigative actions had been performed: the scene of the accident had been examined; the electrics had been inspected; various reports had been received; several witnesses had been questioned; and medical examinations of the victims had been carried out.the fire brigade was called at 7.37 a.m., the officers were instructed how to carry out the evacuation at 7.40 a.m. and the fire brigade arrived at around 7.44 a.m. the first ambulance arrived at 8.06 a.m. the evacuation of the inmates was finished at 8.08 a.m. the ambulances started taking the victims to the hospital at 8.30 a.m., the applicant was taken to the hospital at 8.40 a.m. and the last ambulance left the prison at 8.58 a.m. it appears that the medical staff of lukiškės remand prison were present during the fire and that the head of the health care service was instructed to organise the provision of first aid for those in need.13.  in november 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint with the vilnius regional administrative court, requesting compensation in respect of non‑pecuniary damage for overcrowding, lack of proper separation between sanitary facilities and the cell, insufficient ventilation in lukiškės remand prison from 7 june 2011 until 25 may 2012 and in respect of the alleged inadequate actions of the prison authorities during the fire in that institution on 5 january 2012. the applicant claimed that he had screamed for help during the fire but owing to the untimely actions of the prison authorities he had fallen into a coma that had lasted for several hours (see paragraphs 6 and 10 above).the court further held that the prison authorities had merely provided a general description of the actions of the relevant representatives of the prison during the fire and had not provided any information about the specific actions they had taken in order to immediately remove the applicant from his cell or about the first aid he had received.it agreed with the first-instance decision as regards the overcrowding and the violation of both the domestic norms and article 3 of the convention, but held that there was no information that the prison authorities had breached the requirements for fire prevention or for evacuation of people.
we give you this in lieu of a prologue: ‘... in his eight years and counting at the head of the regional court i. has found himself dozens of loyal people – lawyers, judges, and important businessmen – for whose personal and business interests he has successfully lobbied through favourable judicial decisions [a3] (обзавелся десятками преданных людей... чей бизнес и личные интересы успешно лоббировал с помощью нужных решений в судах)... here is the conclusion: i. is considered the person in charge and untouchable [a4] in the kherson region where 14 governors succeeded each other in 10 years... if one removes him successfully, even if peacefully, the people will believe in changes for the better in the pervasively corrupt judicial system...’ this document arrived in our offices last autumn.under the photograph the following caption appeared: “i will recompense them according to their deeds (old testament)[1] mr i. is shown in the photo” 16.  in the same issue of the newspaper another photograph of i. was published with the caption “parliament so far has not given a ‘life sentence’ to the president of the kherson court of appeal”.29.  on 18 august 2006 the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal varied the judgment of the first-instance court and reaffirmed the essential part of its reasoning: (i) the court of appeal reduced the amounts awarded to uah 20,000 for non-pecuniary damage and uah 1,000 for court fees (about eur 2,970 and 148 respectively at the time), having regard to the applicant company’s financial situation, and upheld the remainder of the first-instance court’s judgment.the court held that the aim of the impugned phrases had been solely to humiliate and disparage a representative of the judiciary and the phrases had made no contribution to the resolution of the problems in the administration of justice.at the same time the district court stressed the following quote from the same paragraph of lingens: “the court notes in this connection that the facts on which mr. lingens founded his value-judgment were undisputed, as was also his good faith.” (vi) the district court went on to note that the defendants had failed to provide proof that the facts which the journalist evaluated in the impugned article were undisputed/incontrovertible (доказів незаперечності оцінених журналістом фактів у даній справі відповідачі суду не надали)[2] and, therefore, the court did not consider that they had acted in good faith in accordance with article 5 of the information act.
it argued, inter alia, that the other party was using the same name for the same product, namely a newspaper, without having obtained any prior permission, despite the fact that it had the rights to the registered trademark which needed to be protected pursuant to legislative decree no.the court noted that the newspaper vatan, the rights to which had been transferred to bağımsız gazetecilik in 2002, had been published since 1975. in line with the findings of the expert report, it held that the name “vatan” had become well-known as a newspaper prior to the applicant company’s application for its registration as a trademark and that the applicant company, whose application should actually have been rejected by the patent institute, could not be considered to have brought the case in good faith.5000 on the establishment and duties of the turkish patent institute), which had come into force on 6 november 2003 during the course of the proceedings and set forth that those who publish periodicals could not be prevented from doing so on the basis of legislative decree no.17.  on 31 january 2008, in examining the matter in relation to a separate case, the turkish constitutional court annulled section 31(2) of the turkish patent institute act, finding that it did not comply with article 35 of the constitution, which guaranteed the right to property.23.  on 17 february 2005 the ankara intellectual property court ruled that the registration in the name of the applicant company be declared void, finding that vatan had become well-known as a newspaper before the applicant company’s registration.
5.  in summer 2014 ms f., the head of the ust-labinskiy district and of the non-governmental organisation “human rights defender”, spoke at a television talk show on the situation in the eastern region of ukraine and relations between russia and ukraine.6.  on 28 july 2015 the applicant published on youtube a video with the title “kolkhoz tv on ukrainian crisis” (колхозное телевидение об украинском кризисе) where he made comments on ms f.’s speech as follows: “ms f.: nobody in the whole world has ever thought that russia would become such a strong country and ... that russia would reach new horizons... the applicant (mr r.): nodding ironically, showing the brochure “life of a galley slave”.the court held as follows: “... [the applicant] disseminated untrue statements about ms f. which damaged her honour, dignity and reputation, because these statements referred to unethical behaviour on her part... the court has established that the defendant used abusive and obscene language in his video ..., therefore [the applicant] intended to humiliate ms f. and damage her reputation.in accordance with the principle of reasonableness, taking into account the seriousness of the wrongful acts, the nature of the offence and the contents of the publication, the degree of suffering involved, and that the information concerned a public activist and was available for the general public, the court allows the plaintiff’s claim for non‑pecuniary damage in part and awards 50,000 roubles (‘rub’)”.10.  on 5 may 2016 the krasnodar regional court upheld this decision on appeal, stating that the applicant had failed to provide any proof in respect of statements about ms f. used in his video, and that he had used vulgar and obscene words humiliating ms f. 11.  on 1 august and 1 november 2016 the krasnodar regional court and the supreme court of russia dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeals.
at 2.15 p.m. the applicant was taken home (in order to change his shoes because the police wanted to seize the ones he had been wearing) and then to the scene of the theft, where he explained to the officers precisely how the offence had been carried out.the applicant could name two of the officers whom he knew from previous police visits to his village: one of them – who had been in charge of his questioning on 4 february 2013 – had not hit him, while the other one had only “dropped by” but had allegedly taken part in his beating.10.  on 16 october 2013 the prosecutor questioned the police officer who had been in charge of questioning the applicant on 4 february 2013. the police officer firmly denied any kind of ill-treatment and said that, after his release, the applicant had met someone who he had alleged had participated in the crime.on the basis of the documents previously drawn up by the general practitioner and the doctor at pécs hospital, the expert concluded that the applicant’s visible injuries, namely the hyperaemia on his face and a minor wound in his mouth, might have resulted from a single slap inflicted with medium force – the wound being caused by the canine tooth colliding with the mucous membrane.14.  the applicant lodged a complaint against the prosecutor’s decision, arguing, among other things, that the authorities had failed to organise a confrontation between him and the police officer in charge in order to resolve the discrepancies in their statements, or an identification parade in order for the applicant to identify the police officers involved.
the applicant company claimed that the refusal of the customs office to approve the value of the goods provided by it in accordance with the transaction value method was unfounded, as was the conclusion that the applicant company and seller company were related.according to the applicant company, it was necessary to refer the following questions to the cjeu: - (1) whether the conditions specified in article 29 § 1 (b) of the community customs code, which influence the sale and price of the goods and whose effect cannot be assessed, include cases such as the one at hand, where at the time of presentation of the goods to customs and the assessment of those goods a debt of buyer to seller exists?- (3) if the seller authorises the buyer’s employees to perform certain actions related to the transportation and the customs procedures of the goods, can this be considered a relationship between buyer and seller, within the meaning of article 29 § 1 (d) of the community customs code, and can it be grounds not to apply the transaction value method?- (5) is the provision of domestic law that the customs office use data existing in the customs department database when applying the transaction value method of similar and identical goods in accordance with article 31 § 1 of the community customs code, which provides that where the customs value of imported goods cannot be determined under articles 29 or 30, it must be determined on the basis of data available in the community?also, the mere fact that a party to the proceedings did not agree with the interpretation of the law provided by the first‑instance court did not mean that the substance of the european union law was not clear and that there was a necessity to refer the question to the cjeu (pastebėtina, kad vien faktinė aplinkybė, jog ginčo šalis nesutinka su pirmosios instancijos teismo pateiktu teisės aiškinimu, savaime nereiškia, jog nėra aiškus europos sąjungos teisės turinys, ir, atitinkamai, kad yra pagrindas kreiptis į estt prejudicinio sprendimo).
so all the steps taken in connection with that offence have been ultra vires and unlawful ... in this case, the criminal investigation and trial should be conducted from the start by the plenary constitutional court ... there is no concrete evidence that could justify pre-trial detention, and the accusations were based on abstract allegations ... [furthermore], in this particular case, the cumulative conditions for pre-trial detention were not met, and in any event, we are asking for alternative measures to be ordered ...” 20.  on the same day, the magistrate ordered the pre-trial detention of the applicant and the thirteen other suspects, holding as follows: “... in view of the fact that some suspects and their representatives contended that the ankara public prosecutor’s office and our court did not have jurisdiction [to deal with the case], it should be noted that in accordance with section 16(1) of law no.following an examination of the investigation file, the suspects’ pre-trial detention is ordered, regard being had to the nature of the alleged offence, the state of the evidence, [all the] records included in the file, the decisions of 17 july 2016 by the presidents’ offices at the court of cassation and the supreme administrative court, the reports on searches and seizures and the entire contents of the case file, and also the fact that there is concrete evidence giving rise to a strong suspicion that the offence in question has been committed.i recall that alparslan altan would write a dissenting opinion whenever a decision was not adopted [along the lines] that he wanted.” in her statement of 6 october 2016 the same witness said the following: “on the basis of my own observations, the contacts i had while working at the constitutional court as a rapporteur, and the comments and behaviour of rapporteurs whom i know to be members of this structure, i can say that the former member and rapporteur of the constitutional court alparslan altan was a member of this cemaat [the term ‘cemaat’ literally means ‘community’; however, at the time of the events, the term was commonly used to denote followers of fetullah gülen, the presumed head of the fetö/pdy organisation – hereinafter ‘the cemaat’].2.  the constitutional court’s assessment of the complaints concerning the lawfulness of the order for the applicant’s pre-trial detention and the alleged lack of reasonable suspicion justifying it 41.  addressing the complaint about the lawfulness of the applicant’s initial detention, the constitutional court held at the outset that this issue should be examined under article 15 of the constitution, by which, in an emergency, the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms could be partially or fully suspended, or measures derogating from the guarantees enshrined in the constitution for those rights and freedoms could be taken.for this reason, there is a situation of discovery in flagrante delicto at the time of the arrest of judges suspected of the offence of membership of an armed organisation.’ 128. having regard to the court of cassation judgments cited above, and to the fact that [the applicant] was arrested on suspicion of membership of the fetö/pdy organisation – deemed by the judicial authorities to constitute an armed terrorist organisation that premeditated the attempted coup – on 16 july 2016, at a time when [the authorities were taking steps to] defeat the coup attempt, it cannot be concluded that there was no factual and legal basis for the finding by the investigating bodies that the offence of membership of an armed terrorist organisation, of which [the applicant] was accused, involved a situation of discovery in flagrante delicto.
the forest ranger explained that the first applicant had exhibited a hostile attitude towards the forest rangers ever since his son, the third applicant, had been fined by the police, in spring 2011. he submitted that the first applicant had set a bad example for his community: “we consider that mr lingurar aron, who sees himself as being the leader of the roma in vâlcele, by his attitude, instead of helping us solve the problems connected with the roma community in vâlcele – which in fact is more peaceful and hard-working than the community in araci – creates more problems with the example he sets for the others.” 12.  in this context, and in order to reduce and prevent the criminal activity, to strengthen citizens’ safety, to identify individuals without identity documents, to summon those suspected of having committed several crimes and to recover stolen goods, the police organised the raid of 15 december 2011.... as a result of the preventive activity carried out by the [ipj] in araci village, six criminal groups have been identified, made up of members of roma families r., b., c., g., l., and n. [nb: the applicants’ family is not mentioned among them]” 14.  given the range of issues to be tackled and the goals of the raid, the intervention involved: fifty-three police officers (eleven from the department for public order, four from the department for criminal investigations, eighteen from the sfântu gheorghe police department, six from vâlcele police station, ten from the rapid intervention squad (serviciul de intervenție rapidă; “sir”), and two from the department for criminal forensics) and thirty gendarmes from the covasna gendarmerie inspectorate (inspectoratul județean de jandarmi covasna; hereinafter “the ijj”).25.  relying on the statements given by the forest ranger and the police, the prosecutor established that the forest ranger had not participated in the events, and that the raid had started at 7 a.m. and not at 5 a.m. as indicated by the applicants and their neighbours.30.  on 17 april 2013 the prosecutor-in-chief from the prosecutor’s office attached to the braşov court of appeal dismissed the objection on the following grounds: - the intervention had been lawful; - the applicants’ immobilisation and the use of handcuffs had been lawful and made necessary by their aggressive behaviour; they had therefore been taken to the police station, interviewed and fined; - the investigation had been completed; - the prosecutor had clarified all aspects of the case and examined the evidence gathered; - the decision had represented the prosecutor’s own conviction based on the evidence in the file, and the reasons given had been adequate; - the other assertions made by the applicants had not been substantiated by evidence.it therefore ordered the prosecutor: - to hear evidence from witnesses, in particular from other persons who had been targeted by that police intervention and neighbours who could clarify whether the police officers had entered the applicants’ home; - to hear the police officers involved in the operation and those responsible for mounting the operation, in order to find out who had given the order to immobilise the first and third applicants and who had carried out that order; - to establish how the immobilisation of the first and third applicants had happened; - to establish how the second and fourth applicants, who had not been immobilised by the police, had been injured; - to establish who had participated in the operation on behalf of the authorities, whether police officers, gendarmes or other individuals.
as can be seen from the video recording of the reconstruction and the relevant verbatim record of this investigative step (which have been provided by the government to the court), the investigator invited the applicant – referring to him as “a suspect” – to tell him about the circumstances of the crime that he had allegedly committed.25.  on 21 march 2006 the supreme court, sitting as a second-instance court, allowed an appeal lodged by the prosecution (having found that the gravity of the crime imputed to the defendants called for the imposition of more severe penalties) and remitted the case for fresh consideration, having also instructed the regional court to verify the allegations made by the defendants.in doing so, the court referred to various pieces of evidence, which included the identification of the applicant by n. and the fact that she had heard d. addressing the applicant by name when he had been stabbing her; the testimony of the applicant’s and g’s mothers; the results of forensic examinations, which had revealed, inter alia, that blood discovered on the applicant’s sweater had not belonged to him, contrary to his statements, but could have belonged to one of the victims; the statements of witnesses that they had seen the applicant and g. at dor.’s home during the evening of 10 december 2004; and the confessions made by the applicant “during the reconstruction of the crime scene carried out in the presence of his lawyer” and during other investigative actions conducted in the lawyer’s presence.it furthermore observed that at a different stage of the pre-trial investigation the applicant had given a similar detailed account of events that had tallied with the evidence given by n. the list of items of evidence referred to by the court in this context included the applicant’s voluntary surrender to the police and the “records of reconstructions of the crime scene”.it noted, inter alia, that the applicant’s guilt had been proved by the statements of n., who had witnessed the crime, and that the accuracy of her statements had been confirmed by other evidence, including by the fact that the applicant had given a similar account of events in his statement of surrender and confession to the police, together with the following statements that he had made.
12.  on 1 and 8 august 2003 a witness, mr i., was questioned by the police and stated that on the night of the murder he had seen the applicant in the victim’s backyard and that he had then, with blood on his hands, come to his house and told him that he had hit the victim.i. had not only made those statements in the course of the pre-trial investigation and in court but had also reiterated them in the course of face-to-face confrontations with the applicant and another witness in the course of the pre-trial investigation.37.  following a request by the applicant for the proceedings to be reopened, on 21 may 2009 five judges of the supreme court asked the plenary formation of the supreme court (consisting of all the judges of the court’s criminal and military divisions) to reopen the proceedings in the applicant’s case in view of the exceptional circumstances (see paragraph 42 below), to quash his sentence and to order a retrial.the judges argued, in particular: (i) that there was medical evidence in the file which indicated that the applicant had been seriously ill-treated in 2003, in particular by being hung by his elbows, (ii) that the investigation into his allegations in this regard had been superficial, and (iii) that the trial court had failed to comment on this.however, this is not why she described in the application the acts of torture but limited the application to a violation of article 6 of the convention only, leaving the acts of torture outside of the scope of the application... at the time the application was lodged in 2008-2009 the court was declaring applications under article 3 inadmissible where applicants failed to appeal to court against the prosecutor’s office’s decision not to institute criminal proceedings.” mr levytskyy went on to describe the court’s approach to the admissibility of such complaints adopted in kaverzin v. ukraine (no.
he stated that he was a fervent christian, which meant that he could not be a freemason, as the church had condemned freemasonry, that he had never been a member of the bulgarian communist party or the youth communist organisation, and that he had not been connected with the communist secret services, but had, on the contrary, all his life fought for human rights and democracy.12.  the city court referred to the applicant’s right to freedom of expression under article 10 of the convention, but considered that in the case he had overstepped the limits of acceptable criticism.as to k.t.’s affiliation with the communist secret services, this allegation had been disproved by the official attestations of the specialised body dealing with those services’ archives, and the witnesses brought by the applicant to prove this point had been unconvincing.had said that he was a member of the maltese order, the applicant had not shown that this was equivalent to freemasonry; it was irrelevant that the allegations made by the applicant had already been made in earlier publications, as this did not make them “less defamatory or truer”; the fact that k.t.let the shame be for their bosses in brussels.” 20.  the applicant also commented on the court, calling the former bulgarian judge s. botoucharova “communist” and “muscovite”, the next judge z. kalaydjieva an agent of the former security services, and the current bulgarian judge – a “communist infant”.
10.  on an unspecified date in 2011, the pula-pola county court, acting as the court of appeal, forwarded the applicant’s appeal and the pula-pola municipal court’s case file to the pula‑pola county state attorney’s office (županijsko državno odvjetništvo u puli-pola) for their examination and opinion.11.  on 7 december 2011 the pula-pola county state attorney’s office returned the case file to pula-pola county court accompanied by a submission which read as follows: “in the criminal case against slobodan kliba, accused of the criminal offence referred to in article 193 § 2 in conjunction with article 192 § 1 of the criminal code, the defence lodged an appeal against the judgment of the pula municipal court no.the criminal code was not violated and the sanction inflicted is appropriate, considering the type and seriousness of the criminal offence of which the accused was found guilty.13.  on 13 march 2012 the applicant, represented by lawyer v.d.l., lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) complaining, inter alia, that his right to a fair trial had been violated because the submission of the pula-pola county state attorney’s office had not been communicated to the defence.it held that the fact that the pula-pola county state attorney’s office submission of 12 july 2013 had not been forwarded to the applicant had not breached his constitutional rights, having regard to the content of the submission, the fact that he had been tried in summary proceedings and that he had not asked that he or his lawyer be invited to the session of the appeal panel.
12 to the convention, the applicants brought an action in the mureş county court seeking compensation equivalent to the “loyalty bonus” (spor de fidelitate) to which they felt they had been entitled in respect of their salary since december 2004. they complained that, although they had met the same requirements as all the other categories of judicial and non-judicial court staff (including judges and ancillary personnel) who had received the loyalty bonus in accordance with article 4 of ordinance no.on the merits of the case, the court relied on the laws regulating “confidentiality bonus[es]” (spor de confidenţialitate), noting that the applicants had to respect the confidentiality of the information to which they had access and for this reason concluded that they should be entitled to a “confidentiality bonus”, like other members of the judiciary and ancillary staff.they also raised an objection of unconstitutionality of articles 318 and 319 of the ccp, which in their view, by allowing for an open-ended possibility of lodging the extraordinary appeal, contradicted the right of access to court guaranteed by article 21 of the constitution and by article 6 § 1 of the convention, the latter having been incorporated into domestic law by article 20 of the constitution.the court of appeal referred to a completely different legal matter, which had not been brought before it by the parties, and thus dismissed as unfounded the appeal lodged by the ministry of justice without examining the arguments put before it by [the ministry of justice] by mistakenly copying the reasoning from a different decision, in which it had examined the issue of awarding a confidentiality bonus.” 18.  consequently, in the same hearing, the court of appeal allowed the extraordinary appeal and quashed the final decision.for this reason the court will not examine the remaining grounds of unlawfulness, will ... allow the appeal, and will ... reject the action lodged by the [applicants].” 19.  the applicants unsuccessfully lodged several extraordinary appeals against that decision, all of which were rejected by final decisions of the court of appeal (19 january 2010, 20 january 2010, and 4 february 2010).
13.  six reviews of the applicant’s detention were written by the applicant’s ‘caseworker’ between 4 march 2011 and 4 july 2011. brief reference was made to the report of dr a-d. inserted into the recital in each review of the applicant’s protracted immigration history was reference to "yet another psychiatric report", which had been "treated as a further request to revoke" the deportation order.while these would have diminished with the passage of time, there still needed to be safeguards if [the applicant] was released into the community and these were not put in place to the satisfaction of the court until 6 july 2011 when she was in fact released on bail.” 16.  the court of appeal refused the applicant permission to appeal its decision but permission was subsequently granted by the supreme court.26.  in the above circumstances the court of appeal concluded that the home secretary had unlawfully failed to apply the policy set out in para 55.10 of the manual when deciding to continue to detain [the applicant] between march and july 2011. this conclusion the home secretary now accepts.the defects in the reviews already filed speak for themselves.” 17.  he went on to comment: “34... realistically [the applicant] accepts that the proper application of the home secretary’s policy to her case in the light of the report of dr [a-d] would not have led to her immediate release in march 2011. she correctly contends that the report should have led the home secretary to make inquiries, most of which, judging by the contents of the reviews, seem never to have been made ... at least however, the limited period between march and her release on bail on 6 july 2011 makes one thing clear: even on the dubious assumption that proper application of her policy should in due course have led the home secretary to direct [the applicant]’s release, it is unrealistic to consider that the conditions necessary for her release would have been in place prior to 6 july 2011.35.  for the above reasons, in agreement with the court of appeal, i regard it as already clear that, although the home secretary unlawfully failed to apply her policy under para 55.10 of the manual to [the applicant]’s continued detention between march and july 2011, a lawful application of her policy would not have secured [the applicant]’s release from detention any earlier than the date of her actual release on bail.” 18.  lord wilson concluded: “37.... the overall refusal to release [the applicant] ... was procedurally flawed.
9.  immediately after the announcement of the preliminary results of the election, the applicant called on his supporters to gather at freedom square in central yerevan in order to protest against the irregularities which had allegedly occurred in the election process, announcing that the election had not been free and fair.16.  in the meantime, the applicant, who was on the platform, was approached by the head of the state protection department (spd) of the national security service, who was also the chief of the armenian president’s bodyguard team, and other spd officers.secondly, once violence had erupted on freedom square, because his security was in danger the applicant had been surrounded on the platform by the head of the spd and other spd officers and taken to the edge of the square, about 20 to 30 metres away, where he sat on a bench surrounded by spd officers.in a democracy you cannot arbitrarily detain political opponents.” 20.  on the same day the spd issued a statement that was broadcast on the public television channel, to the effect that spd officers had decided to remove the applicant from freedom square, pursuant to section 6 § 3 of the act on ensuring the security of persons subject to special state protection, in order to ensure his safety – as a former president of armenia subject to state protection – from any danger posed by the situation created during the police operation in the morning of 1 march 2008. the applicant had been removed from the square and taken to his house, which was similarly to be protected by the spd, pursuant to section 12 (2) of the same act.bearing in mind the necessity of ensuring the applicant’s security, as well as taking into account the fact that the applicant’s leaving his home might lead to unpredictable developments and pose a danger to his security, the spd – in the situation which had arisen – had warned the applicant that he must categorically refrain from attempting to leave his house, indicating that otherwise the spd could not bear responsibility for his safety, since they could not accompany him to an unlawful demonstration.
e (2001/7015) and 2001/4778, dated 21 march 2001, shows the most correct and clear path by holding: “(...) whereas, for a building, it is necessary to prepare the plan and the project, especially to make healthy static calculations, to build the building in accordance with such plan and project by using appropriate material in terms of both quality and quantity, and to inspect the compliance of all these features with the legislation in force; (...) that for example in a building considered as having a hidden defect, section 125 of the code of obligations, by the reference to the fourth paragraph of section 126 of the same law, prescribes a ten-year limitation period which starts from the date of the end of the construction works, that is the date of obtaining the building use permit or the date it is supposed to have been obtained; and that if the building collapses during this period, criminal liability may be invoked; but if the building collapses after the expiry of this period due to a defect because the criminal liability of the (authors) can no longer be invoked in so far as legally they no longer have the faculty to solve the problem, it is considered that there is no longer a causal link; that these considerations are also valid in case of grave fault (...).” our court also endorses this approach.15.  on different dates in 2004 and 2005 (see appended table) the 13th civil chamber of the court of cassation upheld the yalova civil court’s decisions of 19 july 2001. the 13th civil chamber ruled that, having regard to the documents and evidence in the case file, which were relied on by the first-instance court, and in particular to the expiry of the limitation period prescribed by section 125 of the former code of obligations, which started running from the date of the transfer of ownership of the properties in question, the applicants’ grounds for appeal had been unfounded.16.  meanwhile, on 1 july 2004, the 4th civil chamber of the court of cassation, in a similar case lodged by the applicants’ representative on behalf of other claimants, held that the limitation periods for claiming damages started running from the date of the earthquake, since at the time the unlawful act was committed by the defendants, that is, when the construction of the defective buildings was completed, the claimants had not suffered any actual loss.on that basis, it quashed the first-instance court’s judgment which had found, applying section 125 of the former code of obligations, that the lawsuit had been introduced following the expiry of a period of ten years from the issuance of the building use permit (see hayati çelebi and others, cited above, § 37, for the relevant parts of a similar decision by the 4th civil chamber of the court of cassation dated 11 december 2001).17.  on 5 september 2004 the applicants, except mr süleyman öner erdoğan, mr can erdoğan and ms nevzer zorlu, referring to, inter alia, the 4th civil chamber of the court of cassation’s decision of 1 july 2004 (see paragraph 16 above), made an application to the first presidency of the court of cassation requesting the harmonisation of the case-law of the 4th and 13th civil chambers of the court of cassation on the application of the limitation period to claims for damages arising from the earthquake of 17 august 1999.
6.  on 19 september 2015 the federal security service (‘the fsb”) and the investigations committee of the russian federation announced that criminal proceedings on suspicion of membership of a criminal gang and fraud had been opened against the governor of the komi republic, mr gaizer, one of his deputies, several high-ranking officials in the komi republic government, the speaker of the komi republic parliament and a representative of the komi republic in the upper chamber of the russian parliament.in such circumstances the municipal authority’s proposal to change the location of mr kablis’s public event was well reasoned and lawful ... the court considers that the refusal to approve the location for the reasons advanced in the [town administration’s] decision was lawful and acceptable ... the [town administration’s] decision of 21 september 2015 in mr kablis’s case was made within the time-limit established by law and contained reasons justifying the impossibility of holding the public event at the chosen location, a well-reasoned proposal to change the location and an explanation of the procedure for notifying public events.the [district] court correctly applied [the public events act] providing for the conditions for enjoying the right to peaceful assembly guaranteed by article 31 of the constitution ... having assessed the evidence in the case file, the [district] court made a correct finding that [the town administration’s] proposal to change the location of the public event chosen by the organisers had been substantiated, well reasoned and justified by the necessity to respect the balance of interests of the parties and to ensure public safety.they do not therefore warrant the quashing of the [district] court’s judgment ... the contested decision of [the town administration] was in accordance with [the public events act], was made within the municipal authorities’ powers and was in the interests of ensuring public order, with the aim of preventing disorder, protecting health and morality, and safeguarding the rights and freedoms of others.after citing article 10 of the convention and section 15.3 of the information act (see paragraph 36 below), and noting that the town administration had refused to approve “the picket” at the location chosen by the applicant, the court held: “despite the lack of approval for the public event, [the applicant] described the preparations for holding it on his page on a social networking site, vkontakte, and on his blog ..., calling on an unrestricted audience to participate in an unauthorised public event ... in the present case, access to the information published by the claimant was restricted because he had breached information distribution rules, in particular by distributing information containing calls for participation in a public event to be held in breach of the established procedure.
the court did not reply to the applicant’s argument that the town administration’s decision of 16 march 2017 refusing to approve the meeting had been annulled on judicial review and that the meeting had therefore to be considered as authorised and lawful, and the police’s order to stop it unlawful.she referred to the decision of 24 march 2017 by the vakhitovskiy district court declaring unlawful the town administration’s decision of 16 march 2017 refusing to approve the meeting and submitted that under article 227 § 8 of the code of administrative procedure (“the cap”), that decision was subject to immediate enforcement (see a summary of the domestic law provisions in lashmankin and others v. russia, nos.in reply to the applicant’s arguments that the meeting had been lawful and that the police’s order to stop it had been unlawful, the court held as follows: “counsel’s and [the applicant’s] arguments that she was innocent and had been unlawfully charged under [articles 19.3 and 20.2 § 2 of the cao] because there had been no corpus delicti [of the above offences] in her actions – as she had not breached applicable statutory requirements, her guilt had not been proven by the material in the case file and the police officer’s order to stop the public event had been unlawful – are unsubstantiated.the arguments advanced by [the applicant] contradict the facts established during the examination of the case and are disproved by the evidence, which cumulatively shows that [the applicant] disobeyed a lawful order by a police officer who was fulfilling his duty to safeguard public order and ensure public safety.” the court then extensively cited the applicable provisions of the domestic law (see a summary of the domestic law provisions in lashmankin and others, cited above, §§ 226-32) and continued: “a comprehensive analysis of the applicable legal provisions and the facts of the present case leads [the court] to conclude that in the present case the organiser of the public event did not fully comply with the procedure for organising and holding public events, which rendered the public event unlawful.the argument that the public event was to be considered as approved not only after receipt by the organiser of [the local authorities’] approval, but also if [the local authorities] have not provided the organiser with a well-reasoned proposal for a change of location or time of the event within the statutory time-limit is invalid.
4.  is the infringement sufficiently serious if the supreme court of a member state denies, in administrative proceedings, an individual’s right to tax deduction without analysing the underlying provision of european law directly or referring the case for a preliminary ruling, in circumstances where the reasoning of the refusal to refer the case [to the cjeu] is based on the supreme court’s reliance on a judgment of the [cjeu] adopted on a different subject and where this latter court has not yet adopted a ruling on the issue at hand?” 19.  on 2 october 2013 the kúria dismissed in a procedural order (végzés) the applicant’s request for a preliminary ruling.23.  the applicant’s constitutional complaint contained the following passages: “the complainant ... does not want to call into question the merits of the kúria’s impugned judgment in the present procedure [but rather complains that] the kúria acted unfairly in the review proceedings ... the kúria’s procedure was in breach of the claimant’s constitutional right to a fair trial, guaranteed by article xxviii (1) of the fundamental law, in so far as the kúria acted arbitrarily in omitting to refer the case for a preliminary ruling.iii of 1952) pertaining to the reference for a preliminary ruling, as in force at the material time, were set out in somorjai, cited above, §§ 28 and 36. article 361 of the old code of civil procedure provided as follows: “in order to provide redress following a constitutional complaint, the kúria shall decide as follows: ... (c)  if the constitutional court has quashed a judicial decision, [the kúria] shall ... remit the case to the first or second-instance court for new proceedings and a new decision; or order the adoption of a new decision in respect of an application for review.” 28.  the relevant european union law and the case-law of the cjeu pertaining to the preliminary ruling procedure was outlined in, among other authorities, somorjai (cited above, §§ 38-41) and baydar v. the netherlands (no....” 30.  article 17(2)(a) of the sixth directive (council directive 77/388/eec of 17 may 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the member states relating to turnover taxes), as amended by article 28f thereof, provides: “in so far as the goods and services are used for the purposes of his taxable transactions, the taxable person shall be entitled to deduct from the tax which he is liable to pay: (a) [vat] due or paid within the territory of the country in respect of goods or services supplied or to be supplied to him by another taxable person; ...” 31.  in its köbler judgment (c-224/01, eu:c:2003:513, point 1 of the operative part), the cjeu ruled as follows: “the principle that member states are obliged to make good damage caused to individuals by infringements of community law for which they are responsible is also applicable where the alleged infringement stems from a decision of a court adjudicating at last instance where the rule of community law infringed is intended to confer rights on individuals, the breach is sufficiently serious and there is a direct causal link between that breach and the loss or damage sustained by the injured parties.it is for the legal system of each member state to designate the court competent to determine disputes relating to that reparation.” 32.  in connection with the role of the national courts in application of european union law, the cjeu held, among other things, as follows (see, respectively, joined cases c-430/93 and c-431/93 van schijndel, eu:c:1995:441, point 2 of the operative part; and c-2/06 kempter, eu:c:2008:78, paragraph 45): “community law does not require national courts to raise of their own motion an issue concerning the breach of provisions of community law where examination of that issue would oblige them to abandon the passive role assigned to them by going beyond the ambit of the dispute defined by the parties themselves and relying on facts and circumstances other than those on which the party with an interest in application of those provisions bases his claim.” “[w]hile community law does not require national courts to raise of their own motion a plea alleging infringement of community provisions where examination of that plea would oblige them to go beyond the ambit of the dispute as defined by the parties, they are obliged to raise of their own motion points of law based on binding community rules where, under national law, they must or may do so in relation to a binding rule of national law ...”
in the opinion of the judge it was implausible that a reopening of the investigation could lead to the discovery of new documents able to demonstrate the origin of the funds used to pay off the debt to bank s. the expert had already analysed all the documents available, which had been found not only in the headquarters of company s.m.i., but also in the archives of the court in milan (where other proceedings were ongoing).he considered that the claim had an “undetermined value”, however, the applicant had requested to establish the non‑existence of a debt of eur 4,662,778.93. therefore, on the basis of the latter value and the applicable rules, the president calculated the amount of court fees as being eur 6,000 and the variable part of the judge’s remuneration (la parte variabile del compenso spettante al giudice) as being eur 23,000 (eur 20,000 – in accordance with the relevant table – increased by 15%, given that the case had been referred to two judges) as well as eur 500 in reimbursement of judicial expenses.46.  in any case, having examined all the evidence, in the court’s view, the declaration of falsity of the first part of the statement made by b. under oath did not necessarily impact upon the quantification of the debt since (i) all the parties to the contract of 20 march 1990 had acted under the instructions of the same mastermind (b.50.  on 19 october 2015 the president dismissed the application for leave to appeal on the grounds that: (i) most of the applicant’s grounds of appeal concerned the merits of the case (which, under the relevant law, cannot constitute a ground of appeal against judgments of the court for trusts, see paragraph 57 below), (ii) in the first-instance proceedings before the court for trusts, the applicant had not given evidence of any payments made by company s.m.i.55.  the judge observed that, on the one hand, the court had considered that the first part of the “supplementary oath” had been false on the basis of the rules governing contracts of mandate and in the light of the evidence of the operations carried out by company s.m.i.
the applicant had become aware of that during his stay in sofia in may 2009. he expressed his indignation about the works undertaken, as well as doubts as to their legality, and requested to be sent copies of all documents concerning them, stating that he intended to bring the matter to court.in his complaint he stated that he had become aware of the applicant’s letter “by chance”, and claimed that the applicant had defamed him, in particular by stating that he had an “illegal notarial deed ... acquired on the basis of a forged notarial deed”.10.  in a decision of the sofia district court of 18 october 2012, the criminal prosecution of the applicant was discontinued as time-barred, and the examination of the case continued only as regards a.k.’s tort action.11.  that action was allowed in a judgment of the sofia district court of 30 january 2014. the domestic court stated expressly in that judgment that it did not have to establish the elements of the criminal offence of defamation.the construction works had been carried out in 2006 and 2007. a representative of the building control authorities had visited the site on 2 july 2009 and had established breaches of the relevant rules, but no administrative sanction had been ordered against a.k.
6.  the case concerns “non-contentious” proceedings for the return of the child instituted on 13 october 2011 in which the domestic courts refused to order the return of the applicant’s son to the united states after the child’s mother (a croatian national and the applicant’s former wife) had in august 2011 “wrongfully retained” him in croatia within the meaning of the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction (“the hague convention”).the relevant part of the county court’s decision reads as follows: “... the first-instance court based [its] decision in part on undisputed facts, and in the relevant part on the arguments and evidence submitted by the counterparty ... even though it failed to give an opportunity to the petitioner to comment on them ... [t]herefore, the petitioner’s appeal has to be allowed, the first-instance decision quashed and the case remitted ... in the fresh proceedings, the first-instance court shall correct the above error by scheduling a hearing (section 309(5) of the family act) at which it shall, together with the parties (sections 297-298 of the civil procedure act), examine the circumstances of the case.” 8.  in the fresh proceedings the municipal court obtained an opinion from a forensic expert in psychiatry on whether returning the child to the united states would expose him to psychological harm – that is, to a risk envisaged in article 13 paragraph 1 (b) of the hague convention (see paragraph 27 below with further references).this decision was upheld on appeal by the zagreb county court on 22 october 2014. the municipal court justified its decision not to hold a hearing in the following way: “... the court did not take evidence by hearing the parties because that would significantly protract the proceedings, bearing in mind that in their testimonies – precisely because they have a personal stake in the outcome of the proceedings and their objectivity is very questionable – the parties mostly want to praise and present themselves in the best light while discrediting the opposing party ... [s]uch testimonies are [therefore] generally not at all suitable [in terms of assisting a court in establishing the facts of a case] and reaching a decision.” 9.  those return proceedings (see paragraphs 6-8 above) were already subject to the examination by the court.more specifically, the applicant submitted that the ordinary courts had not held a single hearing in the case and that the first‑instance court had not informed him of its decision to obtain an opinion from a forensic expert in psychiatry, thus preventing him from objecting to the choice of expert.it served its decision on his representative on 4 december 2015. the constitutional court examined only the alleged violation of the applicant’s right to fair procedure, because it considered that the alleged violation of his right to family life had been addressed by the court in the first adžić case (see paragraph 9 above).
12.  in the meantime, it appears that the district judge returned the case to the prosecutor, which entailed, apparently, modifying the legal basis for the applicant’s detention pending trial (article 255 of the ccrp) or pending investigation (article 109 of the ccrp); this in turn necessitated the re‑calculation of the respective periods of detention.those circumstances cannot be contested during the examination of another case between the same parties ... thus, it was correctly taken into account that the regional court of the komi republic had stated in its decision of 25 may 2012 (in reply to an application for release) that the detention from 19 february to 27 april 2004 had been lawful.” 23.  on 12 january 2008 the authorities in syktyvkar opened criminal proceedings against the applicants and others under article 210 of the criminal code in respect of the creation and functioning of a “criminal community” (преступное сообщество).the judgment also reads as follows: “having obtained the investigator’s approval, the press officer of the regional department of the federal security service provided the respondent with information about the criminal investigation opened in respect of the claimant and [the] implication [of his involvement] in the criminal community ... the investigating authority was interested in receiving further information, in particular as regards possible eyewitnesses to the crimes.having listed the relevant provisions of article 5 of the convention, the ccrp and the code of civil procedure as well as the procedural history of the criminal case (see paragraphs 33-34 above), the court concluded that the applicant’s detention during the impugned period had been in compliance with the legislation in force at the time in question; that the head of the remand centre had had no legal basis for releasing the applicant, having information that the criminal case had been pending before a trial court.thus, [the applicant’s] detention from 19 february to 29 april 2004 had been lawful ... the court was correct to dismiss the argument that, receiving no extension decision, the head of the remand centre should have released [the applicant] after 19 february 2004 ... article 255 § 2 of the ccrp provides that the detention pending trial should not exceed six months, except for situations listed in paragraph 3 ... thereafter, the relevant court can extend detention in cases relating to serious and particularly serious offences ... thus, given that the criminal case was submitted for trial before the syktyvkar town court and taking note of the decision of 21 april 2004 (in the part relating to the dismissal of the application for release), this decision should be de facto considered as a decision to extend [the applicant’s] detention within the time-limits mentioned in article 255 of the ccrp ...”
6.  in a decision of 20 may 1996 the competent body, the oryahovo land commission, held that the heirs of the applicant’s father (the applicant and her sister) were entitled to the restitution of, inter alia, a plot of land of 11,800 square metres enlisted as “forest”.10.  in 2012, responding to a letter from the applicant, the ministry of agriculture and forests informed her that the completion of the restitution procedure as concerns plots under section 4 was within the competence of the municipality.in a letter dated 21 august 2013 the department, while confirming that the municipality had no competence as concerns this plot, explained that the applicant had had to do one of the following: either have the exact borders of her plot identified in a different procedure, which had already been completed, concerning land which is not covered by section 4; or apply for the restitution of the land under the forests restitution act, for which the relevant time-limits had already expired (see paragraph 22 below).14.  in another letter dated 11 april 2017, replying to a further request by the applicant to finalise the restitution procedure, the oryahovo agriculture department stated that its decision of 20 may 1996, indicating that the applicant’s plot was covered by section 4 and was to be restituted under the procedure concerning such plots, was final, and that the time-limit for seeking its revocation or rectification had expired.19.  the necessity to submit those documents was reiterated in three additional letters sent to the applicant by the oryahovo agriculture department, dated 23 october and 15 and 23 november 2017. in the meantime, the department requested ex officio from the municipality any relevant documents concerning the procedure conducted by the latter under section 4. it appears that there were no other relevant developments after that.
the opinion was submitted to the court on 11 april 2003. the expert was questioned at a hearing on 3 july 2003. on 27 january 2004 another expert submitted a complementary opinion, at the request of the court.19.  at a hearing on 23 july 2008 the court questioned the expert and requested the preparation of another expert opinion on the value of the plot of land.27.  on 9 december 2004 the applicant lodged a complaint with the gliwice regional court under the law of 17 june 2004 on complaint about breach of the right to have a case examined in judicial proceedings without undue delay (ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki – “the 2004 act”).iii s 36/04) the gliwice regional court rejected the claim on formal grounds, having found that the applicant “had not specified the circumstances on which her complaint had been based.” 29.  subsequently, the applicant lodged another complaint under the 2004 act.as regards the period prior to september 2004, the court relied on the supreme court’s jurisprudence and held that the 2004 act applied to delays caused by the court’s inactivity occurring before that date but only if that delay still continued; what had not been the case in the case under the consideration.
it furthermore added that: “... the request (lodged after the publication of the [election] announcement) for a change to the ethnicity entry was aimed exclusively at the attainment of another [electoral] right that would have put other judges (who had attained their right related to the election of [new] members to [the sjc]), in a disadvantageous position.the judgment, in which the court cited the wording of provisions of the act and the general administrative procedure act (see paragraphs 19, 23 and 24 below), stated, inter alia, that: “... [the applicant requested] the modification of his ethnicity entry in the electoral roll after the [publication of] the announcement of the election of [new] members to the sjc, in which he ... participates.[the applicant], as a bulgarian, enjoyed rights related to the election of members to the sjc [given the fact that] he had declared himself in the electoral rolls of [2006, 2008 and 2010] as bulgarian ... ... [the ministry’s] decision is based on the state judicial council act and the general administrative procedure act ... ... [t]he court examined and rejected as ill-founded [the applicant’s] allegations that the impugned decision had restricted his right to assert his own ethnic identity.[the ministry’s] refusal [to do so] cannot be regarded as a restriction on his right to assert his ethnic identity, given that the modification in question was sought after the announcement of the election of [new] members to the sjc had been published.” 16.  on 5 october 2012 the applicant submitted himself for election as a member of the sjc.17.  by a letter of 3 december 2012, the sjc informed the applicant that it had struck his name out of the general list of candidates for election to the sjc to be selected from judges of the courts within the territorial jurisdiction of the štip court of appeal.
7.  on 23 march 2010, upon an appeal by the applicant, the sumy regional court of appeal (“the regional court”) quashed the judgment of 12 january 2010 and remitted the case for retrial.the applicant also submitted that, having been bound by an undertaking not to abscond throughout the first round of the proceedings, he had never attempted to abscond or to obstruct the investigation and had dutifully complied with all his procedural obligations.10.  on several further occasions (in particular, on 13 july, 29 september and 7 december 2010) the applicant lodged similar requests for release; the court rejected each such application on the date on which it was lodged, referring to the seriousness of the offences imputed to the applicant and to the lack of any valid reasons justifying his release.11.  on 10 february 2011 the applicant again asked to be released from custody pending the proceedings against him, reiterating his previous arguments and emphasising that it was very difficult while in detention to keep to his special diet and secure the necessary medical supervision for his chronic medical conditions.referring to article 5 of the convention, the court noted that, regard being had to the applicant’s character (in particular, his age, health, family and social status, the absence of a prior criminal record and his positive character references), there was no reason to consider that he would abscond, obstruct the investigation or engage in criminal activity if released pending trial.
as a result of the investigation of the criminal case it has not been established that the officials of [the agency] have failed to perform properly their official duties or have used their official capacity to the detriment of the interests of their service...” 13.  the applicant subsequently demanded that the agency return the amd 75,820,000 paid to its account.the relevant part of the judgment read as follows: “article 1099 § 4 provides that monetary assets and other property given in fulfilment of non-existent obligations are not subject to return as unjust enrichment if the acquirer proves that the person demanding return of the property had knowledge of the absence of an obligation ... as a result of the examination of the materials of the civil case it has been revealed that the claimant returned the amount in question on the basis of [the agency’s] demand which was not based either on the law or ... on a contract.as regards [the applicant’s] argument that [the agency] had informed her that the general prosecutor’s office was investigating matters relating to the ... agreement concluded with her, as a result of which she had been confused and therefore had returned the amount to [the agency]; the court of appeal notes in this respect that this argument may serve as an independent legal basis to dispute [the agency’s] actions in judicial proceedings ...” 22.  the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law.she argued that in the course of the proceedings it had not been substantiated that, when making the payment, she had been aware of the fact that she did not have any obligations towards the agency, since she had been informed to the contrary, namely that she had been overpaid and that she could be held criminally liable if she did not return the money.30.  for the purpose of implementation of construction projects in yerevan, the government decided to designate real estate (plots of land, buildings and constructions) situated within the administrative boundaries of the kentron district of yerevan as expropriation zones, to be taken for the needs of the state, with a total area of 345,000 square metres.
the city court held in particular that, in coming to the conclusion that the applicant had not proved that she had moved into the flat as a family member of her grandmother and in taking a decision to evict the applicant, the district court had not made any assessment of the fact that the applicant’s grandmother had initially brought the court proceedings together with the applicant and had never challenged the applicant’s right to occupy the flat.the city court also pointed out that the district court had not assessed other evidence submitted by the applicant confirming that she had carried out repair and decoration works in the flat, photographs of the applicant with her grandmother which had been taken in the disputed flat, or other evidence submitted by the applicant.the city court held in particular that in taking its decision in the case, the court of first instance had assessed all the evidence in the case, including the witness testimony, and had reasonably indicated that a. had acquired the right to use the disputed living premises because he had been moved into the flat as a tenant’s family member in accordance with the procedure provided for by law.the city court agreed with the conclusion of the court of first instance that the applicant’s claims had to be dismissed because the applicant had not proved that she had moved into the disputed flat and had shared the same household as the tenant, m., her grandmother.the city court further held that the grounds of the applicant’s appeal had aimed to reassess the evidence in the case, and that, given the fresh conclusion that the court of first instance had duly assessed the evidence before it, those grounds could not serve as a basis for quashing the judgment.
7.  in the course of the pre-trial investigation the applicant’s detention was extended a number of times, including on 15 november 2007, 17 january 2008 and 19 march 2008. the reasons for extending the applicant’s detention were the need to take additional investigative and procedural steps and the fact that there were no grounds to change the preventive measure.8.  on 19 may, 17 june, 26 june, 29 july and 7 august 2008 the courts further extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention, basing their decisions, in addition to the previously mentioned grounds (see paragraph 7 above), on the need for him to familiarise himself with the case file.9.  in the course of reviewing the extension of his detention on 24 september 2007, 8 january, 19 march and 7 august 2008, the applicant raised objections arguing, in particular, that his state of health had been unsatisfactory, that he had a stable family relationship, and that he had not absconded from justice.13.  according to the material in the case file, the applicant has suffered from varicose dilatation (варикозне розширення вен) since 1980. according to the government, the applicant was diagnosed with varicose dilatation of the lower limbs as early as in 1984.18.  on 22 april 2009 the sizo informed the applicant’s lawyer that he had been diagnosed with varicose dilatation of the lower limbs, third degree chronic venous insufficiency of the lower left limb, second degree chronic venous insufficiency of the lower right limb, hypothalamic dysfunction, impaired glucose tolerance, first degree diffuse non-toxic goiter (an enlarged thyroid) and a chronic trophic ulcer on the left shin.
14.  on 27 march 2007 the first applicant was examined at the voronezh regional forensic medical examination bureau by the same expert who recorded the following injuries on him: a wound on the right wrist joint measuring 1.4 to 0.4 centimetres, of an irregular-oval shape, with uneven edges and rounded ends, under firm brownish scab rising over the skin level; an abrasion on the left wrist joint measuring 1.4 to 0.8 centimetres, of an irregular-oval shape, under firm brownish scab entirely coming off here and there; stripe-shaped abrasions on the wrists under firm brownish scabs entirely coming off here and there, measuring 3.5 to 0.4 centimetres (on the front side of the right wrist joint), 5.5 to 0.4 centimetres (on the back side of the right wrist joint) and 3.7 to 0.4 centimetres (on the back side of the left wrist joint).all refusals were annulled by the investigators’ superiors because they were based on incomplete inquiries and additional inquiries were ordered: -  refusal of 20 april 2007, annulled on 19 september 2007; -  refusal of 29 september 2007, annulled on 2 october 2007; -  refusal of 12 october 2007, annulled on 28 november 2007; -  refusal of 10 december 2007, annulled on 15 january 2008; -  refusal of 25 january 2008, annulled on 11 february 2011; -  refusal of 24 february 2011, annulled on 15 april 2011; -  refusal of 28 april 2011, annulled on 6 july 2011; and -  refusal of 8 july 2011 (on the grounds that the injuries could have been inflicted before the first applicant’s arrest and that the applicant had no injuries which could have been inflicted by electric current), annulled on 28 august 2015 (because the investigator failed, inter alia, to identify all police officers who had allegedly ill-treated the applicant).in its decisions of 17 may 2007 (concerning both applicants, upheld on appeal by the voronezh regional court on 5 june 2007), 8 june 2007 (concerning the second applicant, upheld on appeal on 3 july 2007), 9 june 2007 (concerning the first applicant, upheld on appeal on 26 june 2007) and 6 september and 12 december 2007 (concerning the second applicant, the latter decision upheld on appeal on 17 january 2008) the district court, after hearing the applicants and their lawyers who maintained their objections, granted the investigator’s requests and extended the applicants’ detention, stating that they were accused of the grave crimes and the grounds for the court’s initial decision to remand them in custody had not changed.31.  in its decisions for extension of the applicants’ detention of 6 march (concerning both applicants), 17 march 2008 (concerning the first applicant, upheld by the supreme court of russia on 20 may 2008) and 18 march 2008 (concerning the second applicant, upheld on appeal on 20 may 2008) the voronezh regional court relied on the gravity of multiple crimes of which the applicants stood accused (including banditry according to final charges), the risk of their re‑offending and the need to finalise investigative activities involving 36 victims and eight accused and their lawyers.and m.; the first applicant noted that those victims, not mentioned in the courts’ decisions, had acknowledged at the trial that they had actually not received any threats from the defendants), the first applicant’s criminal records, the defendants’ abuse of their rights by submitting multiple requests the majority of which had been rejected and the resultant protraction of the proceedings and the risk of the defendants exerting pressure on jurors.
12.  on 3 june 2016 the supreme court of the republic of udmurtiya re‑opened the applicant’s case at the request of the migration official and sent it for re-examination to the district court.14.  on 15 july, 7 november and 19 december 2016 and 27 january, 2 march and 10 april 2017 the oktyabrskiy district court of izhevsk allowed an application lodged by the bailiff for the postponement of the enforcement of the order of administrative removal by one month owing to the application of an interim measure by the court on 17 june 2016. the district court granted the bailiff’s request having relied on article 31.5 of the code of administrative offences ((“the cao”), see paragraph 21 below).however, the district court dismissed her arguments, having concluded that, “the grounds for the applicant’s detention had already been established by the court in the removal proceedings and the discontinuation of the enforcement proceedings in the circumstances of [the applicant’s] case is not provided for by article 31.7 of the cao” (see paragraph 22 below).15.  on 17 may 2017 the supreme court of the russian federation (“the supreme court”) examined the cassation appeal complaint of the applicant and reviewed the judgments issued in respect of his removal (see paragraph 13 above).the supreme court confirmed the judgments but discontinued the enforcement of administrative penalty in the form of the removal imposed on the applicant on 23 march 2016. the supreme court found that the applicant might be exposed to a risk of torture or ill-treatment in syria in the event of his return there.
6.  the facts presented below are based on the official version of the events contained in the trial judgment of 25 july 2006. at the time, the applicant was a military deputy prosecutor.the applicant also claimed that, in contravention of the applicable rules of criminal procedure, during the preparation of the verdict the trial judge had repeatedly left the deliberations room and that he had prepared the text of the verdict outside perm where the trial had been held.nor does the case file contain any material confirming the [applicant’s] allegations that [judge r.] made statements in public about the verdict he was drafting ... the allegations made in the statements of appeal do not constitute such evidence either.” 19.  on an unspecified date the applicant applied for a supervisory review of his conviction.21.  on 23 june 2009 the supreme court of the russian federation noted that the applicant had not been notified of the date and time of the supervisory review hearing, quashed the judgment of 26 january 2009 and remitted the matter for fresh consideration.the presidium ruled, inter alia, that the trial court’s reliance on the witnesses’ statements had been justified, given that those witnesses had been unable to attend the hearing and that their testimonies had not been the decisive or sole evidence in the applicant’s case.
7.  on 15 march 2013 a report was issued by a medical expert, indicating that the use of a cpap device was the most effective way to treat sleep apnoea and that the applicant’s condition was deteriorating because he had not been using a cpap device.on 29 october 2013, this request was also refused, on the grounds that there were no indications in the applicant’s medical history or in the document issued by the prison hospital that the applicant needed the device (see paragraph 16 below).10.  on 20 october 2014 the applicant lodged a complaint before the domestic courts, which he specified on 19 february 2015. he asked the court to award him 86,800 euros (eur) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage suffered in the period between 4 june 2012 and 20 october 2014. the applicant stated that while he had been detained in kaunas remand prison, he had asked the prison administration to allow him to have a cpap device to treat his sleep apnoea, as recommended to him by a doctor in the prison hospital (see paragraph 8 above).it stated that although the recommendation issued by the specialist contained a reference to possible complications, there was no information in the applicant’s case file to show that the inability to use a cpap device had had any negative consequences for his health.13.  on 12 july 2017 the applicant asked the prison department for a transfer to alytus correctional facility from vilnius correctional facility, where he had been transferred on 20 march 2015. the applicant submitted that he had been serving his sentence in premises for disabled persons but that he could be transferred to the standard dormitory-type premises.
as for the allegations that the children ran a grave risk of being exposed to physical or psychological harm at their father’s hands, it found as follows: “the evidence in the file proves without doubt that the father used physical force and a raised voice to discipline his children.it is therefore evident that nothing can justify a departure from this norm.” 14.  the first applicant appealed, and in a final decision of 30 march 2017 the bucharest court of appeal upheld the order to return the children.the court of appeal reassessed the allegations of grave risk for the children in italy and concluded as follows: “... it cannot be inferred that occasional acts of violence such as those which were proved by the recordings adduced in the file, would reoccur often enough to pose a grave risk ... under article 13 § 1 (b) of the hague convention ... ... it is reasonable to expect that the italian authorities would give the assurance that they would take the measures required by the [brussels ii bis regulation], so that the aim of the hague convention would be observed, namely that a child is not removed or retained in the name of rights linked to his person which are to a larger or lesser extent debatable.17.  a report of 29 may 2018 on the results of the counselling stated that the children refused contact with their father despite the first applicant’s efforts to encourage that relationship.on 13 july 2018 the court stayed the enforcement proceedings, at the first applicant’s request, on the grounds that the children’s refusal to go back to italy with their father had already been established.
the court referred to: the applicant’s conviction in russia, negative character references from the penal colony, the charges against him in uzbekistan, the international search warrant, the fact that the applicant had arrived in russia in 2007 seeking employment, and the absence of any history of persecution or ill-treatment in uzbekistan.16.  on 30 june 2016, the day the applicant finished serving his sentence and was released from the penal colony in the arkhangelsk region, he was immediately arrested by the authorities without having had the chance to contact his lawyer, who was present outside the penal colony at that time.17.  on the same day the applicant was taken to arkhangelsk airport, and he arrived at moscow domodedovo airport on the morning of 1 july 2016. between 9.49 a.m. and 12.28 p.m. the applicant’s representative sent faxes to the prosecutor general’s office and the domodedovo airport police station, informing them of the events and the fact that the interim measure had been indicated by the court.23.  on 26 july and 2 september 2016 the prosecutor general’s office informed the applicant’s representative that no extradition decision had been issued because the prosecution in respect of the charges in uzbekistan was time-barred; and that they had been informed about the interim measure indicated by the court only on 1 july 2016, after the deportation had taken place.in support of that assertion, she provided the following evidence: (a) a handwritten note (in uzbek with a russian translation) from the applicant’s mother dated 28 september 2017 and addressed to ms trenina, which stated that the applicant had expressed his wish to maintain the application during a meeting which he had had with her in the penal colony; (b) a handwritten affidavit from the applicant dated 12 october 2017 and addressed to ms trenina, which stated that he wished to maintain his application, that he had been subjected to ill-treatment during the investigation in uzbekistan, that he was being detained in inhuman conditions, that he had almost lost his eyesight, and that he had attempted to commit suicide while in detention; (c) a handwritten affidavit from the applicant dated 12 october 2017 and addressed to ms trenina, which described his deportation from russia and specifically mentioned that he had been in contact with his representatives via telephone throughout the deportation procedure on 30 june and 1 july 2016, and that the law-enforcement agents carrying out the deportation had been repeatedly informed of the indication of the interim measure by the court, but had chosen to ignore this information; (d) a report from ms rakhmatullayeva, the applicant’s lawyer in uzbekistan, dated 18 october 2017 and addressed to ms trenina, which stated that during a meeting in the penal colony – in the presence of an uzbek law-enforcement agent – the applicant had confirmed both his wish to maintain his application, despite his apparent fear of reprisal from the uzbek authorities, and the facts stated in the above-mentioned handwritten affidavits of 12 october 2017.
28.  the forensic opinion was prepared on 26 june 2012. on the basis of the medical documentation, including the police record dated 16 june 2011 and certificates dated 17 june 2011, the forensic opinion established that the applicant had sustained tenderness of his left temple, swelling of the left side of his face with bruising, swelling of the right wrist, and abrasions on his wrists and his back.with regard to the edw, the prosecutor stated: “the electroshock weapon was used in accordance with procedure, and only in respect of [the applicant], in the circumstances described by the police officer arresting him and owing to his non-compliance with the orders.” 36.  the prosecutor noted that the arrest of five people (two men and three women) had taken place in a flat, in fact in one room (with four people in it) in a very small space.despite the fact that the version of events presented by the applicant could not be entirely ruled out, the prosecutor, having regard to the principle of in dubio pro reo, decided to discontinue the investigation for lack of sufficient evidence for suspicion that the alleged offence had been committed.42.  the court noted that the cases and manner of use of coercive measures by the police was regulated in the ordinance of the council of ministers of 17 september 1990 on the use of coercive measures by the police.if a lawful order given by a police authority or police officer has not been complied with, a police officer may apply the following coercive measures: 1)  physical, technical and chemical means of restraining or escorting persons or of stopping vehicles; 2)  truncheons; 3)  water cannons; 4)  police dogs and horses; 5)  rubber bullets fired from firearms; 2.  police officers may apply only such coercive measures as correspond to the exigencies of a given situation and are necessary to have their orders obeyed.” 48.  the ordinance of the council of ministers of 17 september 1990 on the use of coercive measures by the police (rozporządzenie rady ministrów w sprawie określenia przypadków oraz warunków i sposobów użycia przez policjantów środków przymusu bezpośredniego) was issued on the basis of section 16(4) of the police act.
the first thing to be said is that these remarks must be viewed in the overall context of all that had taken place, which included the various responses of barry doyle regarding the death of his brother, the responses regarding his own family, his children by a previous relationship to his relationship with [g], as well as read or taken in the context of the limited answers he had given about living in limerick and the fact that he had conceded ... that being in custody on suspicion of the murder of [s.g.] was the lowest point in his life....” 48.  he then set out a series of considerations in support of according constitutional status to the right to the presence of a solicitor during questioning: the substantial length of detention permitted by law, allowing for multiple interviews throughout the day over a number of days; the daunting and frightening effect that detention may have on many people; even where the accused is a hardened criminal, the importance of preserving their rights too; the increasing complexity of the criminal law; the limits of judicial control, which prohibits rather than prevents abuse.viewed in that light, i am driven to the conclusion that such an important and fundamental standard of fairness in the administration of justice as the right of access to a lawyer must be deemed to be constitutional in it origin, and to classify it as merely legal would be to undermine its importance and the completeness of the protection of it which the courts are obliged to give.” 51.  in the case the people (dpp) v pringle (1981) 2 frewen 57, it was held by o’higgins cj that, in the absence of an express guarantee against self‑incrimination in the irish constitution, it was not possible to infer a right to have a solicitor present during questioning.however, it does need to be noted that the jurisprudence of both the ecthr and the united states supreme court clearly recognises that the entitlements of a suspect extend to having the relevant lawyer present.” 56.  in a concurring judgment, hardiman j stated: “for many years now judicial and legal authorities have pointed to the likelihood that our system’s option for the very widespread questioning of suspects who are held in custody for that purpose, was very likely to attract a right on the part of such suspects, not merely to be advised by lawyers before interrogation, but to have lawyers present at the interrogation, and enabled to intervene where appropriate.where a lawyer participates during questioning, the fact that such participation has taken place shall be noted using the recording procedure in accordance with the law of the member state concerned; (c)  member states shall ensure that suspects or accused persons shall have, as a minimum, the right for their lawyer to attend the following investigative or evidence‑gathering acts where those acts are provided for under national law and if the suspect or accused person is required or permitted to attend the act concerned: (i)  identity parades; (ii)  confrontations; (iii)  reconstructions of the scene of a crime.” 60.  for a detailed summary of the recitals and other relevant provisions of the directive see beuze v. belgium [gc], no.
19.  during his stay at the cmh, gegham sergoyan was examined by forensic medical expert a.d. of the republican centre of forensic medicine of the ministry of health of armenia (the republican centre of forensic medicine) who stated in his conclusion, inter alia, that the bullet had penetrated from the left side of the lower jaw and, according to descriptions contained in the medical records, it was directed from left to right and upwards from front to back.the order stated, inter alia, the following: “... the internal investigation has revealed the following: - the military unit command had not thoroughly examined [h.g.’s] moral character or his personal and professional preparation, there had been no proper control over the observance of the daily schedule; - the instructions from the personnel responsible for the daily timeline in the military unit had been of a formal nature; - there had been an unhealthy moral environment among the officers and draft soldiers... with a view to penalising the persons liable for the incident i order 1. the imposition [of the following penalties] a. a “reprimand” in respect of the commander of [the military unit] ... for poor supervision of personnel responsible for the daily timeline; b. a “strict reprimand” in respect of: - the deputy commander of [the military unit] ... for failure to organise properly [military] service; - the deputy commander of [the military unit] responsible for the armoury ... (in charge of the military unit on the day of the incident) ... - the deputy commander of [the military unit] responsible for working with the personnel ... for the tense moral environment among the officers and draft soldiers.32.  in the course of the proceedings before the syunik regional court the applicant lodged a civil claim against the republic of armenia, namely the ministry of defence and the ministry of finance of armenia, seeking compensation in the amount of eur 300,000 for non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the murder of his only son, which had caused him deep sorrow and severe mental suffering: he had lost the normal rhythm of life and his health had deteriorated.he further submitted that, although no possibility of compensation for non-pecuniary damage existed under armenian civil law, such a requirement existed under the convention: according to article 6 of the constitution ratified international treaties were a constituent part of the legal system of armenia and, in the case of inconsistency with the national law, the norms of the treaty should prevail.52.  the constitutional court found article 17 § 2 of the civil code incompatible with articles 3 § 2, 16 § 4, 18 § 1, 19 § 1 and 43 § 2 of the constitution in so far as it does not envisage non-pecuniary damage as a type of civil damages and does not provide for a possibility to obtain compensation for non-pecuniary damage by impeding the effective exercise of the right of access to court and the right to a fair trial and at the same time hindering due compliance with its international obligations by the republic of armenia.
5.  on 9 may 2005 the applicant lodged a claim seeking ownership of 265 shares of the company tri grozda a.d. beograd 6.  on 14 september 2007 the belgrade court of first instance delivered a judgment in favour of the applicant.7.  on 13 december 2011 the belgrade court of appeal reversed the judgment of 14 september 2007, and rejected the applicant’s claim.8.  on 3 april 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal, complaining of a violation of his right to a trial within a reasonable time and requesting compensation in that regard.9.  on 23 september 2014 the constitutional court found a violation of the applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time.it held that the finding of a violation had constituted sufficient just satisfaction in the particular circumstances of the present case for the following reasons.
given, moreover, that the contents of the interviews that had been conducted after the applicant had received legal assistance had not substantially differed from the content of the interview that had taken place without legal assistance, the regional court considered that the finding that a procedural requirement had not been complied with (vormverzuim) sufficed.14.  on 3 july 2013 the court of appeal (gerechtshof) of the hague quashed the decision of the regional court, convicted the applicant of the same offence and sentenced him to forty hours’ community service.as regards the claim that the applicant ought to have been assisted by a lawyer during the police interviews, the court of appeal held as follows: “at the hearing on appeal counsel submitted that at the time of the police interviews the suspect had the mental age of a 15 or 16-year old, and also that he was suffering from a brain disorder which may have caused him to have epileptic seizures.in the opinion of the court of appeal, the above does not entail an indication for the officers who interviewed the suspect that he had the mental age of a 15 or 16-year old, nor that the brain disorder from which the suspect is apparently suffering was capable of causing an epileptic seizure.this means in the light of the salduz case-law that the suspect, who was an adult at the time, was not entitled to have a lawyer present at his interview.” 15.  the court of appeal based its conviction of the applicant on the following evidence: -  a complaint lodged with the police by the victim, who claimed that in march 2009 (when she had been 16 years old), she had shown the applicant various parts of her body via webcam, that she had subsequently been told by a third party that the applicant had sent photographs of her to that third party, and that she had been told by two other parties that they had received photographs of her; -  a further statement made by the victim to the police, according to which she had taken a photograph of a part of her body and sent it to the applicant by mobile telephone; -  a statement made by the applicant to the police on 20 august 2009 to the effect that he had sent several photographs (showing parts of the victim’s body), one of which he had taken by means of a screen shot while the others had been sent to him by the victim, to a third party via mobile telephone and that he had also uploaded them onto an image-hosting website; -  a statement made by the aforementioned third party to the police, according to which she had received two photographs from the applicant showing parts of the victim’s body; and -  a record drawn up by a police officer whose investigations into the victim’s allegations had shown that the photographs showing part of the victim’s body were accessible on the world wide web via a profile with a name used by the applicant on the above-mentioned image-hosting website.
if one of the inmates were sick or refused to take part in the daily exercise, the administration cancelled it for all the inmates held in the same cell.on 21 march 2014 the regional prosecutor issued a notice to the head of the regional penal service (fsin), advising that the conditions of detention in the prison be brought in line with the statutory requirements.as to the issue of overcrowding, the prosecutor indicated as follows: “as regards the number of beds ... in the cells ... the [statutory] requirement of 4 sq.22.  on 10 october 2014, in response to a request by the applicant to meet with her family, the prosecutor general’s office responded that, as stipulated in the pre-trial detention act, suspects and defendants could have no more than two family visits per month, subject to written authorisation from the official or authority in charge of the criminal case, and advised the applicant to apply to the law-enforcement bodies in belarus for approval of her relatives’ visits.30.  on 5 february 2015 the lyublinskiy district court of moscow dismissed a complaint by the applicant against the decision of 16 february 2012. on 26 june 2015 the city court upheld the decision of 5 february 2015.
considering the gravity of the offence, the interests of protecting the legal order, and the fact that gathering evidence by other procedural means is either impossible or especially complicated, then, in the interests of elucidating the truth, the application is perfectly justified and lawful.” the other authorisations by preliminary investigation judges included variations of the same wording, occasionally also including references such as “when public officials abuse their position, it damages their credibility in the eyes of society and damages the state’s reputation” and “[t]his offence belongs to the category of offences relating to office.28.  against that background, the supreme court considered that the beginning of the relevant time period should be determined as follows: 25 september 2005 for the second applicant (when he had discovered a surveillance device in his office); 3 october 2006 for the first applicant (when his office had been searched); 3 october 2006 for the second applicant company and the third applicant, in relation to certain criminal incidents (when the premises of the company, including the office of the third applicant, had been searched); 20 september 2007 for the first applicant company and the third applicant, in relation to other criminal incidents (when the premises of the company had been searched); and 16 october 2007 for the fourth applicant (when he had been questioned as a suspect).the supreme court admitted that the organisation of the court hearings at first instance (not planning hearings sufficiently far in advance and not deciding on procedural matters quickly enough, thus allowing for long disputes between the parties), the volume and structure of the criminal file, and the presentation of the statement of charges (which had entailed unnecessary repetition and the structure of which had been illogical to some extent) might have added to the duration of the proceedings.furthermore, although it might have been reasonable for the prosecution to remove some of the material from the criminal file, the supreme court also considered that it had been for the defence representatives and not for the prosecution to decide whether some of the evidence in the criminal file was relevant from the perspective of the defence.40.  as the third applicant had raised the question of the compatibility of the regulation of secret surveillance with the constitution and the convention, the supreme court – also acting as a constitutional review court – analysed the regulation of the ccrp (the limitations as regards offences in respect of which secret surveillance could be conducted, the principle of foreseeability, and the permitted duration of surveillance).
on the same date servicemen from the shali district temporary department of the interior (“the vovd”) arrested him and placed him in a temporary detention ward on the premises of the vovd police station.26.  on the morning of 3 february 2002, when the applicant came to visit her husband in the vovd as usual, she was informed that mr ibragim idrisov had been released the day before, on 2 february 2002. meanwhile, mr ibragim idrisov’s gaz-2410 vehicle remained parked on the premises of the vovd.93.  on 13 january 2012 the ngo materi chechni, acting on behalf of the second applicant, asked the head of the chechen parliamentary committee on the search for the disappeared (комитет парламента чеченской республики по поиску лиц, без вести пропавших в период проведения контртеррористической операции) for assistance in the search of mr obrugov.157.  on 15 july 2011 the investigators questioned a police officer who had been working in the villages of tevzana and khatuni since 2001. he stated that in 2003 various units of the fsb, the ministry of the interior, the ministry of defence and the main intelligence service of the ministry of defence (6-й отдел гру) in grozny had been stationed on the outskirts of the village of khattuni.173.  on 8 november 2006 the investigators questioned mr a.s. (the father of ms tumisha sadykova), who stated in particular that some time after the abduction, two men (a colleague of his daughter named adam and a relative of his family) – both of whom had been engaged in the search for ms tumisha sadykova – had asked him to hand over to them the amount of money allegedly demanded by way of a ransom for her release.
6.  on 15 january 2014 the head of the inter-municipal police department forwarded the following letter to the psychiatric and narcological service: “following receipt of numerous complaints, the [police department] asks you to examine (check) [the applicant] ... at her place of residence.the court established that, contrary to the applicable legislation, the psychiatrist had failed to obtain the applicant’s consent to a psychiatric examination and that the applicant had objected to such an examination.the court interpreted the letter of 15 january 2014 issued by the police department as a request for information from the psychiatrist as to whether the applicant suffered from any mental illness.in 2012 the police had received numerous complaints from the applicant, who had alleged that she had been persecuted by unknown persons, and complaints from owners and employees of concession stands alleging that the applicant had destroyed their property and had disrupted their activities by making scenes.lastly, the court reasoned that the fact that, in response to the police’s request for information, the psychiatric service had examined the applicant unlawfully had no bearing on the lawfulness of the police’s actions.
8.  the first applicant is the mother of mr suliman (also spelled as suleyman) isayev, who was born in 1966, mr rumid isayev, who was born in 1969, and mr ramzan isayev, who was born in 1973. the second applicant is the wife of mr suliman isayev and the third applicant is the wife of mr ramzan isayev.37.  on 17 may 2007 the grozny district prosecutor’s office informed the first applicant and the ngo memorial that the investigation had been suspended and that the operational search activities were in progress in order to establish the whereabouts of mr suliman isayev and mr ramzan isayev.44.  on 31 march 2008 the grozy district court ordered the phone tapping of two mobile numbers belonging to ms g. 45.  on 8 april 2008 the zavodskoy district police station in grozny informed the investigators that no complaints concerning the alleged involvement of the isayev brothers into the abduction of people lodged by ms. g. were registered in the station’s logbooks.223.  on 13 may 2003 the investigators questioned mr ruslan sugatiyev’s brother, mr s.s. he confirmed the circumstances of the abduction as described above and additionally stated that the ural lorry, in which his brother had been taken away from the checkpoint on 8 february 2002, had been seen on several occasions entering the base of the 34 obron military unit.240.  the present application concerns the abduction of the applicants’ relative in the course of the same special operation carried out by the russian federal forces in avtury in may 2002 as in the case of mezhidovy v. russia (see mezhidovy and others v. russia [committee], nos.
the representative of the inspectorate was not present when the judgment was delivered, despite having been duly informed of the date and the time of the hearing.the applicant company objected to the appeal and argued that it had been lodged outside the thirty‑day time-limit and that the inspectorate had not requested an extension of the legal time-limit for lodging it.it argued that the chişinău court of appeal could not strike out the appeal after having commenced its examination of the merits of the case.10.  on 8 october 2014 the supreme court of justice quashed the chişinău court of appeal’s strike-out decision of 3 september 2014. without contesting the court of appeal’s calculation of the time-limit for lodging the appeal, the supreme court of justice accepted the argument put forward by the inspectorate and found that the court of appeal had breached the rules of procedure by adopting a strike-out decision after having started an examination of the merits of the case.11.  on 28 january 2015, after rehearing the case, the chişinău court of appeal upheld the inspectorate’s appeal, quashed the judgment of the străşeni district court of 26 december 2013 and rendered a new judgment whereby the applicant company’s action was rejected as ill-founded.
on each occasion it was noted that the instructions, given to the investigator by the prosecutor and the head of the criminal investigations department, to carry out procedural measures aimed at establishing the existence of the circumstances mentioned in the applicant’s complaint and the circumstances surrounding z.’s death, had not been complied with.13.  on the same day the first deputy prosecutor of the regional prosecutor’s office held that there had been a failure to comply with the law and the requirement of promptness in carrying out the inquiry into z.’s death by the officers of the criminal investigations department and the police department, which had violated the applicant’s rights.in order to establish the circumstances of the incident and the reasons and the motives for the suicide, the chief investigator considered it necessary to carry out investigative measures involving, in particular, specialists and experts in psychology and psychiatry, which was only possible in the framework of a criminal investigation.18.  following another round of pre-investigation inquiries, on 24 october 2011 the institution of a criminal investigation into the death of z. was again refused under article 24 § 1 (2) of the code of criminal procedure, in view of a lack of the constituent elements of a crime under article 110 of the criminal code in ch.’s actions and the absence of any crime under article 105 § 1 of the criminal code (murder).20.  in the meantime, on 8 may 2008 it had been established by the investigator that ch.’s actions in respect of z. contained the elements of a criminal offence under article 117 § 1 of the criminal code (causing physical suffering by inflicting regular beatings) for the period between 19 june 2006 and 8 may 2007. the relevant material was submitted for a pre-investigation inquiry to the nenetskiy autonomous region police department.
the case file contains documents constituting state secrets and the disclosure of such information might entail a serious violation of the [interests] of society and the state.” 12.  on 10 september 2009 the main national television channel broadcast a programme on the circumstances of the criminal case against the applicant.regard being had to the above, the court accepts that the exact value of the house owned by the plaintiffs, the exact amount of their incomes and the exact amount of their real property, in the circumstances of the case, are immaterial.... according to the investment agreement ... the value of the house was estimated at ... usd 60,000 ..., which did not include the cost of the interior, including the installation of a winding staircase and a jacuzzi ... [one of the plaintiffs’ witnesses] submitted that [the applicant] had been offered a reduced price for the house because of his friendship with the management of the construction company ... [the court] finds it incompatible with the standing of the prosecutor.[the court] further takes into account that the plaintiffs had their title to the house registered on the basis of the purchase agreement ... accordingly, in addition to the amount paid under the investment agreement ... the plaintiffs paid a significant sum of money which exceeded their income ... and the amount they received when they sold their three‑roomed flat ... for the equivalent of usd 50,000 ... ... pursuant to [the russian federal law on the mass media], a journalist must obtain consent for the disclosure of information concerning a person’s private life from that person or his representative, except when such disclosure is necessary for the protection of public interests.... according to ms samoylova (the applicant’s wife and a plaintiff), the moscow city court is examining a criminal case against [the applicant] ... [the court considers] that the journalist presented to the public his opinion that there is evidence confirming that [the applicant] is implicated in the commission of the offences he is charged with; [the journalist] commented on the criminal investigation, showed evidence collected and assessed it.
the constitutional court further rejected the applicants’ claim that it would have been more appropriate to take the property by means of outright purchase, as they had not requested the lab to order the commissioner of land to take such a course of action under the mentioned article 19. the law granted the commissioner of land discretion as to which form of taking it would undertake and the constitutional court’s role was limited to verifying whether the form of taking which was actually used breached the rights of an individual.while the applicants claimed compensation of around eur 50,000 the constitutional court noted that the sale value according to the applicant’s ex-parte architect in 2005 was eur 17,470.30 and that in 2011, according to the technical experts of the board, it was eur 10,575.36. thus, given the small size of the property, the area in which it was in, the fact that it had been demolished at the expense of the government and the fact that the recognition rent was adequate, the constitutional court considered that eur 1,500 was an adequate amount of compensation to be shared by the applicants jointly.it reads as follows: “the competent authority may acquire any land required for any public purpose, either - (a) by the absolute purchase thereof; or (b) for the possession and use thereof for a stated time, or during such time as the exigencies of the public purpose shall require; or (c) on public tenure: provided that after a competent authority has acquired any land for possession and use or on public tenure the conversion into public tenure or into absolute ownership of the terms upon which such land is held shall always be deemed to be an acquisition of land required for a public purpose and to be in the public interest: provided also that, subject to the provisions of articles 14, 15 and 16, a competent authority may acquire land partly by one and partly by another or others of the methods in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c): provided further that where the land is to be acquired on behalf and for the use of a third party for a purpose connected with or ancillary to the public interest or utility, the acquisition shall, in every case, be by the absolute purchase of the land.” 32.  section 13 regarding compensation read, in so far as relevant, as follows: “(1) the amount of compensation to be paid for any land required by a competent authority may be determined at any time by agreement between the competent authority and the owner, saving the provisions contained in subarticle (2).(2) the compensation shall in the case of acquisition of land for temporary possession and use be an acquisition rent and in the case of acquisition of land on public tenure be a recognition rent determined in either case in accordance with the relevant provisions contained in article 27.” 33.  the ordinance provided that compensation in respect of absolute purchase was to be calculated in accordance with the applicable “fair rent”, as agreed by the parties following the government’s offer or as established by the lab.in respect of public tenure, section 27(13) of the ordinance provided as follows: “the compensation in respect of the acquisition of any land on public tenure shall be equal to the acquisition rent assessable in respect thereof in accordance with the provisions contained in subarticles (2) to (12), inclusive, of this article, increased (a) by forty per centum (40%) in the case of an old urban tenement and (b) by twenty per centum (20%) in the case of agricultural land.” 34.  in so far as relevant, section 19(1) and (5) read as follows: “(1) when land has been acquired by a competent authority for use and possession during such time as the exigencies of the public purpose shall require, the owner may, after the lapse of ten years from the date when possession was taken by the competent authority, apply to the board for an order that the land be purchased or acquired on public tenure or vacated within a period of one year from the date of the order, and the land shall either be vacated or acquired on public tenure or purchased upon compensation to be determined in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance or of any ordinance amending or substituted for this ordinance.
having considered the judgment, the action plan provided and the advice of its secretariat, the committee adopted the following decision: “the deputies 1.  as regards individual measures and considering the circumstances of the case, called upon the authorities, to ensure the applicant’s release without delay; 2.  in view of the preoccupying reports about the applicant’s health condition, called upon the authorities to urgently take any necessary action and provide rapidly information in this respect; 3.  invited the authorities to indicate the further measures taken or planned in order to give effect to the court’s judgment, and to erase rapidly, as far as possible, the remaining consequences for the applicant of the serious violations established; 4.  noted, in this context, that the criminal proceedings, the initiation of which was criticised by the european court, are still pending before the supreme court; 5.  recalled the general problem of the arbitrary application of criminal legislation to restrict freedom of expression and conveyed their particular concern about the finding of a violation of article 18 taken in conjunction with article 5 of the convention; 6.  therefore called upon the azerbaijani authorities to furnish, without delay, concrete and comprehensive information on the measures taken and/or planned to avoid that criminal proceedings are instituted without a legitimate basis and to ensure effective judicial review of such attempts by the prosecutor’s office; 7.  expressed concern about the repetitive nature of the breach of the principle of presumption of innocence by the prosecutor general’s office and members of the government, despite several judgments of the court which, since 2010, have indicated the precise requirements of the convention in this regard, and insisted on the necessity of rapid and decisive action in order to prevent similar violations in the future; ...” 46.  during this period, the committee of ministers was informed in the context of the individual measures that mr mammadov had initiated a cassation appeal against the decision of the shaki court of appeal of 24 september 2014 (see paragraphs 21-22 above) to the supreme court.recalling that the obligation to abide by the judgments of the court is unconditional; insists that the highest competent authorities of the respondent state take all necessary measures to ensure without further delay ilgar mammadov’s release; declares the committee’s resolve to ensure, with all means available to the organisation, azerbaijan’s compliance with its obligations under this judgment; decides in view thereof to examine the applicant’s situation at each regular and human rights meeting of the committee until such time as he is released.” 58.  the final decision adopted during this period at its 1273rd human rights meeting (6-8 december 2016) stated: “the deputies 1.  noting with the utmost concern that, more than two years after the final judgment of the european court and notwithstanding the repeated calls of the committee of ministers and the secretary general on the respondent state to release the applicant, he remains detained; 2.  recalling the previous decisions and interim resolutions adopted by the committee of ministers, particularly the repeated calls of the committee for the immediate release of the applicant; 3.  deeply deplored that the criminal proceedings against the applicant concluded on 18 november 2016 before the supreme court without the consequences of the violations found by the european court having been drawn, in particular, that of article 18 taken in conjunction with article 5 of the convention; 4.  firmly reiterated that it is not acceptable that, in a state subject to the rule of law, an individual remains deprived of his liberty on the basis of proceedings carried out in violation of the convention in order to punish him for having criticised the government and that, in consequence, the continuing arbitrary detention of ilgar mammadov constitutes a flagrant breach of the obligations under article 46, paragraph 1, of the convention; 5.  affirmed their determination to ensure the implementation of the judgment by actively considering using all the means at the disposal of the organisation, including under article 46, paragraph 4 of the european convention on human rights; 6.  finally expressed their deep concern about the absence of any information from the authorities concerning the general measures taken or envisaged to prevent violations of the rule of law through abuse of power of the kind established in the european court’s judgment; in this respect, encouraged azerbaijan to engage in meaningful dialogue with the committee of ministers.” 59.  exercising his powers under article 52 of the convention the secretary general of the council of europe appointed a representative to visit baku.recalling their previous decisions and interim resolutions calling for the immediate release of ilgar mammadov and in particular their decision of december 2016 affirming their determination to ensure the implementation of the judgment by actively considering using all the means at the disposal of the organisation; 3.  in this respect took note with interest of the azerbaijani authorities’ commitment to examine all avenues discussed during the mission of the representative of the secretary general to execute the ilgar mammadov judgment, as well as of the recent presidential executive order which foresees promising measures for the execution of this judgment; 4.  invited the authorities to keep the committee informed of the concrete measures adopted on the basis of this executive order and in particular of those enabling the release of ilgar mammadov without further delay; 5.  noted the indication given during the meeting by the azerbaijani authorities that the just satisfaction has been paid to ilgar mammadov in december 2015 ...; invited them to confirm this information in writing; ...” 62.  at its 1288th human rights meeting (6-7 june 2017), the committee of ministers’ adopted a decision which recalled the terms of the decision from its previous meeting, called for mr mammadov’s “unconditional” release and encouraged urgent progress of the executive order.67.  finally, at its 1302nd human rights meeting (5-7 december 2017) it adopted its fifth interim resolution (cm/resdh(2017)429) which triggered proceedings under article 46 § 4: “recalling anew a.  that in its above-mentioned judgment, the court found not only a violation of article 5 § 1 of  the convention, as no facts or information had been produced giving rise to a suspicion justifying  the bringing of charges against the applicant or his arrest and pre-trial detention, but also a violation  of article 18 taken in conjunction with article 5, as the actual purpose of these measures was to silence or punish him for criticising the government; b.  the respondent state’s obligation, under article 46 § 1 of the convention, to abide by all  final judgments in cases to which it has been a party and that this obligation entails, in addition to the payment of the just satisfaction awarded by the court, the adoption by the authorities of the respondent state, where required, of individual measures to put an end to violations established and erase their consequences so as to achieve as far as possible restitutio in integrum; c.  the committee’s call, at its first examination on 4 december 2014, of the individual measures required in the light of the above judgment to ensure the applicant’s release without  delay; d.  the committee’s numerous subsequent decisions and interim resolutions stressing the fundamental flaws in the criminal proceedings revealed by the court’s conclusions under article 18 combined with article 5 of the convention and calling for the applicant’s immediate and  unconditional release; e.  that the criminal proceedings against the applicant concluded on 18 november 2016 before the supreme court without the consequences of the violations found by the european court having  been drawn, in particular, that of article 18 taken in conjunction with article 5 of the convention; f.  that, over three years since the court’s judgment became final, the applicant remains in detention on the basis of the flawed criminal proceedings; considers that, in these circumstances, by not having ensured the applicant’s unconditional release, the republic of azerbaijan refuses to abide by the final judgment of the court; decides to refer to the court, in accordance with article 46 § 4 of the convention, the question whether the republic of azerbaijan has failed to fulfil its obligation under article 46 § 1; ...” 68.  in accordance with the committee of ministers’ rules (see paragraph 94 below) the views of the republic of azerbaijan were included in an appendix to the resolution (see annex to the present judgment).this decision shall be taken by a two-thirds majority of the representatives casting a vote and a majority of the representatives entitled to sit on the committee.” 95.  rule 16 addresses the adoption of interim resolutions in the execution process and their intended function: “rule 16 – interim resolutions in the course of its supervision of the execution of a judgment or of the terms of a friendly settlement, the committee of ministers may adopt interim resolutions, notably in order to provide information on the state of progress of the execution or, where appropriate, to express concern and/or to make suggestions with respect to the execution.” 96.  rule 17 states: “rule 17 - final resolution after having established that the high contracting party concerned has taken all the necessary measures to abide by the judgment or that the terms of the friendly settlement have been executed, the committee of ministers shall adopt a resolution concluding that its functions under article 46, paragraph 2, or article 39, paragraph 4, of the convention have been exercised.” 97.  the procedures for the supervision of the execution of judgments were adopted by the committee of ministers in 2010 (see information document: cm/inf/dh(2010)37).
8.  on 30 october 1997 the appeal court quashed the decision on legal costs, remitted that issue to the first-instance court for a retrial and upheld the remainder of the first-instance judgment.9.  the first-instance court subsequently rendered three decisions on the costs of the proceedings on 23 july 1998, 19 february 1999 and 3 march 2000. all of these decisions were quashed on appeal.10.  on 5 february 2013 the first-instance court rendered a fourth decision on the issue of legal costs awarding the applicant approximately 2,000 euros (eur).11.  according to the information on the file, the proceedings are currently pending before the second-instance court.12.  on 13 march 2013 the constitutional court found a violation of the applicant’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time and awarded him eur 300 for the non-pecuniary damage suffered in this regard.
the ministry of justice noted that the court had found a violation in the above‑mentioned case because of its very particular and specific circumstances, which had led the court to conclude that the situation in hungary, in as much as it related to healthcare professionals providing assistance during home births, was surrounded by legal uncertainty that gave rise to arbitrariness.for the court, such legal regulation thus empowered the third applicant to give birth in a specialised medical institution of her choice, which was equipped in accordance with the requirements for such institutions, so that the health of the mother and the newborn would be protected and they could receive immediate high-quality and effective help, should any danger arise to their health or lives during childbirth.23.  the supreme administrative court also referred to the content of the ministry of health letter of 16 october 2012 (see paragraph 18 above), wherein that institution had reminded the third applicant that her family members could be present during the birth of her child and had offered her the opportunity to visit hospitals with maternity wards and to choose the most suitable one.one also had to bear in mind the fact that privacy in respect of the third applicant’s personal life (which she had sought by demanding to be provided with medical assistance during her home birth) could not be seen as having a greater value than the health of her and the newborn child, for the purpose of which the state had established a system of personal healthcare and qualified medical assistance.25.  in her application to the court the fourth applicant also stated that even though she was of “reproductive age”, she did not dare to become pregnant for the fourth time, owing to the charges pending in respect of j.i.š., “while the issue of giving birth at home remained legally unregulated in lithuania” (kol lietuvoje nėra teisiškai sureguliuotas gimdymo namuose klausimas).
these amounts did not correspond to those agreed upon within the rent agreement of 14 august 1978. in the mentioned proceedings the court concluded that, on an unspecified date, the applicants and the band club had entered into a verbal agreement, whereby the annual rent due was increased because the band club had requested the use of a further part of the garden of property b.13.  in 2004 and 2005 the band club had requested that it be able to rent a further part of the garden of property b and for it to purchase the part of the property that was being utilized as the seat of the club.17.  the court noted the attorney general’s arguments against the owners whereby he contended that: the owners’ ascendants had not been forced to enter into the rental agreement with the band club ‑ they had willingly entered into the agreement which at the time they deemed just; when the owners’ ascendants had entered into the agreement the special legal dispositions regulating the renting of a property as a club (introduced through the enactment of the reletting of urban property (regulation) ordinance) were already in place and therefore the owners’ ascendants had entered into the agreement with full knowledge of the consequences it would lead to; therefore they had brought the situation upon themselves and could not allege a violation of their rights, nor should the owners be resorting to the courts to alter their situation.20.  as to the owners’ request for the court to establish a raise in the rent payable to them, the court considered that it was not its role to take on functions that the constitution granted to another organ of the state, just as much as it could not “erase” (tħassar) laws unless it found that they had “no effect” (ma jiswewx).the court concluded that the case of the owners did not concern the renunciation of a human right, but rather the exercise on the part of the owners to dispose of their property as they desired.
13.  according to the applicant, she reported the abduction immediately to the local military command in grozny, the office of the prosecutor of chechnya and various ngos.17.  on 19 august 2001 the applicant complained in respect of the abduction to the representative of the president of the russian federation in the southern federal district and asked him for assistance in the search for her son.29.  on 23 july 2002 the first applicant reported the abduction to the head of the government of the chechen republic.68.  on 15 july 2008 the first applicant requested that the investigators inform her of the progress of the investigation, resume the investigation and allow her access to the case file.84.  in 2009 the first applicant asked the head of the chechen parliamentary committee on the search for the disappeared (комитет парламента чеченской республики по поиску лиц, без вести пропавших в период проведения контртеррористической операции) for assistance in the search for her son.
11.  on 14 september 2005 mr tamer, the applicants’ lawyer at the material time, sent a letter to the applicants asking them to fill out and sign the forms of authority that were enclosed with the letter, to authorise him to lodge an application on their behalf with the court concerning the disciplinary board’s decision to intercept the letters sent by the association (see paragraph 7 above).12.  the administration of the edirne f-type prison believed the contents of the letter of 14 september 2005 to be suspect and therefore lodged a request with the public prosecutor on 21 september 2005 for a decision to refer the matter to an enforcement court to determine whether the material sent to the applicants included objectionable content.18.  in the meantime, on 23 november 2005 mr tamer wrote to the committee of ministers of the council of europe informing it that the edirne f-type prison administration’s refusal to give the applicants the letter in question had impaired his ability to lodge an application with the court and constituted a violation of the european agreement relating to persons participating in proceedings of the european court of human rights.however, if it emerges from documents or other evidence that visits by lawyers to a person convicted of the offences set out in section 220 of the criminal code or sub-chapters 4 and 5 of chapter 2 of the criminal code are serving as a means of communication with a terrorist organisation or of committing a crime or otherwise jeopardising the security of the prison, the enforcement court may, at the application of the prosecution, impose [the following measures]: presence of an official during the lawyer’s visits; verification of documents exchanged between the prisoner and his or her lawyers during such visits; and/or confiscation of all or some of these documents by the judge.2.  as regards persons under detention, the exercise of this right shall in particular imply that: (a)  if their correspondence is examined by the competent authorities, its despatch and delivery shall nevertheless take place without undue delay and without alteration; (b)  such persons shall not be subject to disciplinary measures in any form on account of any communication sent through the proper channels to the commission or the court; (c)  such persons shall have the right to correspond, and consult out of hearing of other persons, with a lawyer qualified to appear before the courts of the country where they are detained in regard to an application to the commission, or any proceedings resulting therefrom.
8.  at the material time the applicant and her family lived in the village of achkhoy-martan in the vicinity of the achkhoy-martan district department of the interior (“the achkhoy-martan rovd”) and the achkhoy‑martan district department of the federal security service (“the achkhoy-martan fsb”).102.  on 11 january 2005 the head of the avtury municipal authority informed the investigators that the remains of mr alikhan golbatsov’s car bearing signs of an explosion had been found near a road between the villages of avtury and niki-khita in the kurchaloiy district, chehcnya.from the documents presented by the applicants it appears that on 8 july 2010 the ngo srji/astreya, on behalf of mr lema khamzatov’s father, requested an update about the progress of the case and access to the documents in the case file.the first applicant stated that he had recognised the appearance and the voice of his son, the grozny rovd building and the car belonging to the head of the grozny rovd.187.  in the meantime, on 27 october 2006 the investigators attempted to examine the premises of the grozny rovd to verify whether it had been depicted on the video, but they were not let in owing to the lack of special authorisation.
as regards the applicant’s assertion that the measure should not have been applied retroactively, it found that the time when the offence had been committed was not to be considered relevant since the measure in question pertained to the final conviction, thereby respecting the presumption of innocence.moreover, the applicant was of the view that, assuming that the administrative court had correctly interpreted the relevant provisions of the financial operations act, those provisions were inconsistent with the constitution.the relevant provision of section 109 of the financial operations act was unambiguous and did not require any particular interpretation; it was clear from its wording that it applied equally to those liquidators who had acquired their licence prior to the enactment of the financial operations act as well as to those who had acquired it after the new act had come into force.19.  on 29 may 2013 the ministry of justice rejected his application, citing the financial operations act’s provision, pursuant to which a licence could not be granted once it had been revoked (point 2, paragraph 4 of section 108 of the financial operations act – see paragraph 30 below) and noting that the applicant’s licence had been revoked on 27 june 2011.24.  on 10 march 2015 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law on the grounds that he had failed to demonstrate that there was an important legal question, he had not pointed to any inconsistencies in the case-law and he had not shown that he had suffered very severe consequences as a result of the impugned measure, which the court pointed out had been a refusal to grant him a licence and not the earlier revocation.
the applicant explained that he could not confirm that the video recorder was the same one connected to the system, and the second tape inside it was surely not the same type that recorded the events of 29 january 2002. he could not remember how many video recorders of the brand gyyr he possessed noting that the new ones used to be in the stores and others could be in the repair room or in another room.22.  the court of criminal appeal further noted that in his subsequent statement the applicant said that the video he had watched with the police officers had started on 9 october 2000 and ended on 24 october 2000. he could not confirm whether the video recorder was the same one which had been included in the system but he considered that the second tape inside was surely not the one he was recording on, on 29 january 2002. he did not know how many videos of the brand gyyr he had.in 2011 three cases were decided by the constitutional court (in similar yet never identical formations of three judges), namely the police vs alvin privitera of 11 april 2011, the police vs esron pullicino of 12 april 2011, and the police vs mark lombardi, also of 12 april 2011. in the three cases the constitutional court held that the claimants had suffered a breach of their right to a fair trial under article 6 of the convention in so far as they had not been legally assisted.by way of example: (i)  cases brought before the constitutional jurisdictions while the criminal proceedings were pending against the complainant charles stephen muscat vs the attorney general, constitutional court judgment of 8 october 2012 45.  by a judgment of 10 october 2011 the civil court (first hall) in its constitutional competence, dismissed an objection to the effect that the complaint was premature and found that the fact that the law precluded the accused from being legally assisted sufficed to find a violation.it considered that to determine the fairness of the proceedings they had to be taken as a whole, on the facts of the case it did not appear to be so in the present case where mr pace did not object to the presentation of his statements to the jurors during the criminal proceedings, to the contrary he noted that he was not challenging the validity of the second statement, which showed that the applicant had not felt prejudiced by his statements, which had been reiterated before the court of magistrates.
the government identified three different categories of data: “full collection of data” (heildarsafn gagna) referred to all the data seized and held by the special prosecutor, regardless of whether it had relevance to the case or not; “investigation documents” (rannsóknargögn) referred to the data, documents and other materials extracted from the full collection of data which had been defined by the special prosecutor as relevant to the case and which were marked as part of the “investigation file”; “evidence in the case” referred to the documents and other materials that were submitted in court by the prosecution or the defence and were part of the “case file” in the court proceedings.at preliminary court sessions on 29 march and 27 april 2012 the applicants requested that the special prosecutor be required to hand over “a copy of the register of events (log-register) about connections between telephone calls or any other data which may have been created during the investigation of the case at the office of the special prosecutor and which contains an overview of telephone calls which were tapped on the basis of rulings on tappings in the case”, as well as copies of all e-mails which had passed through their e-mail addresses and had been seized by the special prosecutor during the investigation.dated 19 september 2016 in which he stated that his wife, mrs s., had been appointed vice-chair of the board of the fme on 1 january 2007 and that she had resigned on 25 january 2009. she had confirmed that between 9 december 2008, when the transactions at issue had been sent to the fme, and the date of her resignation, the transactions had been discussed once in a board meeting, on 19 january 2009, when the director of the fme had announced that a specialist had been appointed to make further inquiries into them; the specialist had handed his report to the fme on 6 march 2009 and the fme had submitted its complaint to the special prosecutor on 13 march 2009. consequently, the matter had never been discussed while mrs s. had been on the board.36.  the government had also received a statement from á.k.’s son, mr k., dated 19 september 2016, confirmed by a former member of the winding-up committee of kaupþing, according to which mr k. had worked in kaupþing’s legal department from november 2007 until the bank collapsed in october 2008. shortly after the appointment of the resolution committee, mr k. had started working for the committee and he had been head of its legal department from december 2008. after the resolution committee had been discontinued at the end of 2011 and a winding-up committee had been appointed, mr k. had taken up the position as head of the legal department of the latter committee, a post which he had held until august 2013. mr k. noted in his statement that when he had taken the position of head of the legal department of the resolution committee, it had been decided that cases concerning criminal investigations and actions for damages against former employees would not form part of the work of the legal division of the resolution committee, because he had been an employee of kaupþing before its collapse; the same applied after the winding-up committee was appointed.anybody aged fifteen or older who is subject to icelandic jurisdiction and is not the defendant or his representative must appear before the court as a witness to respond verbally to questions asked of them about the facts of the case ... ... 4. if the witness is located far from the court or if attending the court would otherwise cause him significant inconvenience, the judge may decide that testimony is to be given during the court session by telephone ot other telecommunications methods, provided that the testimony is given in such a manner that everyone present during the session is able to hear the testimony.
6.  the first and second applicants are the mother and the sister of mr sharpudi (also spelled as sharpuddi and sharpudin) mukhtarov, who was born in 1975. the third and fourth applicants are the parents of mr zaurbek (also spelled as zovrbek) umarov, who was born in 1975 (in the documents submitted the year was also stated as 1981).23.  on 1 april 2009 the sunzhenskiy district court of ingushetia granted the investigators’ request and allowed the seizure of the video containing the interview with mr umarov from the ntv channel.34.  on 4 august 2008 the first applicant informed the investigators about the death of her husband, mr m.m., and asked to be granted victim status in the criminal case.40.  according to the fifth applicant’s submissions to the court, mr umarov’s relatives had learnt about his abduction from mr mukhtarov’s relatives on 1 november 2003. they complained about the incident to the local police and sunzhenskiy district police station.and the ngo memorial that the criminal case into the abduction of mr mukhtarov and mr umarov had been opened on 18 november 2003, and that the investigation had been suspended.
the relevant parts of those notes read as follows: “... i [the handler] met with [the applicant], a law student [at the time], on two occasions on which he expressed a wish to collaborate with the state security office (служба за државна безбедност) ... ... the relationship (пријателската врска) – [the applicant] informed me that [code name] had exchanged letters with ... ... the conversation with [the applicant] was on my [the handler’s] initiative ... the source [the applicant] was used occasionally, during his stay in skopje.its decision stated, inter alia: “... [the applicant] had provided the security bodies with information about certain people of interest for the state security office ... on the basis of documentary evidence, it was established that the state security office had used [the applicant] as an operational liaison ... ... the lustration commission established that [the applicant], as a secret collaborator, informant or operational liaison, [in the process of] creating and storing information about certain people, by which their rights and freedoms had been violated on political or ideological grounds, had collaborated with the state security services in a conscious, secret, organised and continuous manner, in return for favours in getting promoted, by which the condition specified in sections 4 and 18 of the [2012 lustration act] is fulfilled.” 8.  after the lustration commission published the above decision (and the notes of the security bodies referred to in the decision) on its website, the applicant requested (making a non-disclosure statement) and obtained a redacted copy of those documents, in the form in which they were published on the commission’s website.i avow that [the applicant] was not recorded or registered by the security bodies as such ... neither i nor my colleagues, as far as i know, had requested that he be registered as a secret collaborator, informant, operational liaison ... neither had [the applicant] made a request to collaborate with the security service ... i submit that the contents of the official records are not truthful (веродостојни) and at times [the applicant] had not provided the information in any organised manner, i.e. ... he had not been an organised liaison with the state security office ...” 10.  on 30 november 2012 the applicant challenged the commission’s decision before the administrative court.referring to the information in the relevant documents (see paragraph 6 above), which it found truthful (having compared the copy documents in the applicant’s case file with the originals), the court confirmed the lustration commission’s findings that the applicant had collaborated with the security services in a conscious, secret, organised and continuous manner as a secret informant, notably as an operational liaison.the authenticity of the files used against him had also been compromised in that they had not been from the archives of the intelligence service on the one hand, but that they had seemingly been drawn up by handlers at the state security office – which was the predecessor of the intelligence service – on the other hand.
the application refers to the police report ... of 3 may 2007 concerning the use of secret surveillance measures in respect of m.m., alleging that there is probable cause to believe that the persons mentioned [in that report] often communicate about purchasing cocaine, [something] which is established on the basis of telephone conversations with m.m., [a person] in respect of whom this court ordered [secret surveillance] measures under article 180 § 1 (1) and (3) of the code of criminal procedure on 5 march 2007. the investigating judge considers that the application is well founded, because in this particular case the investigation of these criminal offences could not be carried out by other means, as [the offences] concern the criminal offence proscribed by article 173 §§ 1 and 2 of the criminal code.bearing in mind the above facts, the investigating judge [issues] an order under article 180 § 1 (1) of the code of criminal procedure ... because the stated circumstances point to there being sufficient grounds for suspecting the commission of the criminal offence proscribed under article 173 §§ 1 and 2 of the criminal code.” 8.  on 1 june 2007 the zagreb county court issued another order, accepting an application by the office for the suppression of corruption and organised crime (ured za suzbijanje korupcije i organiziranog kriminaliteta, hereinafter “the oscoc”) for the use of secret surveillance measures for a period of three months in respect of the first and fourth applicants and four other persons, on the grounds that they were suspected of drug trafficking proscribed by article 173 § 3 of the criminal code.16.  the latter decision was confirmed by the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske) on 14 may 2008. the relevant statement of reasons given by the supreme court reads as follows: “... this second-instance court agrees with the first-instance court’s conclusion that evidence obtained by using an investigative measure ordered against a person in respect of whom there is a reasonable suspicion that he is committing, alone or jointly with others, one of the criminal offences proscribed under article 181 of the code of criminal procedure, can be used not only against [that person], but also against every other person caught participating in [that person’s] criminal activity, [when] the criminal activity of the other person amounts to the criminal offence proscribed under article 181 of the code of criminal procedure, but always on the condition that the other person has been caught acting together with the person against whom one of the measures under article 180 § 1(1)-(6) has been lawfully issued.consequently, in its application for special measures of inquiry into criminal offences proscribed by article 173 § 3 of the criminal code in the specific case against the defendants, the oscoc proposed the application of the provisions of article 180 § 1 of the code of criminal procedure which the court had applied when issuing the order ... of 1 june 2007. therefore, since the oscoc has jurisdiction over proceedings regarding the criminal offence under article 173 § 3 of the criminal code and proposed ordering special measures of inquiry into such an offence under article 180 § 1of the code of criminal procedure, the court accepted the application, which is why the issued order is not unlawful.furthermore, applying article 180 § 1 of the code of criminal procedure to the order at issue, even though daily reports and documentation regarding technical recordings drafted by the members of the police authorities who were implementing the ordered measures were not delivered to the investigating judge on a daily basis – the judge did not ask for this under article 182a of the code of criminal procedure, but this was done after the special measures had been implemented – this does not render the order in question unlawful pursuant to article 9 §§ 1 and 2 of the code of criminal procedure, nor does it make the material evidence obtained from the measures unlawful, contrary to the allegations in the defendants’ appeals.
the applicant also challenged the judges again; the presiding judge was changed following a decision of the president of the court on 20 may 2015.the court, relying on convention principles, considered that, taking into account the complexity of the case, the length of the proceedings had not been excessive.in particular, in the second of the above-mentioned decisions, the court agreed that the proceedings in the case had concentrated on the examination of the applicant’s applications for legal aid and her applications challenging the experts and judges.on 26 february 2018 the szczecin court of appeal rejected the applicant’s most recent complaint about the length of the proceedings before the court of appeal as it had not been lodged by a lawyer.29.  a detailed description of the relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for excessive length of judicial proceedings – in particular, the applicable provisions of the 2004 act – is set out in the court’s decisions in the cases of charzyński v.poland ((dec.), no.
4.  on 30 november 2004 the applicant company signed a contract (“the contract”) with the ministry of finance (“the ministry”) for an investment loan, expressed in the equivalent of the national currency, with the repayments calculated in euros (во денарска противвредност пресметана во евра).the applicant company’s protest and appeal against the enforcement order were dismissed by both the president of the ohrid court of first instance (основен суд охрид) and by the bitola court of appeal (апелационен суд битола), with the final decision being dated 3 april 2013.6.  on 17 may 2013 the applicant company lodged a civil claim against the ministry seeking an annulment of clause 11 of the contract, claiming that, in accordance with domestic law, interest on the repayment of loans in foreign currencies should be calculated on the basis of that foreign currency’s domestic rate (домицилна камата) instead of the statutory default interest rate.7.  the applicant company’s claim was dismissed by the ohrid court of first instance and the bitola court of appeal on 7 october and 13 january 2014 respectively, each holding that the loan had been approved in the national currency and therefore the statutory default interest rate applied.the supreme court took the stance that the loan repayment instalments were the determinative factor in the cases, and since, in those cases, the instalments had been expressed in a foreign currency, the statutory default interest rate was not applicable.
the decision merely stated that the reasons advanced by the investigator were sufficient for the court to conclude that the applicant might try to abscond from justice, obstruct the investigation, and influence the other suspect or witnesses in the proceedings.10.  in the course of the pre-trial investigation the applicant’s detention was extended a number of times, including on 27 july, 22 and 28 september, and 15 and 29 november 2017. the reasons for extending his detention were the severity of the possible sanction, the need to take additional investigative and procedural steps, and the fact that the existing risks [of the applicant’s absconding or obstructing the criminal proceedings] were still relevant.the trial court maintained the custodial preventive measure in respect of the applicant, reiterating, without providing details, the same reasons which had been mentioned at the pre‑trial stage, namely that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the said crime; if released he might attempt to abscond from justice; the statutory penalty for the crime was up to ten years’ imprisonment along with confiscation of all property; and, being a foreign national, he had no permanent place of residence in ukraine and was unemployed.13.  in the decisions taken on 22 september and 13 december 2017, 28 march, 13 june and 11 september 2018, and 7 november and 11 february 2019, the courts also referred to the fact that the applicant was a national of the russian federation, and might therefore escape justice abroad as he had not handed in his passport, had no permanent place of residence, no social ties in ukraine and was unemployed.29.  on 9 february and 6 march 2018 the sizo administration replied to the defence lawyer’s applications for the applicant’s transfer to a specialised medical facility, informing him that such a transfer would be possible if the relevant documentation confirming the readiness of the medical facility in question to admit the applicant for treatment, were presented.
8.  by a letter of 27 june 2007 the state department of ukraine for the execution of sentences informed the second applicant, in reply to a letter sent by him on an earlier date, that female life prisoners were entitled to have one long visit every three months, as provided by article 139 of the code, given that they served their sentences in medium-security colonies, as provided by article 18 of the code.article 150, as amended, stated that persons sentenced to life imprisonment were to serve their sentences as follows: male prisoners ‑ either in maximum-security sectors of medium-security correctional colonies or in maximum-security correctional colonies; and female prisoners – either in medium-security sectors of minimum-security correctional colonies with general conditions of detention or in medium-security correctional colonies.10.  by the law of 8 april 2014 on the introduction of amendments to the code relating to the adaptation of status of convicted persons to european standards the code was amended again (“the 2014 amendments”).12.  the first applicant stated that he and his family had wished to maintain their relationships, but as the result of the absence of the right to long visits until 2014 he had had to divorce his wife.14.  the third applicant stated that, in the absence of the right to long visits until 2014, his right to found a family had been more declaratory than effective as, in particular, he had not been able to have any physical contact in order to conceive children.
according to the record of the examination, the applicant’s lawyer had agreed to the interview taking place in his absence.given the severity of his condition, the expert expressed concerns about how the applicant could have arrived at the place of the crime, which was located some 8-9 kilometres from his house (не би можела да тврдам како се случило да се оддалечи).on the same day the trial court requested information regarding the summons of 23 november 2005. the ministry responded that it had forwarded the summons to the albanian authorities and that the trial court should allow more time between hearings to ensure a timely delivery of the summons.19.  on 7 february 2008 the trial court acquitted the applicant, holding that there had been no nitrate particles found on his body, the handgun that had been seized from the his house had not been the one used in the murder and there was no fingerprint evidence to suggest that he had been the perpetrator.it reiterated its earlier findings (see paragraph 19 above), but concluded that the applicant had been guilty of the crimes on the basis of the on-site examination, the statement of j.t., the identification parade and the fact that j.t.
5.  on 7 july 2000 the applicant company and the ukrvuglegeologiya state company (“the uvg”), an administrative entity of the ministry of fuel and energy of ukraine represented by its own administrative entity, the sevastopol‑based izumrud recreation centre (“the irc”), concluded a ten‑year rental agreement, under which the applicant company rented bedroom block no.15.  in the meantime, on 20 december 2005 the ministry for the coal industry (the successor to the ministry of fuel and energy) decided to reorganise the uvg by singling out its structural unit, the irc, and creating on its base the izumrud recreation centre state enterprise (“the irc state enterprise”).20.  in september 2006 the irc state enterprise lodged a claim with the sevastopol city commercial court against the fund’s sevastopol office and the applicant company, seeking the invalidation of the contract of 26 december 2003. in response, the applicant company sought the discontinuation of the proceedings, arguing, with reference to article 80 of the 1991 code of commercial procedure, that the same dispute between the same parties had already been resolved by the judgment of 1 february 2006.the uvg had not therefore been a proper party to the proceedings and it could not have put forward any counterclaims seeking the invalidation of the contract of 26 december 2003. the applicant had thus failed to prove that the courts had already decided a claim by the irc state enterprise in relation to the same object and grounds.as to the applicant company’s objections, it stated that it was the irc state enterprise, and not the uvg, which should have been the proper respondent (counterclaimant) in the case when the judgment of 1 february 2006 was adopted, and that the applicant company had failed to prove that the same dispute with the irc state enterprise had already been decided by the courts.
20.  at the same hearing, the court admitted documentary evidence, including: financial and other documents related to the company; official documents from the ministry related to the procurement process and the two contracts; and several letters from the ministry sent in reply to enquiries made by the trial court.21.  at the hearings held on 10 and 17 november 2006 the defence reiterated their request to examine the signatories of the letters (see paragraph 20 above) and some other witnesses and proposed as evidence written material (including army reports and documents, government transcripts and media articles related to the armed conflict) in order that the court establish the relevant facts in respect of the circumstances related to the procurement process, the execution of the contracts, the influence of the deteriorating security situation and z.s.’s role in the company’s affairs.relying on a considerable amount of evidence, including the testimony of ministry officials who had participated in the two contracts and other witnesses, written material related to the procurement, two expert reports and the statements of the two experts at the trial, the trial court concluded the two contracts had not been awarded in a process compliant with the rules of public procurement.as to the construction contract, the court found that there had been neither a legal framework governing the construction of military housing on the site of the base, nor a clear decision or plan for the particular location, which suggested that the defendants’ choice of location had been aimed at circumventing the public-procurement rules.25.  the applicant appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the trial court had dismissed all his applications to introduce evidence (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above) which aimed to prove: (i) that the deteriorating security situation had justified the urgent food procurement and impeded the execution of the construction contract; (ii) that any construction in the military base had fallen under the “security” exception of the public-procurement rules.
10.  on 5 october 2005 yalta city council (“the council”) and the executive committee concluded an agreement with the company which provided, inter alia, that the company would purchase two flats to move the applicant and the owner of another apartment from the dangerous building in exchange for granting to the company title over the applicant’s and the other person’s flats and then over the building as a whole (“the agreement”).17.  on an unspecified date the court of appeal of the autonomous republic of crimea (“the court of appeal”) remitted the case for fresh consideration to the first-instance court, noting that the council, as the owner of the sosnova flat, had not been involved in the proceedings.the court made the following findings: (a) it was not in dispute between the parties that the pushkinska building was a municipal property and was maintained by a municipal company, and that it was the executive committee’s task under the relevant laws to exercise control over the safety of buildings irrespective of their form of ownership; (b) in carrying out this obligation, the executive committee found that the building had been under the threat of collapse and these findings had been valid and had not been appealed against by any interested person.the agreement and the council’s decision of 19 october 2005 approving it were likewise valid; (c) pursuant to article 112 of the housing code the executive committee had been obliged to provide the applicant with a replacement dwelling, which it had done, but the applicant had refused to move on a voluntary basis without providing any reasons; and (d) pursuant to the agreement, which had been approved by the council, the pushkinska building was to be demolished, and not renovated, as claimed by the applicant, which made her return to the property impossible; she thus had to be evicted from that flat and moved to another apartment with her title to the pushkinska flat annulled by the court, which would be in compliance with article 346 § 2 of the civil code.the applicant also disputed the fairness of the calculations used by the first-instance court, referring to the fact that, just before the pushkinska building had been declared dangerous, the company had bought several flats from the applicant’s neighbours, which had been in poor condition, for very high prices – much higher than the building price referred to by the council.
15.  on 6 september 2018 some of the members of the applicants’ families, their colleagues from the schools and human rights defenders spent the day at the airport in the hope of stopping the applicants’ deportation to turkey.18.  on 7 september 2018, the head of the bma, o.p., stated in an interview that the authority had not been involved in the case of the seven orizont teachers and that the procedure for declaring them undesirable and removing them from moldova had not been carried out by the bma.the decisions contained a thorough analysis of the manner in which the gülen movement followers had been treated in turkey and concluded that the applicants’ fear of reprisals at the hands of the turkish authorities were justified.20.  several days after the applicants’ arrest and transfer to turkey their families also received from the bma decisions dated 5 september 2018, banning the applicants from entering moldovan territory for a period of five years and ordering their expulsion under supervision from moldova by the bma in accordance with section 58 of the status of aliens act (see paragraph 27 below).strongly condemns the recent extradition/abduction of turkish citizens to turkey due to their alleged links to the gülen movement, in violation of the rule of law and basic human rights; urges the moldovan authorities to ensure that any extradition requests coming from third countries are processed in a transparent manner while following judicial procedures fully in line with european principles and standards...” 23.  amnesty international also made a statement in relation to the deportation of the seven orizont teachers to turkey.
14.  on 10 march 2011, the prosecutor in charge of the case ordered a series of investigative actions to be carried out by a judicial police officer: “(1)  to contact forensic experts who would carry out a forensic examination to find out the cause of death of the deceased; (2)  to seize the criminal and medical files of sh.p.from the prison facilities, as well as from the hospital; (3)  to search the registers of the tirana prison hospital, tirana university hospital and shkodër civilian hospital in order to find out when he had been hospitalised, what the diagnosis had been, how long he had stayed, etc.; the pages of the register relevant to the search would have to be attached to the report; (4)  to question tirana prison employees, medical staff who had taken care of sh.p., and his family members about his medical history, his treatment, when he had last been hospitalised, etc.on 20 october 2011 the tirana district court rejected the applicant’s complaint on the grounds that he did not have legal standing to complain against the impugned decision, because he had only been notified of it as a family member of the deceased.on 17 november 2015 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s complaints against the ordinary domestic courts’ decisions, with the argument that the statutory denial of standing to challenge the prosecutor’s decision did not violate the essence of the applicant’s right of access to a court.
in particular it noted that in 2010 her company had generated a gross income of pln 213,000; however, the expenses exceeded this sum by approximately pln 50,000. as regards the first four months of 2011 the applicant had declared a gross income of pln 53,600 and expenses of pln 48,500; therefore she had generated a net income of over pln 5,000. moreover the applicant had declared that she had other financial obligations, amounting to pln 4,000 per month, which she had been paying on time.moreover, the applicant had declared a net income for the first four months of 2011. in an extensively reasoned decision the domestic court concluded that the applicant should be expected to pay one third of the fees due for lodging an appeal against the payment order.the court took into account the applicant’s difficult financial situation but noted that the court fee should not have been regarded as less important than the other financial obligations that the applicant had been able to honour, in the amount of pln 4,000 monthly.having examined all the arguments relied on by the applicant, the court considered that the situation did not justify a total exemption from the court fees.14.  on 26 october 2011 the koszalin regional court rejected the applicant’s appeal against the payment order of 2 may 2011 and rejected her third application for full exemption from the court fees as it had been substantially the same as the one lodged before and examined on 26 august 2011.
as to the origins of these injuries, the expert confirmed that the bruising had been typical of the kind caused by truncheons, while the knee injury could have occurred when the applicant had resisted getting into the police car or going to another room.23.  on 12 november 2013 the prosecutor questioned dr m.b., one of the doctors who had treated the applicant in stalowa wola district hospital on 26 june 2013. the doctor stated that he had diagnosed the applicant with chronic instability of the knee.29.  the prosecutor acknowledged that the police officers had used force against the applicant as he had been aggressive during the arrest, but he had not been beaten by the police officers whilst at stalowa wola district police station.in so far as the applicant had referred to the visual technology expert’s report, the court noted that, even if the applicant had begun limping after leaving the room where the body search had taken place, the possibility that his knee injury had occurred earlier on and that he had only begun to feel pain in that leg at a later stage could not be excluded.also, the medical opinion had not been explicit in this respect, since the applicant suffered from chronic instability of the knee, and the swelling might have resulted from the resistance he had demonstrated while getting into the police car.
the relevant part of that decision reads as follows: “... on the basis of the case-file, the first-instance court concludes that meetings between the father and the son have thus far not been taking place in a manner corresponding to the best interest of the child, because the father had been able to see the son very rarely, and those rare occasions on wednesdays had been limited to fifteen minutes after school ... ... the lack of co-operation by the parents concerning the exercise of their parental rights, the mother’s firm attitude and her unwillingness to co-operate with [the applicant] must not run counter to the child’s interests ... given that so far the mother has not been co-operative as regards the time scheduled for father-son meetings once a week, it was in the interest of the child to supplement the previous decision ...” 16.  an appeal lodged by d.m.the boy had asked his father to terminate the lawsuits against his mother, and said that the father would then be able to see him ... in an essay which the child wrote in the third grade, one can detect a firm connection with his mother, the heavy burden of the pending court proceedings (enforcement proceedings, criminal proceedings, present case) and the child’s feeling that his father has left his mother and does not respect the love he feels for her.... in order that a father-son emotional bond can be established and developed, and taking into account the child’s wishes and his free time, the court decides to start with saturday meetings for two hours ... so that the child can see that the court has respected his ability to independently express the wish to spend more or less time with the father, and afterwards every saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. [as suggested by the vinkovci social welfare centre] ... having regard to the events and the length of these proceedings, the centre’s proposal of 28 september 2012 that the court order the parents and the child to undergo an assessment at the zagreb child protection clinic, after which the centre would give its final opinion, was dismissed, as there are no reasons for the court to delay its decision after more than four years, given that the vinkovci social welfare centre has issued its recommendation and that the decisions in the proceedings are subject to change within the meaning of section 102 of the family act.” 20.  both parties lodged appeals against that judgment, which were dismissed by the second-instance court.... given that in the instant case one of the basic rights of the child provided for in the convention on the rights of the child and the legislation in force is jeopardised, it was necessary to offer the parents professional assistance in establishing an adequate relationship by [imposing] the [child protection] measure of supervision of contacts between the son and the father so as to enable both parents to participate in [the child’s] upbringing.[therefore,] because of the distance [between the two towns] and work obligations, and [given] the [resultant] impossibility of implementing the court’s decision in the part concerning contacts between the son and the father during the week owing to changed circumstances, those [contacts] will not be covered by the supervision of contacts between the son and the father.” 44.  on 25 january 2012 the centre again imposed the child-protection measure of supervising the exercise of parental authority for a further year.
8.  at a session on 23 november 2010 the trial court decided to sever the remainder of the case from the proceedings against the applicant, which would be dealt with at a separate trial and joined with other charges brought against him.the decision pertaining to the competence of the court was quashed on 14 december 2010. on 28 december 2010 the trial court extended the applicant’s detention on remand.on 4 february 2011 the proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of another trial, but that decision was quashed upon appeal on 16 march 2011. the case was transferred to the relevant division of the court in march 2011, and thereafter the presiding judge scheduled the beginning of the trial for 14 september 2011 and undertook other preparative actions (such as tracing the addresses of some twelve witnesses).the court, relying on the convention principles, ruled that, taking into account the complexity of the case, the length of the proceedings had not been excessive.the court examined the course of the proceedings and ruled that there had been no delays on the part of the courts.
10.  on 29 march 2007 the prosecutor general’s office initiated court proceedings in which it sought the annulment of both the sale of the building on 29 january 2001 and the subsequent transaction between company b. and the applicant company.it also sought the return of the building to its initial owner, company v. the reason relied upon by the prosecutor’s general’s office was that the valuation of the building conducted by the estate agency had not been carried out in accordance with the provisions of the law.13.  on 7 december 2007 the applicant company lodged a revision request against the above judgment in which it indicated that it had carried out an expert evaluation of the disputed building by an independent expert who determined its value at mdl 8,550,000 (approximately eur 511,440) after the improvements made by the applicant company to it.15.  since company v. did not need the disputed building, the applicant company proposed to it and the latter accepted to conclude a friendly settlement agreement in accordance with which company v. agreed that the applicant company would retain ownership of the building in exchange for mdl 325,092 (approximately eur 19,328).17.  it is unclear from the materials of the case and the parties’ submissions whether after the adoption of the judgment of 11 october 2007 by the supreme court of justice, company b. returned to the applicant company the amount received as a result of the transaction of 25 april 2003.
in view of the fact that, in the applicants’ submission, it was impossible for them to apply to the court directly, the application was lodged by their mothers.on 4 august 2009 the supreme court of the “mrt” upheld the above judgment, but reduced the sentence of the first applicant to fourteen years’ imprisonment.8.  it does not appear from the material in the case file and from the parties’ submissions that the applicants informed the authorities of the republic of moldova about the proceedings against them and the conviction and detention in the “mrt”.9.  in december 2014 the applicants challenged their conviction by way of an extraordinary appeal before the supreme court of the republic of moldova which, on 14 february 2015, upheld their appeal and quashed the judgments of the “mrt” courts on the ground that they had been issued by unconstitutional tribunals.10.  the applicants were released from detention on 20 july and 20 august 2015, respectively, for reasons which were not related to the supreme court of moldova’s decision of 14 february 2015.
in this respect there are two sub-groups: the first five applicants who were arrested together and the sixth applicant who was arrested on a different date; (iii)  the first and second applicants: whether the above-mentioned proceedings for failure to obey the police order to leave were fair in view of the applicants’ absence from the appeal hearings; (iv)  the third, seventh and ninth applicants: whether those applicants were subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment by the personnel involved in the project and, if so, whether there was a failure to protect them from such treatment and investigate it effectively.(c)  the fifth applicant 62.  on 23 june 2010 the district court, having heard the police officers, the fifth applicant and some witnesses, convicted the fifth applicant as charged and fined him uah 170, at the time the equivalent of about eur 17. on 27 july 2010 the court of appeal quashed the conviction by a final decision and discontinued the proceedings against the fifth applicant under article 22 of the code of administrative offences (see paragraph 95 below).86.  according to the applicants, notwithstanding their persistent efforts and requests submitted on 17 february, 5 july, 9 august and 12 september 2011, they had been unable to obtain a copy of the decision of 9 august 2010. they submitted a copy of the letter from the city prosecutor’s office of 19 august 2011, which stated that in response to mr bushchenko’s request of 5 july 2011 a copy of the decision of 9 august 2010 had been sent to him on 26 july 2011. on 4 october 2011 mr bushchenko wrote to the prosecutor’s office again, stating that in fact a copy of the decision had not been enclosed with the authorities’ previous letters.they submitted copies of letters addressed to the city prosecutor’s office and to the city and district police chiefs in which they had asked to be provided with a copy of the decision of 20 august 2010 and enclosed postal receipts showing that those letters had been delivered on 9 and 10 november 2010. in their comments of 1 march 2012 concerning the applicants’ observations of 15 november 2011, the government commented on a number of factual matters raised by the applicants (notably the public consultation concerning the project, see paragraph 200 below) but not on the applicants’ alleged inability to obtain a copy of the decision of 20 august 2010.90.  in november 2010 a number of protesters, including all the applicants, lodged an action with the kharkiv circuit administrative court, complaining that the police had failed to protect them against assaults during their peaceful protest against the tree felling, in particular on 28 and 31 may and 1 and 2 june 2010. according to the government, in the course of the trial in this case the seventh applicant was examined by a representative of the police.
8.  on 16 december 2006 a customs officer of the self-proclaimed “moldovan republic of transdniestria” (“mrt”) stopped the applicant at a check‑point and seized his car on the ground that upon entry on the territory of transdniestria he had failed to stop at the border.his car was also seized, on the ground of his failure to comply with customs regulations, but the seizure report was destroyed and he was able to recover his car five hours later after the intervention of a group of russian peacekeepers.the moldovan government disputed the fact that the applicant had informed them about the circumstances of the present case.11.  reports by inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations, the relevant domestic law and practice of the republic of moldova, and other pertinent documents were summarised in mozer v. the republic of moldova and russia ([gc], no.11138/10, §§ 61-77, 23 february 2016).

the applicant claimed, in particular, that the bailiffs had determined the debt on the basis of the gross earnings the applicant had received as a private entrepreneur, without deducting the expenses he had incurred in the course of those activities.17.  on 27 october 2009 the kyiv regional court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal as unfounded, holding that she had failed to prove that the flat was the marital property of the former spouses and that she had made any contribution to the acquisition of the flat.24.  on 21 september 2010 the kirovohrad regional court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal, holding that the claim against company k. was groundless because it had been just a technical contractor and not a party responsible for the provision and distribution of flats; it had been the responsibility of company o. to provide the applicant’s husband with the flat.28.  following the applicant’s request, on 4 march 2010 the obukhiv district court ordered the local land resources department to submit to the court the land ownership documents given to the farm, including an official list of citizens who had been given the shares in the plots of land allocated to the farm.30.  the applicant appealed, arguing that (i) the fact that his grandmother had not received the share of land had been confirmed, in his opinion, by the official replies from the local authorities which he had submitted to the court; and (ii) he did not have access to the list of citizens mentioned by first-instance court.
10. the first hearing of the main proceedings took place on 3 may 2010 and after fourteen hearings the district court convicted the applicant for having taken a bribe and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of one year and four months, suspended on probation.14.  on the day on which the judgment was pronounced, 18 november 2011, the public prosecutor lodged an appeal on points of law and submitted the reasoning on 16 january 2012. responses to the appeal were submitted by the accused, and the court of appeal scheduled a hearing for 21 january 2013.15.  on 21 january 2013 the court of appeal set the judgment of the regional court aside and remitted the matter to the regional court.these had resulted from the fact that the presiding judge had only been able to schedule hearings on the matter from 11 february 2015 onwards after the matter had been remitted by the court of appeal on 29 january 2013. a discontinuation of the proceedings sought by the applicant based on the unreasonable length of the proceedings had, however, not been appropriate.the court also stated that the fact that, in the event that the suspension of his prison sentence was revoked, only five months would have to be served, did not change the fact that he had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least six months.
at 9.10 a.m. on 28 may 2008 he attended the police station again to “give explanations” and left at 11.40 a.m. at 7.52 p.m. he was arrested there in the presence of his lawyer, t. 9.  according to the police visitors’ book, on 27 may 2008 the applicant arrived at the police station at 7.10 p.m. and left at 9.10 p.m. on 28 may 2008 he arrived at the police station at 9.10 a.m. and left at 11.40 a.m., while t. came to the police station at 7.10 p.m. only the above two entries were made on 28 may 2008. the photocopy of the visitors’ book provided by the government does not contain a column with visitors’ signatures.22.  following the pre-investigation inquiries, on 7 june, 7 august and 28 november 2008, 21 january and 10 april 2009 the town prosecutor or his assistant refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant’s complaint of 29 may 2008. while mentioning the applicant’s explanation that he had been beaten at the police station on 27 may 2008 and the expert report of 2 july 2008, which had established that he could have sustained a number of injuries during the period indicated by him, the prosecutor found that there was no evidence that those injuries had been inflicted at the police station and not elsewhere, because on 27 and 28 may 2008 the applicant had not been at the police station all the time.28.  on 1 june 2010 the applicant complained to the volnovakha court about the decision of 14 january 2010. he stated, inter alia, that if the prosecutor had established that he had been taken to the police station on 28 may 2008 at about 8 p.m. without any visible injuries, and the medical examination at 10 p.m. had found numerous injuries on him, that meant that he had received them on 28 may 2008 between 8 and 10 p.m. the applicant also complained that those who had attended the police station on 27 and 28 may 2008 and could have been witnesses to the events on those days had not been identified.the applicant’s father complained to the higher prosecutors, pointing to a contradiction between the prosecutor’s decisions in which it had been established that the police officers had not seen any injuries on the applicant when he had been taken to the police station on 28 may 2008, and the expert report of 2 july 2008, which stated that a number of injuries could have been sustained by the applicant on 27 may 2008. therefore, those officers would have seen the injuries and had therefore given false statements.in particular, the expert report of 2 july 2008 had not mentioned the injuries on the applicant’s back and the expert had to establish the manner in which the injuries had been sustained and whether they could have been sustained in the circumstances alleged by the applicant.
14.  on 18 february 2008 the kirovskiy district court of makhachkala (“the district court”), sitting in a single-judge formation composed of judge i., granted an application lodged by the administration of the kirovskiy district of makhachkala to place k. in a closed educational institution for minors for two years and five months.in taking this decision the district court relied on the following circumstances: k.’s not attending school, running away from home, vagabonding and leading an anti-social and immoral lifestyle, as well as unsuccessful attempts to discipline k. and her being detained in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders.18.  at the applicant’s request, the prosecutor of the republic of dagestan applied to the presidium of the supreme court of the republic of dagestan for a supervisory review of the decision of 18 february 2008.19.  the present application was already pending before the european court of human rights when, on 7 august 2008, the presidium of the supreme court of the republic of dagestan, by way of a supervisory review, quashed the decision of 18 february 2008 as unlawful and unjustified, and discontinued the proceedings.120-fz of 24 june 1999 (“the minors act”), the district court had decided to place k. in a closed educational institution for minors in the absence of a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings or a decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the latter, and without her having undergone a prior medical examination.
.... based on the parties’ statements, the court finds that the authorities involved did not refuse to provide the child with the services that he was entitled to under the law and which were included in his personal rehabilitation plan; [what they refused were] merely the conditions imposed by the mother that [the services] should be provided on the school premises ... however, in order to meet the child’s complex needs and ensure that he had access to all services, the authorities, in addition to the psycho-educational counselling offered by the school psychologist, organised speech therapy and physiotherapy in his school.... the child has severe neuromotor disabilities which make it impossible for him to move, to walk, to help himself, to take notes in class, etc., and which consequently make it necessary for him to be assisted by another person who can move him, as needed, from the wheelchair or assistive devices to his desk and back; help him move around the school (take charge of him at the school door, accompany him back to the door at the end of the school day, and take him to the toilet, the sports room, and the laboratories which are on the upper floor); help him with taking notes during lessons and writing down the homework; assist him with physical exercises; assist him in the event of an emergency evacuation, etc.there is nothing to prevent the [child protection authority] and the bucharest v local council from including these activities in the personal assistant’s contract ... therefore the court considers that, in principle, the assistance, supervision and safety of the child during school hours must be ensured by his personal assistant or in the latter’s absence ... by a person approved and nominated for the purpose by the parent ... for the same reason, the ismb and the bucharest iv local council ... must take measures in order to ensure the child’s effective access to education and his supervision and safety.... as the court thus considers that the child’s action is well-founded on this count, it orders the ismb, the child protection authority and the bucharest iv and v local councils to take measures in order to ensure the child’s supervision and safety in school, via the teachers or auxiliary staff, his personal assistant or a qualified caregiver.” (e)  the court ordered the ismb and the bucharest iv local council to ensure the first applicant’s access to education by rendering the school building accessible by wheelchair, in particular by: providing specially adapted desks in the classroom and laboratories; ensuring access to the upper floors of the school building; removing the obstacles preventing the first applicant from moving around the school, such as thresholds and narrow doors; adapting the sports room to the child’s needs; and providing him with a computer and software adapted to his educational needs.the court found as follows: “the assertions made by the objecting parties – that at the date on which the enforcement request was lodged they had already complied with the obligations laid down in the court decision – is contradicted by the facts, as the child’s school situation is still uncertain in so far as he still does not benefit in school from the conditions set by that court decision.” 68.  on 23 january 2018 the district court noted that the authorities had not fully complied with their obligation under the interim injunction of 25 july 2016 and that all the objections to enforcement had been dismissed.
the applicant acted as one of the leaders in the formation of a mujahedin community in donja bočinja, in the municipality of maglaj; [the mujahedin community] was a closed community and the first of that sort in bosnia and herzegovina ... the applicant was in charge of reconstruction and building and of maintaining contacts with the authorities.having assessed the reasons given by the aliens service and the ministry of security, the content of the classified and open evidence, and the applicant’s arguments, the court concluded that there still existed reasonable doubt as to whether or not the applicant posed a threat to national security and that the imposition of a less strict preventive measure was not justified, given the particular circumstances of the case.ap 2742/13) the constitutional court examined an appeal lodged by the applicant against sixteen judgments delivered by the state court between 14 march 2013 and 25 march 2015 concerning the lawfulness of his detention in the period between 21 march 2013 and 7 june 2015. the constitutional court found a violation of article 5 § 1 (f) of the convention with regard to the period of the applicant’s detention from 21 march 2013 until 14 march 2014 (the lawfulness of which had been addressed by the state court in judgments delivered between 14 march 2013 and 6 january 2014).[as regards the other impugned judgments] ... the constitutional court notes that the appellant was detained because it had been established that he posed a threat to national security; his detention was extended in accordance with the law ..., and he had the possibility of [seeking] judicial review of these decisions ... [on 14 may 2014 the appeals chamber of] the state court quashed the judgment of 10 march 2014 because the state court and the administrative bodies should have disclosed to the appellant the reasons for his detention and the circumstances and facts which had led ... [the national security agency] to conclude that he posed a threat to national security ... ... 57.  the constitutional court notes furthermore that the appellant is a syrian national and not a stateless person, that his bh citizenship was revoked because it was established that he had acquired it by means of fraudulent conduct, false information and the concealment of relevant facts; and that he was placed in detention ... on national-security grounds and that a deportation order has been issued against him.in view of that – and the fact that the authorities have displayed particular diligence in the case of the applicant, who is neither a refugee nor a stateless person ... and the adequate assessment of the existence of a prima facie reasonable suspicion that if released the appellant would pose a threat to national security – the constitutional court concludes, all the while taking into account the excessive length of the appellant’s detention, that there was no violation of article ii/3.d of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina and no violation of article 5 § 1 (f) of the convention as regards the rest of the impugned judgments [delivered between 6 january 2014 and 25 march 2015] ... ... 64.  the constitutional court considers it necessary to emphasise that although it has found a violation of article 5 § 1 (f) of the convention in respect of the judgments delivered between 14 march 2013 and 6 january 2014, given that it did not find such a violation in respect of the rest of the [impugned] judgments, it considers that exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of the case, the finding of a violation is sufficient and that there is no need to remit the case for a rehearing ...” 44.  on 22 december 2015 (decision no.
