THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most     important. They are also     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17. He is the living God, eternal, and         unchanging. As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,         patient, and full of lovingkindness. Psa 89:1,2;         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7. He is absolutely         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of         sinning in though, word, or action. A.  In creation          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end          of time. b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the                  Father had chosen. The Holy Spirit             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the             following ways:             a.   He convicts of sin. John 16:7-11             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new                  birth). c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work                  of sanctification. 12:13             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of                  Scripture. 1 Cor 12             h.   He restrains sin. Acts 1:8----------------------------------Liane Brown(Internet) brownli@ohsu.eduPortland Oregon

This document may be freelycopied for personal use only, and may not be reprinted in a for-profitpublication without the consent of the author. This driver MUST be loaded into   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's   still there). The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer   needed. * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0	for MSDOS. However, because these parity errors occur only during diskaccesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that theparity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/offtiming for certain disk transfers might cause this). This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longerthan necessary. If you do find a copy, you run it like so:	setscsi -n:4  This adjusts the "bus on" timing to 4 microseconds. However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'mmentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my1542. Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discoveredthat using a different floppy controller solves it. When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)reliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenlyable to find and use the tape drive. If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the "DB=" parameter. * Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one  gigabyte in size. This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been	obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in	case someone already has these drivers.]

Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  need to re-boot. When I  first got it it had 4Mg of memory. It ran windows fine (not too many  GPF's). The Leading edge  machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  board. The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  fine by the BIOS RAM check. I have gone through and entire  day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  in the sppace of 20 minutes? This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  diagnostic tools for hardware? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. Any help is truly appreciated.....-Ericebosco@us.oracle.com

When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB. The tool survived the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC. NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,    "It's been a long time since something like this happened. We've lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this." The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on April 2nd. Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the report and Discovery was launched with its "extra payload". NASA officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th launch date. The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB technician. When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster, its 18-inch long rope was still attached. The pliers were found in a part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad. note:  naaahhh,  just too easy)    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that the Shuttle processor will take "appropriate action". Thiokol is a subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch. _________________________________________________________Karl Anderson	DEV/2000: Configuration Management/Version ControlDept 53K/006-2		Rochester, Minnesota 55901253-8044		Tie 8-453-8044INTERNET: karl@vnet.ibm.comPRODIGY: CMMG96A"To seek, to strive, to find, and not to yield."

If your Expose event handler simply redraws everything, you'll bedoing much more work than just drawing the new item "on top" of theexisting scene. -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Mike Yang        Silicon Graphics, Inc.               mikey@sgi.com           415/390-1786

A similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are Jehovah's Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood transfusion. The doctor's efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as Christians could be perceived to be arrogant. The truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of the child is irrelevant here. What matters is that the doctor BELIEVES it to be true, and could be seen to be trying to foce his beliefs on the parents, and this could well be perceived as arrogance. ============================================================Steve Hayes, Department of Missiology & Editorial DepartmentUniv. of South Africa, P.O.

My goal is for this keyboardto look exactly like an AT sytle keyboard to its host system. This will be a highly endowed keyboard with a Little PCL from Z Worldat its heart. The only thing I lack is detailed information on thehardware signaling that the 486 (with  Windows 3.1  and DOS 5.0) will be expecting. My project is independant of Windows, my hope is that some ofyou fellow Window's users/programmers will recognize what I need and be willing to point me in the right direction. I have The Winn L. Rosch Hardware Bible (2nd edition). The HB givesmost (if not all) of the information I will need concerning scan codes and even a wire diagram for the PS/2 style connector I will need, but it leaves a number of important questions unanswered. Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication? I'm    guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock. In either    event, how is the data framed? I'm guessing half-duplex    since the host can turn LEDs on and off. Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the "AT    keyboard standard" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)?

Then Macx changes the colormap so thatthe selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted, but now other applicationsare having to make do with it's colormap.

I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simpleterminal emulator program). The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to theserver for display, one at a time. The characters appear to be too closelyspaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the rightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the rightmost edge of the second character, and so on. It looks like there is aninvisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previouscharacter. There is no problem between the characters when the shell returnsa complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individualcharacters. If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where I should look tofind it, it would be much appreciated. --  Jon Dhuse              |     Internet: jdhuse@sedona.intel.com Intel  Corp.

I would like to request that I be exempted from Christiancoverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly.

Palm Beach Capitals  Now that the Anahaim team is becomming real I'm really beginning to believethe rest of the 'message'. I'm sure the future will turn you into believers too. After 2000 the NHL will abandond ice-rinks. It's so expensive to cool down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is anyway. NHL will become a roller skating hockey league. That way it can create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the game in their back yards ! There won't REALLY be a Disney team in Anaheim, will there?

TRANSLATION The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of materialnature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be freefrom all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and beestablished in the self. PURPORT All material activities involve actions and reactions in the threemodes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, whichcause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitiveactivities to gradually elevate the general public from the field ofsense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself tothe transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in thebeginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supremetranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world arestruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation ofthe material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and getrid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sensegratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then thechance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of theUpanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is apart of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark thebeginning of transcendental life. As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions inthe material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualitiessuch as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by toleratingsuch dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. Thistranscendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when oneis fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.

Since my note taking ability is by no meansinfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine. Permission is granted to copy this without restriction. The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories anddetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements. Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down. 1 G   /                 |                        |                        |0 G                     |             ^          ^           ~100 sec    ~400 secAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below3. Initially, all eight engines are started. As the vehicle  burns fuel theaccelleration increases. However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so itsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether. This causes the dip in accelleration at about 100 seconds. The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit. Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given. My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protectingnational security or MD protecting their own interests? The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.

From: asket@acad2.alaska.eduSubject: When is a couple married...Organization: University of AlaskaLines: 31     I used to be a marriage commissioner for the Alaska CourtSystem (sort of a justice of the peace). I used to pray earnestly in the courthousebathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the coupleswould come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness anddivine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realizethat marriage is God's institution, not the state's. Gradually,however, I came to conclude that because I was acting in astrictly secular, public capacity, established as such by boththe state and the expectations of the couples involved, I wasreally conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with nogreater moral or religious implications than if I had beenconducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony,to "please hurry it up" may have helped me to this conclusion). I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharpdistinction between marriage before God, and "marriage" beforethe state, until I had to deal with my own divorce. KeepingMatthew 19:6 in mind, I felt that the state had no businessdissolving my marriage established before God, but of course itassumed jurisdiction nonetheless. I would ask those of you proposing answers to thisquestion to consider this issue's logical extension: Ifintercourse, or the mental intent of the parties, or theceremony of the church, or any combination thereof, establishesmarriage, then at what moment is it dissolved?

Christian people have caused"objective morality" to look very "relative." If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain thisapparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, thenHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tickphysically, emotionally, etc. That is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (ordetrimental to) the creature He created. To some extent, every activity of aperson's life creates a new situation to which morality must beapplied. There never could be enough volumes to codify God's"objective" morality for us. Throughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list ofrules (objectivity, if you please.) In the Old Testament, we haveboth principles and specific rules. By the time of Jesus, most of theprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules. Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify theapplication of the principles. For example, in	verses 21-22:  "You have heard that the ancients were told,	'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall	be liable to the court.' But I say to you that everyone who is	angry with his brother shall be liable to the court..."The "objective morality" of God gets blurred by our ineptinterpretation of it. We [Christians] have made our biggest errorswhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLYwhat God intended for us.

There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in theX11R5 distribution. Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program...(take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When usingon-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keepit from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, theywere just about equal. The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculoussizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if yourapplication dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit whendebugging SHM apps). Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to beattached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomesXShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem tosupport the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and usingpixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* touse the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; onecopies the info three times per redraw instead of one). In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is aGood Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pickwhatever feels fastest.

The only way to avoidthis will be to try to prohibit strong encryption.

An old-fashioned wiretap could thendetect the use of pre-encryption, which would drastically increasethe measured entropy of the input.

I don't know if he was putting us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait. The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. You could say that she bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her wedding band and her watch were gold. After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead, halfway into the other world. She said, "I was afraid to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'." I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing." Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. That's just what he said, "those Azerbaijanis," as though he himself were not Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, "I'll drivethem out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nailsand nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41."

Since they aren't fixed in position on theirstainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly differentposition. I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, butneeds to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of ouroffice's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, onecould still adjust the roller slightly. I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. Ifyou can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl alcohol. If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and seeif it is actually causing the axle to spin. If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-( It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would benecessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been thatdirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction. Hope this helps,Murray -- Murray M.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquirecelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities. On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinkedto the spacecraft without incident. This sequence covers spacecraft activityfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio RelayAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993. The command loss timer was set to11 days as a part of this sequence memory load. On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer(MAG) instruments. Preliminary analysis indicates the data was receivedproperly. Preliminaryanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulationindex is near the optimal level. Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal. The AC measurement reads19 DN (4.3 volts). The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts). Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance testfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21(Compatibility Test Area 21).

The ice princess next door makes a habit of flooring her cage out of the driveway when she sees me coming. I made the mistake of waving to a neighbor. I was riding downhill at ~60mph on a local backroad when a brown dobie came flashing through the brush at well over 30mph, on an intercept course with my front wheel. The dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard me and still had a lead when it hit the road. The dog was approaching from my left, and was running full tilt to get to my bike on the other side of the road before I went by. Rover was looking back at me to calculate the final trajectory. Too bad it didn't notice the car approaching at 50+mph from the other direction. I got a closeup view of the our poor canine friend's noggin careening off the front bumper, smacking the asphalt, and getting runover by the front tire. It managed a pretty good yelp, just before impact. ( I guess the driver didn't see me or they probably would have swerved into my lane. The squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back home, but I haven't seen it since.

We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network. The copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface. I can also print rgb files, but these are in turn converted to postscript by an internal filter. When we convert to postscript with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that acceptable. Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image formatand translating the image into postscript. We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the SCSI port. To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a warranty. The management here does not want to spend this much money without some assurance that the product will work. Here my questions:If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or parallel port? Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?

He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,    not gain more bulk. Conservatively, I'd say he's    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed. Note that he acts sort of like    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is    released. Downing could do this without significant head movement -    Canseco can't. Without a good starting point, it's hard    to make adjustments in your swing. Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing. First, minimize movement before the swing. Close and widen the stance,and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing. Hopefully, thiswill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to movethe bathead more freely.

Dr. Noordewier has appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational biology. 12:00-2:45pm "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for  Biologists"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological applications. Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge representation, inference, and machine learning. The intended audience includes biologists with some computational background, but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence. Genetic Programming, an extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will also be addressed. Particular attention will be paid to biological applications, and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the methods. These involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional relatedness.

Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part. * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance? * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are  relatively easy to break? Cryptanalysis is the art  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when  you're not supposed to be able to. Decryption means any procedure to convert  ciphertext into plaintext. The  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up  to the mid-60's. Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or  Sinkov [SIN66]. The  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,  access control, and formal models of security. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses  of many classical cryptosystems. Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered  practical. A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above. Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused.

What   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet. The study received widespread media attention and stirred a	good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public. However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers	did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did	actually translate into an increase in eating. The two do not	necessarily go hand in hand. And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the	Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins	University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-	sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in	the amount of food eaten afterward. One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing	cancer is aspartame. But it most certainly has been blamed for a	host of other ills. Granted, the FDA has set forth an "acceptable daily intake" of	50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight. man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams	of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups	of yogurt -- to go over the limit. [chart with aspartame content	of selected foods omitted]	   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away	from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called	phenylketonuria, or PKU. To help people with	PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other	aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning "Phenylketonurics:	Contains Phenylalanine." -Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)

Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, sincerespect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations. Thisdoesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace inthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it. Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians shouldaddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity. Likeit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,and isn't. I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity hasforgotten. The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a greatdeal of resistance. This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who havehad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches. Second, paganism respects the physical world. This is an idea with greatramifications. Christianity has a longtradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppressand deny their sexuality. This is too much--sex is clearly a part of humanexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option. Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderatedsexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.

It clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in manycases it will do fine. The critical information from the neuron is inthe firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials perseconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of thesignal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bitconvertor is more then sufficient. AC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many casesyou are not interested in the DC level. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. Ifthe cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightlydistorted. But even that normally does not matter since it is theoccurrence of the spike that is important. However, I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I startbattling with the toolbox to get it going. As yet I have no clue wereto start looking for the technical specifications.

I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a coupleof things jumped out at me. First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type ofweapon used in self defense. 1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to "weapon." The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gundefenses reported *fell* by almost 25%. Unless there's an explanation forthis, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time. Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, andnot just a reporting difference?

This three part message consists of E[M; K], K encryptedwith some other key, and the chip serial number. This three partmessage is then encrypted by still another key. For example, say we are dealing with an encrypted digitizedvoice application. The speech waveform is sampled and digitizedand then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block. This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-securecommunications link. Is something appended toeach 64 bit block? Is a header sent at the beginning of thesession? If the header is sent at the beginning of the session, howdo they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip doesjust that? Can just anyone manufacture products using the chip?

( BTW, as of acouple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is thatmost people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-order types. For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is aHUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily. Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these arenot as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. The other parts,more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.

Just the other day, I ordered a VRAM chip for my new LCIII fromMac Connection. They sent it overnight (very nice) and I got it installed,and we found that it didn't work properly. When you put the computer in thousands mode, the bottom of the screen (using the new chip) is all flickeringand fuzzy. So I called them up and I'm going to return it for a new one. My question is, how often does such a thing happen with SIMM chips in general? Do you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad? This is the first chip I've ordered so I have no other experiencein this area. I'm just curious if anyone else has had the same type ofexperience.

Letting one's mind roamfreely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of comingup with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysisof the problem first. Scientific intuition is not something one is born with. Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding newscientific ideas. One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalisticstudies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the theory of evolution. This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizesempirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informalexploration as important scientific work. I agree that mere speculationdoes not deserve to be called science. I also think that mere empiricalstudies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a verypoor kind of science.

The remaining 22 games, as well as some of the early round playoff games, will be available by "subscription tv" only. To receive the games, you'll have to pay a one time hook up fee, andthen a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars. Also, under the new deal, there will no longer be radio/tv simulcasts. There will be a TV broadcast team, and a radiobroadcast team. Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwaldare both under contract with KDKA, but their contracts expire at theend of this season. KBL President Bill Craig said he'd like to hireLange and Steigerwald. LoriContact for the Penguinslli+@cs.cmu.edu

The greatest danger of the escrow database, if it were kept on disk,would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out. Youcan design lots of protection, but with enough corruption a completecopy is always possible. Storing it on paper or something very hardto copy at once may actually make sense.

An optionin the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creatsa Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics. Typing a <RET> whilethe Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be "Tek-term") isactive makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focusto the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top ofXterm. If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.) The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it. Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move the Tek-term to the top. If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve screen space, it stays an icon. The desired behavior: one of two options -     1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the        inactive one. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon       but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher        level than the Xterm. What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term willbe at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term. These commands, would, I'd guess, need to be in the Fortran or in the command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term.

Hopefully the LDS   netters will be amiable in their explanation.) Mr. England wrote the following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring 1993 edition):  "I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other   with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian   or non-Christian -- Hal 8^). When we are tempted to draw a circle around  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude  those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central  defining characteristic of a good American might be "one who doesn't draw  exclusive circles" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the   central American ideal is by excluding others. "I recently spent some time in a "Christian" bookstore in California. The  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons. But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking   others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American  culture, or other religions. A whole section was devoted to "Cults and the  Occult," and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism. "It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety ("Perfect  love casteth out fear," I John 4:18). It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of  others they believe to be evil." Once again, being in the majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective voice is louder. Using someone elses biased research of truths and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. Let us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion and conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.

I wouldn't expect to be able to do this. Not because the engineers at BMW areputting in anti-fraud logic, but just because an automobile is a noisy, hostileenvironment for electronics, and I would expect the software to be conservative.

I wouldn't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter:  remember, it'sprobably damped so it can't move too fast, and is probably protected.

Reading the cases of people who've tried the various thingsMr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) thosewho win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to theirclaim, and (2) those who lose. Consider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seencited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff. Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in theshow and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says thatan individual has to file a return. Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcastthe next morning. Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended topeople who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offerfor Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, andso Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000. So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against aclaim on the $100,000 reward. However, his win had nothing to do withthe tax code.

Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim peoplebetween 1914 and 1920. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of theEuropean Jewry during WWII. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, childrenand elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last four years. For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutionsculminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds. The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye. Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity. Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland. During the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate theunity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkishand Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the strugglefor that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.

SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4]are for IRQ5. The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow. The only identification printed on the board is "MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD"across the bottom. There is a box for serial number, but it is blank.

The real fear comes fromthem doing more than this. This is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to onthe surface. Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one. It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't haveregistered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan formost phone companies. AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryptionproduct. The government has marketed hard to get major vendors touse these chips. If they get enough market share, they will rule. The public isn't that concerned about it now,after all. They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listento today! They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that securethem only from the police. Well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work withother proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phonesexpensive. Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell themcheap, only the Mob will buy them. And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists ofbetter encryption phones, because "the only reason a person would wantone is to evade the police." -- Brad Templeton, ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale, CA 408/296-0366

Strictly,a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output changestate, according to the inputs. A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine whichof four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enableinput, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, alloutputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) outputwill be low). Thus you achieve youraim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Notethat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, sinceyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) leftonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose. A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plusa mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, usethe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide thefour enable lines. Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to thefour final stage decoders. Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.

There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price. They allsaid low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.

Israel has a right to keep Jerusalem for many reasons. Theyinclude the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, thefact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and thehistorical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem. When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948,the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visitreligious shrines. This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan,who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control. TheJordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city. They turned aJewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in theirlatrines. Israel has allowed individuals of all religions intoJerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness tocontrol the city. Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered inJerusalem, but has holy sites there. The home of Islam is Mecca,where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title butoff ice was less happy. They have played "home" games in placeslike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. ===================================================SENATORS SOLDThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman tothe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHLhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meetingin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it clear the league was more interested in the stability of the AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintainingthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with CharlottetownNew Brunswick and are expected to move there. ==================================================DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTONAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation outof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashingtheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and theywanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise. Thus keeping the Hawksin the New Brunswick city. They become the third team to announce a limitedfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders. ======================================================AHL GAME OF THE WEEKIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. =====================================================UTICA GONE? =====================================================WHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEARONE OPTION				ANOTHER OPTION			Northern Division			Southern DivisionADIRONDACK RED WINGS			ADIRONDACKSPRINGFIELD INDIANS			SPRINGFIELDPROVIDENCE BRUINS			PROVIDENCECD ISLANDERS				CDIPORTLAND PIRATES			HERSHEY					BINGHAMTONSouthern Division			ROCHESTERHERSHEY BEARS				HAMILTONBINGHAMTON RANGERS			UTICAROCHESTER AMERICANSHAMILTON CANUCKS			Atlantic DivisionUTICA (?)

I'm not going to let a bunch of seven suits tellme what the right way to estimate cost effectiveness is, atleast not until they can make their mind up long enoughto leave their scheme stable for a fiscal year or two. If you were to ask the British governmentwhether their colonisation efforts in the Americas were costeffective, what answer do you think you'd get?

They mislabled my address and I did not receive my packageuntil one month ago. I was mad and angry about how it took themso long to get my package. So I wrote them a letter and requestedfor a refund. I was lucky enough tofind out their telephone number through operator and received thepackage. I immediately returned the package and wrote them anotherletter to ask for refund. The package was returned because theyaddress they put on the package was incorrect. It took me at least 10 phone calls to find out their new number,but they refused to take any responsibility. I spoke to theirmanager and she said she would call me back, but she has not callyet. Should I just go ahead and send the package?

This probably tells you somethingabout how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAMEof the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have to say? With regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several. You canbuy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both GraphOn and NCD. (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.) NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which isNCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's. There may be other such software packages available. X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for runningX11 over low-speed connections. It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote. It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, therewill be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various sorts of hardware.

The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, wasreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver timesrequired using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actualEVA tasks on previous missions. "Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three isto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to thedynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks," Mission Director Randy Brinkley said. "It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing addedflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations." "When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest throughlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for eachspacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate," said Milt Heflin, Lead FlightDirector for the mission. "We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previousspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,"Heflin said. "In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary toformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possibleto accomplish the mission objectives." Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessionsthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integratedsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours. In addition, many stand aloneunderwater training "runs" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk. Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will bemade based on actual training experience during the months prior to themission. Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flightwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques. Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will includespacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission. Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built withgrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures. The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990. At thattime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may havebecome necessary. - end -     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

So long as your own brain is involved,there is a possibility for error. Someone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, buthe did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphraseSartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argumentleads to relativism. As I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as falsebecause you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just becauseyou dislike them. All he has said is that he doesnot like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it. *There were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to thepoint at hand:>  There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be> experienced and it is verifiable. However, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning aboutthem, we are on much shakier ground. Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trustedin very limited circumstances. >  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute> about a thing. Once God's revelation stops, and your ownreasoning begins, possibility for error appears. Was he thinking ofTran- or Con- substatiation? But we knowthat our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong. Beyond that, once we start making updoctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, weget into trouble. They do notbelieve we are infallible, any more than we do. Witnessing ishardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that youare either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally tryingto cover them up.

Organization: fnalLines: 25Distribution: worldNNTP-Posting-Host: phurh.fnal.govHere's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumpedmyself and a few others:What does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a largecache set (through control panel) in your SIMMs? EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don'trob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?). Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on thecache card? Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cachebetween the card and the SIMM's? Or does it still speed things up byproviding a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly intothe SIMM RAM cache? I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory toreally do any good compared to what you can set yourself. Yet, DaystarFastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on someoperations. Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMMaccesses? Please help, I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIcisystem described in the EX above.

From: JEK@cu.nih.govSubject: about Eliz C ProphetLines: 21Rob Butera asks about a book called THE LOST YEARS OF JESUS, byElizabeth Clare Prophet. However, Miss Prophet is the leader of agroup (The Church Universal and Triumphant) derived from the I AMgroup founded by a Mr. Ballard who began his mission in the 1930's(I am writing this from memory and may not have all the detailsstraight -- for an old account, check your library for a bnook byMarcus Bach) after an eighteenth-century Frenchman appeared, tappedhim on the shoulder, and offered him a cup of "cosmic essence." Amajor tenet of the movement is that there is a monastery in themountains of Tibet from which a monk descends to the lower altitudesevery few centuries to preach, and that all major religions havebeen founded by monks from this monastery. Typically, the Ballardfamily and their successors, the Prophet family (related bymarriage, if I remember aright), base almost all their teachings onmessages they have allegedly received by telepathy from Tibet. Ishould be surprised if the book you mention has any scholarly basis.

Urbana, ILLines: 117Disclaimer -- This is for fun. I've figured out some defensive statsfor the second basemen. Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,fluke shots, and a monster park factor. By the same method I've calculated Net DoublePlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by). Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, orDCON :->. Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), whichshould represent the player's total contribution to the team. The formula for DCON appears at the end of thisarticle. The short version -- definition of termsHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt StillwellNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielderNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielderNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielderDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate. DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution. The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are factored into SLG. That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors. For more discussion see the post on Hits Stolen -- First Base 1992-- Dale J.

Andy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91? Has anyone seen him pitch the two good games? Kelly Keach		kkeach@pomona.claremont.edu

Such opposition is often wit-nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. AhmadiMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.

Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode(probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar notspent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft. In order to turn thespacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will beavailable, or you need to retrain a new team. Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed. Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set. Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a "standby" mode foruse in an emergency. In that case, however, the same ops team is stillrequired to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance isrelatively cheap. Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenanceto stay under control) is also right on the mark. I suggested a spin-stabilized control mode because it would require little power or maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from timeto time. In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.

From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler)Subject: Re: What WAS the immaculate conceptionOrganization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PALines: 48Biblical basis for the Immaculate Conception:1) "I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, andbetween your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crushyour head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel." -Genesis 3.152) "He who commits sin is of the devil ..."    -1 John 3.83) "Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with thee ..."    -Luke 1.28   From the above, we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is thefirst promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles ofSatan. "[ Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood inthe truth because there is no truth in him." Now the woman is bothEve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. "Her seed" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in thesame way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan. Thus, knowing aswe do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude thatMary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmitywith the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of hersinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, aswould God's veracity. For God promised an enmity between Mary and theserpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved. Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by theArchangle Gabriel "full of grace." As I pointed out above this is fromthe Greek word "Kecharitomene" which means not just full of grace, but aplenitude or perfection of grace. The sense of it is best grasped bythe footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, "Hail you who have been and reaminfilled with grace." But that is a little to long to say, so it isreduced to full of grace. And as it says, "you who have been" Mary hadalways been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, whichwas also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later. It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have donewhat the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do. And ifGod could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through hisMother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which theFathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all ofChristian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope onthe matter in "Ineffibilus Deus."

There are at least two other FFRDCs (Federally Funded Research and DevelopmentCorporations) that work for NSA: Aerospace Corporation and the Institute forDefense Analysis. Now, if NSA were to be untrustworthy (a position that Iam neutral about, for purposes of this posting), it would be in a position toexert economic pressure upon Mitre to release key halves on demand. It couldjust say, "If you don't cooperate with us, we'll place all our evaluationcontracts with Aerospace and IDA." I am not saying that people at NSA, Mitre, Aerospace, or IDA are dishonestfolk.

Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the teamis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/gameand giving up 6.6/game. Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gavethe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to besuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief eitherheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpenis a big question mark. Today's gamewith California was cancelled.

Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE. Using the edgedictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation ofthis face. And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistentlyorienting the entire surface. Find the average of the vertices in this surface. Using that point,calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face'sorientation. If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the facesare oriented correctly. If it is negative, reverse their orientations(mark them CLOCKWISE). If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another faceand go through the algorithm again. At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversedbefore facet normals are found.

And in the NHL,there exist these things called "ties". A tie occurs when a game endswith the score for each team equal. There also exits these things called "wins". (Oh yeah, only two teams play each otherat a time, so I can say "the opponent".) So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10ties. Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties. Thefirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points. So,Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, thenthat's what it means. In our example, the second team would win thetiebreaker and therefore have the "better" record, even though both teamshad the same number of points. :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)--    Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!! kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		IVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!

I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wastingspace, but I thought you might want some relief from the "So-and-so is a thief"posts. Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would benice to hear some good news once in a while. After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller arequest for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS. He suggested a price of $50in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping. That soundedmore than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found amessage from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailedthe money order). After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized andassured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for. Hesent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating atransfer of license. This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked himto fill out one of their forms. It took three timesto get it to the right address (my fault). Anyway, he mailed me the form formy signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in thedeal. Again, he apologized for not sending it before. I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatatyou may want, give him a call. If I had the choice, I would purchase all of mysoftware from him.

If you think otherwise, try to construct a proof thatyesterday happened. Obviously it did; anyone old enough to bereading this was there for it and remembers that it happened. A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere. You need axioms to talk about logical proof. You can say thatyou remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anythingyou clearly remember happened. Evidences of theresurrected Jesus exist. I also think that this will not happen, asthe evidence for the resurrection is quite good as these thingsgo. It is not entirely fair to claim that you can only takethe resurrection on faith.

Christianity is not the cause of the massacresand horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the faultof people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modifyit to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter theirambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable inthe New Testament. people will understand it in a distortedway, with inevitable consequences. The Bible's message is that we are to love all people, andthat all people are redeemable. It preaches a message ofrepentance, and of giving. Unfortunately, all people havedeceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this messagearound and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways. This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine. One of the problems is that you look at the world throughthe eyes of Western history. I think that you will findmany, many cases of massacres that were instigated bypeople who never claimed they were Christian. I doubt that wewould have the same freedoms in the countries in which welive, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ. Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst forpower, greed and hatred. I believe that a line of questioning like you presentedis, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian. Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviourof the world, and especially Christians.

If not, how fancy does the compression need to be? Note: I am *not* a cable freak, so I might have completelymisunderstood what you said. Also, my math is frequently noted forbeing wrong, so you'll better check the calculations yourself. This corresponds to aNyquist frequency of 720 Hz, which should be too low, especially ifyou think about the 8-bit low quality sound. Furthermore, your D/Aconverter will probably not present you with a signal that has beencut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higherfrequencies. (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcomethat problem.) On the other hand, speech should be easily compressible. For example,you could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter andthen linearize the fourier transforms. It won't be CD quality sound,but it'll be discernible. The power spectrum method is very good inthat respect. I have once programmed such a software compressor, andcompression rates of 90% with relative errors due to linearization ofless than 5% were common.

The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't saythat the Law was abolished. It simply acknowledged that fact that itdidn't apply to Gentiles. I think we can reasonably assume thatMat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience. However there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul onthe Law. At least as Iread Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in acertain sense superceded. While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in theend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion. Thequoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the restof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets theLaw. He is quiteconcerned about maintaining moral standards. As is natural in lettersresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of theLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewishceremonies. On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seemsto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals andhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were laterto give Paul so much trouble.

Any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections, and whenits fuel runs out it will crash within months. The orbits of the Apollomotherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a fewdays. It is *possible* that there are stable orbits here and there --the Moon's gravitational field is poorly mapped -- but we know of none. Perturbations from Sun and Earth are relatively minor issues at lowaltitudes. The big problem is that the Moon's own gravitational fieldis quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the Moon. | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

This was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus inslave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners. But how culturally & biblically accurate arethese icons? Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found inEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna. But what about Biblicalphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,His feet to that of brass? And think about the area of the world where allBiblical actions took place. I welcome all intelligent commentary on thisimportant topic; flamers need not reply. Sherlette P.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn't matter whatcolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."

And as forsaying that "it doesn't matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipatedpeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  ITMATTERS.

They claim to be able to  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase. But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is  the phantom effect. During high frequency photography of a leaf from  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly. The important thing  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern  can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.

This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB   VRAM. 2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to      be. b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK). 3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development   Environment. The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled. Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter   "R". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it   does this satisfactorily. The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles   the VGA mode. The same bug shows up when I use   another monitor in place of my usual one. I still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will beremedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).

If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably besufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz perchannel sampling rate.) That level of analog multiplexing shouldbe rather easy to accomplish. Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do withoutgenerating intermodulation. A system to be carried by a runner isin a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult tokeep balanced.

At this time her doctor  suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue. While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being  manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) This was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is  persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3 and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term. My questions are:      Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the     levels of pain? Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced? Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated. Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group. If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated. S.W.

I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz. The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be usedat these speeds. There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved designof this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly). While using this would have let me reduce the "external" IF count onreceive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so Ididn't bother with it. The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2MHz channel but later reduced to half that. These 256 kbps radiosactually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps andspeed is pretty much a function of filter design. Handling the datastream is another matter entirely. Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a"beacon" test mode. I'm currently working on a spreadspectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems. I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we  agreed on a price. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  started adding up the numbers. He then said he needed  another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  the turn of events. Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  to know what happened. I told him  that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  pretty steamed about the whole affair. I told  him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else. Everyone seemed to know about the  incident, even the lot boy. So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.
From: qtm2w@virginia.edu (Quinn T. McCord)Subject: Questions from a newbieOrganization: University of VirginiaLines: 56	Is life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on acurve? I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want toknow what some of you people think. Specifically, are there aninfinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one thathe/she deserves? Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Is the person's childhood takeninto account? I suspectthat's because our primary source of information is prophets andvisionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic. Howeverboth Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelationto John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life andeternal death. On a number of occasions Jesus does say things thatimply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number ofsimilar passages where Jesus says things like "even XXX will be betteroff than you in the judgement." Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought ofassociating grading with God. While there aredifferences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we allagree that in one way or another, God cheats. I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactlyhow far God's cheating extends. Will he accept people who don'texplicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in theirhearts? Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least inprinciple, but certainly not all do. Jesus provided us with a cleardescription of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that heprovided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividingline. Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whetherother individuals are saved or not.

In some places it hasobvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums andto the Septuagint. It must be emphasized that, to the best ofmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, andhave little theological import. The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all ofIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books. As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variationsbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions. These tend to reflect theseptuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error. Again, though, thedifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically. There is this bigexpectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in thematerial, but so far this hasn't happened.

From: jhpb@sarto.budd-lake.nj.us (Joseph H. Buehler)Subject: Re: SSPX schism ? And I pared down the rest to what was relevant. Joe Buehler...Schism and DisobedienceAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in arefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of theChurch united to him. The Archbishop madehis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: "We prayfor the Pope every day. We don't even say that heis a heretical Pope. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of thebishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers ofjurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose ofensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations andalso to perform confirmations. It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's criticsthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vaticanhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression. There is notso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. Thefirst part deals with "Offenses against Religion and the Unity of theChurch" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). A comparablesmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainlyjustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. It is this usurpation of the powers ofthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing aparallel Church. Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una VoceAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and heknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has nogreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. A quotation from astatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February1989 Remnant merits careful study:    In retrospect, the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June    appears more paved with grave Roman (and, unfortunately, also    papal) omissions than with Lefebvrist "obstinancies."

I cut some players, likeKenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunchof pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at acost of $1 million for the lot of them.

The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared	with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16	for the DES). It supports all 4 DES modes of operation. F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips	N, a 30-bit serial number	U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted		 with the chip	The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then	fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:  	   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 	   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block. All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications   like cellular phones (or even regular phones over 2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output? Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,   or also to the wiretap block? Or, if the wiretap block is only   transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into   everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode? 3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself? Does the block have to be present at all? Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,   it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's    limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,   and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness   (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets   it recognize a valid E[K;U].) In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT   wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention? (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.) Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;   paranoid people can use someone else's serial number. On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,   presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,   like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ? --#				Pray for peace;      Bill# Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ#	              No, I'm *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....# White House Commect Line 1-202-456-1111  fax 1-202-456-2461

I suspect you have very limited experience -- US freeways varydramatically, particularly between states. I can name a number ofinterstate highways in various parts of the country where 130 would bevery optimistic in any car. I'm not sure what you call "quite severe" in terms of road deviationsbut I suspect every single bridge junction on I84 through CT would beconsidered so. That's not the onlyinterstate I've seen with such deviations, but it's one I drivefrequently. Texas is pretty much an edge-case -- you can't assume that everywherehas roads in such good condition, such flat terrain, and suchwide-open spaces.

This would require a constitutional amendment, and Congressenjoys raising taxes too much to restrict themselves like that. (Besides, with the 2/3 majority necessary to pull that off you'd have a difficult time "forcing" anything like that.) Primarily because it's a practical impossibility to "freeze"tax rates. However, this is something that bothers me. We're always talkingabout "consumer confidence" and "consumer spending" as gauges for theeconomy.

I've had kidney stones 4 times and I know the pain she is going through. First, it is best that she see a doctor. However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and theonly thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for aurinary tract infection. The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stonesare extremely painful. My stones were judged passable, so we just waited itout. However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun. Anyway, if sheabsolutely won't see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhapsan over the counter sleeping pill. But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctor. Kidney stones are not something to fool around with. She should be x-rayed to make sure there is not a serious problem.

From police sources heobtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people. These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a formerLos Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews withpolice and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wideintelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League. Theyhave refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz. At times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger airwith laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous withforeign agents and code names like "Ironsides" and "Flipper." A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knewnothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL. Officially, I'm onlya contract worker with Bruce Hochman. Bullock also gave the trash toGerard for Gerard to examine. Gerard would later return the trash toBullock." Gerard, whose filescontained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people. Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which heattempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on arival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center forHolocaust Studies.

X-Last-Updated: 1993/04/16Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part05Last-modified: 1993/4/15FAQ for sci.crypt, part 5: Product ciphersThis is the fifth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part. The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answersevery 21 days. * What can be proven about the security of a product cipher? * How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size? In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing''  function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a  complex nonlinear fashion. Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,  the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit  blocks. Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show  that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number  of rounds. See the question about "ECB" below for more details. DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)  defined in ANSI X3.92-1981. Despite this, software  implementations abound, and are used by government agencies. Cryptech CRY12C102: 22.5Mbit/s according to Data Sheet, with 32 Bit  interface. D(m)	The DES decryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using  	the same key schedule as in E(m), except that the 16 keys  	in the schedule are used in the opposite order as in E(m). R[n]	The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.

Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution,crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution. Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are   quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by? Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges? Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought thegamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected thatGRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population(within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactichalo. ( Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster wasprobably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)	As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halopopulation should show anisotropy (a local disk population isruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy youhave to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanismof getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should startto see for example the Andromeda's bursters. The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source withthe right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (henceisotropy) and the edge is "the edge of the Universe" ;-)If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron starcolliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then gettingthe spectrum is very hard, but conceivable. If we know anything about physics at that level,the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmicstrings, wrong spectrum for one thing. The situation is further complicated by recent claims thatthere are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NSthey'd actually probably fit relatively easily into theNS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering   hyperspace :-)   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so,# could you provide any evidence ? However:1) Their use so far has been restricted to killing deer, by LSD addicted   "Cherrie" soldiers. 2) They are locked in the cellar of the "Garinei Afula" factory, and since   the Gingi lost the key, no one can use them anymore. 3) Even if the Gingi finds the key, the chief Rabbis have a time lock   on the bombs that does not allow them to be activated on the Sabbath   and during weeks which follow victories of the Betar Jerusalem soccer   team.

Ialso have 340 Pens for it as follows:  10 packs of 4 Black Oil based, 16packs of 4 Red,Green, Blue, and Black pens, 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black,7 packs of 4 Aqueous R,G,Blue,Black,  1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi colorpens,  and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored. I have tested it using the Windows drivers forHP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine. I figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth atleast another $200 more..  One thing is certain, you won't need topurchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens weresealed so they are all still fresh. The rest were capped and seem tofunction as well.

However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answersto the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why? Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate fromthe hard drive. Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), andwhat I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controllercard on my ISA 486-50. I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit). I believe I'm gettingsomething like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU). How would thisnumber compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, andthe state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what wouldYOU want to use on your ISA system? Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if Iwere to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hookup a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (andown the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).

The problem was that the thing had no groundclearance whatsoever. The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and stillunique) overhead cam system. The solution was alittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started thebeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches topressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,uses an electric oil pump. Thiswas feasible because it was a racing engine. The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when itworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionarytechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized thatracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machineswere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly twoSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up anddown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many astwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modernrecord of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcyclehistorians discount this story. * SLMR 2.1a * If you aren't sliding, you aren't riding. ----+===============================================================+|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)||Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|+===============================================================+

Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injuredby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villagesof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians. Once theyare back they announce that they bombed a "terrorist  hideout" wherean 8 year old girl just happened to be. The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a regular basis. There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanesegoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it iscapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they didin all other parts of Lebanon.

A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and ahigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Eachoption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscalyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, researchoperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate programreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds. Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASAbudget for the President's new technology investment. As a result,station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsettingreductions in the rest of the NASA budget. Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session ofthe advisory committee. Generally, the members-designate focused uponadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They alsoreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process theStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisorycommittee to consider. Gibbons also announced that the United States and itsinternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- havedecided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use ofRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process. To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in theredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesignteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIRand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise ofthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. Theoverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducingstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achievingthat goal. Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to theredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve thescience, the technology and the jobs that the space station programrepresents. However, he also is committed to a space station that is wellmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which shouldbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation." NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russianparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space ScienceCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of RoaldSagdeev.

"Public heretics, eventhose who err in good faith (material heretics), do not belong to the bodyof the Church" (Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, 1960, Ludwig Ott, p. 311). All is not lost, however, as you still might belong spiritually to theChurch by your desire to belong to it. As you said, only God can judgethe condition of a man's soul. About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul 1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians. Following the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider   returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac,and Jacob. Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic,that is true. Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processesof God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture. Scripture is oneof the best sources for learning what can be known about God. -- boundary, the catechist no teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no hevenido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, tr.

The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark. Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion. "It's the guns" Vice President Gore said. "We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people", said  the President of Colt industries. "As long as Clinton is in office, we  suspect it will", he added. The President said, "This law will benefit America two ways. In addition,  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the  street." "Their stockpiling,  stockpiling, stockpiling" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference  at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.  Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment  that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been  drawn from the hat. Senator Simon was quoted as saying, "First we'll  fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning", during a press  conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate  building. He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow  the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require  the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,  after all of the cards have been drawn. We may be too busy to seize all those  guns". - end article -  For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)                                 Bill Vojak                                vojak@icebucket.stortek.com				NRA, ILA,                                Colorado Firearms Coalition------------------------------------------------------------The CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

In addition, I find my hazards to be moreoften used than my horn. At speeds below 40mph on the interstates,quite common in mountains with trucks, some states require flashers. In rural areas, flashers let the guy behind you know there is a tractorwith a rather large implement behind it in the way. Use them whenever you need to communicate that things will deviate from the norm. >-- >Chris BeHanna	DoD# 114          1983 H-D FXWG Wide Glide - Jubilee's Red Lady>behanna@syl.nj.nec.com	          1975 CB360T - Baby Bike>Disclaimer:  Now why would NEC	  1991 ZX-11 - needs a name	Is that ZX-11 painted green?

I'm a VERY straight(as an arrow), 17-year old male that is involved in the BSA. I don't care what gay people do among each other, as long as they don't makepasses at me or anything. At my summer camp where I work, my boss is gay. Not in a 'pansy' way of gay (I know a few), but just 'one of the guys'. He doesn't push anything on me, and we give him the same respect back, dueto his position. If anything, the BSA has taught me, I don't know, tolerance or something. Before I met this guy, I thought all gays were 'faries'. So, the BSA HAStaught me to be an antibigot. Basically, It comes down to this: What you do among yourself is your ownbusiness. No one else has the right to tell you otherwise, unless itviolates someone else's civil rights.

Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers stranglingdoctors with budget strings.

Z, contains 77 pages, and can beretrieved fromftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. ====================================================================ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cashsystem based on a problem, called the representation problem, of whichlittle use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is thefirst to be based entirely on discrete logarithms. Using therepresentation problem as a basic concept, some techniques areintroduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal andpayment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earliersystems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient inboth computation and communication complexity than any such systemproposed previously. Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can bemathematically proven to a very great extent. Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve inpreviously known systems. In particular, it can be incorporated even under themost stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Furthermore, the basic cash systemcan be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, whileretaining its computational efficiency. ====================================================================Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system! I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained aspossible. Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail tome and I will try to reply as good as I can.

Such arguments are basically worthless, imho. Would it really matter if it were millions of people who are regularlydenied access to housing, employment, and personal security oreven only one? As for death threats, I happen to know from personalexperience that gay people are far more likely to receivethem based on political veiws or even personal philosophiesrelated to the issue of sexual orientation than are heterosexuals. Not a week goes by that I personally or one of my friendsis not physically or verbally harrassed for even appearing tobe gay. Everyone is garaunteed certain unalienable rights underour current form of government in theory, yet every day gay people are victimized by their local governments, bythe police force, and by (for the most part) an uninformedand ignorant public. A society's sense of justice is judged on the basis ofthe treatment of the people who make up that society. And yes, that includes gays, lesbians,and bisexuals whose "crimes" have no victims, and whoare as varied and diverse as the society of wich they area part. -- Frank Jordan                                                [D[D[D[C[C[C              Gay Arab Bassoonists UNITE!!!

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions. (These measurements are statistical, and you canalways hide a sufficiently small number of a differenttype of GRB with a different origin in the data. I am assumingthat there is only one population of GRBs). The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the centerof the distribution. The only things the Earth is at the exact centerof are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of cometsway beyond Pluto) and the Universe. Cosmological theories, placingGRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies tobe released over a timescale of milliseconds. Oort cloud modelstend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics. If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane ofthe Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center(for a spherical 'halo' population). We don't see this, so if theyare Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years inradius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the AndromedaGalaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.) For comparison, theEarth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy. There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature.

And, in the case of someone who calls himself a Christianbrother yet continues in his sin (and claims that his sin is not a sin at all, but perfectly acceptable), what should be done? Should Christians just ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person? By reaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the Bible, are they using "a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus"? Frankly, I find the occurance of a homosexual Christian attempting to pass himself off as a 'straight' Christian in order to have other Christians accept his chastisement better a *lot* more serious than people reaffirming that the Bible teaches homosexuality is a sin.

There is no question that Candida albicans causes thrush.

The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will beloaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.comwill be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com. mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and itcould - perhaps - be unloaded, if no other driver is loaded after it. The working of both drivers is totally the same. When I ran dos, I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat,because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose theones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6, this advantage is gone,because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differentialanalysis). Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chipand its communications channel. The purpose of this chip is twofold:    	1) Transmit Channel	    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with	    a secondary keying variable. This renders the serial number	    unrecoverable with just the system key	2) Recieve Channel	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number	    is necessary for local operation). This has the net result of hiding the serial number. This gets moreinteresting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large,making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers anda spoofed serial number. Without knowing the system key, you couldlie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie. IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you couldsuccessfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating theformat of your own serial number. Makes you wonder whats being hidden here? Seems  like the secrecy isto prevent you from lying about who you are.

Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bitswide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3Mbytes/sec. Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles toperform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s,which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed. However, Ibelieve a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states). -- Richard Krehbiel                                 richk@grebyn.comOS/2 2.0 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along...

The Roman Empirelasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople. Themain reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople bythe men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had beenexcommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian cityof Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle ofMazinkert. After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matterof time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold ontothe rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middleshould be quite obvious to any student of history. The sack ofConstantinople only hastened the inevitable along. For if the Greekshad wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with theCrusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rdCrusades? Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people theyconsidered heretics, even though those "heretics" were fighting for thecause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkishhordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the somehordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third ofEurope (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that containsXlib graphics. A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new itemto be drawn in the Window. This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the newitem in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take careof rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that theWindow is mapped. The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the windowis visible and mapped. Do you know the best way to "tickle" a window sothat the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item?
