Former FBI director James Comey speaks during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Thursday, June 8, 2017, in Washington.WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - The White House initially said Trump fired Comey over his handling of the Hillary Clinton private email server investigation, however, later the US president stated that when he decided to dismiss Comey, he was thinking of the Russia investigation.US President Donald Trump said in a statement on Thursday that he did not fire former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey because of the Russia investigation.Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2018 In an interview with NBC News Lester Holt in May 2017, Trump said he was thinking about "this Russia thing" when he decided to fire Comey.READ MORE: Twitter on Fire as Comey Strikes Back at Trump "Lying" About FBI Comeys firing ultimately led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate allegations of Russian interference into the 2016 election and collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign.Trump has also denied any collusion with the Kremlin and has called Muellers investigation "a witch hunt."
President Trump responded to the Senate Republicans inability to pass a skinny version of Obamacares repeal the only way he knows how: Twitter.The bill, titled the Health Care Freedom Act, would have repealed the individual insurance mandate.GOP leaders and Vice President Mike Pence huddled with McCain, Murkowski and Collins before the vote, which was stalled for nearly an hour.A few minutes before the vote, McCain crossed the chamber to huddle with Democrats.The vote is a devastating blow for Republicans who have fought for months to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and will likely have to start the process all over again."This is clearly a disappointing moment," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said shortly after the final vote tally was called.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer admitted that the current health care law is not perfect and called for Republicans and Democrats to work together to fix the problems with Obamacare.Other memorable moments from the health care debate: Now the Senate will move on to the defense budget.
As the FS1 Dynamic Duo began discussing the topic, Sharpe went on an incredible eight-minute rant on how NFL owners suddenly got an awakening about President Trump’s comments at an Alabama rally about players who kneel during the national anthem.And then he expressed why he was disappointed and unimpressed: I’m disappointed, Skip and Joy, because this is the tipping point.Of the 7,537 things that President Trump has said in the last 50 years, him calling an NFL player a ‘SOB’ is what brought the NFL, the owners and players together.You see, President Trump has bullied a lot of people … Sharpe then mentioned Trump’s comments on Mexico, attacking a Gold Star family after last year’s Democratic National Convention, and his statements to former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush about women saying, that did not shock the conscience of NFL owners.And then, Skip, he called players that protested the anthem … he called them ‘SOB’s.’ Think about that now, he called them ‘SOB’s.’ That’s what got the owners, that’s what got the players to unite.He also pointed out Colin Kaepernick, who started the kneeling during the national anthem, was forgotten and the NFL owners were uniting against Donald Trump.Sharpe said of all the teams that issued statements this weekend, only the Seattle Seahawks got the reason why they were denouncing the President’s statements.Sharpe said he was very disappointed in him, saying Lewis sat in that chair right there saying that he could never kneel, never not stand for the national anthem citing those who died fighting for the flag and then he went down on both knees.
In his election campaign, Mr Trump was clear about his desire to build a "great great" wall along the border of the US and Mexico which he believes will bring an end to illegal immigration from South and Central America.Josephine believes people from her native country are victimised because the Mexican government does not do enough for their people and have no authority when it comes to handling crime, especially in relation to drugs.A Mexican caller is excited for Donald Trump to build a wall along the American and Mexican border The Mexican government has turned a blind eye and the war has been lost with the drugs.Tue, December 13, 2016 Donald John Trump is an American businessman and politician who is President-elect of the United States as well as chairman and president of The Trump Organization No, no, no, Josephine replied.Speaking to CBS in his first major interview since being elected Mr Trump said: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably two million – it could be even three million – we are getting them out of the country or we are going to incarcerate.Collins, attempting to understand why the Mexican woman was so pleased about Mr Trump’s election success, said: Was he saying something that lots of people think but are too scared to say?Josephine said: Yes, and another thing is that I love the people that are here that I know, I know many people that are Asians, that are Arabs, good speaking English people, but there are very few.The most people in the area don’t want to mix, and they are very hostile.
So her recent expression of disgust over Weinstein’s activities ring hollow: At long last, the people who do the strategic planning for Hillary Clinton and tell her what emotions she should imitate in response to various stimuli have weighed in and they have decided that Harvey Weinstein is not a nice man: I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein.Weinstein has been joined at the hip with the Clintons for a couple of decades… Ironically, as it turns out, he was a major defender of Bill Clinton in the Lewinski affair though Weinstein seemed to favor aiming at the ficus bushes rather than blue dresses.Hollywood was a major funder of both the Clinton and Obama political machines, and many a Hollywood star defended Bill Clinton’s sordid activities as a personal matter as long as he was doing a good job as President.They similarly defended Weinstein as Michelle Obama once did, as a wonderful human being, as well as a good friend and just a powerhouse Both the Obamas and Clintons knew Weinstein well and neither should be given a pass for feigning ignorance and shock at his activities: None other than CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on Tuesday evening that former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama should not get a pass on Harvey Weinstein.And we all need to build a culture -- including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect -- so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future… As Breitbart News has reported, Weinstein visited the Obama White House on at least 13 occasions and Obama’s daughter, Malia Obama, recently wrapped up an internship at the New York City offices of The Weinstein Co.Juanita Broaddrick’s story is a credible one, and one of the many  bimbo eruptions that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton handled during her husband Bill’s presidential campaign As Linda Tripp, confidante of former Clinton intern Monica Lewinsky, told the Daily Mail of how Hillary both enabled and covered up Bill’s many dalliances: Tripp said: His political success was largely dependent upon Hillary.At a Trump press conference in 2016, Broaddrick, tired of being accused of being part of that vast right-wing conspiracy, and afraid that her attacker would once again occupy the White House with the woman who orchestrated the attacks on Bill Clinton’s bimbo eruptions, repeated her accusation: Actions speak louder than words, Broaddrick said.Broaddrick, who has said Hillary threatened her, appeared with fellow Clinton sexual assault victims Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey appeared in an interview at presidential suite of the historic Watergate and related the taleof Bill’s assaults and their fear of Hillary’s retaliation: In an exclusive video interview at the presidential suite of the historic Watergate Hotel, the victims of Bill Clinton’s alleged sexual assault -- Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, and Paula Jones -- got together for the first time in person to express their personal fear of Hillary Clinton and to warn voters that Clinton does not stand for women’s issues.
"Ebby went to a party on a Friday night and had been assaulted, and there was a videotape," said Ebbys mother Laurie Jernigan."An incident had occurred at that party that she wanted to discuss, and discuss with the police," said Michael Jernigan."She would move out and hang out, which was really unusual, but she would never run away and not talk to her family," said Laurie."I called Little Rock and notified them that the car had been sitting there for three days, and they had gotten the car and taken it in," said Guy Hooper."The last thing that we need to do is to run out here and start our own investigation and interfere with the police investigation in some way, so we basically did nothing other than try to communicate with the police department and stay in communication with the family," said Vickers.We tracked down Guy Hooper ourselves, and he gave us the shocking details about seeing Ebby with two young black men in the park only days before she disappeared."Its this middle one on the top and the gentleman on the left," said Hooper.We dont know if the Little Rock Police Department has ever seen the potential bombshell evidence that Crime Watch Daily has brought to the table.
Members of the Dallas Cowboys organization have been reluctant to protest the national anthem, with head coach Jason Garrett calling the anthem sacred and Dez Bryant saying he wouldn’t protest.Their attitudes mirror what’s coming from the top.Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has made it clear that he opposes national anthem protests.In an interview with FOX Business, Jones said he did not think the place to express opinions is by protesting the flag."I do not think the place to express yourself in society is as we recognize the American flag."– Jerry Jones on National Anthem protests pic.twitter.com/3JkrdMhwWy — FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) September 24, 2017 Jones’ thoughts echo that of many Americans, though as the demonstrations attest, there are many who disagree.Based on his public comments, it would be a surprise to see a display from any Cowboys on Monday night.
The State Department argued at a federal hearing Thursday that its ability to process the 100,0 Hillary Clinton emails ordered released under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit has been hindered by a lack of manpower due to a "hiring freeze" and that the urgency to release the documents has been diminished by the publics lack of interest in the subject, according to the watchdog group that won the lawsuit for the documents release.Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton is accusing the State Department of slow-rolling the emails being sent from the FBI to the State Department, a large number of which Clinton "failed to disclose" to the government when she served as secretary of state, he said.State Department spokeswoman Pooja Jhunjhunwala told Circa "‎the Department takes its records management responsibilities seriously and is working diligently to process FOIA requests and to balance the demands of the many requests we have received."The State Department was ordered in November to process documents at the rate of 500 pages per month, but "at that rate it would take until 2020 for the bulk to made public," Fitton said."President Trump needs to direct his agencies to follow the the law but right now they are making a mockery of it by saying they wont finish releasing it until 2020," said Fitton, whose group will be heading back to court three months from now to assess the progress.A U.S. official familiar with the case and the agencies told Circa on the condition that they not be named that "there are still holdovers within the departments that dont want to see these emails released, so slow-rolling these requests makes perfect sense.Last week, Judicial Watch released 448 pages of documents the State Department did turn over from Abedin, describing what it said was preferential treatment "to major donors to the Clinton Foundation and political campaigns," according to the group."The documents included six Clinton email exchanges not previously turned over to the State Department, bringing the known total to date to at least 439 emails that were not part of the 55,0 pages of emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department, and further contradicting a statement by Clinton that,  as far as she knew, all of her government emails had been turned over to the State Department," the watchdog group stated in a July 14 press release.
Its a debate playing out across America.Should statues and memorials of Confederate soldiers and officers remain standing, or should they be removed.Those in favor of removing the statues say the statues represent racism.Those who want the statues to remain complain that removing the statues would be an attempt to get rid of history.What do you think?Should cities and states get rid of Confederate statues and memorials?
And he knows that its not enough for just some of us to prosper, for alongside our famous individualism, theres another ingredient in the American saga, a belief that were all connected as one people.Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us; the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes.But Ive got news for them, too: we worship an awesome God in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states.We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.In the end -- in the end -- in the end, thats what this election is about.In the end, that is Gods greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation, a belief in things not seen; a belief that there are better days ahead.I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs, and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.America, tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president, and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president, and this country will reclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness, a brighter day will come.
This riveting finding has resulted in some exposure on the topic – including articles by the New York Times, The Independent UK, and network affiliates such as ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, but the whole story – or the many threads connecting the various murders– is not being told.For this reason, the activist took to the internet today, on the one-year-anniversary of the first of the mysterious deaths, to express how serious of a concern these events are.Prev Next 6) July 19, 2015 A month to the day after the first doctor (Jeff Bradstreet, MD) was found dead with a gunshot wound to his chest, Dr. Ron Schwartz was found murdered in his E. Coast Florida home.Sadly, he was shot to death.Another, a Phd (who was a wife and mother of two) was hit while jogging near the beach and then buried in a shallow grave on the tourist island of Grenada.20) January 26, 2016 Believe it or not just a few short weeks later, a holistic MD and his wife (a physician’s assistant) were attacked, while on a relaxing beach stroll, by a sword wielding man in the same place- the tiny island of Grenada.Both perps in each attack of the doctors in Grenada in a couple of weeks are reported to have been recently released from prison and in both crimes (allegedly unrelated) the men just nonchalantly turned themselves in after the crime.21) January 28th, 2016 The new spate of cancer who are killed or found dead doesn’t slow down and this might be the strangest of them all: Yet another cancer researcher, Professor Alan Clarke, 52, was found dead in the wood in hanging from a tree in a rubber body suit on December 28th, 2015 and they ruled it accidental.29) March 14th, 2016 One of the strangest cases yet is holistic MD and acupuncturist Dr Clogston, 68, who was missing 3 weeks and eventually found dead in his car which was allegedly found off the route some say he took to work for 30 years.
In August outspoken Missouri State Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal called for the assassination of President Trump.Maria Chappelle-Nadal was removed from her committee assignments the next week.Republicans are Nazis.Democrat Maria Chappelle Nadal defended her decision to compare President Trump to Hitler in an interview on Thursday afternoon… AND she played the race card.FOX 2 reported: The St. Louis Post-Dispatch interviewed Chappelle-Nadal about the tweet.She tells the newspaper that, I have a First Amendment right to share my opinion, and if a meme is offensive to people, they should look at the First Amendment again, she said.Maria is the future of the Democrat Party — constant insults and pure insanity.Sponsored Sponsored
Former Dems Now Backing Trump: Our Countrys Going in the Wrong Direction Donald Trump joined Bill OReilly on "The Factor" tonight to discuss a wide range of topics, including his claims that the election is rigged against him."The system is rigged," Trump said, arguing that the media has been "horrible" in their coverage of him, while giving Hillary Clinton a pass for her various scandals.He added that Clinton was also given a pass by the Justice Department and the FBI for her private email server and mishandling of state secrets."She is so guilty in so many different ways that she shouldnt even be allowed to run for president," Trump stated.The Republican nominee added that he also isnt ruling out the possibility of widespread election fraud, with votes being miscounted at locations around the country.OReilly pointed out that there arent any "hard facts" to back up such allegations.Trump asserted that there are 1.8 million deceased people registered to vote and 2.8 million people registered to vote in two states.Watch the "OReilly Factor" interview above, and let us know what you think in the comments.
Truth is, though, social justice is an oxymoron based on the false premise that the cure for injustice is leveling the playing field and redistributing wealth.That’s why you should bolt out of any place of worship that combines Jesus, social justice and the government in the same sentence.In his book, The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism, economist Friedrich Hayek nails what’s really at stake: The aim of socialism is no less than to affect a complete redesigning of our traditional morals, law and language â€’ and on this basis to stamp out the old order and the supposedly inexorable, unjustifiable conditions that prevent the institution of reason, fulfillment, true freedom and justice.They harp about injustice and claim only they can fix it, which is one of the most arrogant, egotistical piles of hogwash you’ll ever hear.As I’ve said before, Democrats’ sacrosanct belief that the government was created to control how fairness is spread around is nothing more than a modern-day effort to reinvent Robin Hood, without all the chivalry and green tights.Those who romantically embrace the concept of social justice believe the misnomer that stealing from some and passing it on to those who should have had it in the first place will result in some sort of righteous leveling.They bring food in one hand and a rifle in the other, knowing if they teach someone how to hunt, they’ll eat for a lifetime.Seizing the opportunity to convert their victims into non-thinking entitlement aficionados, they stop at nothing to meet an immediate need, then lead them by their noses to leftist-run metropolises where crime and government handouts abound.
Rumors that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are allegedly on the verge of divorce have been circulating as early as a few weeks into their marriage.New reports claimed that there is a new woman involved in Jennifer Aniston and Justin Therouxs alleged rocky relationship and its none other than Jens close friend, Chelsea Handler.Is the former "Friends" star jealous because her new husband and her pal are getting too close?"But Justin Theroux has forbidden her from having any more naked romps in his house while he is out of town," the report continued."It bugged him to come home and find Chelsea there and the house a mess, but he bit his tongue.But now that he and Jen are married, he is establishing some ground rules, chief among them is that Chelsea is no longer welcome in their guest room," the report said.It has been previously reported that the newly weds are allegedly having problems over Jennifer Aniston being jealous because of Justins purported closeness with his "The Leftovers" co-star, Margaret Qualley.The newlyweds friends are hoping that the couple work out their differences especially since the couple is allegedly in the process of adopting a baby.
Fake news web sites capitalized on the tragedy of the 1 October 2017 mass shooting event in Las Vegas by proffering various unfounded conspiracy theories as news, particularly those positing that a second shooter took part in the carnage in additional to the one who rained bullets onto a concert crowd from a room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel.In particular, fake news sites focused on Jesus Campos, the Mandalay Bay security guard who reportedly went to investigate a door alarm on the 32nd floor and was wounded in the leg when the shooter fired an estimated 200 bullets through his hotel room door.Those sites initially reported (without any evidence) that Campos was not an innocent victim wounded in the course of his duties, but was actually suspected of being an accomplice in the mass shooting.On 12 October 2017, an impostor CNN lookalike web site doubled down on that tidbit of fake news by posting an article holding that Campos (whose name was repeatedly misspelled as Compos) was not only suspected of being an accomplice to the shooting, but had actually been arrested on the grounds that he, too, shot at concert-goers from the Mandalay Bay’s 32nd floor suite — and then shot the real perpetrator in the head (fatally) and himself in the arm (superficially) to provide cover for his actions: Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Compos has been arrested accused of being an accomplice and second shooter in the Las Vegas massacre that claimed the lives of 59 people and injured more than 500.Jesus Campos had originally been praised for his apparent heroics on October 1st, as he supposedly rushed to Paddock’s suite, was shot in the upper thigh through the door, and continued to help get people to safety despite his wounds.However, FBI officials involved in the investigation now believe he was an accomplice of Paddock’s, and was involved in the initial shooting as a second gunman from the other broken window in Paddock’s 32nd-floor room.We believe he killed [the shooter], shot holes through the door and his own arm to produce physical evidence for his cover story, then went and lay next to the elevator, the FBI official told CNN.Although some confusion remains, as of this writing, about the precise timing of when Campos was wounded relative to the onset of the larger mass shooting rampage, law enforcement has not at any time suggested that Campos was an accomplice to that mass shooting, much less taken him into custody on that basis.
There are many more, including Trump’s club trying to welch on a $1 million hole-in-one payout (out of all of Trump’s bad qualities, his steadfast refusal to pay people what he owes them, while bragging about it, is the most enraging), along with the old bit about Trump blithely ignoring local ordinances so he could put a big, dipshit flagpole up at the Mar-A-Lago club, with his lawyers stating—with a straight face—that a smaller flag would fail to appropriately express the magnitude of Donald J. Trump’s .YOU are the people willing to embarrass this nation and put it on the brink of economic ruin all because you wanna throw an electoral hissy fit.You guys don’t give a shit about facts and research when it comes to Trump, so I’m not gonna give a shit about whatever clumsy meme you cook up to explain why she did Benghazi.He is the worst of America stuffed into a nacho cheese casing, and he is emblematic of the kind of arrogant, flag-waving, trashy, racist moron that the rest of us have to DRAG kicking and screaming into the 21st century: Cliven Bundy, Sean Hannity, Kim Davis, and on and on and on.Trump voters are the people who have spent the past decade or so voting insipid obstructionists into office, sending death threats to anyone who even mentions the idea of gun control, demanding 100% tax cuts on millions of dollars they can only daydream about making, and getting suckered in by any Oil Party candidate waving a NO GAYS flag.And voting for Trump is their way of emulating him, of saying FUCK YOU to everyone else as a mission statement, with no regard for the fallout.TRENDING THIS VERY SECOND travel-and-eats Where to Eat and Drink in Houston, the New Capital of Southern Cool culture Serena Williams Catsuit Is Banned from All Future French Opens news-and-politics No One Knows Why This QAnon Conspiracy Theorist Was in the Oval Office with Trump The old saw is that people get the politicians they deserve, and I’ll be crestfallen if Trump wins and proves this to be true once more.You are telling the world that all of our big talk about freedom and unity and ideals is just a load of shit, and that you would prefer a smoldering dystopia where freedom is just a flimsy cover for evildoing, led by a man who believes that strength is measured only in killing people.

The Daily Beast reported Thursday that the Department of Justice has taken an interest in a familiar subject — the infamous email server of the former Democratic presidential candidate and her alleged bungling of classified information.Citing a source close to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, The Daily Beast claims that the Justice Department wants to know how those tasked with investigating Clintons private email server went about their probe.DOJ officials are also reportedly interested in tallying the classified material contained in her emails and finding out "who put that information into an unclassified environment," The Daily Beast says.Before Clinton was cleared of criminal wrongdoing by the FBI in July 2016, the former secretary of state claimed that many of the emails on her server were classified after the fact or that she was unaware of which "headers" denoted that an email was classified.As such, people within the DOJ are reportedly concerned that Trumps vocal tweets on the matter could cause the impression that the law enforcement agency is only doing the presidents bidding.An unnamed former DOJ official even suggested to The Daily Beast that it was "an open question" if this inquiry would occur "without a political directive from the White House."The Justice Department would not comment on the reported inquiry to The Daily Beast.Kelly OMeara Morales
ET: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell held a press conference on Wednesday and spoke about how the NFL wants players to stand during the national anthem.Goodell steered clear of directly addressing the tweet Donald Trump sent out on Wednesday about the NFLs decision not to force players to stand.Goodell: "were focusing on what we should be doing as the NFL," in response to more questions about Trumps Tweets — Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) October 18, 2017 Additionally, Goodell said he wants the league to "stay out of politics" and talked about how he hopes that there will eventually be "zero" players kneeling during the anthem.Just a week after saying a one-game suspension would have scared Colin Kaepernick from kneeling in protest of the national anthem ever again (ROFL), hes back on Twitter clapping at the NFL for not bringing the hammer down on players who are still protesting.The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017 "The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem," Trump tweeted.If Trump was so concerned about players protesting the national anthem—which, again is a part of the First Amendment—why doesnt he stop the police from murdering black people?If Trumps so concerned about people openly resisting the tradition of bigging up America before playing a game, why doesnt he go to the root of the problem?
It is a rich if tragic irony that the same progressives denouncing Richard Spencer and demanding that municipal statues be torn down for their alleged white supremacist qualities are themselves closely aligned with a white supremacist-tied group.I am speaking, of course, of Planned Parenthood, which is to the abortion-loving Left what Adolf Hitler’s bunker would have become to fascists had Germany not demolished it in the late 1980s: a sort of holy shrine upon which adulation and adoration can be fixated.Read Full Article »

On July 28 1982, President Ronald Reagan designated August 14 as Navajo Code Talkers Day.Reagan called it a day dedicated to "all members of the Navajo Nation and to all Native Americans who gave their special talents and their lives so that others might live.""When called upon to serve the United States, [the Navajo Nation] contributed a precious commodity never before used in this way.In the midst of the fighting in the Pacific during World War II, a gallant group of men from the Navajo Nation utilized their language in coded form to help speed the Allied victory."According to the U.S. Marine Corps, Code Talkers took part in every assault by Marines in the Pacific during the war from 1942 to 1945 serving in all Marine six divisions.The Code Talkers were a vital part to the Allied forces victory as the Navajo language is the only spoken code to have never been deciphered."The dedication and unswerving devotion to duty shown by the men of the Navajo Nation," Reagan said the proclamation, "should serve as a fine example for all Americans."PHOTOS: Honoring the Navajo Code Talkers
As we previously informed you all, Quantasia claimed that she’d met Usher at his concert and then had a one night stand with him later that night, without him telling her that he allegedly has herpes… Fans Called Accuser’s Bluff It was her details ( and the prior lies she was accused of telling about other celebs) that caused many Usher fans to call her bluff though.Sharpton claimed that after Usher’s concert, she went back to her Days Inn hotel room and Usher called her, then went to Days Inn to sex her up like Color Me Badd (okay she didn’t say the Color Me Badd part, but if the shoe fits…).Anywho, after fans heard her ‘Days Inn’ claim, they were like ‘Chile please…Usher ain’t rollin’ up to a cheap Days Inn hotel room to have sex with you.’ Attorney Lisa Bloom with her accuser, Quantasia Days Inn Employee’s Claims Days later, an alleged Days Inn worker then claimed she saw Usher walk into the hotel to go see Quantasia.The worker also said the only reason she revealed that is because she didn’t like that Usher reportedly said to the press that Quantasia isn’t his type.Usher’s Team Provides Their Proof Fast forward to today and Usher has spoken, through his team, to provide 3 facts that shoot down Quantasia’s claims, according to TMZ.Check out what was reported by Usher’s people below… 1. : Usher and , Grace Miguel Sources close to the singer tell TMZ … he says there was never a hotel hookup with Quantasia Sharpton, telling friends, in November 2014 he was on the verge of getting engaged to Grace Miguel.ACCUSER’S TIMELINE CONFLICT: Usher’s people also say on the night in question his show ran late, which pushed the meet-and-greet well after midnight … and that flies in the face with Quantasia’s timeline in which she claims she hooked up with the singer around 12.-via TMZ Sometimes it’s best to make moves in silence…I wonder if Quantasia Sharpton and her attorney, Lisa Bloom, are now wishing that she did, because this is turning out to be a mess.
Stephen Paddock has been identified as the sole suspect in the Las Vegas concert shooting that took place on Sunday night.Police say that Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort &amp; Casino, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more.Just about 12 hours following the attack, the Associated Press reported that ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, adding that Paddock converted to Islam months ago.— The Associated Press (@AP) October 2, 2017 The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the mass shooting in Las Vegas, saying that the perpetrator was ‘a soldier’ who had converted to Islam months ago, without providing any evidence to support the claim… It did not name the suspected shooter…but said he had ‘executed the operation in response to calls to target countries of the coalition’ batting the extremist group in Iraq and Syria, reports the Associated Press.Many people are skeptical about Paddock’s involvement with the group and officials have yet to confirm or deny any ties between ISIS and Paddock.Paddock’s brother, Eric, spoke to the Daily Mail about the shooting.He told the outlet that his brother didn’t have any political or religious affiliation.Eric also clearly stated his opinion on the shooting, saying it was not a terror arrack.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and his wife, Jane Sanders have hired prominent defense attorneys amid an FBI investigation concerning possible bank fraud, according to CBS News and Politico Magazine.The investigation centers on a loan that Jane Sanders secured to expand Burlington College when she was its president.Jane Sanders allegedly distorted school donor levels in a 2010 loan application for $10 million from Peoples United Bank to buy 33 acres of land for the school, which shut down in 2016.Bernie Sanders told the Washington Post that the investigation would clear his wife of any wrongdoing.Rich Cassidy has reportedly been hired to represent Bernie Sanders, while high-profile Washington defense attorney Larry Robbins is reportedly representing Jane Sanders.
PHOTO: Instagram Dont freak out the next time you see President Barack Obama sans wedding ring—he and Michelle are still #goals.In fact, the reason why Obama often goes ringless has us loving the First Couple—who recently celebrated their 24th wedding anniversary on October 3—all the more.It appears that President Obama keeps his left-hand naked because he wants to keep his most precious valuable safe, and doesnt want to risk anything happening to his wedding band.A video recently surfaced on the Washington Post of President Obama discreetly slipping off his wedding ring and placing it in his pocket as he approached a small crowd to shake hands—seemingly indicating that he wants to keep it close and out of any potential harms way.(Like snatchers or who-knows-what-else.People be crazy.)Even with all of the Secret Service agents surrounding him, Obama still takes the utmost precautions with his beloved wedding ring.However, if Obama were to lose his wedding ring—say it slips out of his pocket—he could always call the Ring Finders.
Here’s one thing we can all say for certain regarding the latest twist of the Hillary Clinton email scandal: James Comey, who was once regarded as the Eliot Ness of law enforcement, a modern day straight-shooter impenetrable to political pressure, will instead leave the office of FBI chief as something closer to Inspector Clouseau.Don’t take my word for it; that’s the assessment of just about every law enforcement official, both former and present, I spoke to in the hours following his bizarre decision on Friday to reopen the case on the legality of Hillary Clinton’s email server, just days before the Nov 8 presidential election.It was bizarre, these people tell me, because the whole sordid Hillary Clinton email saga should never have gotten this far; Comey launched an investigation that developed far more evidence than anyone in law enforcement ever believed existed that Hillary Clinton broke the laws involving the receipt of sensitive government documents over an easily hacked private email server while she was President Obama’s secretary of state.My sources in law enforcement were pretty convinced Comey would do the right thing and recommend charges to the Obama Justice Department, despite its political consequence, because the evidence was there and Comey was supposed to be so non political.It was such an odd set rationale that Comey laid out for not bringing that case that most people listening to him at first thought he was laying out his reasoning to bring charges, as he explained one reckless move after another from Clinton in establishing the private server and private emails for handing all her government business.But that wasnt the sentiment inside the FBI, where according to my law enforcement sources, a near mutiny broke out among career agents who believe there was plenty of evidence pointing to Clintons gross negligence that Comey initially said never existed, and that their boss caved to political pressure from the Obama DOJ.Her supporters point out that others like Bush Administration Secretary of State Colin Powell used a private email account, but that omits the fact that Powell’s email was from a computer he kept at the state department and he used it before the document laws were beefed up post 9-11.That’s probably because Powell didn’t have a reason to have a private server that he could control and erase its contents; He didn’t have a private charity that would do business with the federal government and would become a private enrichment vehicle, as Hillary and her former-president husband Bill have in the form of the Clinton Foundation.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence agencies provided advanced warning to Russia about a major terrorist plot in St. Petersburg, allowing Moscow to thwart an attack that could have killed large numbers of people, the White House said on Sunday.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called President Donald J. Trump today to thank him for the advanced warning the United States intelligence agencies provided to Russia concerning a major terror plot in Saint Petersburg, Russia, the White House said in a statement.
"Day One" is a multi-part series in which CBS News Margaret Brennan speaks with former U.S. government officials on the major foreign policy issues the next president will inherit on the first day of their presidency.Look, the best-case scenario would be to have Assad step down, to have a transitional government be able to establish itself representing each of the factions that are there -- the Sunnis, the Kurds, the Shias.And then, frankly, have the Russians and whatever is left of the Syrian forces join with the United States in going after ISIS to truly defeat them.That refugees continue to flow out of Syria, that the Russians continue to have a presence there and continue to attack our moderate forces that were trying to train in Syria.PANETTA: I think the likelihood is that the next president is gonna have to consider adding additional special forces on the ground to try to assist those moderate forces that are taking on ISIS, and that are taking on Assads forces.And when were dealing with the Russians who go in and literally bomb the very forces that were training to go after Assad and to go after ISIS.Theyre not gonna do the right thing without giving our diplomats greater leverage than what they have now to deal with the Russians.To do that we have got to make very clear that we have objectives to achieve, that we intend to press to achieve those objectives, and that we will not allow them to divert us from the goals of defending ourselves.
Roy Moore for Senate In a report titled ‘Roy Moore’s Facebook page shared inflammatory memes, article praising Russia’s anti-gay laws,’ CNN (Cable News Network), one of most rabid left-wing, anti-conservative channels in the United States, sternly criticized the conservative contents of the Facebook page belonging to Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for US Senate in Alabama.Among Moore’s Facebook posts hated by CNN the most highlighted was the BarbWire article  Conservative Russians Give Moral Lesson to Facebook’s Homosexual Propaganda, written by me.CNN said, Moore’s Facebook page also shared an article from the religious conservative website BarbWire.com in July 2015 with the headline, Conservative Russians Give Moral Lesson to Facebook’s Homosexual Propaganda.The article highlighted efforts by some Russians to counter a feature on Facebook that allowed users to overlay a rainbow over their profile picture.Trending: English Professor Assigns Trump-Bashing Books The strongest reaction came from conservative Russians who overlaid an image of the colors of their country’s flag — white, blue and red — over their profile picture, the article read, adding that users also countered the homosexual #LoveWins hashtag with #pridetobestraight and #pridetoberussian.The article also described Russia’s efforts to crack down on the LGBT community, including the country’s so-called gay propaganda law, as a strong stance in defense of traditional family values.CNN added, Moore shared an article in July 2015 that praised Russia’s anti-gay laws and Russians who opposed Facebook’s feature that allowed users to change their profile pictures to celebrate same-sex marriage: I considered it a privilege to have a my conservative BarbWire article shared by Judge Roy Moore.Portuguese version of this article: CNN ataca Roy Moore só porque ele compartilhou meu artigo no portal conservador BarbWire The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of Barb Wire.

I think it’s interesting how you have that transition from somebody who was just being real and communicating to his people in a way that made sense to him; and then you have Howard Stern, who makes a lot of money—and in fact an entire career—from pissing people off.I believe that South Parks anti-PC messages paved the way for white supremacist groups to recruit much of the largely white male fanbase into what is now referred to as the alt-right, or other groups that are identical in all but name.They promoted the idea that marginalized people—trans people, people of color, Jewish people, etc.—speaking out against harm caused by South Parks brand of "humor" and [the shows] "I do what I want" attitude are the real oppressors.They tell these kids that theyre the ones being oppressed by those telling them that they have privilege, and therefore need to make some effort to at least not use certain words and maybe examine prejudiced attitudes they might have picked up from a culture that is prejudiced in many ways.The alt-right promotes the idea of white male victimization, drawing in youth that has been told by South Park that the plight of marginalized groups doesnt matter and that "political correctness" is oppressing them.But it’s so popular and so widespread on the right now, and you actually have people coming out with articles and people in the White House using that rhetoric to help further their political careers.It seemed to come out of nowhere, but then you look at the timing and it does kind of follow Caitlyn Jenner’s coming out to the public as a woman.That in itself probably would have gotten some backlash, but then you look at how popular South Park is, and there’s no way it didn’t play a role in people reacting the way they did: reacting like, oh that’s just so gross—their existence is gross and wrong.
He added that the suspects broke into the home through the front door over the weekend, but said he was not sure exactly how they gained entry.The investigation into the events and the motive behind the Las Vegas shooting last Sunday night is in flux.Last week a press conference was held jointly by the FBI and the local Sheriff in Las Vegas concerning the recent murder of at least 59 people in that city.This directly contradicts with the earlier report that the security guard found the room of the killer and stopped him from shooting on the crowd.The FBI’s lack of transparency along with the corrupt and criminal acts by former FBI Directors lead all of America to begin forming conspiracy theories and to further lose trust in the FBI.Newsmax reports: Paddock shot the unarmed Campos in the leg as he was moving toward the room outside in the hallway, The Daily Beast reported being told by Dave Hickey, president of the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America.[…] Campos had taken an elevator to the 32nd floor of the hotel because the stairway door had been blocked, The Daily Beast said, and when Campos got to the door where he suspected Paddock was barricaded, he was met with gunfire through the door.Schuck was on a higher level of the Las Vegas hotel on Oct. 1 when he got a call to look at a fire exit door that wouldn’t open on the 32nd floor.
The world Is watching and so is oil as the death toll rises in the streets of Iran, where the people revolt against a terrible economy and the lack of any real freedoms and rights.Many arrests have been made and the government of Iran says it may seek the death penalty, for what they say are crimes against God, in demonstrations that have gone on for over 5 days in a row.Bad data is becoming a bigger risk as underinvestment has led to the least amount of oil discoveries in 70 years and the global oil replenishment rate ratio fell to 11 percent this year, down from more than 50 percent in 2012 according to a new report.In ten years’ time, U.S. shale production may peak, at least according to OPEC that sees shale peaking after 2025, although the cartel has conceded that U.S. tight oil has defied previous forecasts and has increased production more than initially expected and will continue to do so in the short-term.What worries analysts the most is the fact that this year the reserve replacement ratio–the amount of discovered resources relative to the amount of production–was a mere 11 percent, compared to 50 percent in 2012, Sonia Mladá Passos, Senior Analyst at Rystad Energy, said.In recent months, Ramirez has grown increasingly critical of Maduro’s handling of a fourth straight year of recession that has triggered malnutrition, widespread food and medicine shortages, the world’s steepest inflation, and a surge in emigration.Their accuracy or completeness is not guaranteed and the giving of the same is not to be deemed as an offer or solicitation on our part with respect to the sale or purchase of any securities or futures.Any decision to purchase or sell as a result of the opinions expressed in this report will be the full responsibility of the person authorizing such transaction.
Trump Jr. allowed Tuesday night in an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel that "he has probably met with other people from Russia" but insisted that he did not attempt to coordinate to impact the election or try to damage Hillary Clinton."It was such a nothing there was nothing to tell" his father, said Trump Jr. Donald Trump Jr. eagerly accepted help from what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid his fathers campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton, according to the emails.He is a great person who loves our country!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017 White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read a brief statement from the president Tuesday in response to revelations that Trump Jr. agreed to hear damaging information on Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian governments effort to help his father.050r5n5LQ— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017 The messages were the latest disclosure to roil the ongoing investigation into potential coordination between Trumps campaign and Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said sought to influence the outcome of the election in Trumps favor.1Xi4nr2gq— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017 In the emails, Goldstone wrote to Trump Jr. that the information "would be very useful to your father.""If its what you say I love it especially later in the summer," Trump Jr. replied to Goldstone in one of a series of email exchanges the younger Trump posted to Twitter.A day later, Trump Jr. changed his account, acknowledging that he was told beforehand that Veselnitskaya might have information "helpful" to the Trump campaign, and was told by her during the meeting that she had something about Clinton.He said that he first wanted to speak by phone, but that when that didnt work out, he was told that the attorney would be in New York "and I decided to take the meeting."
According to Texas Monthly, a 26-year-old hunting guide named Walker Daugherty was shot in the abdomen.When Daugherty reported the incident to law enforcement officials, he and his fiancée claimed that the gunfire came from illegal Mexican immigrants who were attempting to steal the Daugherty’s RV and kidnap their clients.According to KOSA CBS 7, the now-inactive campaign page stated that Daugherty was shot by illegal immigrants who were trying to steal his RV.CREDIT: Credit: GoFundMe Upon hearing the story, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller posted a message to Facebook calling Daugherty a hero and pledging his support for a border wall.According to KOSA CBS 7 in Texas, an investigation by the Presidio County Sheriff’s Department found that the gunfire did not come from immigrants crossing the border — it came from the hunters themselves.The Daugherty family reportedly released a statement about the Presidio County Sheriff’s investigation that was published on the blog The Westerner.We are unable to reveal all the details of the event at this time but we do not agree with the Sherriff’s stated conclusion to the incident.Daugherty and Bryant have since been indicted on charges of deadly conduct by discharging firearms in the direction of others, reports the Austin American-Statesman.
Of the people arrested during the protests, several were wearing masks while others were connected to assaults.The crowd began to diminish around 3:30 p.m., six hours after a march led to the protests.In a statement early Sunday, the group said "we fully intend to move forward with (the Rally Against Hate)" on the campus despite calls by the university police department for people to stay away for safety reasons.The rally was held in response to the planned right-wing protest "No To Marxism in America."However, organizer Amber Cummings canceled the protest on Friday, saying Berkeley officials and left-wing extremists made it impossible to hold the event and she would be the sole attendee.Before the unpermitted events, Berkeley police put into place several rules in response the protests, stating, "To ensure the peaceful expression of free speech, the City of Berkeley will be prohibiting sticks, pipes, poles and anything else that can be used for a riot at Civic Center Park."The group of more than 100 hooded protesters, with shields emblazoned with the words "no hate" and waving a flag identifying themselves as anarchist, broke through police lines, avoiding security checks by officers to take away possible weapons.Then the group blended in with the rest of the crowd.
TAMPA BAY, Fla. - Americans around the country are being urged to donate blood at their local blood center in order to assist victims of Hurricane Irma.OneBlood, a Florida based blood center, resumed blood collections on Tuesday.All blood types are needed, however, there is an urgent need for platelet donors and people with O negative blood.Hurricane Irma forced OneBlood to suspend operations for three days and as a result, there is an urgent need to replenish the blood supply in Florida.Donors should visit for donor center hours and blood drive locations.OneBlood, in coordination with America’s Blood Centers and Blood Centers of America, has been actively arranging for shipments of blood to be brought in to Florida by blood centers from around the country.OneBlood is urging people living outside of Irma’s path to visit their local blood center and donate blood as soon as possible to assist those desperately in need in Florida.Those interested in donating blood may contact the following organizations to find a local blood drive and to schedule an appointment: AABB: +1.301.907.6977
Facebook Stephen C. Paddock has been identified as the lone shooter in the Las Vegas shooting that occurred at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, as reported by USA Today.Since news of the shooting broke, Paddock’s family has begun to speak out and his brother Eric, from Orlando, Florida, has been talking to the media.Get to know more about the shooter through his brother Eric, the incident itself, and how Eric Paddock views the tragedy.Paddock’s Family Is Worried About Being Attacked Over the Incident Eric Paddock says that his 90-year-old mother, who lives close to him, is struggling to cope with the news and is in shock.Like his brother was reported to be, according to his Facebook page, Eric Paddock is retired, like several of his family members in Florida.The Shooter and His Brother Were Not Very Close Stephen C. Paddock and his brother’s relationship was not strained, but they were not very close.Paddock said that, as much as he knew, his brother had no known health or financial problems at the time of the shooting.This Was the Deadliest Shooting In US History With over 50 people dead and over 400 injured in the shooting, this is reported to be the deadliest shooting in American history.
An FBI raid on Elbarasse’s home unearthed a trove of Islamic doctrinal books and key Muslim Brotherhood documents—which became evidence in the largest terrorism-financing trial in U.S. history.A document from the Elbarasse raid outlines the Muslim Brotherhood’s phased plan to destroy Western civilization from within: Phase One: Secret establishment of leadership.But for radicals, sharia is the legal and political foundation for jihad and global rule, a power play to force Islam on the world.It’s primarily political, not religious; though in America it masks itself as a religion to manipulate the First Amendment as a front for seditious activity.You Wont Believe Where It Was Stashed Ahok’s conviction—accompanied by violent rallies and death threats, shows the chilling influence on pluralism by hardline Islamism that the government and judiciary are reluctant to oppose, said Time reporter Nicola Smith.The late Ayatollah Khomeini, and his successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, sidestepped Shi’a believe that the Mahdi (12th Imam), a quasi-messianic figure, must return before waging jihad and adopted an ideology promoting a senior Shiite cleric to theocratic political power over Shiites worldwide.Khomeini inserted his doctrine into the 1989 constitution, in which the regime’s objective is global conquest under sharia rule and nuclear dominance is a surefire path to achieve that goal.Iran and its proxies not only menace Israel’s existence and portend regional upheaval, the bomb of Islamist ideology threatens the lives and freedoms of every sovereign nation in the world.
President Trump on Thursday said it would be a "very sad day" for North Korea if the U.S. military needed to use force against it.President Trump on Thursday praised Kuwait for its contributions to defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and other terrorist groups."The United States is proud to have contributed to the liberation of Kuwait and the friendship we have built together in the years since," he said, referencing the First Gulf War from 1990 to 1991."We also thank Kuwait for its humanitarian leadership and its partnership in the fight to destroy ISIS," Trump added in a joint press conference with Kuwaiti leader Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah.President Trump and Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, the leader of Kuwait, on Thursday are appearing together in a joint press conference after meeting in Washington, D.C. Thursdays meeting comes as Kuwait tries mediating an ongoing diplomatic crisis between Qatar and its Arab neighbors in the Middle East.Trump initially seemed to side with Saudi Arabia on the disagreement, but he then instructed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to back the Kuwaiti mediation initiative.Tillerson and other U.S. diplomats have since traveled through the region to boost Kuwaits efforts, but the dispute has dragged on despite their efforts.Trump was also expected to discuss global efforts to isolate North Korea by halting employment of its guest workers during his talks with Al Sabah.
While officially the White House is condemning the ISIS suicide attacks in Tehran today, in keeping with their policy of being against ISIS, President Trump’s own statement on the matter appeared less than wholly sympathetic, attributing the attacks to Iran  falling victim to the evil they promote.President Trump has made clear since the campaign that he does not like Iran, and spent much of his recent trip to the Middle East pushing hostility toward Iran, as well as portraying Iran as being to blame for most of the terrorism in the region.That ISIS is the world’s biggest terrorist organization, and that Iran has been heavily supporting both Iraq and Syria in fighting ISIS, doesn’t fit into Trump’s narrative, and the fact that ISIS just launched terrorist attacks in Tehran is particularly unwelcome to the US agenda of trying to spin everything wrong in the Middle East as being Iran’s fault.President Trump’s answer to this, then, is to remind everyone that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, an official designation by the US government which means effectively nothing, and only currently applies to three countries that the US doesn’t like, none of whom has anything to do with ISIS, al-Qaeda, or other major international terrorist groups.Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz
Most of the country condemned Kathy Griffin’s now-infamous photo shoot holding a fake severed head of President Trump.As the Trump family reacted to the photo, it was reported that President Trump’s youngest child—11-year-old Barron—had seen the photo while watching the news and became understandably upset.Not only was Griffin’s photo shoot and full admission of wrongdoing completely unacceptable by anyone’s standards, it was disrespectful to victims of terrorism and their families.CNN has since announced that Kathy Griffin has been fired from her job as a New Year’s Eve announcer for the network alongside Anderson Cooper, who also expressed outrage over the violent photo.With serious reactions to the photo taking place in the United States, opportunists usually crawl out of the woodwork to make a sad attempt at humor.Attacking a child who was understandably disturbed by the gruesome image of his father’s mock beheading is a new low in our society.Regarding which, by the way, President Trump released a statement condemning the act as hatred that has no place in the United States.It seems like reactions to disturbing incidents like the Kathy Griffin photo expose the true nature of individuals and separate those with compassion for humans—regardless of political belief—from truly heinous people.
However, because this term remains so undefined and widely denounced amongst the groups associated with it, many of the ideologies within the so-call "alt-left" contradict from group to group.Most groups refuse to give the term creedance, and after U.S. President Donald Trump used the term in a 2017 press conference, many have stated that it is a meaningless phrase.[2] The partys website reads (translated to English): "A call to all these women and men of our country, who are locally involved in the social movement, trade unionism, the associative fabric, environmental struggles, growth objection, food sovereignty, culture: lets create this together A new left-wing political force, an ecosocialist, which is so much lacking in Switzerland."It reads: "To improve communication between individuals who are dissatisfied with the behaviour and morality common to the mainstream Left and the far-Left.According to the site, the AltLeft politically runs "to the left of Alt-right."In the article, the Post reports that conservative advocacy group One Nation released a statement under the subject line "Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders Lead Alt-Left in Hijacking of Bipartisan Medical Research Bill.""Alt left" is a term quite literally designed to draw equivalence between white supremacists and people who want universal he Trump "Unite The Right Rally" Comments Following the violent Unite The Right Rally that left one person dead and dozens injured, President Donald Trump made a series of statements on the event.Thank you President Trump for your honesty &amp; courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville &amp; condemn the leftist terrorist Trumps use of the term alt-left set off more criticism of the more moderate democrats use of the term.
Opinion Donald Trump’s words hit the headlines again with reports, first in The Washington Post, that he railed Thursday against immigrants from shithole countries, such as Haiti, El Salvador and in Africa, and called for taking more people from Norway, which is nearly 90 percent white.But this isn’t the America that many of us cherish – the nation of immigrants, of the Statue of Liberty.Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, tweeted that the president’s comments are further proof that his Make America Great Again agenda is really a Make America White Again agenda.The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used, the president tweeted.This is beyond the daily drama and craziness coming out of this White House, and is already hurting the nation’s standing around the globe.We all need to stop pretending that there are no consequences when the most powerful person in the world espouses racist views and gives a wink and a nod to the darkest elements in our society, Feinstein said in perhaps her toughest statement yet on Trump.If the president can’t control himself and lead this country with the authority, dignity and leadership it requires, then he shouldn’t be the president.Related stories from Sacramento Bee Trump denies shithole comment but Illinois senator confirms the remarks Trump denies ‘shithole countries’ comment and says Haiti slurs were ‘made up by Dems’ Trump asks why US should accept immigrants from ‘s-hole countries’, sources say Yet the sad truth is that all of this may actually solidify Trump’s support among some in his base – the one-third of Americans who apparently will stand by him no matter what he does or says, no matter how outrageous or unfair or damaging.
Once again, Trump has told his gullible supporters that we are letting people in by the thousands who are not vetted and that we don’t know who they are.If they are approved, they are referred to the State Department to begin the vetting process.More information is collected and they are put through security screenings from the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.protected by reCAPTCHA Privacy - Terms Privacy - Terms If the refugee is Syrian, they must go through another layer of security, which includes further checks by a special part of Homeland Security, the USCIS fraud detection and National Security directors.There, interviews with USCIS officers would take place and fingerprints run through biometric databases of the FBI, Homeland Security and Department of Defense.This is the most vigorous vetting anyone has ever faced to enter the U.S. Donald Trump is trying to instill fear in the gullible supporters that he has.He has lied about his health records, his tax returns, President Obama’s birth certificate, election fraud (31 cases of voter impersonation in over 1 billion votes) and hundreds of other things, and those who choose to believe him either don’t care about his lies or aren’t smart enough to find out the truth for themselves.Danny Duncan Palmetto
But it is the breakthrough of the AfD into the German Parliament that is causing headlines around the world.In elections last September the AfD were elected to representative roles in most of the country’s regional assemblies and beat Merkel’s party into third place in her own constituency.In a media landscape where very few papers can afford any foreign coverage at all, and a social media landscape which blows around slightly sourced stories with a further splash of personal self-aggrandisement, understanding a phenomenon like the AfD is harder than it should be.This obviously suits the incumbents, and is best achieved by depicting any and all parties concerned about immigration – including the mass immigration which people across the political spectrum now say they acknowledge to have been an unrepeatable disaster – as Nazis, fascists and racists.The few people who continue to claim that the public’s concerns are all racist are themselves the ones who now look ridiculous.For if the media and political class call everybody a racist and a Nazi for years, and the public can see that these people often called racists and Nazis (Ukip in Britain, for instance) are – whatever else you might think of them – clearly not Nazis or racists, then you set up another problem down the road.Anyone who has heard a hundred different people being called Nazis who they knew not to be Nazis is unlikely to have their anti-Nazi antennae intact when the accusation is made for the hundred and first time.Instead it is to recognise that the concerns of the public are concerns that should be addressed and remedied by the political mainstream.
She decided to sell it to Noah Muroff and his wife for about $150 on Craigslist.But he knew immediately that he couldn’t keep the money.He called the woman he bought it from.It turned out she hid her inheritance in the desk and couldn’t remember where she put it.She said, ‘You could have kept the money and nobody would have ever known.If God wants us to have $98,0, he’ll make sure to give it to us in some other way.The woman was so grateful, she summed up how she felt in a thank-you card.Please SHARE this story if you’re glad Noah Muroff did the right thing for the woman!
WASHINGTON, DC — As South Florida begins the long process of rebuilding after Hurricane Irma, the Federal Emergency Management Agency added Broward, Martin, Palm Beach &amp; St. Lucie Counties to the list of counties eligible for Individual Assistance.While President Trump’s September 10 Major Disaster Declaration included all 67 Florida counties on the list for Public Assistance, only nine counties were eligible for federal assistance to individuals and households.Video: Time-lapse of Hurricane Irma FEMA’s new declaration comes after the Members of Congress sent a letter to the White House and urged FEMA these counties be included for Individual Assistance.Residents in the above counties are encouraged to see what benefits are applicable to them and apply at
FBI Director James Comey caused a major shakeup in the presidential election with his letter Friday revealing a review of newly-discovered emails related to the FBI previously-closed investigation into Hillary Clintons use of a private server.What we do know is that the FBI believes they are "pertinent" to its investigation into Clintons use of a private server during her tenure as secretary of State.In a speech Friday, Clinton said she is "confident" that the new developments wont change the FBIs recommendation not to prosecute her for improperly handling classified materials.Although Comey could not put a timetable on how long it will take to review the new material, a source tells USA TODAY that is unlikely it will be completed before Election Day.The emails were discovered as part of an investigation into former New York congressman Anthony Weiner, who is suspected of having sexually charged communications with a 15-year-old girl.In his letter to lawmakers, informing them of the latest developments, Comey said he thought it was important to update them "in light of my previous testimony," which said the investigation had been concluded.Lynch objected to Comeys decision to notify Congress that the FBI was reviewing newly discovered email, an official familiar with the matter told USA TODAY.The FBI director weighed the attorney generals advice during a spirited discussion of the matter Thursday and early Friday, but in the end, Comey felt compelled to act.
King, who was attempting to confirm the identities of the men behind the beating, found that one of the men, Alex Michael Ramos, identifies as Latino.A group called the Atlanta Antifascists then tweeted that Ramos was affiliated with the Atlanta chapter of the far-right organization Proud Boys and the far-right militia called the Georgia Security Force.Latinos, both here and in Latin America, do and say plenty of things that promote anti-blackness — and most of the time we don’t even blink an eye when it happens.When it comes to discussing racism, we often subscribe to the black vs. white binary that we often see in the United States.What about last year, when Black Lives Matter was marching in the streets and you heard someone (maybe it was you) say, Latinos need to fight for our causes, like immigration reform, completely ignoring the fact that there are black Latinos?The idea that anti-blackness is only a thing perpetuated by white Americans is what leads a Mexican sports newspaper to make jokes like this one, literally days after a person died in Charlottesville: Meanwhile, in Mexican print media… ?0QWfJc — Laura Martínez® (@miblogestublog) August 17, 2017 Yes, Real Madrid are nicknamed Los Blancos, but the joke is clearly rooted in the idea that white supremacy is a problem over there in the U.S. and not in Mexico, where they released a stamp celebrating a cartoon character that is a racist stereotype.please check your URL or return to homepage Right now would be a good time for us to revisit that and not just stop there, but continue to educate ourselves on how we can make sure we’re not promoting white supremacy.
Donald Trump defended past disparaging remarks about women during Thursday’s GOP debate, saying he doesn’t have time for total political correctness and that oftentimes he’s just kidding.Youve called women you dont like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals, Fox News debate moderator Megyn Kelly told Trump.Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, she added.Trump said those comments were directed at TV personality Rosie O’Donnell, who has publicly feuded with Trump in the past.I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct.Ive been challenged by so many people and I dont frankly have time for total political correctness and to be honest with you this country doesnt have time either, Trump shot back to cheers.Frankly what I say and oftentimes its fun, its kidding, we have a good time, Trump added.
The unearthing of this donation led to protests from gay rights activists and the h igh profile call for a boycott of Firefox by dating site OkCupid.com.Prior to his resignation, Eich told tech site CNET [i]f Mozilla cannot continue to operate according to its principles of inclusiveness, where you can work on the mission no matter what your background or other beliefs, I think we’ll probably fail.In the same interview, he said that he wished for those who were calling for his ouster to know that without getting into my personal beliefs, which I separate from my Mozilla work — when people learned of the donation, they felt pain.This may or may not be the case, but I’d wager that many of them aren’t such dogged defenders of rights when asked about, say, the Second Amendment.The uncomfortable fact for the left is that 2008 was the same election in which minority voters pulled the levers in droves for President Obama.An Associated Press piece about Eich’s resignation asks whether the episode undercuts the well-groomed image of Silicon Valley as a marketplace of ideas and diversity of thought, and whether, in this case, the tech world surrendered to political correctness enforced through a public shaming on social media.The trite knock at the religious right is to be expected from a regular guest on Bill Maher’s show, but Sullivan is right to call the gay rights activists out on their bullying tactics.In a society which encourages the personal destruction of dissenters, any one of us can develop the desire to spend more time with family at any time.
According to Mary Mazzios documentary I Am Jane Doe, there are more than 1.6 million homeless or runaway kids on the streets of America, and up to 15 percent of them have fallen victim to sex-trafficking."I know what its like to be more afraid to go home than you are to get in a car with a stranger," said former trafficking victim Rebecca Bender.After a decade free from the life, Rebecca Bender is about to go back on the streets, posing as a sex worker to expose just how big the problem may be in your town.The judge granted Crime Watch Daily exclusive access inside the courtroom for the proceedings, where ultimately the defense requested a delay.And to all the "johns" out there feeding the illegal sex trade, you can be sure that law enforcement and Crime Watch Daily will not stop until you are in handcuffs.RESOURCES The National Child Traumatic Stress Network has resources for mental health professionals, law enforcement personnel, health care professionals, and survivors on the signs of trafficking and services for human trafficking survivors.Children of the Night is a privately funded non-profit organization established in 1979 and dedicated to rescuing America’s children from the ravages of prostitution.Since recovery from sexual exploitation is a long-term process, GenerateHope provides individualized support to work through past trauma until the women reach the ability to live independently and become a positive influence on their communities and future generations.

That being said, there are some promising new treatments (with some currently still in the investigational stages) targeting cancer, and they could prove valuable to millions of patients in the U.S. and beyond in the future.This technique can zero in on specific areas or heat the whole body, which will break down protein cells within a tumor and cause them to die, notes the source.Hyperthermia Therapy is very exciting because, if it turns out to be a viable treatment, this will destroy the cancerous tumors from the inside out and hinder its ability to infect more healthy cells, adds the source.Cellular Adoptive Immunotherapy Also called adoptive cell transfer, the experimental technique aims to improve the ability of a patient’s natural T-cells (lymphocytes for immunity) to fight cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute.Doctors can take the best and most active T-cells that have invaded a tumor and extract them to multiply in a lab – the patient’s immune cells are then wiped out and the lab-grown cells are re-infused back to them, it adds.The team found that ovarian cancer cells express an abnormal level of TNFR2 that can promote tumor growth – and the source points out other types of cancers, such as colon and kidney cancer, also show unusual TNFR2 production.Tumor Treating Fields This therapy, which the American Brain Tumor Association said was recently approved by the FDA for glioblastoma (an aggressive brain cancer), usually follows surgery and radiation therapy, adds the source.The site notes that almost 300-patients with various forms of cancer in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. have been treated with this therapy, which infects cancer cells and causes them to explode.

This, of course, was in response to that pathetic performance in the wake of the tragedy in Charlottesville, Va., when he suggested moral equivalence between white supremacists and those who protest them.The reference is not to the shellacking he took from pundits or the reprovals of GOP leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan.But you did not expect the Chairman and CEO of Merck to quit the president’s American Manufacturing Council.Members of the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities also resigned en masse.The Washington Post listed the Salvation Army, the American Red Cross, Susan G. Komen and the American Cancer Society among those who have chosen to hold their galas elsewhere.Bob Corker, a respected Republican senator who has heretofore sought to engage with the president, raised sharp questions not just about Trump’s competence, but also his stability, and called for radical changes in the White House.And it was announced that the president would not be attending the Kennedy Center Honors in December, nor host the traditional White House reception for the five honorees after three of them had spoken of boycotting the event.A president uses what Theodore Roosevelt called the bully pulpit — the honor and prestige of his office — to stand for what is right and remind us to do likewise.
Watkins hit the the net with her heartbreaking story about her cousin, 25-year-old Eddie Russell, Jr., who was shot multiple times and killed by police in Peoria, Illinois.The department is investigating the fatal shooting death, however T-Boz and her family are disputing the officer’s account of what happened.T-Boz posted the tweets above with the following caption: My Cousin Was Shot 18 Times Including the Face and Back of His Head!The cops told his mother to call him out on a bullhorn USED her saying WE WILL GIVE HIM THE HELP HE NEEDS and He Came Out Because He Heard His Mother and They used beyond excessive force to gun him down also with heavy artillery used in warfare!They Lied and told family members Eddie Jr was at the hospital to get them away from the house knowing he was dead outside the house where they killed him!They didn’t even wait for the negotiator to arrive or is it that the negotiator took his time getting there?PLEASE HELP HIS MOTHER AND SPREAD HER STORY SO SHE CAN GET THE HELP SHE NEEDS AND JUSTICE FOR HER SON!According to police accounts, Russell, Jr. exited the home in an aggressive manner and the officers stated they believed he was holding the same handgun used in the robbery.
That means no thumbing through the ex-president’s correspondence on the health care fight or first drafts of his State of the Union addresses.All archivists are waiting to see how this will work, because we are all struggling with how to make things available digitally, Peggy Glowacki, a manuscripts librarian at the Richard J. Daley Library at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told the Chicago Tribune.An interesting piece of information to note is evidence surrounding Susan Rice’s role in the ‘unmasking’ probe have been moved to the future library.The documents were moved to the Obama Library and under the Presidential Records Act, Presidential records remain closed to the public for five years after an administration has left office.President of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton said Wednesday on Fox &amp; Friends that President Trump can obtain these records from the Obama Presidential Library because they are federal records.Fox &amp; Friends host Steve Doocy said that the President himself could obtain the records if he were to ask for them.Special Counsel Mueller, if he decides to actually investigate real crimes like the unmasking, the illicit surveillance, the leaking–he could get them if he issued subpoenas.There are options to get these records and they need to be taken because there could be elements of the records in the other agencies, but these are key White House records about what the White House was up to and that to me is as important as anything else.
Illegal aliens, paid Soros protesters, angry Black Lives Matter terrorists inspired by Obama’s race war and Bernie Sanders supporters who have absolutely no idea why they showed up, sent four innocent police officers to the hospital; prevented thousands of innocent Americans from exercising their First Amendment right.Where are all of these concerned citizens (especially the Black Lives Matter terrorists) to protest for a solution for the murder of 117 people in Chicago already this year?Here they warn anyone who opposes his radical ideology: Four police officers were sent to hospital: Violence against police officers is not only acceptable with Bernie Sanders and Black Lives Matter terrorists, its necessary to create chaos and panic: What kind of violent protest would be complete without Barack Obama’s good friend, domestic terrorist Bill Ayers: Actual terrorist Bill Ayers is protesting against trump in Chicago.pic.twitter.com/7dqat4Dvmh It’s probably just a coincidence that on a day that Obama was too busy to attend Nancy Reagan’s funeral, he was able to address a crowd about his hate for Trump only hours before this organized chaos in Chicago: And finally, we’re wondering how much our Organizer In Chief had to do with this Alinsky style chaos in Chicago: Illegal aliens, paid Soros protesters, angry Black Lives Matter terrorists inspired by Obama’s race war and Bernie Sanders supporters who have absolutely no idea why they showed up, sent four innocent police officers to the hospital; prevented thousands of innocent Americans from exercising their First Amendment right.Here they warn anyone who opposes his radical ideology: Four police officers were sent to hospital: Violence against police officers is not only acceptable with Bernie Sanders and Black Lives Matter terrorists, its necessary to create chaos and panic: What kind of violent protest would be complete without Barack Obama’s good friend, domestic terrorist Bill Ayers: Actual terrorist Bill Ayers is protesting against trump in Chicago.pic.twitter.com/7dqat4Dvmh It’s probably just a coincidence that on a day that Obama was too busy to attend Nancy Reagan’s funeral, he was able to address a crowd about his hate for Trump only hours before this organized chaos in Chicago: And finally, we’re wondering how much our Organizer In Chief had to do with this Alinsky style chaos in Chicago: Illegal aliens, paid Soros protesters, angry Black Lives Matter terrorists inspired by Obama’s race war and Bernie Sanders supporters who have absolutely no idea why they showed up, sent four innocent police officers to the hospital; prevented thousands of innocent Americans from exercising their First Amendment right.Here they warn anyone who opposes his radical ideology: Four police officers were sent to hospital: Violence against police officers is not only acceptable with Bernie Sanders and Black Lives Matter terrorists, its necessary to create chaos and panic: What kind of violent protest would be complete without Barack Obama’s good friend, domestic terrorist Bill Ayers: Actual terrorist Bill Ayers is protesting against trump in Chicago.pic.twitter.com/7dqat4Dvmh It’s probably just a coincidence that on a day that Obama was too busy to attend Nancy Reagan’s funeral, he was able to address a crowd about his hate for Trump only hours before this organized chaos in Chicago: And finally, we’re wondering how much our Organizer In Chief had to do with this Alinsky style chaos in Chicago:
Despite the skepticism, postpartum depression in fathers is very real, with estimates that around 10 percent of men report symptoms of depression following the birth of a child, about double the typical rate of depression in males.In an attempt to solve this mystery, my colleagues and I recently tested whether men’s levels of the hormone testosterone are related to their postpartum depression risk during early parenthood.Among animals that engage in the biparental care of offspring – Mongolian gerbils, Djungarian hamsters, California mice and cotton-top tamarins – males show lower testosterone levels following the birth of pups.In one of the largest studies of testosterone and fatherhood, anthropologist Lee Gettler and his colleagues followed over 600 single men in the Philippines for about five years.Given that many men show drops in testosterone over the transition to parenthood, this finding may help explain why the postpartum period is such a high-risk time for depression in men.But after we statistically controlled for the relationship between low testosterone and depression, we saw that higher testosterone put men at greater risk of experiencing problems in the parenting relationship.In terms of resilience to depression and stress, men with average levels of postpartum testosterone seemed to fare best.If new dads (or moms) are experiencing depressed moods after the birth of their infants, they can take some comfort in the fact that these feelings are normal – and may even be rooted in our evolutionary biology.
A voting sign points early voters to the polling station at the Hillsbourgh County Supervisor of Elections office on October 24, 2016 in St. Petersburg, Florida.(Getty) The early voting period in Florida has come to an end, and the final results are now in.In the end, the Democrats were able to come away from early voting with the advantage.This translates into 39.85 percent of the vote going to the Democrats, and 38.49 percent of it going to the Republicans.In 2012, Democrats scored 43 percent of the early vote in Florida, and Republicans scored 40 percent.In the end, Barack Obama won Florida, but it was a tight race, with the president defeating Mitt Romney by a margin of just 0.88 percentage points.In a recent CBS News poll, independent voters favored Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, 47 percent to 34 percent, and another Remington Research survey showed Trump winning among unaffiliated voters 49 percent to 36 percent.Although the number of votes cast by Democrats is down, good news for Hillary Clinton is the fact that Hispanic turnout in Florida is up this year.
