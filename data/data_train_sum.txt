As seen on The Five Police Group Boycotts Ben &amp; Jerrys After Black Lives Matter Endorsement As more women come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Donald Trump, the Republican nominee is lashing out at the mainstream media, which he claims is running with this "total fiction" to distract from Hillary Clintons scandals.At a rally in Greensboro, N.C., Trump said these accusations are part of a conspiracy involving the Clinton campaign and what he called the corrupt media.Greg Gutfeld agreed with much of Trumps assessment on "The Five" today, saying, "The media wants Hillary to win.Theres no doubt about that."Its a Little Too Convenient Gutfeld explained that Trump has actually been "set up," as he was given countless hours of coverage and "billions of dollars of free media," only to have the rug pulled out from under him."The media .[and] Hillary and Obama, they knew elevating Donald Trump - giving him an air of respectability in the press, as well - turned him into the Republican nominee.Watch the co-hosts of "The Five" discuss above, and let us know what you think in the comments.
Once again, Trump has told his gullible supporters that we are letting people in by the thousands who are not vetted and that we don’t know who they are.If they are approved, they are referred to the State Department to begin the vetting process.More information is collected and they are put through security screenings from the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.protected by reCAPTCHA Privacy - Terms Privacy - Terms If the refugee is Syrian, they must go through another layer of security, which includes further checks by a special part of Homeland Security, the USCIS fraud detection and National Security directors.There, interviews with USCIS officers would take place and fingerprints run through biometric databases of the FBI, Homeland Security and Department of Defense.This is the most vigorous vetting anyone has ever faced to enter the U.S. Donald Trump is trying to instill fear in the gullible supporters that he has.He has lied about his health records, his tax returns, President Obama’s birth certificate, election fraud (31 cases of voter impersonation in over 1 billion votes) and hundreds of other things, and those who choose to believe him either don’t care about his lies or aren’t smart enough to find out the truth for themselves.Danny Duncan Palmetto
Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom weighs in on significance behind the FBI reopening the case against Hillary Clinton.The FBI announced Friday afternoon it will reopen its investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server during her tenure as Secretary of State.The decision comes as the FBI said it is reviewing new information related to the original case.These guys that run the FBI now came to the conclusion that they look like absolute fools and that they’ve done a horrible job, they’ve thrown the agents under the bus, they discredited the FBI’s reputation, he told Neil Cavuto.And I can tell the people listening to you, it’s not the FBI agents, believe me.It’s two or three people at the top of the FBI.Kallstrom believes the government agency shouldn’t have started an investigation in the first place if it didn’t meet certain guidelines.I would’ve liked to have seen somebody with the integrity not to just conduct an investigation that doesn’t meet any of the criteria of how the FBI operates, he stated.
Britain has to tell the EU that it wants to go by invoking Article 50 of the EU rulebook for the first time in history.Article 50, which is set out in the Lisbon Treaty, is the legal mechanism for the withdrawal of a member state from the EU.At the end of the two-year period, Britain will be expelled from the EU unless member states unanimously decide to extend the deadline.The Supreme Court has held up a High Court decision that the use Article 50 needs to be agreed by Parliament to the delight of EU voters.But the British Government is under pressure to start the process as soon as possible in order to put an end to the uncertainty that has engulfed Europe.The European Council has said: We now expect the United Kingdom Government to give effect to this decision of the British people as soon as possible, however painful that process may be.The EU referendum result is not legally binding so in theory Parliament could ignore the will of the people by deciding to stay in the EU.Therefore the EU referendum legislation does not force the Government to automatically take Britain out of the EU.
A photo of empty bus seats caused a heated debate on Facebook because people thought they saw six women in burqas.The image was shared to a Norwegian anti-immigration group with the question: What do people think about this?Members sounded off, saying things like: It looks really scary, should be banned.You can never know who is under there.Get them out of our country, those who look like collapsed umbrellas.I thought it would be like this in the year 2050, but it is happening NOW!The user who posted the photo wanted to show people the dangers of jumping to conclusions and spreading fake news.Norways right-wing government recently proposed a law that would ban Muslim women from wearing full face veils in schools.
What if Idaho sends a message to the rest of the country that we value and respect everyone, especially women, minorities, veterans and the disabled — those denigrated and disrespected by the Republican candidate for president.Idahoans stand for fairness, civility, kindness and compassion.Let go of your ties to the Republican Party for this election and vote for Hillary Clinton and for all the other Democratic nominees.It’s time to stand for fairness.Voting along party lines just to vote for the party does not make sense in this election.Vote Democratic.Barbara A.

North Korea must denuclearise the peninsula amid World War 3 scares, Counsellor to the President, Kellyanne Conway has warned.Speaking to Fox News, Donald Trump’s top aide said: Well the President’s position, our position on North Korea has never changed.North Korea news: Trump will continue to apply She said: North Korea must denuclearise the peninsula region and we’re very happy that there seems to be a more unified international effort in this regard, in that pursuit.You see the United Nations resolution on December 22, very recently, you see the previous resolutions unanimously in support of the United States position with respect to North Korea."Mr Trump’s aide added that North Korea is a threat to the entire world, not just the US.She said: This is key because this President has made clear from the beginning and constantly throughout the first year of his presidency that a nuclearised North Korea is not just a danger and a threat to America, and to any freedom and democracy loving people, but to the entire world and the world is responding.North Korea has been fanning fears of World War 3 by refusing to heed calls for denuclearisation – with leader Kim engaging President Trump in an escalating war of words.But Kim appeared to offer an olive branch to neighbouring South Korea – a close US ally – by suggesting North Korea could use the 2018 Winter Olympics to organise diplomatic talks with Seoul to defuse tensions with the international community.

Hill Called Trump a ‘White Supremacist’ After Posting About Kid Rock Hill’s tweet about Trump was posted late on September 11 after she retweeted a The Hill article about musician Kid Rock, who has been teasing a run for Michigan Senator after launching KidRockforSenate.com in July.He loves black people so much that he pandered to racists by using a flag that unquestionably stands for dehumanizing black people, Hill wrote, referring to the singer’s use of the Confederate Battle flag.The comments on Twitter from Jemele Hill regarding the President do not represent the position of ESPN, the statement reads.After the Pulse nightclub shootings in Orlando in June 2016, when a man killed 49 people inside a gay nightclub, Hill wrote, So in a country where we have done everything possible to undermine the LGBTQ community, we are suddenly lecturing Islam on homophobia.You have athletes saying they’re going to the White House, not going to the White House, that’s all sports news, Hill continued.I recently wrote a column saying that there is just as much evidence against Lance Armstrong as there is [against] Barry Bonds, and part of the reason there is this extraordinary benefit of the doubt extended to Lance is because he’s white.I got a ton of mail about that one, even though I posed the racial element in the next-to-last graf of the column.A couple years ago, I was visiting the Poynter Institute, one of the foremost journalism think tanks in the country, and I sat in on a session taught by one of my favorite columnist and people, the Washington Post’s Sally Jenkins.
Warwickshire Police believe the suspect may have been wearing a wig in this picture Linda Gibbs died on 31 August aged 70.Hours after receiving the news, she was called by someone claiming to be from her telephone provider who told her a direct debit payment had failed.She gave them her bank details and PIN number and was told someone would come and collect her card to sort the payment out.A woman arrived at her home in Nuneaton and collected the card, which was then used to buy thousands of pounds worth of jewellery.Warwickshire Police called the criminals heartless Warwickshire Police have released photographs of a woman they want to interview in connection with the investigation, who, they say, may have been wearing a wig at the time the pictures were taken.The extra stress this put on her life in her last days was unbearable.Kevin Knight, of Warwickshire Police, said: "These types of heartless criminals regularly prey on the most vulnerable members of the community and in this case they have targeted someone who had just received the most awful news."You can only imagine the impact this had on the final weeks of Mrs Gibbs life and the anger it continues to cause her family.
If we measured political ability by a person’s capacity to say laughable talking points with a straight face, Susan Rice has to be the politician of the century.Instead of looking in the mirror and considering her ill-advised statements about the cause of terrorism and a deserter’s supposedly meritorious record, this time she blames the backlash on the intersection of race and gender.In reality, she is being attacked because she is a ridiculous partisan hack, whose disconnect from basic facts and ability to repeat the most ridiculous spin and talking points from the Obama administration is as ridiculous as it is stunning.If we measured political ability by a person’s capacity to say laughable talking points with a straight face, Susan Rice has to be the politician of the century.She first made the news when she commented on the 2012 attacks in Libya that killed the US ambassador and 3 other Americans.But in public, Susan Rice went on five Sunday talk shows to claim they attacked in response to a video even though it was plainly obvious to anybody watching that there was more to the attack than a video.Among all of the arguing, Susan Rice admitted to being one of the individuals that unmasked figures in the Trump campaign.She supplies so many howling and guffaw inducing talking points but does it with such sincerity and a straight face that I almost wish she would be in the news every day.
Original report: Web hosting company GoDaddy is booting the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, over an inflammatory post about the woman killed in the deadly car attack on people protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.According to CBS News, GoDaddy announced the move after receiving complaints about an article on the site that made derogatory comments about Charlottesville victim Heather Heyers appearance and views."We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service," GoDaddy tweeted from its verified account.We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service.— GoDaddy (@GoDaddy) August 14, 2017 Hours later, a post appeared on the Daily Stormer claiming that hacking group Anonymous had taken control of the site and would shut it down within 24 hours."THIS SITE IS NOW UNDER THE CONTROL OF ANONYMOUS," the post read."WE HAVE TAKEN THIS SITE IN THE NAME OF HEATHER HEYER A VICTIM OF WHITE SUPREMACIST TERRORISM."Anonymous tweeted that it had "no confirmation" that its hackers were involved and suggested that the Daily Stormer was behind the stunt.
A Muslim man was shocked to have his request for a judge to acknowledge Sharia law denied in court.Ombabis brother, Hasameldin Ibrahim Imbabi, subsequently disputed the ruling on the grounds that the money should be distributed to his family in accordance with Sharia law.One of the specifics of that argument was that the men should receive "twice the share of the female.""[The brother] further asserts that the principles of the private international law should have been applied from the beginning since the law of all parties (the decedent, his widow and decedent[‘s] next of kin) is the Islamic Law and they are all Muslims and follow the specifics of the religion.… [The brother’s] main assertion of error appears to be that the district court should have applied Sudanese Islamic law instead of Minnesota law when distributing the wrongful-death settlement proceeds….[He] also asserts that the district court erred by refusing to honor a legal declaration issued by the Sudanese Family Court in Khartoum regarding distribution of the wrongful-death settlement proceeds under Sudanese Islamic law," court documents stated, the Washington Post reported.The judge, however, denied the mans argument due to lack of legal representation and specious arguments.these people need to get it through their thick skull that the US Constitution which is law of our land and Sharia Law does not and cannot co-exist in our land!"
SANTA MARIA, Calif. - California is now officially a "sanctuary state" after Governor Brown signed controversial State Senate Bill 54 which limits local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities.SB 54, called the California Values Act, was hard fought in the state legislature on its way to the Governors desk over the issue of public safety versus protecting people living in California illegally.SB 54 protects jail inmates from being held in custody until immigration agents can come and pick them up regardless of their immigration status.The California State Sheriffs Association strongly opposed SB 54 saying, among other things, it protects so-called non-violent offenders including gang members, drug dealers and sex offenders from deportation."Today I am very pleased to announce the governor of the great State of California, Governor Jerry Brown, signed Senate Bill 54, the California Values Act", said Democrat Senator Kevin De Leon of Los Angeles who introduced SB 54 earlier this year in response to the Trump Administrations immigration policies, "our President is pursuing biased law enforcement policies based on the principles of white supremacy."In a written statement after signing SB 54 into law Thursday, Governor Brown said the California Values Act "does not prevent or prohibit ICE or the Department of Homeland Security from doing their own work in any way.This protects public safety and ensures that hard working people who contribute to the state are respected."The Trump Administration has been threatening to withhold federal funds from states that declare themselves as sanctuaries.

Mr. Trump said that the United States signed a peace treaty to bring an end to the civil war in Syria.Mr. Trump said we have hundreds of thousands of people pouring into the United States from places like Syria, and we have no idea who they are.Mr. Trump said that growth is down to 1 percent and that taxes in the United States are the highest in the world.Mr. Trump said maybe there is no hacking, in response to Mrs. Clinton’s claim that Russians are engaged in an unprecedented effort to influence the election — on Mr. Trump’s behalf.Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton wants to go to a single-payer plan like the health care system in Canada.Mr. Trump said many people saw bombs all over the apartment of a couple who committed the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. Mrs. Clinton deleted 33,0 emails from her private server even after she got a subpoena from Congress.Mr. Trump said that a Clinton associate pushed the birther notion against Obama in 2008.When Mr. Trump was asked whether he has kissed women or groped women without consent, as he claimed on a recently released video, Mr. Trump said no, he had not.
&gt;&gt; Read about the latest in the investigation here Key developments: 82-year-old Charles Emery, 80-year-old Thomas Emery and 79-year-old Edwin Emery were charged Monday with two counts of possession of depictions of minors engaged in sexual conduct.Police say a family member was cleaning the mens Green Lake home and discovered what she believed to be materials depicting the sexual abuse of a child.Charging papers say authorities including members of the FBIs internet Crimes Against Children Task Force searched the home, finding evidence prosecutors say that each of the men spent the majority of their lives sexually abusing children and exploiting children depicted in child pornography.What the investigation first found On Aug. 19, Seattle child sex crime detectives say they acted on a tip from a relative who arrived to clean out the garage of the brothers.About the brothers Neighbors in the quiet Green Lake neighborhood along Northeast 59th St.Street say they always wondered about the dilapidated house and the three guarded, mysterious Emery brothers who lived there since 1962.The search extended from the home in the Green Lake neighborhood to another home the brothers owned 90 miles away in Shelton.Now detectives are hoping to identify the children in the photos and they hope to find victims who may have been molested decades ago and never came forward.The neighbors say they wish they wouldve noticed some sign earlier, about what was going on in the house but theyre just glad the three brothers arent there to victimize kids any longer.
Trump had just married Melania when the recording was made in 2005 A couple of weeks ago, after the row over Trump "fat-shaming" Alicia Machado, I suggested the Republican candidate lay off our weight.The day after a video tape emerged in which he suggested he could have any woman he wants because hes a star and so could just "grab them by the pussy", Mr Trump is in a whole ocean of hot political water.The role of gender in the debate Surveys (US government and UN) suggest one in five American women are the victim of rape or attempted rape and a staggering 83% of girls suffer sexual harassment at school.Mr Trump is not guilty of either of those but his language is exactly the kind of language that encourages men and boys to feel its okay to abuse women.There is a violence in the phrases "grab em by the pussy" and "you can do anything" that any victim of abuse would recognise and that most women would find sickening.To dismiss the tape as mere "locker room banter" and imply that the people who are offended are making an unnecessary fuss, or to say, as he did in his bizarre overnight apology tape, that this is just a distraction, compounds his problem.Trump has offended many groups of people before But this tape doesnt just offend women, judging from the reaction in the Republican party - it has offended a lot of men too.So on Sunday night, when he debates with Hillary Clinton for the second time, will he raise the issue of Bill Clintons affairs and Hillarys role in discrediting the women involved, or will he keep quiet about sex altogether?

Mr. Trump said a cease-fire agreement between the United States and Russia allowed Russia to control more territory in Syria, because the Russians outplayed the United States.On projections that Mr. Trump’s proposals would raise the national debt, he said that they’re wrong because I’m going to create tremendous jobs.Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump tweeted that the Emmy’s were rigged when he did not win for The Apprentice.Mrs. Clinton said that when her husband, Bill Clinton, was president, the fiscal position of the federal government improved: A $300 billion budget deficit turned into a $200 billion surplus, she said.Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump didn’t even raise the issue of the border wall with the Mexican president, since he choked.When asked about the many women who have come forward to allege they were kissed or groped by Mr. Trump without their consent, Mr. Trump said the stories were largely debunked.Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Trump is willing to spout the Putin line and get help from him in the election.Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton’s support for abortion rights would allow a fetus to be ripped from a woman’s womb in the ninth month of pregnancy, in some cases just a few days before a baby is born.
NEW YORK (KGUN9-TV) - Arizona Congressman Raul Grijalva has been released from police custody following his arrest in New York Tuesday.The Tucson area legislator was part of a group sitting in the street in front of Trump Tower.He was involved in a demonstration protesting President Donald Trumps plans to end DACA; the order from then-President Obama protecting from deportation undocumented people who were brought to the U.S. when they were too young to have decided on their own to come to this country.Grijalva was charged with two counts of disorderly conduct-one for disrupting traffic, one for refusing to disperse.A public information officer for New York Police says the Congressman was fingerprinted and given paperwork instructing him to appear before a judge at a future date.Police arrested ten people in all.Grijalva has been a vocal critic of President Trump and his policies, and a strong advocate for protecting DACA recipients from deportation.
The states are: Alabama Alaska Arkansas Idaho Indiana Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska North Dakota Oklahoma South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah West Virginia Wyoming Then there are two states that usually vote for the Republican candidate but where Hillary Clinton has actually been somewhat close in the polls.Still, it seems likely that these states will stay red as they have been for a long time, but it’s necessary for Trump to defend himself here if he wants to win the election.Those states are: Arizona Georgia If we add these two states to Donald Trump’s column, plus all the traditionally red states, the Republican nominee is now at 190 Electoral College votes.Those battlegrounds are: Florida Iowa Maine’s 2nd Congressional District Nevada New Hampshire North Carolina Ohio All of these states add up to 80 Electoral College votes, meaning that if Trump wins all of the states we have mentioned so far, he hits 270 electors exactly, and he becomes the next president of the United States.Technically Trump can win without it, but the path would become so narrow as a result that it’s almost impossible to imagine Hillary Clinton not winning if she turns Florida blue.Because the aforementioned path is so narrow, the Trump campaign is also looking at a fourth category, states that are leaning towards Hillary Clinton and that traditionally vote blue but that Trump hopes he can turn red.Those blue states, accompanied by the lead Hillary Clinton currently has in the polls according to Real Clear Politics, are: Colorado (Clinton +3) Michigan (Clinton +5) Minnesota (Clinton +6.4) Pennsylvania (Clinton +2.8) Virginia (Clinton +4.3) Wisconsin (Clinton +6.5) To summarize, with each of the battlegrounds (Florida, Iowa, Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Ohio) losing one means Trump must make up for it by winning a combination of blue states (Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin) .If Trump wins all the battlegrounds except for New Hampshire Trump loses, or… Trump wins Colorado, bringing him to 275 Trump wins Michigan, bringing him to 282 Trump wins Minnesota, bringing him to 276 Trump wins Pennsylvania, bringing him to 286 Trump wins Virginia, bringing him to 279 Trump wins Wisconsin, bringing him to 276 If Trump wins all the battlegrounds except for Nevada Trump loses, or… Trump wins Colorado, bringing him to 273 Trump wins Michigan, bringing him to 280 Trump wins Minnesota, bringing him to 274 Trump wins Pennsylvania, bringing him to 284 Trump wins Wisconsin, bringing him to 274 Trump wins Virginia, bringing him to 277 If Trump wins all the battlegrounds except for North Carolina… Trump loses, or… Trump wins Pennsylvania, bringing him to 275 Trump wins Minnesota and Colorado, bringing him to 274 Trump wins Michigan, bringing him to 271 Trump wins Virginia and Colorado, bringing him to 277 Trump wins Virginia and Wisconsin, bringing him to 278 Trump wins Wisconsin and Colorado, bringing him to 274 If Trump wins all the battlegrounds except for Ohio… Trump loses, or… Trump wins Michigan and Colorado, bringing him to 277 Trump wins Minnesota and Colorado, bringing him to 271 Trump wins Pennsylvania, bring him to 272 Trump wins Virginia and Colorado, bringing him to 274 Trump wins Wisconsin and Michigan, bringing him to 278 If Trump wins all the battlegrounds except for Florida… Trump loses, or… Trump wins Colorado, Minnesota and Wisconsin, bringing him to 270 Trump wins Colorado, Michigan and Wisconsin, bringing him to 276 Trump wins Pennsylvania and Virginia, bringing him to 274 If Trump wins all the battlegrounds except for Iowa… Trump loses, or… Trump wins Colorado, bringing him to 273 Trump wins Michigan, bringing him to 280 Trump wins Minnesota, bringing him to 274 Trump wins Pennsylvania, bringing him to 284 Trump wins Virginia, bringing him to 277 Trump wins Wisconsin, bringing him to 274 If Trump wins all the battlegrounds except for Maine’s 2nd Congressional District… Trump loses, or… Trump wins Colorado, bringing him to 278 Trump wins Michigan, bringing him to 285 Trump wins Minnesota, bringing him to 279 Trump wins Pennsylvania, bringing him to 289 Trump wins Virginia, bringing him to 282 Trump wins Wisconsin, bringing him to 279 Read more about Donald Trump and Melania in Spanish at AhoraMismo.com: Join over 240,0 people who get the most important news stories and the best shopping deals from Heavy – Delivered right to your inbox.
As this group has a penchant for sharing out-of-context, misleading, and false information, it wasn’t surprising that at least one of these videos, which purportedly shows violent acts committed by Muslims, had a misleading caption : Although the video is frequently accompanied by the caption Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches, there is no evidence to support this assertion, which in fact came, like so many other unfortunate assumptions, from its comment section.Although the original posting largely focuses on the act of hitting a person on crutches, and it was not shared with any claims about the attacker’s religion, some people on the comment section naturally — and baselessly — assumed that the perpetrator was Muslim.Further, when this months-old video was brought back into the spotlight in November 2017 thanks to a retweet from President Trump, Dumpert.nl posted a short article that mocked Trump for sharing the video: (By the way, fake news!Perpetrator was not a Muslim and not an immigrant, but nice try Trumpie) Geenstijl, the web site that operates Dumpert, also stated that the attacker in the video was not a Muslim: Moreover, the perpetrator was not a Muslim, let alone a migrant, but simply a Dutchman.The official Twitter account of the Public Prosecution Service of North Holland also disputed the claim that the attacker in this video was a Muslim migrant.The attacker, who was born in the Netherlands, was placed in the HALT Program, an alternative settlement for young first time offenders: A video has been shared on twitter in which an argument between two underage boys can be seen.(2/2) The Netherlands Embassy in the United States also took to Twitter to tell to President Trump that facts do matter and that the attacker in the video was not a Muslim migrant: .The perpetrator of the violent act in this video was born and raised in the Netherlands.

Candace Owens is surely the worst nightmare of the hard-Left wing of the Democrat party.For decades, those folks have taken the black vote for granted.Now blacks are waking up, and that could spell doom for Democrats — hence their interest in Latino-Americans, especially illegal immigrants.In the 2-minute video above, hear Candace’s advice and warning for Latinos — namely, don’t be scammed by Democrats the way that America’s blacks have been.She explains clearly how Democrats are eyeing illegal immigrants as the most promising new voting livestock for their Big-Government-Dependency Plantation.Owens’ message isn’t new, but her youth and style makes her among the best to reach America’s young people, no matter what identity group the Democrats assign them to.Thomas Sowell is fantastic, but he cannot reach young people the way Owens can.Via WFP
A Grain of Saul is a weekly column that digs into some of the biggest issues we face as a nation and as an international community in search of reliable data, realistic solutions, and — most importantly — hope.Yesterday, a piece in The New Yorker quoted nearly a dozen on the record firsthand accounts of Weinsteins harassment and sexual assault and included never-before-heard audio recordings from a New York Police Department sting operation in which Weinstein appears to admit to groping model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez.Although Weinstein apologized in a statement for at least some of the behavior referenced in the New York Times article, he denied the sexual assault allegations following the New Yorker pieces release.Perhaps one of the most unfortunate reactions has been to politicize the story, as some conservative pundits have grasped onto Weinstein — a major Democratic donor Michelle Obama once publicly praised as a "wonderful human being" — as illustrative of rotten liberal America.In many of the cases that have made national headlines, though, wealthy men in positions of significant power have leveraged their status to pressure or force women into sexual encounters.Crews said he decided not to retaliate with allegations against the man because he didnt want to be ostracized, noting that "the predator has power and influence."Its time for men to stop being passive observers of the kinds of harassment and overt sexism that are all too common in the spaces we dominate.Its time for men to stand up for the victims we see in our day-to-day lives, and to create spaces, environments, communities, teams, companies and homes where everyone feels safe and supported enough to speak truth to power.
On Thursday morning, after the High Court ruled that the Government cannot use the Royal Prerogative to trigger Article 50, Gina Miller – the woman behind the case – stood outside the Royal Courts of Justice and tried to prove Abraham Lincoln wrong.The High Court ruled that the Government cannot use the Royal Prerogative to trigger Article 50 That it’s a simple matter of democracy and parliamentary sovereignty being re-established and the fact they are all Remainers is irrelevant.Gina Miller said that the case had nothing to do with the EU Which is of course exactly what some – such as Owen Smith, the Labour MP who was beaten out of sight by Jeremy Corbyn this summer – are now saying, arguing that any deal done by the Government should be subject to another referendum.Mr Lammy said that when Parliament decides on Article 50: I will be voting in what I believe to be the interests of the country – which I think all MPs will take on board – and will absolutely not be voting to trigger Article 50.So in parallel they will use their powers to try to ensure we have the worst possible deal so that they can re-argue the referendum debate when the deal is done.We are seeing this already with Hilary Benn, the Remainer chair of the new House of Commons select committee on Brexit, demanding that the Government reveals its negotiation stance – and so hand a huge advantage to Brussels.If it doesn’t – if Remain MPs use their powers to frustrate the will of the people – then they will provoke one of the greatest constitutional crises since the Civil War.Brexit committee chairman Hilary Benn Thu, March 2, 2017 Gina Miller is leading the challenge that has blocked Theresa May triggering Article 50 without the consent of Parliament Gina Miller has won the case to block Theresa May from Article 50 Parliament will be defying the people over the result of a referendum that Parliament itself called.
Members of the Dallas Cowboys organization have been reluctant to protest the national anthem, with head coach Jason Garrett calling the anthem sacred and Dez Bryant saying he wouldn’t protest.Their attitudes mirror what’s coming from the top.Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has made it clear that he opposes national anthem protests.In an interview with FOX Business, Jones said he did not think the place to express opinions is by protesting the flag."I do not think the place to express yourself in society is as we recognize the American flag."– Jerry Jones on National Anthem protests pic.twitter.com/3JkrdMhwWy — FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) September 24, 2017 Jones’ thoughts echo that of many Americans, though as the demonstrations attest, there are many who disagree.Based on his public comments, it would be a surprise to see a display from any Cowboys on Monday night.
Former Dems Now Backing Trump: Our Countrys Going in the Wrong Direction If youve ever seen "Watters World," you know that some American adults are pretty clueless.But what about the youth of the nation?Jesse Watters hit the streets of New York City to see what kids think about Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and the major issues facing the country.What have you heard about Hillary Clinton?What do you think about Donald Trump?"Hes very confident when he speaks.Hes blunt, and I think thats very different than anything weve ever had."Watch the "Watters World" clip above, and let us know what you think in the comments.
In the space of a day, R. Kelly‘s name has catapulted back into the headlines after a shocking exposé alleged that he is leading a secret sex cult and is holding women against their will.Since the story hit the wire, the singer has, via his publicist, denied the claims and alluded to taking legal action.However, it’s quickly becoming clear that the drama isn’t going anywhere.The family of alleged hostage Jocelyn Savage held a press conference claiming that Kelly has brainwashed the 21 year old.So much so that she effectively has Stockholm Syndrome: In a twist, Jocelyn sat down with TMZ to refute the claims of her family, insisting that she has been receiving their messages but has willingly cut off communication with them.She wouldn’t, however, reveal what her current living arrangement is nor which city she resides in: Sigh.Keep it locked on That Grape Juice for the latest.Your thoughts?
For the third debate in a row, Donald Trump expressed doubt that Russia was behind recent hacks of Democratic groups, putting him at odds not just with Hillary Clinton, but with the entire U.S. intelligence community.She has no idea whether it’s Russia, China, or anybody else, Trump said at the final presidential debate held in Las Vegas Wednesday night.Two weeks ago, the U.S. intelligence community announced it is confident that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of e-mails.Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006, Trump said.As a senator, Clinton did vote for a bill to build 700 miles of fencing along parts of the 2,0-mile Southern border, but not a massive wall as Trump has proposed.She’s the one, and Obama, that caused the violence, Trump said.He said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted, Clinton said.On the budget, Clinton claimed that her proposals on infrastructure and education would not add a penny to the debt because she has ways to pay for all of them.
Of the people arrested during the protests, several were wearing masks while others were connected to assaults.The crowd began to diminish around 3:30 p.m., six hours after a march led to the protests.In a statement early Sunday, the group said "we fully intend to move forward with (the Rally Against Hate)" on the campus despite calls by the university police department for people to stay away for safety reasons.The rally was held in response to the planned right-wing protest "No To Marxism in America."However, organizer Amber Cummings canceled the protest on Friday, saying Berkeley officials and left-wing extremists made it impossible to hold the event and she would be the sole attendee.Before the unpermitted events, Berkeley police put into place several rules in response the protests, stating, "To ensure the peaceful expression of free speech, the City of Berkeley will be prohibiting sticks, pipes, poles and anything else that can be used for a riot at Civic Center Park."The group of more than 100 hooded protesters, with shields emblazoned with the words "no hate" and waving a flag identifying themselves as anarchist, broke through police lines, avoiding security checks by officers to take away possible weapons.Then the group blended in with the rest of the crowd.
The left continues to harp on unproven allegations that Donald Trump inappropriately touched women and said dirty words 11 years ago many are wondering where the outrage is about Joe Biden.For years the vice president’s inappropriate touching of women, and the invading of their personal space, has been a punchline seen as harmless.But now that the barrage of claims against Trump has reached its zenith social media has begun asking where the mainstream news sources are on creepy Uncle Joe’s unwanted encroachments.64X3tXH — Trump the Hill (@TrumpTheHill) October 15, 2016 @CNN @andersoncooper @Maddow @MSNBC Where’s the Wall 2 Wall segment on Creepy Uncle Joe Molesting Young ?#HYPOCRITES #NVDebate pic.twitter.0g — Truth Is Power (@truthispower7) October 15, 2016 #OnHillarysTeleprompter would someone tell Joe Biden that touching women and making them uncomfortable makes you unfit for office — Robert Wilson (@rwlawoffice) October 15, 2016 Katie Pavlich – It’s Time For a National Conversation About Joe Biden’s Inappropriate Touching 5XU — Diamond Barbarian (@NoMoreElitists) October 14, 2016 No prof of Trump touching women.Watch Joe Biden Rub, Touch And Kiss His Way To Beck-Like Creepiness – YouTube 4ssgF — R.

On the left, and among Donald Trumps conservative critics, a new debate has emerged: is the media to blame for the businessmans rise, or are Republican primary voters simply "idiots," as New York Magazines Jon Chait argued recently, and unable to recognize a con-artist when they see one?A Hillary win would likely take us to something like the pre-Trump status quo ante, which is one reason why so many D.C. and Wall Street Republicans will wind up supporting her -- theyll still know how to play the game in a second Clinton presidency.The policies hell pursue in office are still something of a mystery, but due to his lack of a real, grounding political philosophy, we can assume that hell embrace positions to both the right- and left-of-center.In effect this would be something like a third party in American politics, and one in control of the White House no less -- a Party of Trump, which will find itself at odds with both stalwart conservatives like Ben Sasse and progressives like Elizabeth Warren.You can argue that the changes that Trump would bring to this country would be disastrous, or that hes morally and intellectually unfit for the office.But the one safe bet we have about a Trump presidency is that it would provoke a realignment in our politics and bring about an end to the elite governing consensus of the last several decades.If you think that Trumps voters dont get whats best for them, then its up to you to sell them on why theyre wrong -- to make the case that free trade leads to cheaper, better goods for everyone, that immigration greatly benefits the economy, that a "Muslim ban" is immoral and would only help groups like ISIS.The consensus among all the poll-watchers and data-heads who have consistently underestimated Trump from the onset is that Hillary is all but certain to win in November.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2017 Im sure this is the part where the Clinton-haters — be they Trumpers, Bernie Bros or anything in between — will say something to the effect of, "Of course he wants her to run again.While Republicans are trying to tar her with a bogus scandal connecting her to Russia (and anyone who believes Clinton did something wrong in the Uranium One deal lacks credibility on all matters political), the reality is that no candidate can be better described as Russias nemesis than Clinton.As the ample connections between the Trump campaign and Russia or its water-carriers like WikiLeaks clearly demonstrate, the one person we know we can trust more than anyone is the candidate who Putin very obviously did not want to see as Americas president.From the moment she emerged on the national stage in 1992 as a distinctly feminist prospective first lady, she has been the target of right-wing wrath woefully out of proportion to anything she has ever said or done.At the very least, the next Democratic presidential candidate needs to be a woman — perhaps not Clinton specifically, but certainly a woman, to offset the symbolic gut-punch of the first female candidate getting cheated by an overt misogynist.As I wrote in September, Clinton is the first defeated presidential candidate to win the popular vote without being automatically considered a frontrunner in the next election.On issues ranging from raising the minimum wage and fighting global warming to scaling back the war on drugs, she would stand exactly where the majority of grassroots activists in the party want her to be.That ability to get things done, by the way, is why Clinton had high approval ratings as secretary of state (usually in the 60s), even proving more popular than President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden in 2011 and 2012.
So argues Sasha Polakow-Suransky, the author of  Go Back to Where You Came From: The Backlash Against Immigration and the Fate of Western Democracy," which examines the explosion of far-right anti-immigration politics in both Europe and the United States.People like Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen are reactionaries, Polakow-Suransky told me on "Salon Talks," but they like to hide behind liberal values like equality and secularism when launching attacks on Muslim immigrants.What these parties are doing, especially in France and Holland, is they’re telling gays, they’re telling feminists, and they’re telling Jews even, ‘We are the only ones who will protect you, he said.The threat all of you face is from Islam and Muslims and we’re the only party that can stand up to that.’ These politicians want voters to believe they’re not neo-Nazis and skinheads, he continued, but in reality, they’re weaponizing secularism to target a specific group.Polakow-Suransky, who is an Open Society Foundations fellow and has held previous positions as an op-ed editor at the New York Times and as a senior editor at Foreign Affairs, says he sees similarity in how our president reacts to a horrible terrorist attack, such as the murders in New York City on Halloween, and other crimes.You see a real gulf between the reactions to any crime perpetrated by an Islamic extremist and crimes committed by white nationalists or other groups, Polakow-Suransky said.Tune into Salons live shows, "Salon Talks" and "Salon Stage," daily at noon ET / 9 a.m. PT and 4 p.m.ET / 1 p.m. PT, streaming live on Salon and on Facebook.
Or, perhaps, it was just a case of not wanting to belabor the obvious: It would hardly seem to advance the discussion to insist that Trump is an oaf, brute, philistine and cad, which is, of course, exactly the shocked — shocked!Or, as the candidate uniquely created and promoted by the media, has he been gamely protected and tolerated through stages of amusement, gratefulness ("It may not be good for America, but its damn good for CBS," said CBS Corp. chief Leslie Moonves earlier in the cycle, no doubt now regretfully), incredulity and alarm, until we reached the horror stage in September with a sudden leveling of the polls, prompting the media to act in righteous concert?The unavoidable awkwardness, of course, is that so many of the details about Trumps particular sort of sleaziness, so many smoking guns, actually have been in the hands of the media all along.Billy Bush, who would become a Today show regular this summer — that is, an employee of the NBC News division of NBCUniversal — was the other party to the tape.Billy Bush Part of the rationale about the videos news value, and for why the media should be so righteous about stomping on Trump now, is the seeming singularity of the vulgarity in Trumps own voice.Another aspect of the media rationale for why now and not before involves the recently enshrined journalistic principle that the testimony of one victim brings out supporting testimony of others — and now theres a growing list of Trump grope victims — quite putting aside the fact that when witnesses have the opportunity to compare accounts, that necessarily lessens reliability.While it is wholly believable that Trump systematically mashed a lot of women, it also is as reasonable that the rudeness and grossness he has made no secret of, only now, in the tailoring of a chorus of accounts (lawyers shaping the language of decade-old memories) inflates to a media consensus of sociopathic if not criminal behavior.Indeed, The New York Times, when it previously pursued the issue of Trumps behavior toward women for an article in May, relying on independent accounts, came up with an entirely different tenor of story — "a complex, at times contradictory portrait of a wealthy, well-known and provocative man and the women around him, one that defies simple categorization."
After Colin Kaepernick rightly chose to kneel during the national anthem before NFL games, many racists and idiots came out with critical response to what was a peaceful, important statement against police brutality and systemic American racism.That’s what Kap’s protest is about.Kap’s protest is strictly against racism, which is what this country was built on.Kap’s protest is decidedly not against the American flag.Here’s a former Marine sayingthat Kap’s protest is nececcesary.Here’s a picture of Laremy Tunsil, a wonderful and beautiful left tackle, kneeling out of solidarity with fellow Americans before Sunday’s game against the New York Jets, which the Dolphins lost, 20-6.Respecting the flag and respecting the anthem before football games are perhaps the dumbest notions floated among sports fans.Laremy Tunsil is a real person with real political beliefs, and his political beliefs include black people shouldn’t be killed by the police with impunity.
Trump is so far off the reservation that he is claiming that Republican Special Counsel Robert Mueller is a Democrat who worked for Obama for eight years.Video: Trump said, But you have a group of investigators that are all Democrats.In some cases, they went to the Hillary Clinton celebration that turned out to be a funeral.In all fairness, Bob Mueller worked for Obama for eight years.The Special Counsel is not a Democrat.Trump is in complete meltdown mode, and he is inventing reasons out of thin air for why he can’t sit down for an interview with the Special Counsel.Facts matter.The fact is that Trump is lying and running away from doing an interview with Mueller.
Former Presidential candidate and current Donald Trump sycophant Mike Huckabee can barely even remember basic facts, like whether or not Trump has ever admitted to committing sexual assault.The things Republicans have to tell themselves and the public in order to continue pushing their agenda take some serious mental gymnastics.For example, she suggested that ESPN analyst Jemele Hill be fired for bullying President Trump on Twitter, despite the fact that the President regularly uses his own Twitter account to shout down opponents and turn his followers against others.Conservatives have loved speaking about disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and his donations to Democratic causes and candidates, and Trump’s favorite morning team and Huckabee decided to tie it back to Hillary Clinton yet again.Host Abby Huntsman started things off by addressing Huckabee: There was also an uncomfortable moment when she talked about President Trump, how he admitted to being sexual assaulter.She was asked about the Weinstein situation and she mentioned how her husband – Bill Clinton – what he did was in the past.Anyone with a halfway functioning brain would of course recall the infamous Access Hollywood tape where Trump bragged about grabbing women by the pussy because he was famous.He then proceeds to turn the discussion back to Bill Clinton, who, if you recall, was President twenty years ago.
Marshall is the DA who pursued charges, even to the point of double jeopardy, against Dwight and Steven Hammond, the eastern Oregon ranchers who preemptively set controlled burns to stop wildfires from encroaching on their property.Of course the anti gun folks were more than happy to feature Amanda Marshall as a guest speaker at a summit presented by Ceasefire Oregon and Oregon Alliance To Prevent Gun Violence.The Oregonian reports: The panel determined there was probable cause to bring ethics charges against Marshall for violating rules dealing with honesty and trustworthiness.The disciplinary board identified two rules Marshall may have violated, one involving criminal conduct that reflects poorly on a lawyer’s honesty and trustworthiness or fitness and the other dealing with conduct involving fraud and dishonesty.Marshall’s lawyer, Allison Martin Rhodes, said Monday that Marshall has always acknowledged that she was not completely truthful when asked by a superior about the relationship.The professional standards agency opened an investigation last year after the U.S. Department of Justice’s inspector general found Marshall had engaged in a yearlong intimate and personal relationship with a subordinate.The inspector general said Marshall, who now practices law in McMinnville, violated sexual harassment laws, lied to investigators and tried to block the investigation.It’s just fitting that someone with ties to the Obama administration and anti-gun organizations is caught up in a series of scandals and lies.
As we previously informed you all, Quantasia claimed that she’d met Usher at his concert and then had a one night stand with him later that night, without him telling her that he allegedly has herpes… Fans Called Accuser’s Bluff It was her details ( and the prior lies she was accused of telling about other celebs) that caused many Usher fans to call her bluff though.Sharpton claimed that after Usher’s concert, she went back to her Days Inn hotel room and Usher called her, then went to Days Inn to sex her up like Color Me Badd (okay she didn’t say the Color Me Badd part, but if the shoe fits…).Anywho, after fans heard her ‘Days Inn’ claim, they were like ‘Chile please…Usher ain’t rollin’ up to a cheap Days Inn hotel room to have sex with you.’ Attorney Lisa Bloom with her accuser, Quantasia Days Inn Employee’s Claims Days later, an alleged Days Inn worker then claimed she saw Usher walk into the hotel to go see Quantasia.The worker also said the only reason she revealed that is because she didn’t like that Usher reportedly said to the press that Quantasia isn’t his type.Usher’s Team Provides Their Proof Fast forward to today and Usher has spoken, through his team, to provide 3 facts that shoot down Quantasia’s claims, according to TMZ.Check out what was reported by Usher’s people below… 1. : Usher and , Grace Miguel Sources close to the singer tell TMZ … he says there was never a hotel hookup with Quantasia Sharpton, telling friends, in November 2014 he was on the verge of getting engaged to Grace Miguel.ACCUSER’S TIMELINE CONFLICT: Usher’s people also say on the night in question his show ran late, which pushed the meet-and-greet well after midnight … and that flies in the face with Quantasia’s timeline in which she claims she hooked up with the singer around 12.-via TMZ Sometimes it’s best to make moves in silence…I wonder if Quantasia Sharpton and her attorney, Lisa Bloom, are now wishing that she did, because this is turning out to be a mess.

Corey Taylor doesn’t like Donald Trump.In fact, that’s probably something of an understatement, the President being dubbed ‘the Cheeto’ throughout America 51.But on the other hand, Corey doesn’t like the two-party system of American politics at all, which he makes abundantly clear at the beginning of his fourth book.One thing The Great Big Mouth loves, however, is his country – the United States Of America.In his typical stream-of-consciousness style, often flailing wildly off-topic, the Slipknot frontman airs his gripes with all the political bullshittery that has gone down on his home turf recently.While his previous books have taken aim at the unending list of humanity’s traits that annoy Corey, this is a takedown of modern-day politics and (of course) the Trump administration from a man who admits he feels no kinship to either big party, but has a wealth of knowledge on American politics and a comical yet vicious tongue to match.Using his band life and turbulent childhood as reference points throughout, Corey shares his liberal views on everything from Black Lives Matter to Reaganomics, with cursing and caps lock firmly in place, forever reminding the reader that he’s an asshole (his words!).And while not everyone will agree with the points made on these pages, this asshole knows his shit.
The Dallas Cowboys made headlines before their Week 3 Monday Night Football game against the Arizona Cardinals when they briefly knelt on the field — alongside owner Jerry Jones — and then stood with arms linked during the national anthem.While some saw the move as a good compromise between protesting during the anthem and respecting the flag, others were surprised and disappointed the Cowboys took a knee at all.TRENDING: MLB Player Goes 7 Straight Games With HR, Sets Franchise Record The Cowboys’ star receiver told the Dallas Morning News that the team will go back to doing what it did before Monday night’s game: We’re going to stand and put our hand over our heart.Trump had suggested last week that he’d like to see NFL owners fire players who protest during the national anthem.Jones said Friday morning on KRLD-FMthat Bryant appeared to be torn before the protest took place in Arizona.As for this week, Bryant said, I’m going to leave all of that in the past.Trump also tweeted that he had spoken with Jones and confirmed that the players will stand for Week 4.Dallas will look to build upon its Week 3 victory over the Cardinals as it hosts the surprising Los Angeles Rams at AT&amp;T Stadium.
Putting aside Trump’s inaccurate assessment of the quality of medical care prisoners receive and the woefully underfunded public defender system in the U.S., Trump is attacking some of the bedrock principles of American justice.The Supreme Court has explained that infliction of such unnecessary suffering is inconsistent with contemporary standards of decency and outlined the basic principle that the public be required to care for the prisoner, who cannot, by reason of the deprivation of his liberty, care for himself.Part of that protection is that no public figure can sue as a result of a bad story without proving malice, meaning that the journalists knew the story was false or demonstrated complete disregard for whether it was true.Without this principle, the press would be too scared to write pieces critical of the powerful, and the First Amendment would be virtually meaningless.His recently announced maternity leave plan includes no coverage for fathers, which shows his lack of concern for the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause; his insistence that women and doctors should be punished for abortion shows that he doesn’t believe in a constitutional right to privacy under the Due Process Clause; he has promised to violate treaties, which are constitutionally recognized sources of law; he doesn’t understand the difference between state and federal authority, the basic principle of federalism which underlies the Constitution; nor does he care about separation of powers, the founding constitutional idea that the president, Congress and the courts have different responsibilities in order to prevent tyranny.In other words, other than his repeated invocation of the Second Amendment, including his not-so-oblique references to one of his supporters shooting Hillary Clinton (something that came up again this weekend), Trump has shown that he disagrees not just with one or two isolated parts of the Constitution – which would be within normal democratic bounds, and is countenanced by the Constitution’s amendment process – but rather with the very fabric of the document.Trump doesn’t appear to accept those principles at all, and instead seems to want to be president of a country with a foreign understanding of government and its relationship to the people.If Trump were elected, he would have to swear the same allegiance to the Constitution that every president has before him: I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
There is a partisan case for voting for Moore, which is simply that Republicans can’t afford to lose a Senate seat over the next three years and Moore’s failings must be ignored or rationalized away for the larger good of the party.For his part, Bannon wants to pick up the ethics of the party of Clinton and transfer them into the GOP.It’s not clear why the globalists would be so fixated on defeating Moore that they’d work behind the scenes to get a bunch of women — and corroborating witnesses — who don’t know each other to lie about Moore having a romantic interest in them when they were teenagers.Bannon shot back, in a truly perverse riff, that Moore has more honor in his pinkie than the entire Romney clan; per Bannon, Moore served in Vietnam and Romney didn’t, and none of Romney’s sons joined the military.Obviously, if going to Vietnam and having kids who served in the military is the sole measure of honor, Trump fails the test, and John McCain passes it.He’d be looking to minimize the damage and shift the blame (the advantage of the specter of an all-powerful establishment is that it can be blamed for anything).Bannon likes to attack everyone else in the party for lacking courage, but in Alabama, he’s afraid to admit he backed a bum candidate and afraid to acknowledge the truth about Moore.If the point is just to support the Trump agenda, safer, more conventional candidates are as reliable, and perhaps more reliable than the likes of Moore, who opposed the Graham-Cassidy health care bill (Rand Paul praises Roy Moore for opposing Obamacare repeal effort is how one headline put it at the time).
Kennedy, who spoke these words prior to Donald Trumps taking office, was speaking in general terms about his hope that Trump would become a great president, seeing optimism in the fact that Trump appeared at the time to be unbound by ideology.In an earlier segment on that night’s show, Lemon and his guests had drawn comparisons between the Trumps and the Kennedys, referencing remarks made by former Microsoft head Bill Gates a day earlier, with Lemon’s asking Kennedy Jr. how he felt about this comparison: We’ve discussed this on this show during the primary season, but Bill Gates has said today that Trump could be a new JFK.Some people look how close the Trump family is and how connected the children are to the family business and any they could be like the Kennedys.Kennedy’s answer, essentially, was not that Donald Trump had already done and achieved things that would fairly rank him as the greatest President in history, but that the comparison of Trump to the Kennedy family could turn out to be fair, because Donald Trump is less bound by ideology than any president probably that we’ve had this century.His statement was one of optimism for the future and was not rooted in anything Donald Trump (who had yet to assume office) had actually done as President: I think Trump, you know, because he doesn’t have obligations, he doesn’t owe anything to anybody, if he’s — I think if he cares about history and he understands that history is his principal audience, that he could be an extraordinary president.[…] He said to Leonardo DiCaprio the other day that he wanted to be the next Teddy Roosevelt and he can easily do that he could — but I think it’s important to start by surrounding yourself with advisers who share that idealism and not people who are just working for the oil industry.Since that exchange, numerous pro-Trump websites have run with Kennedy’s statement that I think [Trump] could be the greatest president in history without offering the any of the context that led to up to it.However, because Kennedy’s words, in full context, were not offered as complimentary of Trump’s actions as a president (which he wasn’t at that point) but as a general hopefulness for the future, we rate this claim as a mixture.
The this past weekend, 27 players from the Jacksonville Jaguars and Baltimore Ravens opted to take a knee during the singing of the US national anthem before a game at Wembley Stadium in London.The defiant stance has become a sign of protest against racial inequality within the US, and more recently, against President Trumps lacklustre response to the Charlottesville white-nationalist rally last month, and the heated aftermath that followed.The defiant stance first made national news following a preseason game in 2016, when Colin Kaepernick sat down (as opposed to the tradition of standing), during the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner".The Pittsburgh Steelers, Oakland Raiders, Washington Redskins and more all protested in one way or another - with the Seattle Seahawks and Tennessee Titans even choosing to remain their locker rooms during the playing of the national anthem.As reported on ABC Action News, a six-year-old boy in Pasco County knelt down during a reading of the pledge of allegiance - an action that his teacher found disrespectful of the country, and disrespectful of the flag.Linda Cobbe of Pasco County schools stated that they follow state law, and that the only way a student can be exempted from reciting the pledge of allegiance is with a written request from the parents, and even then, "they must stand".Cobbe also agreed that a more beneficial approach would have been to pull the boy to the side of the class and discuss the matter, instead of punishing him in front of the other students.Both the boys mom and the school are now hoping that the incident will be something everyone can learn from, as the school "does not want to infringe on anyones rights".
Republicans are starting to talk openly about refusing to fill Antonin Scalia’s Supreme Court seat not only through the end of President Obama’s term but indefinitely.You can see this attitude in the willingness to shut down the government, the threats to default on the national debt and the stated desire to make Obama a failed president.The political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein call it  asymmetric polarization: the two political parties have come to behave quite differently.It would send the message that Republicans believe a president should be able to exercise the Constitutional power to name justices only if that president were Republican.I hope that the wiser heads within the Republican Party prevail after the election.The alternative would mean that Senate control — which remains up in the air, given the tightness of recent polls — will be crucial.If Democrats take the Senate, they would have an obvious fallback plan: eliminating the 60-vote threshold of the filibuster — as a Senate majority can always do — and confirming a justice with 51 votes.What I’m reading: Jeff Shesol, at The New Yorker, has an excellent breakdown of the growing signs of the Republicans’ Supreme Court obstructionism.
Trump said the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with the Kremlin is "phony," "bad for our country," a "witch hunt," and "evil politics."Trump said the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with the Kremlin is phony, bad for our country, a witch hunt, and evil politics.He added the news that Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for the unverified dossier alleging scandalous behavior by Trump has united Republicans.The $12 million figure refers to the amount of money Clinton’s campaign paid to Perkins and Cole, a law firm that then paid Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump.It’s not clear if all $12 million the Clinton campaign paid to the law firm went toward funding the dossier.Trump was also referring to a deal between an American company and a Russian government agency to purchase the company, which controlled about 20 percent of the country’s uranium supply.Clinton’s State Department was one of nine government agencies that signed off on the purchase, and that decision has come under new scrutiny after revelations that the FBI was investigating if Russians were trying to gain influence in the American uranium industry.Later on, Trump added the new focus on the Russia investigation is likely a distraction from the Republican push for tax reform.
Opinion Modal Trigger Voters’ top concerns are the stagnant economy and the threat of terrorism, but you wouldn’t know it from Hillary Clinton’s TV ads or campaign speeches.Too embarrassed to run on her party’s economic record or her failed stint as secretary of state, she’s positioning herself as top cop of the speech police.Her ad uses a voiceover of Trump saying things like she ate like a pig and does she have a fat ass?Some experts blame Hollywood’s glorification of skinny women for at least contributing to the rash of eating disorders and young girls’ body-image struggles.Instead of trying to muzzle Trump and other men, why isn’t Hillary calling out her big supporters in the entertainment industry?Trump can’t catch a break with Clinton, even when he’s trying to do the right thing.Implicit bias — you’re told you have it even if you don’t realize it, no matter how colorblind you try to be, and denying your bias just proves it.There’s no solid data to support it, cautions social scientists Philip Tetlock of UPenn and Gregory Mitchell of the University of Virginia and experts from New York University and the University of Connecticut.
Earlier this week, the co-host of ESPNs SC6 with Michael and Jemele" fired off a series of tweets calling the President a "bigot" and "white supremacist."The network issued a followup statement after her apology and said that Hill has a right to her personal beliefs, but said that they are not reflective of the companys opinions or beliefs.White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is calling for the termination of an ESPN anchor after she called President Donald Trump a white supremacist on Twitter.That is one of the more outrageous comments that anybody could make and certainly is something that is a fireable offense by ESPN, Sanders said on Wednesday.This comes after Jemele Hill, who co-hosts a ESPN show called SC6 with Michael and Jemele," fired off a series of Tweets denouncing Trump and calling his supporters white supremacists.The comments on Twitter from Jemele Hill regarding the president do not represent the position of ESPN, the network said.The comments on Twitter from Jemele Hill regarding the president do not represent the position of ESPN, the network tweeted from its public relation’s department’s account.We have addressed this with Jemele and she recognizes her actions were inappropriate, ESPN added of Hill, a co-host on the 6 p.m. broadcast of the network’s SportsCenter program.
This is how we should regard President Trump’s tweeting and his unbecoming, personal attacks on members of the media.His cabinet, the best since Lincoln, the Keystone pipeline, the impeccable Supreme Court nominee, the gathering of what amounted to the formative meeting of a Middle East NATO to defeat ISIS, the facing up to North Korea and Iran and Russia and China, the withdrawal from the rigged, insufferable Paris Climate Accord, sealing our borders to prohibit illegal entry, especially entry by dreadful thugs and terrorists, and moving aggressively to rid the country of those thugs and illegals like MS-13 and the monster who killed Kate Steinle, whom Obama welcomed, either directly or through insolent benign neglect.We are awestruck at the vision, purpose and energy Trump has brought to the leadership of his country.The Democrats, the Progressives (or do I repeat myself), the Radicals, The Anarchists, the Communists, the university intelligentsia, Black Lives Matter, all amalgamated into a huge mass of vicious, unhinged hatred for Donald Trump.And so we see a level of disgusting personal attack on Mr. Trump such as has never been seen before, including faux-beheadings, calls for his impeachment, calls for his assassination, magazine covers depicting the president’s head with the cross hairs of a rifle at his temple, queries about his sanity, professional assertions of his imbalance, bastardized Shakespearean plays, allegations that he is a modern Hitler, utterly invented stories of misconduct by Trump or his team, based on unidentified sources.I propose you did a disservice to your community and your country when you admonished Rep. McSally to come out and vigorously oppose President Trump and school him in proper conduct (Time for McSally to take a stand, July 5, Page A6).And I propose you were in error when you promised that if she did not follow your advice, she would be punished in 2018 by the voters.And, if she is punished at the 2018 election, it will be for failure to support and defend her president, and the punishment will be at the hands of We The People, who elected Mr. Trump.

In his election campaign, Mr Trump was clear about his desire to build a "great great" wall along the border of the US and Mexico which he believes will bring an end to illegal immigration from South and Central America.Josephine believes people from her native country are victimised because the Mexican government does not do enough for their people and have no authority when it comes to handling crime, especially in relation to drugs.A Mexican caller is excited for Donald Trump to build a wall along the American and Mexican border The Mexican government has turned a blind eye and the war has been lost with the drugs.Tue, December 13, 2016 Donald John Trump is an American businessman and politician who is President-elect of the United States as well as chairman and president of The Trump Organization No, no, no, Josephine replied.Speaking to CBS in his first major interview since being elected Mr Trump said: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably two million – it could be even three million – we are getting them out of the country or we are going to incarcerate.Collins, attempting to understand why the Mexican woman was so pleased about Mr Trump’s election success, said: Was he saying something that lots of people think but are too scared to say?Josephine said: Yes, and another thing is that I love the people that are here that I know, I know many people that are Asians, that are Arabs, good speaking English people, but there are very few.The most people in the area don’t want to mix, and they are very hostile.
As the FS1 Dynamic Duo began discussing the topic, Sharpe went on an incredible eight-minute rant on how NFL owners suddenly got an awakening about President Trump’s comments at an Alabama rally about players who kneel during the national anthem.And then he expressed why he was disappointed and unimpressed: I’m disappointed, Skip and Joy, because this is the tipping point.Of the 7,537 things that President Trump has said in the last 50 years, him calling an NFL player a ‘SOB’ is what brought the NFL, the owners and players together.You see, President Trump has bullied a lot of people … Sharpe then mentioned Trump’s comments on Mexico, attacking a Gold Star family after last year’s Democratic National Convention, and his statements to former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush about women saying, that did not shock the conscience of NFL owners.And then, Skip, he called players that protested the anthem … he called them ‘SOB’s.’ Think about that now, he called them ‘SOB’s.’ That’s what got the owners, that’s what got the players to unite.He also pointed out Colin Kaepernick, who started the kneeling during the national anthem, was forgotten and the NFL owners were uniting against Donald Trump.Sharpe said of all the teams that issued statements this weekend, only the Seattle Seahawks got the reason why they were denouncing the President’s statements.Sharpe said he was very disappointed in him, saying Lewis sat in that chair right there saying that he could never kneel, never not stand for the national anthem citing those who died fighting for the flag and then he went down on both knees.
Videos in newsfeeds depicting the murder of black men by police open automatically without warning on our screens all the time, forcing another wave of trauma for some black folks and other people of color.This film changes the perspective, offering on-the-ground footage of protests, police-academy training and interviews with people involved in both.Why does our society so often discount the stories of black people who face danger from the police?The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has just passed a ruling declaring that it is reasonable for black men to flee police officers, so great is the risk.In this new and vital documentary, Craig Atkinson interrogates what is happening in American police departments and why cops presence on the streets looks more and more like war.Theres no need for commentary in the film when footage from protests in Ferguson, Missouri, immediately following Michael Browns death at the hands of a police officer shows squads of cops in riot gear, holsters on their hips, facing down young black men wearing shirts reading "STOP KILLING US."His visit to a police academy, where officers in training are told that the riskiness of their day jobs guarantees great sex back home, illuminates the objectification, detachment and selfish brutality of American police culture — and why it might be so seductive.Atkinson focuses on the growing resistance to it; we must, too.
President Donald Trump criticized some in the National Football League Friday night at a rally for Alabama Republican Senate candidate Luther Strange, saying team owners should fire players for taking a knee during the national anthem.Trump added that if fans would "leave the stadium" when players kneel in protest during the national anthem, "I guarantee, things will stop."Trump said NFL owners should respond to the players by saying, "Get that son of a b**** off the field right now, hes fired."For a week, (that owner would) be the most popular person in this country.Last year, Colin Kaepernick -- formerly with the San Francisco 49ers, but currently without a team -- drew national attention for refusing to stand during "The Star-Spangled Banner" prior to kickoff."I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color," Kaepernick told NFL Media in August 2016.Following the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white supremacists gathered to protest the removal of a Confederate soldier statue, Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett told CNN he would follow suit."I cant stand for the national anthem," Bennett said.

Rachel Crooks, Samantha Holvey and Jessica Leeds with documentarian Robert Greenwald (Photo: Screen capture) A total of 16 women joined together Monday to address their stories of sexual assault and sexual harassment at the hands of President Donald Trump.She went on to say that it was only through other remarkably similar accounts that she felt empowered to come forward.Lisa Boyne spoke via phone to the press conference, telling her own story of being invited to a dinner party with Trump in the West Village.She said that he wanted the women to rate other women on a 1 to 10 scale.The women were brought to the table one by one and he told them to walk across the table.As a parent I was so deeply deeply offended… because he had a son around the age of my son and what sort of values are we teaching our children when we say that something like rape is ‘locker room talk, she shouted.And that her husband talking about that is ‘boy talk.’ Everybody is normalizing as something that boys and men say in the locker room.That is the talk of horrible people and Trump keeps staying it to the press pool.

Disgraced Hollywood producer and mogul Harvey Weinstein has been under the spotlight as multiple disturbing allegations of him sexually abusing women have come to the publics attention following an article published by the New York Times.The abuse has allegedly been occurring for over three decades, with the earliest case cited being from 1984.TMZ writes that on Wednesday morning Weinsteins daughter Remy called 911 to notify police that her father was "suicidal and depressed."The Daily Mail reportsthat Weinstein attempted to flag down a ride from a random driver following the argument.When the police arrived, Remy reportedly made no mention that her father was suicidal, and said it was a family dispute.Actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette, Heather Graham, Ashley Judd, Asia Argento, and others have come forth with their personal stories of Weinsteins sickening and sexually abusive behavior.In a statement made to People, Chapman wrote, "My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions.Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time."

How Trump’s belittled our allies, demonized immigrants and endangered the environment — the usual mind vomit leftists spew forth on a daily basis.He talked about Russian collusion, which after 11 months and nearly $7 million has yielded no evidence whatsoever, and how Trump is undermining America by deregulating the EPA and repealing Obama’s health care debacle, which is true since Trump is trying to improve both fiascos.The writer then goes on to say that as horrible as Trump is, it could be worse.She would not only have increased the growing malignancy of a liberal ideology that has made a mockery of the presidency, the IRS, the FBI, the DOJ and the media, but we’d have both Clinton serial women abusers and compulsive liars in the White House.On Hillary’s website one can open tabs on ethnic, religious and sexual minorities all related to the nature of diversity, power and oppression, but unlike Trump’s, there’s not one mention of her vision of a true American community.Send your letters to the editor to letters@thetribunenews.comor submit your letter here.We reserve the right to edit letters for length, clarity and taste.All letters and Viewpoints become the property of The Tribune.
On 5 October 2017, the disreputable web site GotNews.com — run by notorious Internet troll Chuck C. Johnson — reported (with no evidence or citations) that the security guard being lauded as a hero for his role in helping to stop the massacre perpetrated by Las Vegas Strip shooter Stephen Paddock was, in fact, an accomplice in the shooting.Stephen Paddock, 64, has been named as the lone gunman by law enforcement in the 1 October 2017 mass shooting, in which he fired on a music festival crowd of 22,0 with a modified automatic weapon from a suite in the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, killing 58 and wounding hundreds.GotNews reported: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives now believes Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock likely had help planning and executing the deadliest mass shooting in US history from none other than the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino security guard who was shot in the leg that night, a senior ATF official told GotNews.The ATF contacted GotNews to notify them the story was inaccurate; the story was then updated with this disclaimer: The ATF has disputed GotNews’ source, saying the information in the article is incorrect, in the following article on a theory regarding the Las Vegas shooting.In another update on 6 October 2017, LVMPD Undersheriff Kevin McMahill reiterated that Campos’s actions were nothing other than heroic: Most of you also now know the name of the Mandalay Bay security guard, who you’ve all named in the media, and I’ll just reaffirm to you that Jesus Campos is a true hero.Why GotNews backtracked in that case to defer to police but not in the case of Campos is unclear but accuracy doesn’t seem to have been the goal — as of 6 October 2017, the GotNews story still says police have not identified the suspect, even though James Alex Fields was not only publicly identified but also charged with the crime the day the story was published.Johnson is also behind the crowdfunding web site WeSearchr, where he has raised funds for supporters of the neo-Nazi web site Daily Stormer and a movement of white supremacists who chartered (then abandoned) a ship in an effort to scuttle the efforts of aid organizations trying to rescue migrants making the deadly Mediterranean Sea crossing between North Africa and Europe.Thank you for your time A fake news web site posing as CNN published an article reiterating the debunked rumor on 11 October 2017: Breaking News – Police Arrest Mandalay Security Guard Jesus Compos As Second Shooter In Las Vegas Massacre CNN) Breaking News – Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Compos has been arrested accused of being an accomplice and second shooter in the Las Vegas massacre that claimed the lives of 59 people and injured more than 500.
A protest sign is tacked to a pole before a speaking engagement by Ben Shapiro on the campus of the University of California Berkeley in Berkeley, Calif., Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017.(AP Edelson) In an article focusing on free speech on the campus, The New York Times tells its readers that the UC Berkeley faculty is divided over whether or not the university should allow right-wing speakers to appear on campus.The upcoming event was scheduled to take place from September 24-27, but as Rick Moran reports in these pages, it was announced today that Berkeley Patriot canceled the event.To confound issues even more, Milo Yiannopoulos announced he would appear and speak anyway at the famous Sproul Plaza, the site of the 1964 Free Speech Movement protest.The highlight at the now suspended conference was to be the "Mario Savio Award, given to the individual who in their eyes has most represented the idea of free speech.When the university moved in October of 1964 to prevent a protestor from speaking, students spontaneously surrounded the police car he had been put in.Now Yiannopoulos is co-opting the once liberal and leftist cause of free speech as his own, and in effect positing that he and his associates are the ones acting in Savio’s spirit.Yet Milos appearance — should he show up — has forced the university authorities to spend one million dollars arranging for security, since they fear the kind of violence that erupted in Charlottesville when Antifa appeared to contest the neo-Nazis and racists who planned a rally there.
U.S. President Donald Trump, left, shakes hands with James Comey in January 2017 | Pool photo by Andrew Images President Donald Trump said Wednesday that former FBI Director James Comey lied and leaked information and ultimately protected Hillary Clinton, while also questioning the credibility of the FBI’s probe into her email.Trump’s early morning tweets come in the wake of news that the bureau’s former director had drafted a statement exonerating Clinton before the investigation was over.Despite Comey having already drafted a statement on the investigation into Clinton’s email practices while at the State Department, the probe would continue on for months.That Comey had drafted a statement exonerating Clinton with months to go before the completion of the investigation has raised concern among Republicans on Capitol Hill, including Senators Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who wrote a letter to current FBI Director Christopher Wray noting that the outcome of an investigation should not be prejudged while FBI agents are still hard at work trying to gather the facts.While the president has complained that Comey was too easy on Clinton, the former secretary of state has made no secret that she believes it was Comey’s late October 2016, announcement that the bureau was examining potentially fresh evidence related to the email investigation that cost her the election.The evidence examined by the bureau came up fruitless, but Clinton has complained that the resurfacing of the scandal so close to Election Day reintroduced doubt into voters’ minds.Trump, who reveled in the bureau’s investigation into Clinton throughout the campaign, fired Comey last May, a move the White House initially said was based on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s assessment of Comey’s handling of the Clinton investigation.Trump later conceded that he had already made his mind up to fire Comey before receiving Rosenstein’s recommendation and that he had made the decision with the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election weighing on his mind.
State Police say an investigation has revealed the information in the viral video not to be accurate.(Photo from ) ( ) -- The Michigan State Police out of Detroit took to Twitter reporting the claims of a viral video about human trafficking in a Metro Detroit suburb are not accurate."It was investigated by law enforcement and not a case of human trafficking.He was right about being vigilant but that’s about it," said the State Police on Twitter.This is the Facebook post where Nick Ahmad claims human trafficking almost happened to his wife and others.The video has been viewed over 650,0 times and shared close to 30,0 times.After an investigation the Michigan State Police took to twitter saying the viral Facebook video is not accurate.
The former secretary of state announced that she will be seeking the nomination for President of the United States on Sunday with a campaign video on her official website.The politician has long been hyped as the Democratic front-runner for the 2016 election.Clinton later served on Obama’s cabinet, working as the secretary of state from the start of his presidency in 2009 through Feb. 1, 2013.When Clinton, 67, left her position in 2013, political watchers took it as a sign that the former first lady was preparing for her own campaign in 2016.Her announcement makes her the first major candidate to seek out the Democratic nomination.Given Clinton’s high profile (and the fact that her candidacy has been speculated about for years), she has become a major target for both other Democratic hopeful nominees and Republicans.While the politician said that she was allowed to use her personal email, critics took issue with the fact that it caused an issue for journalists requesting records through the Freedom of Information Act and Benghazi investigators who have subpoenaed Clinton.Watch These Children Freak Out as Bees Upstage President Obama More on Hillary Clinton: • Hillary Clinton Officially Joins the 2016 Presidential Race • Inside Hillary Clinton’s Decision to Run: ‘We Need to Break Down the Highest, Hardest Glass Ceiling’ • Barack Obama Offers Advice to Hillary Clinton for Her 2016 Run • What Should We Call Bill If Hillary Wins?
Without a hint of irony, Clark said that Kaepernick was the flag bearer for blacks in America and the NFL.But in order to use that analogy, a person would have to actually respect the flag, and this in turn undermines the narrative that liberals and activists are peddling.That they are victims of systemic poverty that leads to crime, and that the root causes and issues that are important to them are not being addressed.The flag was usually close to the commander, and the flag moving forward on the battlefield could communicate an attack when it was too loud for words.It was an honorable tradition to carry the flag, and the enemy often aimed for the flag bearer, which made it the most dangerous spot on the battlefield.The importance of the flag doesn’t seem lost on Ryan Clarke and other analysts when they compare Kaepernick to a flag bearer.But with a black President, Secretary of State, and Supreme Court Justice, it’s tough to argue that racism is worse now than in the past when athletes stood and honored the flag.If Ryan Clarke and other liberal sports analysts want to praise the act of kneeling for the anthem, they should avoid using analogies that underscore the importance of the flag.

It seems that Corey Feldman was telling the truth about those 1993 tapes on which he named names of alleged sexual predators in Hollywood.In October, the former child actor claimed that he once told the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office about all of the alleged sexual predators in Hollywood during an interview related to the investigation of molestation accusations against Michael Jackson.The Sheriff’s Office previously said it didn’t have the records Feldman had referred to.On Wednesday, Fox News reported that it received confirmation from the Santa Barbara County sheriff that they did in fact have the tapes that Feldman was referring to.The publication received confirmation in an emailed statement: Following the recent inquiries into the Sheriff’s Office interview of Mr. Feldman in 1993, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office conducted an additional review for any stored items remaining from the Michael Jackson investigation.In a container which included the original reports from the investigation, the Sheriff’s Office located some detective working copies of audio recordings made during the investigation.Due to the fact that this case involves the alleged sexual abuse of a child, we are unable to comment further and any documentation or evidence related to this case is exempt from release Feldman appeared on Today in October and told — ironically enough — Matt Lauer that he was crowd-sourcing $10 million for a documentary he claims will expose the truth about sex abuse in Hollywood.Michael was innocent … I told them, ‘He was not that guy, Feldman said at the time.
The rally organized by the conservative pro-Trump group known as Patriot Prayer — and a counter protest aimed at standing against hate — were planned for Sunday.Patriot Prayer demonstrators The pro-Trump group "Patriot Prayer" gathered for a rally in Westlake Park that it billed as in support of freedom and free speech.Patriot Prayer’s first speaker stated a message from the organizers; that the incident in Charlottesville was an act of terrorism and should be denounced, and that white supremacists were not welcome at their event.Time-stamped updates as events happened Sunday The latest on the "Freedom Rally" put on by The Patriot Prayer, a conservative group, and the "Solidarity Against Hate" counter-protest in Seattle.(@SeattlePD) August 13, 2017 [3:54] An update from the Seattle Police Department: Police continue to maintain a presence at a separate event at Westlake Park.[1:00] One of two groups that planned to march in downtown Seattle Sunday has said the group will not march, but gather in light of the violence that erupted at a Charlottesville, Va., rally Saturday.Opponents, which include members of the Veterans for Peace, Socialist Party, Washington Federation of State Workers and other groups, had planned to march after the Patriot Prayer group originally announced it would march in Seattle on August 13.The Patriot Prayer group had touted the event as a Freedom Rally; opponents of their messaging say the group is homophobic, racist and bigoted.
The DNC has gone beyond the pale this year in using an anchor baby Karla Ortiz, her illegal mother and a second illegal immigrant, Astrid Silva, to promote illegal immigration at their convention this year.The child puppet of the Clinton machine was brought on stage to share that she is afraid that her mommy and daddy would be forced to leave.The crowd went wild, cheering for this law-breaking family and for the wanton use of a child to promote their open border agenda.Our nation’s diversity is our greatest strength #DemsInPhilly This girl’s speech about the fear of deportation brought people to to tears #DemsInPhilly 5xcNQjM via @fusion — Mike de la Rocha (@mrmikedelarocha) July 26, 2016 #KarlaOrtiz Beautiful speech I literally cried.#inspiring#weareallamericans#america — Francisco Aguilar (@francoj559) July 26, 2016 Mother-daughter duo who could be separated by deportation try to humanize immigration issues at DNC 8o — Annelize Bester (@AnnelizeBester) July 26, 2016 28-year-old illegal immigrant, Astrid Silva, blasted Donald Trump in her speech at the DNC for his promise to separate families: When I was four years old, my mother and I climbed into a raft and we crossed a river to join my dad in America for a better life, Astrid Silva, who hails from Mexico, said in remarks delivered to the 4,0-plus Democratic delegation.My family and I are here because of people like Sen. Harry Reid, she said, highlighting the Senate minority leader’s defense of DREAMers, or young adults who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.Ahead of her convention speech, Silver told Fusion she hoped the invitation to speak demonstrated the stark contrast between the Democratic National Convention and the Republicans’ four-day gathering in Cleveland last week, where undocumented people [were] being called horrible names.Forget law and order and rational thought, let’s just let our feelings do the voting and put the Queen of Law Breaking in the White House.
A wave of liberal rage has marked the last 11 months since the rise and subsequent election of President Donald Trump.Amid this backdrop, The Huffington Post publishes an article calling for the execution of Trump and everyone assisting his agenda.The aggression since Trump’s nomination is difficult to enumerate, but nevertheless, The Daily Caller News Foundation pored over media reports to compile a close but non-exhaustive list of violent acts against conservatives in months following the Republican National Convention.In creating the list, The DCNF reviewed numerous articles detailing attacks and violent threats against conservatives and Trump supporters.While there are examples of anonymous threats, The DCNF chose to include only those that resulted in the cancelling of events and two to members of Congress deemed credible.Senator Paul Rand, who witness the event, has hailed the police officers and credited them for preventing a far worse tragedy.He had previously been charged with assault and battery for punching a woman in the face with a closed fist.All he did was give tax breaks to the rich and put the rest of the country (or at least 13.1 percent) out of work.
President Donald Trump forecasted that Bernie Sanders would run against him in 2020 even if he’s in a wheelchair, and mocked the Vermont senator by imitating a scrunched-up body.Trump expressed that opinion over the summer when he invited four Democratic lawmakers to the White House, and also asked, Who is going to run against me in 2020?At 70 years old, Trump was the oldest president to be inaugurated in the U.S. Trump, now 71, is nearly five years younger than Sanders, who would turn 79 in 2020.P. Bernstein Reuters But Sanders’s wife Jane in June said that the senator was actively advocating for policies benefiting the working class and that his age wasn’t a factor.Ageism is the last ‘ism’ that seems to be acceptable to people, and I never felt that it was whether somebody was too young or too old, she told the New York Times.Bernie Sanders, who lost the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton last year, has started addressing some of his political shortcomings including his lack of foreign policy connections, a sign he may be gearing up for a 2020 bid, POLITICO reported late last month.After Trump in October tweeted he hopes Clinton will run against him, Clinton told BBC Radio 4, No, I’m not going to run again, but that she would continue to speak out against Trump.Shortly after, Senator Rand Paul said Republicans "need to know (if) President Trump (is) running for re-election, and, I think you wont know that until you get into sort of second, third year of his presidency."

The truth is that by voting for Amendment 1, Florida voters have a historic opportunity to advance solar power in the Sunshine State, at the same time ensuring that energy consumers are treated fairly; this includes those who choose solar and those who do not.It constitutionally guarantees individuals and businesses the right to buy or lease solar equipment to produce their own energy; this means consumers will always have the right to generate their own solar electricity, and politicians cannot tamper with that right.Another good point made by Florida TaxWatch is that, for Floridians who want the right to provide their own energy needs, this amendment raises that right to Constitutional status, which strengthens that right, as it cannot be changed by state or local governments without going back to the voters.Something else you should know, since we are seeing political leftists like the League of Women Voters dishing out misinformation to welcoming publishers like The Palm Beach Post (which editorially calls Amendment 1 a fraud), is that this ballot initiative is being supported by a wide list of groups other than utility companies.Many of those opposing Amendment 1 are companies that don’t want you to buy your own solar panels to generate your own electricity because they want you to buy solar electricity from them.Their business model is to lock consumers into 20-year contracts to put their solar equipment on your roof and sell you the electricity from it.Something else these opponents fail to divulge is that they want a subsidy to operate their business model in Florida, a stand-by charge uniformly applied to every electric customer to ensure their model makes economic sense—for them.The Amendment does not block ownership of solar, it does not make solar more expensive, and it certainly does not discourage people from installing solar on their homes.
Rose McGowan, one of 28 actresses and film industry figures who has accused Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, blasted colleagues Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for allegedly remaining silent about the charges for years.Well get there.OK, now that you understand the flavor of the whole thing, enter, the Twitter police.McGowan announced on Wednesday via Instagram that the Twitter powers that be had suspended her account for 12 hours — with the countdown to begin after she deleted the tweets that violate our rules: No word what those rules are, given Twitter is littered with F-bombs and worse on a daily basis, not to mention brutal ad hominem attacks against anyone and everyone.In 1997, then-23-year-old McGowan reportedly reached a $100,0 settlement with Weinstein over what The New York Times described as an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival, Business Insider reported.Oddly, ten years later, McGowan and Weinstein were all smiles as they arrived, arm-in-arm, at the Los Angeles premiere of the film Grindhouse in March 2007: TMZ originally reported that the producer would be getting help in Wickenburg, Arizona.But Thursday morning, it reported that Weinstein is now in the Scottsdale, Arizona, area at a rehabilitation center for treatment of behavioral issues, including sexual addiction.As is often the case, (see: Anthony Weiner, et al.) Weinsteins apologies and subsequent claims of desiring help come only after decades of alleged inappropriate sexual behavior, including alleged rape, after finally being outed.
On 15 October 2015 we published an article with the headline Children forced to cook and clean for migrants.Correction The article was inaccurate in that it claimed that the German children in question had been forced to carry out work for migrants.The Kiel Ministry of Education confirmed that the school had come up with the idea because some migrant children sat in the class.It said that the students themselves thought of the project.
But federal data showing that even at the preschool level black students are nearly four times as likely to be suspended as their white peers is especially shocking.Chief among these mechanisms, according to a new reportfrom Yale University’s Child Study Center, are racial preconceptions that shape the way the teachers view black boys in particular.In the study, the Yale researchers showed teachers a dozen brief video clips of four well-behaved preschool-aged children, two boys, one black and one white, and two girls, one black and one white, working and playing together in a classroom.Though the children were behaving calmly, the teachers were asked to look for signs of behavior that might become problematic.A computer program that tracked the eyes of the teachers as they watched the video showed that both black and white teachers watched the black children, especially the boys, longer when looking for signs of trouble.And when the researchers asked teachers which child had commanded the most attention, 42 percent of them chose the black boy, 34 percent the white boy, 13 percent the white girl and 10 percent the black girl.The Yale study is consistent with previous research suggesting that teachers tend to see acting out by black children as more threatening than similar behavior in white children, and thus deserving of disproportionately harsher punishments.This is counterproductive on a number of counts, but what’s really at stake here is the future of these children, whose early disciplinary problems put them at greater risk later on of falling behind, dropping out and eventually getting caught up in the juvenile justice system.
Disney’s Hollywood Studios is quite often looked at as a ‘half-day park.’ People believe that it doesn’t have much to offer in the form of attractions and entertainment, and so they only spend a few hours in the park dedicated to celebrating film and stage classics.While Hollywood Studios is undergoing a significant amount of changes as they begin to construct both Star Wars Land and Toy Story Land, this doesn’t mean that the park doesn’t have much to offer.Star Wars If you’re a fan of the classic franchise, then you are definitely going to keep going to Hollywood Studios.Guests can ride Star Tours: The Adventure Continues and come face to face with some of the most beloved, and feared, characters of the franchise.If you are a fan of the movie and a fan of musicals, this Broadway style show will have you singing and bopping along to the movie’s most inspiring songs.Another big attraction in the park that I, personally, would consider a form of entertainment is the Frozen sing-a-long in the theatre that once housed the American Idol Experience.One of the more recent additions to the park, and my personal favorite, is Toy Story Midway Mania, which lets you battle your friends and family in five carnival-inspired games inspired by different Toy Story characters.You get to step inside some of the most iconic movie scenes in film history, and you even get to be part of the show as well.
Emails leaked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s private email account Friday by WikiLeaks addressed using executive privilege to keep the emails between Hillary Clinton and President Obama from being released, a 2008 survey testing reaction to then-Sen. Obama’s Muslim father and use of cocaine, and a suggestion from former Michigan Gov.March 2015: Podesta wrote to Cheryl Mills about withholding emails between Clinton and Obama Six days before Hillary Clinton spoke to reporters at the United Nations about her private email server, Podesta wrote to Cheryl Mills, Think we should hold emails to and from potus?In September, Politico reported that the State Department would not release emails exchanged between Clinton and Obama to the public, citing the presidential communications privilege, which is another name for the executive privilege.This means that the emails the two wrote to each other won’t be released until 5 to 12 years after the end of the Obama administration, as dictated by the Presidential Records Act.January 2008: Clinton pollster proposed message testing lines on Obama--including reference to his Muslim father, past cocaine use An email referring to McCain Survey-3 from Greenberg research listed a number of survey questions with negative facts about Clinton’s primary opponent, then-Sen. Obama.Kristi Fuksa, of Greenberg Research, sent the email to Democratic operatives including Podesta, Paul Begala, Tara McGuinness and Susan McCue The statements floated included subjects like his upbringing among Muslims, his father’s Muslim faith, his referring to past cocaine use as a little blow -- here’s the survey: * 1 Obama (owe-BAHM-uh) was the only candidate at a recent event not to cover his heart during the national anthem and he has stopped wearing an American flag pin.* 5 Obama (owe-BAHM-uh) plans to raise taxes by 180 (one hundred and eighty) billion dollars a year to pay for his government-run health care plan * 6 Obama (owe-BAHM-uh) voted repeatedly against emergency funding bills for U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.July 2015: Jennifer Granholm’s suggestion on how to get Clinton out of the bubble The former Michigan governor suggested Clinton could dispense with the idea that she’s out of touch by doing work days, in which she’d pick 8 occupations that she is willing to spend one day working at.
President Trump took a shot at Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday, describing him as "beleaguered" in a tweet about the Russia investigation."After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found, Chuck Schumer just stated that "Democrats should blame ourselves,not Russia," Trump tweeted."So why arent the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes &amp; Russia relations?"Trump disclosed in a New York Times interview on Wednesday that he would not have hired Sessions if he had known that Sessions would recuse himself from the Russia probe."Should have never recused himself and if he was going to recuse himself he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else," Trump said.The presidents comments prompted speculation that Sessions would resign from his post.However, a day after the interview was published, Sessions said he plans on continuing in the role."I’m totally confident that we can continue to run this office in an effective way," Sessions said.
Upon hearing about the establishment of the award in his honor, Muhammad Ali said, I know there will be a great tradition of champions to receive this award in the future."There are certain iconic images that will forever live in our social collective unconscious of activist athletes who risked their lives, not to mention their careers, to uphold their principles and commitment to their country: Jesse Owens receiving his gold medal in the 1936 Berlin Olympics while a German runner-up beside him gave the Nazi salute.But he insisted on standing up for his principles, even though it cost him millions of dollars and resulted in death threats, harsh attacks from the press and public, the loss of his title and the possibility of prison.Since Colin first declined to stand for the national anthem on Aug. 14, 2016, to call attention to the astounding number of unarmed African-Americans killed by police, the citizens have responded with both praise and condemnation, just as they always have whenever anyone exercises their right to free speech on a contentious topic.On Nov. 30, it was reported that a group of about 40 NFL players and league officials had reached an agreement for the league to provide approximately $90 million between now and 2023 for activism endeavors important to African-American communities.Clearly, this is the result of Colin’s one-knee revolution and of the many players and coaches he inspired to join him.It’s especially puzzling when they are accused of disrespecting the national anthem, which contains the lyrics, No refuge could save the hireling and the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave, and was written by a man who referred to blacks as an inferior race of people.Upon hearing about the establishment of the award in his honor, Ali said, I know there will be a great tradition of champions to receive this award in the future, and I look forward to celebrating their spirit and accomplishments.
He upbraided Iran as a corrupt and malignant regime that had taken America and its allies to the cleaners with the nuclear deal—’One of the worst and most one-sided transactions.’ And for good measure, he scoffed at various socialist regimes around the globe.The only term missing in his dyspeptic assessment of the carnage around the world was ‘axis of evil,’ the phrase that George W. Bush made famous when he decried Iran, North Korea and Iraq after the 9/11 attacks.Like Bush, he embraced the tone of moral superiority: ‘If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph.’ When it was not chiliastic, Trump indulged in snark, referring to ‘Rocket Man’ as being on a ‘suicide mission.’ There can be no doubting that the regimes Trump referred to are as nasty as they come.But enmeshing America in an Asian land war would surpass any of the follies that it has experienced in the Middle East.Certainly Trump’s speech fitted with the desire he is now expressing to stage a massive military parade down Pennsylvania Avenue on 4 July to match, or even surpass, the festivities surrounding the Bastille Day parade that left him agog this past July in Paris, where he was the guest of Emmanuel Macron.His bellicosity is discordant, however, with the more isolationist America First doctrines that he brayed about during the presidential campaign.It was notable that during his speech at the UN, Trump veered from claiming, on the one hand, that it was imperative to respect the national sovereignty of individual nations to alleging, on the other, that there is no burking the necessity of taking out regimes that he, and he alone, deems inimical to American interests and values.What about the country that meddled with the 2016 American elections, thereby violating the precious sovereignty Trump dwelled upon?
While Clarke submitted his letter of resignation Thursday afternoon, the letter did not include the details of why he quit and what was next for the sheriff.However, CNN reports that Clarke will join the Trump administration but what exactly he will be doing is still unknown.Trump has pegged him earlier this year for a role, but Clarke withdrew from consideration within a few days of the announcement.According to CNN: It’s unclear what job Clarke will take in the administration, but one of the sources said he’s expected to join the White House.But according to sources, no official offer had been made to him at the time of his announcement and was forced to withdraw from consideration.After the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, many critics spoke about against Trump’s response and his failure to condemn white supremacy.Clarke went on Sean Hannity’s show to defend the President by stating that he doesn’t have a racist bone in his body.Perhaps, Clarke will be joining the Trump team just to do television appearance on Trump’s behalf to combat claims of racism and bigotry.
Truth is, though, social justice is an oxymoron based on the false premise that the cure for injustice is leveling the playing field and redistributing wealth.That’s why you should bolt out of any place of worship that combines Jesus, social justice and the government in the same sentence.In his book, The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism, economist Friedrich Hayek nails what’s really at stake: The aim of socialism is no less than to affect a complete redesigning of our traditional morals, law and language â€’ and on this basis to stamp out the old order and the supposedly inexorable, unjustifiable conditions that prevent the institution of reason, fulfillment, true freedom and justice.They harp about injustice and claim only they can fix it, which is one of the most arrogant, egotistical piles of hogwash you’ll ever hear.As I’ve said before, Democrats’ sacrosanct belief that the government was created to control how fairness is spread around is nothing more than a modern-day effort to reinvent Robin Hood, without all the chivalry and green tights.Those who romantically embrace the concept of social justice believe the misnomer that stealing from some and passing it on to those who should have had it in the first place will result in some sort of righteous leveling.They bring food in one hand and a rifle in the other, knowing if they teach someone how to hunt, they’ll eat for a lifetime.Seizing the opportunity to convert their victims into non-thinking entitlement aficionados, they stop at nothing to meet an immediate need, then lead them by their noses to leftist-run metropolises where crime and government handouts abound.
Facebook Stephen C. Paddock has been identified as the lone shooter in the Las Vegas shooting that occurred at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, as reported by USA Today.Since news of the shooting broke, Paddock’s family has begun to speak out and his brother Eric, from Orlando, Florida, has been talking to the media.Get to know more about the shooter through his brother Eric, the incident itself, and how Eric Paddock views the tragedy.Paddock’s Family Is Worried About Being Attacked Over the Incident Eric Paddock says that his 90-year-old mother, who lives close to him, is struggling to cope with the news and is in shock.Like his brother was reported to be, according to his Facebook page, Eric Paddock is retired, like several of his family members in Florida.The Shooter and His Brother Were Not Very Close Stephen C. Paddock and his brother’s relationship was not strained, but they were not very close.Paddock said that, as much as he knew, his brother had no known health or financial problems at the time of the shooting.This Was the Deadliest Shooting In US History With over 50 people dead and over 400 injured in the shooting, this is reported to be the deadliest shooting in American history.
TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Attackers have mounted simultaneous gun and suicide bomb assaults on Irans parliament building and the tomb of the republics revolutionary founder in Tehran.The attacks were the most audacious State media reported that gunmen stormed the parliament building in Tehran and went on a shooting spree.At the same time, a gun and suicide bomb attack targeted the Ayatollah Khomeini mausoleum on the southern outskirts of the Iranian capital.CNN has not independently verified the number of victims and it was not immediately clear whether the number of dead included the suicide bombers.The attackers were holding a number of hostages inside the highly-fortified parliament building, Press TV reported, as Iranian officials scrambled to establish who was behind the attacks or whether they were coordinated.A picture from semi-official Fars news agency shows a man lowering a young boy from a window of the parliament building onto the street as another man holding a gun watches over them from another window.The man with the gun is reportedly a policeman helping with the evacuation.The location of the mausoleum attack is symbolic, targeting the tomb of the Islamic Republics founder and first supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
(AP Balce Ceneta) Following another dump of his personal emails, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, is claiming that Russian hackers targeted his account to try and influence the presidential election -- and he suggested that those hackers tipped off a Trump advisor.He argued that it’s all circumstantial evidence pointing so some kind of secret understanding between Trump and the highest reaches of the Russian government.Podesta said the theft of 10 years worth of emails from his gmail account is now being investigated as part of the FBI’s larger probe into hacks at the Democratic National Committee (DNC).Russian interference in this election and their apparent attempt to influence it on behalf of Mr. Trump is, I think, of -- should be of utmost concern to all Americans, Podesta told reporters from the Clinton campaign plane.Podesta noted that long-time Trump confidant Roger Stone appeared to have advance notice of the hack, when Stone tweeted back in August: Trust me, it will soon be the Podesta’s time in the barrel.In another, Starbucks CEO and major Clinton donor Howard Schultz called the campaign stale and lacking the transparency that the American people.will need to trust and ultimately elect Clinton.I frankly never thought I’d see the day when we had a major party candidate who would be promoting those kinds of notions, the president said at a Clinton campaign event.He added that he expects the leaks to soon follow the pattern of other Russian-led hacks, where they begin by releasing real documents at first -- and then start releasing fake ones.
This post is the opinion of the the author and does not necessarily represent The Good Men Project.This was alarming and deeply distressing for those who held President Obama as a champion of the environment, of civil rights reforms, and the people.President Obama’s grace and personal skills helped pave the way for a global relationship with the rest of the world.Kim Jong Un is the perfect shadow reflection for Trump who claims to be the great negotiator who’s going to make great deals all over the world.As such, whenever he’s under fire – which is often – he goes on the campaign trail and holds a MAGA rally, where he (in the words of John McCain) fires up the crazies.Unfortunately for him, in the years to come, his name will stand in the shadow of Obama as historians will establish comparisons that will have Trump turning in his gold plated grave.We will recognize that this dark era is the result of a progressive black man and his family coming to power, agitating the shadow of racism and white supremacy in America.Thanks to Donald Trump, we’ll be able to see Barack Obama for the great man that he was, and we’ll build a monument to him upon the failures of Trump and his ilk.
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds.We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; "and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of Gods children will be able to sing with new meaning: My country tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of Gods children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: Free at last!
Dr. Tommy J. Curry, professor of philosophy at Texas A&amp;M University, hopes to fight the perception of the Black boogie man with his new book, The Man-Not: Race, Class, Genre, and the Dilemma of Black Manhood.In On Mimesis and Men, Dr. Curry reveals the justification of enslaving and controlling the Black man and the origin of the Black Beast narrative.In Lost In a Kiss?, Dr. Curry discusses Eldridge Cleaver’s lost manuscript The Book of Lives, Cleaver’s thoughts on the sexualization of Black men in prison, and how the mere existence of Black life provokes an attack by white racists.This ties into the theme of The Man-Not: the specific societal and historic vulnerability of Black men and the white supremacist order, making the Black male disposable.Dr. Curry quotes Frantz Fanon, author of the classic book The Wretched of The Earth on this issue: The Negro is phobogenic, meaning that the Negro triggers a pre-rational fear in the mind of the white.While The Man-Not spends much of its time combating the negative stereotypes that reduce the Black man to a caricature, it also muses about life as a Black child seeing the violence that is directed at him because he is male.In the land rife with anti-Black male sentiment, The Man-Not presents the case for why Black men have not only been historically a target of every type of violent attack and stereotype, but that because of their Black maleness, this eliminates any supposed privilege they would share with white men.Dr. Curry describes a world where even though Black men have the lowest employment, the lowest life expectancy, and the highest percentage of people who are incarcerated in the United States in numbers that far exceed those at the height of South African Apartheid, there is a supposed inherent advantage to being Black and male.
It’s for liberals to get that under their skin because it’s a biological FACT.According to usa politics today: Had state-funded schools, colleges and universities not complied with the directive, it could put public institutions at risk of losing federal funding.In his ruling, O’Connor said Title IX is not ambiguous about sex being defined as the biological and anatomical differences between male and female students as determined at their birth.Trump is going to bring back family values and Christian values to America again!It’s time this country to become conservative and normal again!We should stop with the promotion of liberal sick values, all that sick attitude, we have to be normal and sane and good people again!No more transgender, gay, abortions, drugs, crimes, illegals etc… We have to have law and order, strong police, strong border, strong military, strong churches, more freedom, less socialism, less communism, less utopia, lower taxes, less regulation!That is the Trump rule, that is the Trump philosophy, and we voted for that!

When I was fourteen or sixteen – pardon me, but I don’t remember precisely, nor did these things make any impression in the international mainstream media – mom and I went to what was probably an illegal demonstration in downtown Porto, Portugal.What I remember of that demonstration — one in a string of them — were the shots from above.If my memory serves me (and understand that after these many years things run together, but be patient, there’s a point to this), the demonstration was in Avenida dos Aliados, which despite the name is a plaza, hemmed in between tallish, twentieth century stone buildings.The shots came from either the upper windows or the roof of one of these buildings.As someone in the crowd, I remember people startled, starting to move, eddies in the packed multitude, and then someone ahead of us going down, bloodied.I don’t know how I ended up running near a wall (we were pretty much in the center of the space) but I remember the moment a hand shot out, grabbed me, and pressed me flat against the wall.The person who grabbed me was my mom, and for the next few minutes, we resisted the crowd going by so close they might pull us with them.Facebook and probably all the news media — I’m working on a book and at any rate have no intention of subjecting my blood pressure to that kind of hammering — are full of experts and observers and commenters talking about how this wouldn’t have happened if we had only banned private gun ownership.
Mining is one of the most destructive forces currently on the face of the planet.Recently, in the US, the toxic consequences of gold mining were on full display when the Environmental Protection Agency’s incompetence in cleaning out an abandoned gold mine turned the Animas river orange after heavy metal-laden mining waste drained into the river.The camouflaged drones Credit – Rick Stevens Now that gold mining is not as common as it once was in the US, many other countries have been exploited by gold mining firms in its absence.Rick Steven, a mine surveyor in the region, said that he had lost nine of his Trimble UX5 drones to eagles, which he labeled the natural enemy of drones.This isn’t the first case of animals fighting back against the degradation of the environment in recent months.Less than a month ago, a herd of wild buffalo appeared out of nowhere in a seeming show of support to the Native Americans and their allies protesting the Dakota Access pipeline.The buffalo, who are considered sacred by the Sioux tribe, appeared by the thousands in a stampede that interrupted a confrontation between protestors and police.Hopefully, these acts of defiance from the natural world will inspire people to follow their lead in taking a stand against the corporations destroying the planet.
Or that the victim just happened to be days away from graduating from Bowie State University and had recently been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army and was preparing to move to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, for training in defending the country against chemical attacks.What is important here, since it seems to be the only thing that is ever important in these situations, is that the victim - Richard Collins I, 23 - was Black.His murderer, Christopher Urbanski, 22, who saw fit to plunge a knife into Collinss chest for reasons no one apparently knows but the FBI is investigating as a "possible" (possible!)As a matter of fact, Urbanski, who was charged with assault and first- and second-degree murder and is being held without bail, is a member of the white supremacist Facebook group Alt-Reich: Nation, according to NBC 4 Washington.After Collins died, a civilian employee of the Anne Arundel County Police Department in Maryland took to social media to praise the act.To which Burgone replied with a meme that he apparently found funny, even though it objectively isnt funny under ANY circumstances, and certainly not when it refers to the slaying of a fellow human being.Save Thankfully, because sometimes the world isnt a completely awful place, the Anne Arundel Police Department also didnt find it funny and immediately suspended Burgone, issuing the following statement: "The actions of this employee are a betrayal of the values of the Anne Arundel County Police Department.This person is, however, still alive and freely roaming the streets being a good ol Murican and contributing to the "dialogue" on his possible pro-hate crime radical extremist white supremacist group, and will go on to find employment elsewhere and ban together with like-minded fragile white men and possibly even reproduce and indoctrinate his progeny into his viciously racist ideology, all the while hiding behind his God and guns, so, awesome.
Shortly before the Democratic National Convention, the activist released incriminating email showing that the DNC had worked against Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in favor of a Clinton nomination.Though that did much to shake up supporters of the American political system and infuriate supporters of Sanders, the Vermont Senator pledged his support to Clinton nonetheless.Rigged or not (and it’s most definitely rigged), is this truly the reason Bernie Sanders gave up the good fight?Pilger, who is working on a documentary about Assange, asked: Julian, we cut you off earlier when you were talking about what you felt were the most significant emails that you have released.And Bernie Sanders was independent candidate trying to get the nomination trough the Democratic Party and if you ask me he did get the nomination, but he was threatened to drop out.The Clinton campaign knows he’s on to her, too, which is why a strategist called for an assassination of Assange on TV.Of course, we’re very interested in revealing the truth about any candidate and yes we have some material about Bernie Sanders that will be published, Assange added.This article ( Julian Assange: This Is The REAL Reason Bernie Sanders Dropped Out Of The Race) is free and open source.
Michael Douglas of The Reach on the red carpet at the Princess of Wales Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto on Saturday September 6, 2014.Michael Network Michael Douglas has jumped ahead of allegations he masturbated in front of a former employee, insisting he’s not about to sit back and become the villain of a harassment story.The Basic Instinct star claims staff at both The Hollywood Reporter and Variety have reached out for feedback concerning accusations he pleasured himself in front of an employee three decades ago, and he’s keen to get ahead of the story, before he joins the likes of Harvey Weinstein, Louis C.K., Jeremy Piven, and Brett Ratner, among others, who have been accused of sexual misconduct.Douglas has turned to movie news website Deadline to set the story straight, stating, I felt the need to get ahead of this.Revealing that The Hollywood Reporter contacted him via his attorney regarding the woman’s claims that he used colourful language in front of her, spoke raunchily, or dirtily with friends of mine in private conversations on the phone.The woman’s third claim was that the actor masturbated in front of her, to which Douglas responds, I remembered this woman: sophisticated intelligent, good sense of humour, a novelist, who has written books and published novels and was an active feminist, and proud of it.According to the actor, the journalist at The Hollywood Reporter agreed to sit on the story over the holidays, but in the New Year the publication got back in touch and said, ‘She’s (accuser) running around, possibly trying to give this story to other people, so we’re going to run with it’.She supposedly had three friends who would back her up, that she had mentioned this to… How am I, in a 50 year career in this industry, dealing with an employee 33 years ago who perhaps is disgruntled that I let her go, even though I have never heard from her in 32 years.
President Trump on Thursday said it would be a "very sad day" for North Korea if the U.S. military needed to use force against it.President Trump on Thursday praised Kuwait for its contributions to defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and other terrorist groups."The United States is proud to have contributed to the liberation of Kuwait and the friendship we have built together in the years since," he said, referencing the First Gulf War from 1990 to 1991."We also thank Kuwait for its humanitarian leadership and its partnership in the fight to destroy ISIS," Trump added in a joint press conference with Kuwaiti leader Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah.President Trump and Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, the leader of Kuwait, on Thursday are appearing together in a joint press conference after meeting in Washington, D.C.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Saturday the second flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile demonstrated his country can hit the U.S.The Korean Central News Agency said Kim expressed "great satisfaction" with the test.The Pentagon confirmed Friday morning that North Korea launched another ballistic missile.Japanese government spokesperson Yoshihide Suga said the missile flew for roughly 45 minutes and landed off the Japanese coast in waters near Japan and the Korean Peninsula.Japanese public broadcaster NHK said the coast guard has issued safety warnings to aircraft and ships.The launch occurred one day after Congress approved a legislative package that includes economic sanctions against North Korea.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the projectile may have landed in the sea.We will immediately analyze information and do our utmost to protect the safety of the Japanese people.

Miss America Organization Chairman and CEO Sam Haskell speaks to the media during a press conference in 2014.(AP Press of Atlantic City, Edward Lea) (Newser) – Miss America chairman and CEO Sam Haskell resigned Saturday—just a day after saying he wouldnt, the New York Daily News reports.The resignations of Miss America leadership come after HuffPo published internal emails Thursday that feature Haskell calling a former Miss America winner "fat and gross" and joking that hes one of very few people who havent had sex with her, according to USA Today.On Friday, Haskell was suspended pending an investigation as 49 former Miss America winners signed a petition calling on pageant leadership to resign.Haskell remained adamant that he wouldnt resign over what he said were false accusations and a "mistake of words."In a statement, the Miss America Organization says Haskells resignation will take effect immediately.Randle and Weidner will stay on for the coming weeks to "facilitate a smooth transition.""The board thanks Lynn and Sam for many years of tireless work for, and significant financial support to, both the Miss America Organization and thousands of young women," the statement reads.
by Walter W. Murray, reporter The easily triggered college students of the left won’t let facts stand in the way of their false outrage.In a hilarious video that’s going viral, students at the University of California, Santa Barbara were hopping mad over President Donald Trump’s plan to send troops to the U.S.-Mexico border just 200 miles away… not knowing they were trashing former President Barack Obama, too.Take a look here — Americans In The Dark On Trumps Plan To End The U.S. Dollar Just one problem: The very act they’re livid over — the actions they blame on Trump — are the same exact moves made by former President Barack Obama, the hero of the young leftists.Scientists discover blood pressure-improving effects of 3 common foods In 2010, Obama sent up to 1,200 troops to the border as part of the $110 million Operation Phalanx.They couldn’t approve the move because Trump did it — but they couldn’t condemn it anymore, either, since their hero did the same thing.They’re taught in the classroom, they’re taught by society and the media, it must be horrible, it must be racist.Your funding for new staffing will allow the Guard to do what it does best: support operations targeting transnational criminal gangs, human traffickers and illegal firearm and drug smugglers along the border, the coast and throughout the state, Brown admitted in the letter to Trump.For your eyes only (personal matter) [sponsored] Quote that letter to the left – tell them Trump said it – and you can bet they would take to the streets.
Executive Dow Constantine issued this statement as the demonstration was underway Sunday afternoon: To the white supremacists and fascists who gathered today at Westlake Center under the false pretense of patriotism the day after the violence that a similar group sparked in Charlottesville, I have a message to share on behalf of the people of King County.But the event page listed a variety of items the group claimed it was worried about – including sexual allegations against the Seattle mayor and what the group called communist ideologies.Leader Joey Gibson started the rally with the Pledge of Allegiance and a prayer asking for peace on the West Coast.Speakers in the rally called the Charlottesville incident an act of terrorism, said that white supremacists were not welcome at their event, and asked anyone who attended for racist reasons to leave.Gibson, who hosted a Patriot Prayer event earlier in the summer at The Evergreen State College, spoke to KIRO Radio on Monday and further spoke on his groups message.Demonstrations respond nationwide in wake of Charlottesville Seattle was just one of the cities in the United States on Sunday that had protesters decrying hate and racism.In Charlottesville over the weekend, neo-Nazis, skinheads, Ku Klux Klan members and other white nationalists gathered to "take America back" and oppose plans to remove a Confederate statue in the Virginia college town, and hundreds of other people came to protest the rally.Some of the people protesting Sunday also point to the president and his campaign, saying they gave license to racist hatred that built into what happened in Charlottesville.
With FBI Director James Comey announcing the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email scandal would be reopened, Former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft weighs in on the backlash as well as the political fallout as Election Day quickly approaches.Ashcroft then brought up claims that the Department of Justice blocked the FBI from using many of the investigative tools available to it in its investigation of the Clinton Foundation.There’s been a pervasive perversion of the Justice Department process over and over again and recent reports like in The Wall Street Journal that suggest that, not only suggest, allege that the Justice Department has denied investigative tools to be used in investigations related to the Clinton Foundation and frankly, the absence of the use of tools that should have been used in the initial investigation of Hillary Clinton.As a result, Ashcroft explained, The Justice Department sent the FBI in to investigate the Clinton Foundation with its hands tied behind its back.The fact that the investigation is being reopened now, so close to the election, was not a surprise to Ashcroft, but the result of stonewalling by Hillary Clinton and her staffers.This isn’t an October surprise in my judgment, this is the continuity of an issue which had been stonewalled, for which information had been requested which was not fully given and there was an erroneous statement earlier, much to the acclaim of the people who did the stonewalling, that the investigation was over.According to Ashcroft, it is unfair for the Clinton campaign to blame the FBI for the timing of the announcement when the campaign’s stonewalling is ultimately at fault due to its lack of transparency and delays in providing information requested.There’s a sense in which it’s a little disingenuous to be complaining about information coming out late when you are the cause of the information coming out late because of a significant stonewalling effort that’s been unfortunately facilitated by the way in which the Attorney General and others have allowed this particular investigation to be conducted.

The assailant opened fire with a fully automatic weapon just as Jason Aldean was beginning his show at the Route 91 Harvest Festival.Videos posted on social media show Aldean, one of the biggest names in the genre, singing as very rapid gunfire begins in the background.He can be seen running from stage as he, and the thousands in the crowd who came to see him, realized the horror of what was happening.Many were trapped in the venue for what must have felt like an eternity, but police SWAT officers eventually found and killed the shooter.He was found on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Casino, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said, and shot dead.Aldean said he was safe in an Instagram post early Monday, sharing an image of the city and asking for prayers for the victims: Tonight has been beyond horrific.Country star Jake Owen was one of the witnesses, having just finished his set and was still on stage when the shooting started.He was not known to hold extremist political or religious beliefs, though the investigation into the matter is just hours old.

Jerry Brown, to build two giant water tunnels to re-engineer the states water system, according to the audit by the inspector generals office of the U.S.By California law and by an agreement by the water districts, California water districts and not federal taxpayers are supposed to bear the costs of the $16 billion project, the audit said.The inspector general says federal authorities did not fully disclose to Congress or others that it was covering much of the cost of the projects planning.The actions by the Bureau of Reclamation, which is part of the Interior Department, mean that federal taxpayers paid a third of the cost of the projects planning up to 2016, the audit said.Thomas Birmingham, general manager of the sprawling Central Valley rural water district Westlands, which received one of the largest shares from the government, said he knew of nothing about the arrangement that was "inconsistent with either state or federal law.""No one indicated this was somehow a violation of the letter or spirit of the agreement" guiding the costs of the project.The audits findings were "appalling," said Doug Obegi of the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group, which has opposed the project on the grounds that it would speed up the extinction of several endangered native species."I wish I were surprised to learn that the Westlands Water District colluded with the Interior Department to hide millions of dollars in unauthorized payments from Congress, but this is typical of the longstanding and incestuous relationship between the largest irrigation district in the country and its federal patrons," said U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, a California Democrat.
Barack and Michelle Obama are speaking out about the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal after their daughter, Malia, interned for his company.Barack Obama, 56, and wife Michelle Obama, 53, finally released an official statement on Oct. 10, about the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment accusations and it’s not pretty, according to media outlets such as TMZ.Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein, the statement reads.The former U.S. president and first lady’s daughter Malia Obama, 19, interned at Harvey’s company, The Weinstein Company, before attending Harvard University and Harvey even donated $680, 0 for Barack’s 2012 re-election campaign.And we all need to build a culture – including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect – so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future.Barack and Michelle’s statement comes just hours after a video message from the Republican National Committee, first reported by Daily Mail, condemned him for his silence in the case.The film producer continues to make headlines from the unfortunate situation with the most recent one involving an announcement that his wife, Georgina Chapman, 41, is leaving him.It’s been five days since the first allegations surfaced and since then, more and more women are coming forward with their own shocking stories.

The FBI has discovered a batch of new emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, according to a letter FBI Director James Comey sent to the chairs of pertinent Congressional and Senate committees Friday.Clinton’s campaign said it had no advance knowledge of Comey’s letter, and the campaign staff found out about it only after the news had broken Friday afternoon, while Clinton was on a two-hour,15-minute flight traveling with staff and with reporters to Cedar Rapids, all of whom had little or no Wi-Fi access for most of the duration of the flight Reporters shouted questions to Clinton as she walked from the plane in Cedar Rapids to the car that took her to her rally.FBI Dir just informed me, "The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation."Case reopened— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 Pegues confirmed Friday that the new batch of emails was discovered during the investigation into the August sexting scandal of Anthony Weiner, the husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, after the agency seized electronic devices belonging to the couple.Following the release of the FBI letter, House Speaker Paul Ryan reiterated his call for the Director of National Intelligence to stop giving classified briefings to Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee.If so, Toner said the State Department is ready to cooperate with the FBI, but as of Friday afternoon, the department had not been contacted by the agency.Trump also commended the FBI for now being willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made in announcing its investigation was complete.Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, Podesta said.

In June 2008, when she conceded the Democratic presidential race to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton famously noted that "we werent able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time."More than eight years later, she will literally be standing underneath one as the final votes are counted on Nov. 8.On Wednesday, the Clinton campaign announced her election night party would be held at the Jacob K.

To the extent that Trumps words are interpreted as a genuine expression of the policy and plans of the United States government, the inescapable conclusion is that the world stands on the brink of the most devastating military conflict since the outbreak of World War II.With only minutes to make a decision, will the regime view the approach of a US bomber toward North Korean airspace as the beginning of a full-scale attack?In a comment in the Los Angeles Times last month, retired Air Force Brigadier General Rob Givens calculated that 20,0 South Koreans would die every day in a war on the peninsula, even without the use of nuclear weapons.Writing as if what was involved was merely a matter of White House gossip and intrigue, the Times stated that the "timing" of the "calm before the storm" statement was "particularly tantalizing."The efforts of the media to downplay the danger are contradicted by signs of serious divisions within the Trump administration.Rather than speculating idly over whether Trump is merely bluffing, the critical task is the building of a powerful movement, based on the working class, against the drive to war.To the extent that Trumps words are interpreted as a genuine expression of the policy and plans of the United States government, the inescapable conclusion is that the world stands on the brink of the most devastating military conflict since the outbreak of World War II.With only minutes to make a decision, will the regime view the approach of a US bomber toward North Korean airspace as the beginning of a full-scale attack?
On 31 August 2017, repeat offender TheLastLineOfDefense.com published a  report on the Ramashan Mosque in Houston, which according to them, refused to help people seeking relief from the flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey: The building can easily hold over 500 people, much more than the 27 currently inside.But the imam of the mosque, Aswat Turads, says that they absolutely cannot accept any non-Muslim people because it’s against their religion.The original version of the story (and an equally fake follow-up post) also included a picture of Canadian imam Ibrahim Hindy, who publicly refuted the story, saying that not only was he in Saudi Arabia completing the hajj Islamic pilgrimage at the time the massive storm hit Texas, he has never been to that state in his life at all: The site quickly swapped out its photographs in response.The current version of the story now includes an Associated Press picture of a Lebanese cleric, Ahmad al-Assir, who was arrested by authorities in his country in August 2015.The radio station named in the article, WXTX-FM, is actually based out of Columbus, Georgia and not Texas.Despite its complete lack of any factual content, the hoax story was shared thousands of times; it was also picked up and run verbatim as true by other web sites.In reality, several Houston mosques have taken people in and performed volunteer food and donation drives to help victims of the storm.Snopes.com has long been engaged in the battle against misinformation, an effort we could not sustain without the support of our readers.
And that is what many publishers - from The New Yorker, to The Wall Street Journal, to Marie Claire (and Business Insider) - have been doing for certain articles, with more frequency since the algorithm change.When you follow the link to the publishers website, the article isnt a piece of "sponsored content," even though the Facebook post is labeled "sponsored."But thats only the start of the rabbit hole when it comes to the blurring of the lines between advertising and editorial content on Facebook.Here is what that looks like from The New Yorker on an editorial article titled " The Great Sadness of Ben Affleck": Nathan And heres one from The Wall Street Journal on an editorial article titled " Silicon Valley to Washington: Why Dont You Get Us": Nathan Just scrolling through my Facebook feed casually, I noticed many such articles from outlets ranging from those above to Marie Claire (as mentioned), Ranker, Screen Rant, Elite Daily, U.S. News and World Report, and so on.But the main point is that the underlying video, and in this case even the underlying original Facebook post, isnt an ad - but the subject of the video is paying for a "sponsored" Facebook post to promote it.Sometimes these "sponsored" posts are even geo-targeted, like the one on this article from The New Yoker titled " Divinity on the Dance Floor," which is being "promoted" not even by its subject (DJ Robert Hood), but by the nightclub where he performs regularly ( Schimanski): When the outlet pays an influencer to spread it Now lets get to influencers and celebrities.Heres an example from BuzzFeed and NBC Sports: In these cases, the word "with" is usually employed in the Facebook post to denote which company is paying for the underlying content.One last thing to remember is that no matter who is paying for a "sponsored" Facebook post - outlet, subject, or influencer - if you check the actual article after following the link, it should clearly mark whether the article is an advertisement or a journalistic piece.

Kate McKinnon (left) and Alec Baldwin (right) as Clinton and Trump NBC Universal Saturday Night Live takes swings at all political candidates, regardless of party.And with Alec Baldwin and Kate McKinnon portraying Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, they keep hitting the mark.The show has a long history of making fun of everyone with their impersonations.Trump has even joined in on the fun in the past while acting as a host.On Saturday’s broadcast of the show, the actors took on the second debate between Trump and Clinton, and the GOP nominee was the focus of some pointed satire from Baldwin.I’m going to blow this whole thing, Baldwin, as Trump, said in the sketch.After the show, Trump took to Twitter to let people know that once it gets personal, he’s no longer laughing.While Trump and his supporters seem convinced that Saturday Night Live is trying to bring down his campaign, a lot of people took to Twitter to remind everyone that the show is all in the name of satire.
According to Texas Monthly, a 26-year-old hunting guide named Walker Daugherty was shot in the abdomen.When Daugherty reported the incident to law enforcement officials, he and his fiancée claimed that the gunfire came from illegal Mexican immigrants who were attempting to steal the Daugherty’s RV and kidnap their clients.According to KOSA CBS 7, the now-inactive campaign page stated that Daugherty was shot by illegal immigrants who were trying to steal his RV.CREDIT: Credit: GoFundMe Upon hearing the story, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller posted a message to Facebook calling Daugherty a hero and pledging his support for a border wall.According to KOSA CBS 7 in Texas, an investigation by the Presidio County Sheriff’s Department found that the gunfire did not come from immigrants crossing the border — it came from the hunters themselves.The Daugherty family reportedly released a statement about the Presidio County Sheriff’s investigation that was published on the blog The Westerner.We are unable to reveal all the details of the event at this time but we do not agree with the Sherriff’s stated conclusion to the incident.Daugherty and Bryant have since been indicted on charges of deadly conduct by discharging firearms in the direction of others, reports the Austin American-Statesman.
During Drew Brees media whirlwind in New York on Tuesday, the New Orleans Saints quarterback levied yet another serious criticism of the NFL."Ive been informed a lot of those coaches feel there are further sanctions being held over their head if they dont cooperate with the investigation," Brees said on The Dan Patrick Show, via ProFootballTalk."If they were to speak out on behalf of the players, maybe thats the fear they have.""Of course people are free to speak, as Joe Vitt has done," Aiello told Around the League on Wednesday.After Williams indefinite suspension was announced, the league indicated that Williams cooperation with future proceedings would be a factor in his possible reinstatement."Commissioner Goodell said he will give close attention to the extent to which Coach Williams cooperates with the NFL in any further proceedings," the league explained in a March 21 statement detailing Williams punishment.The back-and-forth between the players and the league over the bounty evidence is seemingly never-ending.Payton and Williams have openly apologized, admitted their mistakes, and seem to want to move past the controversy as much as possible.
Ex-FBI Director James Comey went rogue, according to testimony Wednesday from Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Sessions said in a Senate hearing that by clearing Hillary Clinton from prosecution for leaking and transmitting classified and top secret emails, Comey acted as investigator, judge and jury.And that is why he was fired.Sessions was addressing questions from Sen.

The trio’s resolution calls for Trump’s censure over his inadequate response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.The proposal also cites Trump for his failure to immediately and specifically name and condemn the groups responsible for actions of domestic terrorism in Charlottesville.The group’s resolution additionally demands that Trump fire any and all advisors who have urged him to cater to the alt-Right movement in the United State.The document criticizes Trump for employing people with ties to white supremacist movements in the White House.Bannon previously served as the executive chairman of Breitbart, which he characterized as the platform for the alt-right last year.What about the alt-left that came charging at the – as you say, the alt-right?One person died last Saturday when a car drove into people protesting the white nationalists in the city.Two other Virginia State Police Department officers were killed the same day in a helicopter crash authorities linked to the unrest.
Tucker Carlson said that Hillary Clinton spun a yarn of conspiracy theories about her election loss during a speech on Wednesday.Mike Huckabee joined "Fox &amp; Friends" to discuss Hillary Clintons return to the public eye with a speech over the weekend in the Poconos.A retired NYPD detective and private investigator running against New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio posted a video to Facebook challenging the Democrat to a push-up contest.A professor at a southern California college went on a diatribe against President-elect Donald Trump, and the unnamed student who recorded her may be facing punishment.
Meanwhile, the name of The Weinstein Company will be changed and Weinstein’s name will be taken off future projects.On the business side, it’s been reported that The Weinstein Company is a shambles, with agents and talent trying to get themselves and their projects away from the bad smell, and upcoming films such as The Current War and The Upside in release limbo.The Financial Times says that Goldman Sachs is exploring options for its small stake in The Weinstein Company — and really, people, if the Goldman Sachs is taking the moral high ground, consider yourself toast.It’s not as if Harvey Weinstein varies much from all the other handsy creeps in his business — ooh, the names we’d insert here — and casting couch stories have plagued the industry since Florence Lawrence first fluttered her eyelashes circa 1906.Some of the more interesting fallout from the Weinstein case involves the support weasels — every Weinstein staffer who knew things were rotten is under a cloud, and so is every agent, manager, casting agent, publicist or assistant who knowingly sent some poor girl to talk to Weinstein in a hotel room.The movie industry really is a cesspool of sexual harassment and bullying; hard to know how so many people go to work every day in such an atmosphere of fear and loathing.People will risk a lot to get anywhere near rich and famous, and an industry that allows ordinary people — capable of memorizing dialogue and playing make-believe — to be treated like gods is an industry in which every sort of predatory behaviour will no doubt thrive.Foreground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque Background --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Window --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Font Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400% Text Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow Font Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps Defaults Done Riley Fleming and Wes Heffernan have been going back and forth all year, so why wouldn’t you expect them to do the same thing in the PGA of Alberta Championship?

Amal and George Clooney attend the Celebrity Fight Night In Italy Benefitting The Andrea Bocelli Foundation and The Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center Gala on September 7, 2014 in Florence, Italy.(Photo by Andrew Images for Celebrity Fight Night) — George and Amal Clooney have donated $1 million to Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit that strives to put an end to domestic hate groups and extremists, in response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, earlier this month.What happened in Charlottesville, and what is happening in communities across our country, demands our collective engagement to stand up to hate, the actor and humanitarian lawyer said in a joint statement.&gt;&gt; Related: More than 900 active hate groups in the U.S., report says On Aug. 12, a rally in Charlottesville turned violent when a group of white nationalists clashed with counterprotesters.One woman was killed when a car plowed into the crowd at the rally.According to Reuters, the donation comes from the Clooney Foundation for Justice, which the couple created in 2016 to promote justice worldwide in courtrooms and classrooms.Southern Poverty Law Center President Richard Cohen released a statement thanking the Clooneys for standing with (the organization) at this critical moment in our country’s fight against hate.Trending - Most Read Stories
As the GOP divides at the rate of human cells, and a self-destructive President Trump causes his own supporters to question how he can succeed, Democrats have refused to fill the leadership void with a better vision of governance.Democrats are leaning indulgently on the politics of race and gratuitous opposition to Trump, and they appear content to be the party of sanctuary cities, safe spaces and single-payer health care.The president’s pathetic and irresponsible response to a white supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville -- where a protester was mowed down by a driver and killed -- has prompted not only fellow Republicans to criticize Trump but now his own National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, as well.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is calling on Congress to censure the president for the repulsiveness of his words and actions, adding that every day, the president gives us further evidence of why such a censure is necessary.Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any potential ties the president and his campaign had to those activities, responded Friday, saying in a Twitter post that he will co-sponsor a censure resolution because Trump expresses views inimical to our values.Rep. Maxine Waters, whose late-in-life internet fame recently landed her on The View, tweeted the day after Charlottesville that Trump has made it clear - &amp; Gorka in the WH, &amp; the Klan in the streets, it is now the White Supremacists House.While countering Trump is essential -- after all, Republicans are doing the same -- the focus should remain on even more fundamental matters: guarding the Constitution and the separation of powers; stressing facts over falsehoods; preventing a government shutdown that Trump’s lobbying for; defending the right to a free press to hold him accountable; urging him to pay cost-sharing reduction payments under the Affordable Care Act to provide more certainty to the fragile exchanges; and pushing for any bipartisan cooperation possible on health care, tax reform and infrastructure projects.As they attempt to plot a path forward and regain seats in state legislatures, governorships, the U.S. House and Senate -- and someday the White House -- Democrats need new faces and leaders and can’t lean too heavily on the 44th president.
Major League Baseball, the sport of Jackie Robinson and long ago a touchstone of civil rights, saw its first athlete join the movement started by Colin Kaepernick and inflamed this weekend by President Trump.From the @sfchronicle’s Santiago Mejia, here is A’s rookie Bruce Maxwell becoming the first MLB player to take a knee for the anthem: pic.twitter.8QVY9hW15— Susan Slusser (@susanslusser) September 24, 2017 Maxwell, a 26-year-old catcher from Alabama, composed several tweets Saturday in the wake of President Trumps comments Friday night to "fire the sons of (expletives)" in the NFL who kneeled for the anthem.This now has gone from just a BlackLives Matter topic to just complete inequality of any man or woman that wants to stand for Their rights!— Bruce T Maxwell (@bruu_truu13) September 23, 2017 In a profane Instagram post, he implored "every single NFL player" to kneel on Sunday, and then he followed up his words with actions before Saturday nights game in Oakland, kneeling in the dirt in front of the As dugout at the Coliseum.Teammate Mark Canha kept a hand on Maxwells shoulder as he engaged in his protest as the anthem played, and wrapped him in a hug once it concluded.He was raised in Alabama, site of Trumps Friday night speech during which the president blasted NFL players for kneeling during the anthem and also bemoaned what he seemed to consider an overriding concern within the league for brain injuries.As NFL players geared up for what may be a significant day of protest before Sundays games, and NBA players blasted the president on social media as well, Maxwells Twitter and Instagram feeds went beyond his usual penchant for Alabama Crimson Tide football.A post shared by bruce_maxwell (@bruce_maxwell) on But until he took a knee before Saturdays game, baseball did not yet have a player join in anthem protests that started with Kaepernick and continued through various NFL players and even to U.S. womens national soccer team star Megan Rapinoe.
(Getty) Hillary Clinton is beginning to increase her odds of winning Florida in many election forecasts, while other models say that Donald Trump is now likely to capture the state.The state has flipped from red to blue in the past 24 hours; as of November 7th, the FiveThirtyEight model now gives Donald Trump a 48.5 percent chance of winning Florida, with Hillary Clinton having the better odds of 51.6 percent.On their forecast, we can see a clear dip that occurs in the immediate aftermath of the news that the FBI would be looking into new emails relevant to the Hillary Clinton investigation, but now her lead is beginning to rise again.FiveThirtyEight is also forecasting that Hillary Clinton will win 48.2 percent of the popular vote in Florida, while Donald Trump will receive 48.0 percent of it.On November 6th, the Times’ model gave Hillary Clinton a 70 percent chance of winning the state, but now, this number has gone down to 66 percent.On November 6th, Clinton was given a 73 percent chance of winning Florida by PredictWise, but now that has gone up two points to 75 percent.On Sunday, this model gave Clinton a 93 percent chance of winning Florida, and the state was placed in the probable Clinton column.No polls have yet been released that reflect the FBI’s recent announcement that they would still not be recommending charges against Hillary Clinton after reviewing the new set of e-mails, so it remains to be seen if Clinton will be able to recover even more of her lead in the aftermath of that news.
North Korean leader and and monster heel Kim Jong-Un attends the test of a missile dropkick.Geopolitical tensions are mounting after state-run North Korean news media released footage of what appears to be the successful test of a devastating missile dropkick.In newly released footage, North Korean President Kim Jong-Un is seen celebrating as missile dropkick collides feet-first with an ocean target, causing a huge bump.The missile dropkick was reportedly launched from the country’s Technical Operations Pad for Thermonuclear and Underwater Reconnaissance Networks of Ballistics Used for Catastrophic Kinetic Launching Exercises, or T.O.P.T.U.R.N.B.U.C.K.L.E.International weaponry experts have long known that North Korea is capable of launching a Powerbomb — perhaps even an Exploder Suplex — but the possibility that the country now has a missile dropkick in its arsenal has caused alarm worldwide and throughout the WWE Universe.U.S. President and WWE Hall of Famer Donald Trump has insisted he has zero tolerance for North Korea’s missile dropkick tests and will, if necessary, send Bobby Lashley over to take care of them before Trump himself shaves Kim Jong-Un’s head.

It’s not often that a suspect’s attorney calls the police officer who arrested him a true hero; but in John Picerno’s eyes, that exactly what Overland Park Police Sergeant Scott Ferguson is.Back in April, Ferguson was on night patrol when he spotted a vehicle driving along the wrong side of road with no headlights on.He pulled the car over, but the driver quickly took off again…only to crash into a fire hydrant.Rather than brandishing his own weapon, Ferguson wrestled the gun out of the driver’s hands – and the driver to the ground where he was finally handcuffed.At his hearing in August, the suspect pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and battery on a law enforcement officer, as well as driving under the influence.But according to Picerno, his lawyer, he should just be thankful he’s alive.He is very lucky and both he and his family are very grateful for the officer, Sgt.Scott Ferguson, who exercised extreme discretion during the incident, Picerno said according to the Kansas City Star.

The offenders that the bill targets are the worst of the worst — predators of young children.Republican Rep. Steve Hurst introduced the measure requiring anyone older than 21 who is convicted of certain sex offenses against children age 12 or younger to pay for the surgical procedure before they serve the end of their prison sentence.This isn’t a first for Hurst — he’s introduced similar legislation seven times since 2006, but most of his efforts never made it out of committee, according to CBS News.He was prompted to begin this crusade as the result of a visit from a foster parent advocacy group that relayed a horrible story of abuse.Several House members at the time told The Associated Press they feared the castration language would have made the bill unconstitutional.In 2011, Hurst co-sponsored a bill that classified the sexual abuse of a child 6 years or younger as a capital offense, allowing courts to sentence offenders to life without parole.Somebody that wants to mess with a little girl or little boy that age should be castrated, and they should not be able to mess with any other kids, Keith Dison told CBS affiliate WIAT.I understand prison and going to prison for a long time for some kind of crime like that, but to physical mutilate someone…that’s a little out there…it’s crazy, Jessica George told the station.
A convoy used by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria has become a death trap for fighters with the radical Islamic terrorist group.According to multiple reports and Pentagon spokesmen, the convoy consisted of 17 buses that were departing an ISIS-held enclave after striking a deal with the radical Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah and the Syrian army.However, the United States scrambled assets to attack the convoy, and cratered the road ahead of the busses.Corey ) While six of the vehicles turned back towards the city of Palmyra, the other 11 have been stranded for at least 10 days.This has saved the United States and the rest of the anti-ISIS coalition the time and effort of hunting them down.The U.S.-lead anti-ISIS coalition has allowed deliveries of food and water to the convoy, to which ISIS fighters have been drawn to "[l]ike moths to the flame," according to comments by DOD spokesman Ryan Dillon, an Army colonel.(Screengrab from YouTube UNB News) "We were able to exploit it and take advantage," he said, noting that over 40 vehicles, from technicals to a tank, have been hit trying to aid the convoy.There was no word on whether the internal fighting among the ISIS terrorists saved the coalition additional trouble.

Obama legacy being trashed.Via Daily Caller: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt announced he would sign a proposed rule to repeal the centerpiece of former President Barack Obama’s plan to fight global warming.Pruitt announced his intention to withdraw the Clean Power Plan (CPP) to applause from a crowd gathered at a mining event on Monday.EPA has been working to repeal the CPP for months.The Obama administration finalized the CPP in 2015, which aims to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.Obama used the CPP as part of his plant to meet the goals of the Paris climate accord.
Before taking her life, August Ames left a suicide note behind in her car.Within the note that was addressed to her family and friends, August allegedly apologized for killing herself in a public park, The Blast reports.However, according to the Medical Examiner, August failed to mention the bullying and online harassment she suffered in the days leading up to her suicide at any point in her message, which was discovered by authorities.We reported earlier how the Ventura County Medical Examiner spokesperson said that the official cause of death was asphyxiation from hanging herself, an act which she committed in a park 20 minutes away from her home.Immediately after her death, many of her friends initially believed that she had taken her life as a result of cyberbullying after August tweeted about refusing to do a scene with a male adult performer who had done gay porn.While the suicide note did not indicate that bullying was an impetus for August taking her own life, we reported earlier how Dr. Jenn Mann informed us that bully victims are 229 times more likely to commit suicide than non-victims, according to a study by Yale University.It’s now also come to light that August reportedly had mental health issues that stemmed from when she was allegedly sexually assaulted as a kid.One of August’s friends and fellow porn star Alison Tyler said that the porn industry could have been a lot more supportive of August, and that August had never been homophobic despite claims that a controversial tweet she posted was potentially gay-bashing.
Regarding Jennifer Rubin, Washington Post, Oct. 7: The Washington Post has the audacity to call out Fox News and the GOP while writing its liberal garbage defending Hillary Clinton and Democrats, who have led this country down a dangerous path of socialist leaning.I know this paper is being led by an ex-Post employee, but please give your readers a break.The Statesman must have an editorial department; why not use them instead of importing this junk.Karl Betar, Meridian Breaking News Be the first to know when big news breaks Recaptcha requires verification.protected by reCAPTCHA Privacy - Terms Privacy - Terms
During the second presidential debate in St. Louis, Missouri, candidate Trump told Hillary Clinton, You’d be in jail!It’s now been one year and Trump supporters are still waiting to see Crooked Hillary behind bars.In 2015 former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani famously said Hillary Clinton should be investigated for breaking 15 federal laws.Rudy Giuliani: General Petraeus was got prosecuted for doing approximately one-tenth of what she’s alleged to have done… There are specific federal crimes, I could give you a list of fifteen of them if you’d like, that she should be investigated for, for which there needs to be an answer.According to the public record, the answer to many of those is there is probable cause to believe she committed a crime.It’s been a year since President Trump told Hillary Clinton to her face that he would lock her up.Americans are tired of a two-tiered judicial system — one for the elites and one for the common man.Sponsored Sponsored

Quinn warns Ridge that if he thinks she’d betray Eric, he doesn’t know a damn thing about her.Incredulous, Quinn points out what Ridge was planning to do to her – he’s exactly like him!She says Eric is the first man to respect her and she’s not giving that up…ever.Quinn screams that she hates who she was then, but finally she has a life worth living because of love.Quinn protests that she had to, to survive, but Eric saw through that and took a chance on her.She sobs that after years of being alone anymore, she’s not now, and she doesn’t ever want to be alone again.He hints that when she and Douglas do arrive, it would be nice not to have a roommate.Steffy explains that she’s waiting to move back into Liam’s out of fairness to Wyatt.
Unfortunately, Judd had to go to the "Womens March," where hundreds of thousands of women wore pink "pussy" hats while claiming to be upset that Trump had used that word once.She performed ridiculous slam poetry, screeching defamatory accusations about the president wanting to have sex with his daughter and about other terrible things about which she had no first-hand knowledge.No "by the way, Harvey Weinstein is a dirtbag who tried to get me to watch him shower for a part."I find it very difficult to believe Judd is this angry at Donald Trump, a man who has never done anything to her, or provably to anybody, when there is a man who did do something horrible to her whom she could be screeching about.Jennifer Lawrence was recently interviewed for her epic fail of a movie, Mother, and gave Democratic talking points like "equality for women in the workplace," blamed Trump for hurricanes, and rattled off the same tired Leftist arguments weve heard forever.During another interview, she claimed that she is terrified of Trump and wanted to make a video of herself saying "F*** you!"Lawrence claimed she felt she could be a spokesperson for women who are underpaid: I felt like I had a voice, people look at me and listen to me, and to not say anything, thats never sat well with me.While she supported Obama, she never had anything more interesting to say beyond how handsome she thinks he is.
@ How much money did it cost the nations taxpayers for Vice President and Official Glarer at North Korea Mike Pence to spend just enough time in Indianapolis on Sunday to storm out of a Colts game in protest of a protest?CNN has an estimate just for the plane alone: According to the Air Force, flying a C-32, the model of plane used for Air Force 2, for one hour costs about $30,0.All so Pence could release a statement that was the equivalent of his infamous stern gaze across the Demilitarized Zone at North Korea: I left todays Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.This is belied by the fact that his reporters traveling with him were not allowed out of their vans when they arrived at the Colts stadium but were told ahead of time that there may be an early departure from the game by VPOTUS.He knew this ahead of time, yet he still chose to fly from Las Vegas to Indianapolis despite the fact that he had to fly back to California immediately afterwards for fundraisers, just so he could get a picture of himself holding his hand over his heart (a picture his staff immediately made the header photo on his Twitter page) before theatrically storming out and scolding the NFL players for offending him.A real leader might have tried to find out exactly why the players started kneeling in the first place, which was to protest police brutality and racism, and then spoken with them and tried to figure out ways to address their concerns.As of Monday morning, he has yet to make a peep about the white nationalists returning to Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday night to once again rally around the Robert E. Lee statue there.The views and opinions expressed within it are those of the author only and do not necessarily reflect the editorial opinion of IJR.
Governor Cuomo of New York is threatening to sue the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to stop its ongoing raids to detain illegal immigrants wanted for serious crimes like assault and rape.The governor is parroting Democrats across the nation who claim ICE should be abolished because it’s breaking apart families and peaceful communities.Eighty-eight percent of the illegal immigrants arrested in recent Los Angeles ICE raids and 81% arrested throughout California, according to the latest ICE data, had criminal convictions.Check the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution: Uncle Sam doesn’t need Andrew Cuomo’s permission to enforce federal laws.ICE is forced to conduct sweeps out in residential communities because New York’s sanctuary laws are preventing the agency from taking custody of criminal aliens before they’re released from jail, like the agency used to do.New York is moving in the same direction, with 23% of its population foreign-born and Democrats gaining increasing control of state government.Mr. Cuomo and other Democrats have been resisting the federal crackdown on immigrant-related crime and calling for increased spending on after-school music and sports programs to provide an alternative to gang activity in immigrant communities.Brutes willing to torture and mutilate a human being with a machete will not be dissuaded by learning to play the flute.
The media’s reporting has now become one of the most central issues being covered by the media.The issues are not the central matters that concern Trump’s opponents – they just seem focused on one thing – bringing President Trump down – with no red lines as to how to achieve that goal.Some corners of the media seem to have totally lost focus on what their jobs are supposed to be.Just like Donald Trump has been saying, the New York times has been using headlines such as: Ten die in PLO Fighting as far back as the 80’s.Instead of reporting that warring Arab factions in Lebanon had killed other Arab factions in Lebanon, the clear implication was that the Israeli Army killed 10 more Arabs.The key aspect was not whether or not the news was fake or not, but whether or not the implication that the publications were hoping to get across would stick.In the case of the New York Times, it was a clear anti-Israel bias that spread across ABS, NBC, and CBS during their War in Lebanon.So, when Donald Trump takes on the biased media with terms like fake news, it is a pleasure to see and watch the pompous anti-right wing media cringe.
Opinion editorial Modal Trigger James Comey As soon as FBI Director James Comey announced the revival of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server, Democrats went on the attack — against Comey.The same Harry Reid who flat-out lied in 2012 in claiming a confidential source told him Mitt Romney had paid no income taxes for a decade.The same Harry Reid who still calls that lie one of the best things I’ve ever done — simply because Romney didn’t win.Now that Comey wants to check the e-mails from Anthony Weiner’s devices, he’s become an agent of the vast right-wing conspiracy that Clinton says has been hounding her for 25 years.Sorry: After clearing Clinton four months ago, Comey had no choice but to announce the discovery of potential fresh evidence in the case — evidence that should’ve been handed over long ago.We’re glad to see the White House playing it cool, announcing that President Obama doesn’t believe Comey is trying to influence the election outcome.The fault here is not with the FBI but with the Democrats’ own candidate, Hillary Clinton, who plainly believes the law doesn’t matter if it conflicts with her desire for secrecy.Just as Harry Reid believes the truth doesn’t matter — as long as the Democrats win.
The 1st Amendment is the most well known to Americans of all the amendments in the Bill of Rights.The 1st Amendment reads like this: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."For one hundred years the 1st Amendment was understood to only apply to the federal government, but after the Civil War and the 14th Amendment was added to the Constitution, courts began to forbid the states to interfere with these rights as well due to an idea called "due process of law."Indeed, in the minds of some, banning expressions of religious faith like this is a violation of another clause of the 1st Amendment - the Free Exercise Clause, because it seeks to control the religious expressions of citizens.Free Exercise Clause The Free Exercise Clause is the part of the 1st Amendment that says Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or "the free exercise thereof."The Freedom of Speech Clause The Freedom of Speech Clause is the part of the 1st Amendment that says, "Congress shall make no law.Freedom of the Press Clause This was a very important principle to the Founding Fathers of America because of the importance the press played during the Revolutionary War.The Freedom of Assembly was recognized to be of utmost importance if the Americans were to be successful in establishing a government of the people.
This riveting finding has resulted in some exposure on the topic – including articles by the New York Times, The Independent UK, and network affiliates such as ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, but the whole story – or the many threads connecting the various murders– is not being told.For this reason, the activist took to the internet today, on the one-year-anniversary of the first of the mysterious deaths, to express how serious of a concern these events are.Prev Next 6) July 19, 2015 A month to the day after the first doctor (Jeff Bradstreet, MD) was found dead with a gunshot wound to his chest, Dr. Ron Schwartz was found murdered in his E. Coast Florida home.Sadly, he was shot to death.Another, a Phd (who was a wife and mother of two) was hit while jogging near the beach and then buried in a shallow grave on the tourist island of Grenada.20) January 26, 2016 Believe it or not just a few short weeks later, a holistic MD and his wife (a physician’s assistant) were attacked, while on a relaxing beach stroll, by a sword wielding man in the same place- the tiny island of Grenada.Both perps in each attack of the doctors in Grenada in a couple of weeks are reported to have been recently released from prison and in both crimes (allegedly unrelated) the men just nonchalantly turned themselves in after the crime.21) January 28th, 2016 The new spate of cancer who are killed or found dead doesn’t slow down and this might be the strangest of them all: Yet another cancer researcher, Professor Alan Clarke, 52, was found dead in the wood in hanging from a tree in a rubber body suit on December 28th, 2015 and they ruled it accidental.29) March 14th, 2016 One of the strangest cases yet is holistic MD and acupuncturist Dr Clogston, 68, who was missing 3 weeks and eventually found dead in his car which was allegedly found off the route some say he took to work for 30 years.
Roy Moore for Senate In a report titled ‘Roy Moore’s Facebook page shared inflammatory memes, article praising Russia’s anti-gay laws,’ CNN (Cable News Network), one of most rabid left-wing, anti-conservative channels in the United States, sternly criticized the conservative contents of the Facebook page belonging to Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for US Senate in Alabama.Among Moore’s Facebook posts hated by CNN the most highlighted was the BarbWire article  Conservative Russians Give Moral Lesson to Facebook’s Homosexual Propaganda, written by me.CNN said, Moore’s Facebook page also shared an article from the religious conservative website BarbWire.com in July 2015 with the headline, Conservative Russians Give Moral Lesson to Facebook’s Homosexual Propaganda.The article highlighted efforts by some Russians to counter a feature on Facebook that allowed users to overlay a rainbow over their profile picture.Trending: English Professor Assigns Trump-Bashing Books The strongest reaction came from conservative Russians who overlaid an image of the colors of their country’s flag — white, blue and red — over their profile picture, the article read, adding that users also countered the homosexual #LoveWins hashtag with #pridetobestraight and #pridetoberussian.The article also described Russia’s efforts to crack down on the LGBT community, including the country’s so-called gay propaganda law, as a strong stance in defense of traditional family values.CNN added, Moore shared an article in July 2015 that praised Russia’s anti-gay laws and Russians who opposed Facebook’s feature that allowed users to change their profile pictures to celebrate same-sex marriage: I considered it a privilege to have a my conservative BarbWire article shared by Judge Roy Moore.Portuguese version of this article: CNN ataca Roy Moore só porque ele compartilhou meu artigo no portal conservador BarbWire The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of Barb Wire.
Opinion Modal Trigger Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrives to speak on Sept. 12, 2012, on the killing of US Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three staff members at the US Consulate building in Benghazi, Libya, from the Treaty Room of the State Department.Her failures go beyond leaving four Americans to die in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, the ridiculous Russian reset and the carnage in Syria that she and President Obama idly watched unfold — and that gets more horrific daily.The Bush administration — reeling from the attack on the World Trade Center — had made it a top priority to protect information flow among embassies, the CIA and the FBI.But Clinton dropped the ball, creating what the department’s inspector general called undue risk in the management of information.In November 2013, the IG issued an alert to the State Department’s top executives about the urgent recurring weaknesses in cybersecurity that had been red-flagged in six previous reports between 2011 and 2013, almost all on Clinton’s watch.John Bentel, in charge of State’s cybersecurity during Clinton’s tenure, is one of the five State Department staffers who demanded immunity before talking to FBI investigators about Clinton’s private-server scheme.Outrageous, but still a lesser offense than Clinton’s neglect of the entire department’s digital security — exposing communications between thousands of agents and diplomats across the globe.Yet during Monday’s debate, Clinton had the nerve to claim that she takes threats to the nation’s cybersecurity very seriously.
Photo By Justin Images In response to Joyce Newman’s recent letter about a conversation about guns: According to the National Right to Life Organization, approximately 600,0 babies are murdered every year by Planned Parenthood with more than 52 million murdered since Roe v. Wade.This makes Planned Parenthood the biggest mass murderer in the history of the world.Is she willing to have a serious conversation about that?More people die every year from overdoses or auto accidents then from guns.More people die every year from obesity then from guns.The left’s obsession with gun control is just that, control.They support Planned Parenthood but go ballistic when a gun is used to kill someone.It’s the old game of don’t pay any attention to what’s going on over there, but look what’s happening here.
All the more so because it comes from the editor of the New York Times, who happens to be the actual guilty party.The result is the paper’s relentless, daily assault on Trump, to the advantage of Hillary Clinton.This is not a mere continuation of the old liberal bias that infected the Times, the Washington Post and the broadcast networks for years.The signal that the Times abandoned its traditional church-state separation of news and opinion came in an article by the paper’s media reporter two months ago.In his August piece, Jim Rutenberg declared that most reporters saw Trump as an abnormal and potentially dangerous candidate, and concluded they had a duty to be true to the facts, in a way that will stand up to history’s judgment.This is not a mere continuation of the old liberal bias that infected the Times, the Washington Post and the broadcast networks for years.3: Did the mayor ask teachers union president Michael Mulgrew for the $350,0 contribution the union gave to de Blasio’s political slush fund, the Campaign for One New York, a month before the union got a $9 billion contract?The public has a right to know what the mayor knows about the investigations, including the possibility he will face criminal charges.
John Legend has added his voice against those speaking out against disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual harassment, assault and rape by multiple women in Hollywood.He was recently fired from the Weinstein Company but has reportedly vowed to continue making movies.TMZ spoke with Legend and asked for his thoughts on the matter.He said: I think he did some despicable things and he is rightfully being shamed for it.He shouldn’t be working in Hollywood if he’s abusing his position that way.I think it’s good we’re bringing light to this issue and hopefully more women will be able to tell their stories.Men need to listen and change their behavior.
"Ebby went to a party on a Friday night and had been assaulted, and there was a videotape," said Ebbys mother Laurie Jernigan."An incident had occurred at that party that she wanted to discuss, and discuss with the police," said Michael Jernigan."She would move out and hang out, which was really unusual, but she would never run away and not talk to her family," said Laurie."I called Little Rock and notified them that the car had been sitting there for three days, and they had gotten the car and taken it in," said Guy Hooper."The last thing that we need to do is to run out here and start our own investigation and interfere with the police investigation in some way, so we basically did nothing other than try to communicate with the police department and stay in communication with the family," said Vickers.We tracked down Guy Hooper ourselves, and he gave us the shocking details about seeing Ebby with two young black men in the park only days before she disappeared."Its this middle one on the top and the gentleman on the left," said Hooper.We dont know if the Little Rock Police Department has ever seen the potential bombshell evidence that Crime Watch Daily has brought to the table.
Workers have started putting up stand for President Trumps inauguration outside the White House Donald Trump’s first week The Republican billionaire made a victory speech in New York yesterday, just after Hillary Clinton conceded defeat to him by phone.The real estate developer is due to meet outgoing President Barack Obama at the White House today to discuss the transfer of power.Donald Trump’s first months Over the next two months, Mr Trump will get ready to take power before he enters the White House on January 20.Mr Trump will also work to repair relations with the Republican Party, which has retaken control of the Senate and House of Representatives.House speaker Paul Ryan said: We are eager to work hand-in-hand with the new administration to advance an agenda to improve the lives of the American people."How the US election process works Donald Trump’s first 100 days Once in the White House, Mr Trump will immediately set about undoing as much of Mr Obama’s legacy as possible.Wed, November 9, 2016 After Donald Trump won the US election he made this statement We will get along with all the nations that get along with us."we look at how Europe reacted to the shock victory of Trump After Donald Trump won the US election he made this statement We will get along with all the nations that get along with us."
PHOTO: Instagram Dont freak out the next time you see President Barack Obama sans wedding ring—he and Michelle are still #goals.In fact, the reason why Obama often goes ringless has us loving the First Couple—who recently celebrated their 24th wedding anniversary on October 3—all the more.It appears that President Obama keeps his left-hand naked because he wants to keep his most precious valuable safe, and doesnt want to risk anything happening to his wedding band.A video recently surfaced on the Washington Post of President Obama discreetly slipping off his wedding ring and placing it in his pocket as he approached a small crowd to shake hands—seemingly indicating that he wants to keep it close and out of any potential harms way.(Like snatchers or who-knows-what-else.People be crazy.)Even with all of the Secret Service agents surrounding him, Obama still takes the utmost precautions with his beloved wedding ring.However, if Obama were to lose his wedding ring—say it slips out of his pocket—he could always call the Ring Finders.
At Price Hill Chili Restaurant in Hamilton County, Ohio, Tuesday morning, they served up hot coffee, scrambled eggs and a side of politics.CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller asked voters there whether the FBI’s decision to re-open Hillary Clinton’s email investigation is changing any minds.I am standing by Hillary, one said.I am really rooting for Trump this year, said another.Watch the video above for more reaction from swing state voters.
ISTANBUL: Presiden Turki, Recep Tayyip Erdogan menyatakan kesediaan Turki membuka kedutaannya di Baitumaqdis Timur dalam usaha meningkatkan tentangan terhadap pengiktirafan kota itu sebagai ibu negara Israel oleh Presiden Donald Trump.Erdogan sebelum ini mengetuai kecaman umat Islam terhadap langkah AS itu dengan mengadakan sidang kemuncak bersama pemimpin Pertubuhan Kerjasama Islam (OIC) minggu lalu di Istanbul, yang menggesa dunia mengiktiraf Baitulmaqdis sebagai ibu negara Palestin.Tetapi, Insya Allah hari tersebut hampir tiba dan … kita akan secara rasminya membuka kedutaan kita di sana, katanya tanpa memberikan tarikh yang tepat.Erdogan yang membantah keputusan Trump termasuk memindahkan kedutaan Amerika Syarikat (AS) ke Baitulmaqdis berkata ia sejajar logik dan pemahaman zionis dan evangelis.Erdogan memberi amaran kepada umat Islam dalam ucapannya agar menentang perang saudara di mana pertempuran antara satu sama lain hanya membantu negara pengganas seperti Israel.Di kebanyakan bandar di tenggara Diyarbakir, Kurdish, beribu-ribu orang mengibar bendera Palestin dan melaungkan slogan seperti pembunuhan beramai-ramai tidak akan berhenti jika semua umat Islam tidak bersatu.Dalam ucapan berasingan, Perdana Menteri Binali Yildirim berkata mulai sekarang kita mengisytiharkan Timur Baitulmuqaddis yang diduduki sebagai ibu negara Palestin, sambil menambah Turki ingin melihat penyelesaian untuk Baitulmaqdis yang akan memuaskan hati kedua-dua belah pihak dalam konflik itu.Tahun lepas, Turki dan Israel mengakhiri perselisihan yang dicetuskan Israel pada 2010 yang menyebabkan 10 aktivis Turki mati selain ketegangan diplomatik.
I think it’s interesting how you have that transition from somebody who was just being real and communicating to his people in a way that made sense to him; and then you have Howard Stern, who makes a lot of money—and in fact an entire career—from pissing people off.I believe that South Parks anti-PC messages paved the way for white supremacist groups to recruit much of the largely white male fanbase into what is now referred to as the alt-right, or other groups that are identical in all but name.They promoted the idea that marginalized people—trans people, people of color, Jewish people, etc.—speaking out against harm caused by South Parks brand of "humor" and [the shows] "I do what I want" attitude are the real oppressors.They tell these kids that theyre the ones being oppressed by those telling them that they have privilege, and therefore need to make some effort to at least not use certain words and maybe examine prejudiced attitudes they might have picked up from a culture that is prejudiced in many ways.The alt-right promotes the idea of white male victimization, drawing in youth that has been told by South Park that the plight of marginalized groups doesnt matter and that "political correctness" is oppressing them.But it’s so popular and so widespread on the right now, and you actually have people coming out with articles and people in the White House using that rhetoric to help further their political careers.It seemed to come out of nowhere, but then you look at the timing and it does kind of follow Caitlyn Jenner’s coming out to the public as a woman.That in itself probably would have gotten some backlash, but then you look at how popular South Park is, and there’s no way it didn’t play a role in people reacting the way they did: reacting like, oh that’s just so gross—their existence is gross and wrong.
Luis Ruiz is a fifth-degree black belt in karate and a martial arts instructor.Perhaps it was that the two men knew they could handle themselves that they fearlessly engaged with an attacker.When they looked around, they noticed a woman being brutally beaten by a man.We notice that he’s grabbing her and slamming her on the ground, Ruiz told CBS.So I say ‘hey, is everything OK, are you guys OK?’ The guy gets up like nothing, turns to his right and walks away like he wasn’t doing anything wrong, he said.Ruiz then comforted the woman, whose face, he says, was swollen beyond recognition and bloodied.The father and son were able to identify the attacker as Todd Deas.I’d rather think we just did the right thing, and that everyone in the neighborhood and in the world would do the right thing, Ruiz said.
US President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC.President-elect Donald Trump and future First Lady Melania Trump are meeting with President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama at the White House and are expected to discuss efforts toward a smooth transition of power.President elect Donald Trump , with his wife Melania Trump, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, gives the thumbs up after a meeting in the Majority Leaders office in the US Capitol in Washington, DC.Earlier in the day President elect Trump met with US President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.
So, before Trump can fire the prosecutor who is hot on the corruption trail of those in the president’s inner circle, he needs a pretext.He could just work his way down the line at the Justice Department, until he found a quisling willing to remove the special counsel.Thus, he’s now attacking the F.B.I., saying the agency is in Tatters and its standing the worst in History.Trump’s lawyer, John Dowd, has been busy clearing out more brush, making the preposterous claim that the president cannot obstruct justice because he’s the nation’s chief law enforcement officer.If Trump shot somebody on Fifth Avenue — his own suggested redline — he could, as the nation’s chief law enforcement officer, tell the cops to quash the investigation.With Trump in, the sanctions against Russia would be ripped up, clearing the way for big money to be made on the inside, according to the report made public Wednesday.As for their boss, he said that Mueller is frankly a disgrace to the American justice system and has put the country on the brink of becoming a banana republic.Don’t forget, this is the same Robert Mueller who won wide bipartisan praise when he was appointed special counsel: a career prosecutor, the longest-serving director of the F.B.I.
Following the latest FBI developments in Hillary Clinton’s email probe, Donald Trump ripped the Justice Department and top Clinton aide Huma Abedin on Saturday, firing off a tirade during his triumphant swing through western states.It’s reported today, this morning that the Department of Justice was fighting the FBI, Trump said in Golden, Colorado.Trump was referencing reports that Attorney General Loretta Lynch recommended that FBI Director James Comey not publicly disclose the new emails -- what the Justice Department viewed as a violation of its long-standing practice not to comment on ongoing investigations.Offering no proof, the Republican nominee posited that Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, had bribed Lynch with the position when the two had an impromptu meeting earlier this summer on a plane in Arizona.Perhaps, just perhaps, of course he said he only talked about golf and the grandchildren, but he was on the plane for 39 minutes, he went to Arizona, an unbelievable place, but there are those who think when he went onto the plane that’s what he discussed just prior to a decision being made, Trump said.The emails tied to the Clinton probe were found on the separated couple’s electronic devices from a separate FBI investigation into Weiner’s sexting scandal.He added that Comey’s letter to top Republicans in the House and Senate was long on innuendo and short on facts.Podesta added that Comey knew full well what Republicans in Congress would do with it and blasted House Oversight Committee Chair Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, in particular for taking the opportunity to distort the facts.
Donald Trump has, finally, all but united the Republican Party – in denunciation of his continued, race-based attacks on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the civil lawsuits against the candidate’s Trump University.Claiming a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment … it’s absolutely unacceptable.And Sen. Mark Kirk, a Republican from Illinois facing a tough reelection battle this year, flat out withdrew his support for his party’s nominee, saying Donald Trump’s belief that an American-born judge of Mexican descent is incapable of fairly presiding over his case is not only dead wrong, it is un-American.Last week, Trump charged that his plan to build a wall between the U.S.-Mexican border was an absolute conflict of interest, charging to the Wall Street Journal that Curiel could not preside fairly over the Trump University case because he is of Mexican heritage.Amid the fierce backlash from his own party, Trump put together a damage-control statement late Tuesday promising not to say anything more about Curiel or the lawsuit – after this: It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage.Just one day earlier, Trump encouraged supporters on a private conference call on Monday to join his chorus by publicly questioning the judge’s credibility, two participants on the call told Bloomberg Politics.Several Republican politicians, including former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown, were involved in the call, during which Trump overturned a Sunday email from his staff that ordered his most prominent supporters – those surrogates who speak for him on cable news talk shows and at campaign appearances – to cease all talk of the lawsuit and Curiel.Freshly-minted presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton also issued a warning on Monday that Trump may next focus his attacks on women judges … or maybe a judge with a disability, or perhaps one who was a former POW, or African-American.
A self-proclaimed Alt-Left leader has vowed to use a baseball bat embedded with nails to crush skulls during a Patriot Prayer peace rally set to take place in San Francisco this weekend.The Twitter user, who goes by the handle @ibPrinceJordan, tweeted, The Patriot Prayer rally is a nazi white supremacist event.The user is located in San Francisco, which is where the event will take place at Crissy Field on Saturday, suggesting he does indeed plan to attend the march.Many Americans In The Dark About These BIG "Federal Rent Checks" Despite numerous other prominent Twitter users drawing attention to the violent threat, the account has not been suspended.What makes the threat even more absurd is that organizers of the Patriot Prayer rally have specifically said its aim is to promote peace, love and unity, and that racists are not welcome.Remember, in the aftermath of Charlottesville, the mainstream media relentlessly attacked Trump for saying both sides were responsible for violence, tacitly endorsing the violent alt-left.CNN even changed a headline at the request of Antifa to disguise the fact that the group routinely engages in violence.Given that the mainstream media has emboldened unhinged thugs by exalting them as anti-fascists, any violence that occurs at the Patriot Prayer rally will be their responsibility.
Did you acknowledge that the leader of the free world — by title, anyway — had shown himself to be a white supremacist, casually expressing his dislike of brown-skinned immigrants and preference for white European immigrants?Did you denounce the comments, as Rep. Mia Love, a Utah Republican whose parents came to America from Haiti, did, saying in a statement: This behavior is unacceptable from the leader of our nation.Did you scream something about identity politics and try to pretend that this is the fault of others, not the fault of the transparently racist old man in the White House?Did you tamp down memories of his calls for the execution of the Central Park Five, even after the young men, four black and one Latino, were found innocent?Did you explain away what Trump was implying in this tweet from 2013: According to Bill OReilly, 80% of all the shootings in New York City are blacks-if you add Hispanics, that figure goes to 98%.What did you say when our president called other countries shitholes and you had to shield your children’s ears from profanity on the nightly news?And if you stayed silent, if you made excuses, if you tried to fool yourself into believing this is appropriate presidential behavior, if you let it slide because this presidency might somehow line your pocketbook, then you will be remembered as complicit, as one who stood by and let America’s decency get dragged through the mud.And if you laughed, or if you smiled, or if you nodded your head in agreement, you will be remembered just as Trump will: as a racist, a fool and an absolute embarrassment.
"Day One" is a multi-part series in which CBS News Margaret Brennan speaks with former U.S. government officials on the major foreign policy issues the next president will inherit on the first day of their presidency.Look, the best-case scenario would be to have Assad step down, to have a transitional government be able to establish itself representing each of the factions that are there -- the Sunnis, the Kurds, the Shias.And then, frankly, have the Russians and whatever is left of the Syrian forces join with the United States in going after ISIS to truly defeat them.That refugees continue to flow out of Syria, that the Russians continue to have a presence there and continue to attack our moderate forces that were trying to train in Syria.PANETTA: I think the likelihood is that the next president is gonna have to consider adding additional special forces on the ground to try to assist those moderate forces that are taking on ISIS, and that are taking on Assads forces.And when were dealing with the Russians who go in and literally bomb the very forces that were training to go after Assad and to go after ISIS.Theyre not gonna do the right thing without giving our diplomats greater leverage than what they have now to deal with the Russians.To do that we have got to make very clear that we have objectives to achieve, that we intend to press to achieve those objectives, and that we will not allow them to divert us from the goals of defending ourselves.
The world Is watching and so is oil as the death toll rises in the streets of Iran, where the people revolt against a terrible economy and the lack of any real freedoms and rights.Many arrests have been made and the government of Iran says it may seek the death penalty, for what they say are crimes against God, in demonstrations that have gone on for over 5 days in a row.Bad data is becoming a bigger risk as underinvestment has led to the least amount of oil discoveries in 70 years and the global oil replenishment rate ratio fell to 11 percent this year, down from more than 50 percent in 2012 according to a new report.In ten years’ time, U.S. shale production may peak, at least according to OPEC that sees shale peaking after 2025, although the cartel has conceded that U.S. tight oil has defied previous forecasts and has increased production more than initially expected and will continue to do so in the short-term.What worries analysts the most is the fact that this year the reserve replacement ratio–the amount of discovered resources relative to the amount of production–was a mere 11 percent, compared to 50 percent in 2012, Sonia Mladá Passos, Senior Analyst at Rystad Energy, said.In recent months, Ramirez has grown increasingly critical of Maduro’s handling of a fourth straight year of recession that has triggered malnutrition, widespread food and medicine shortages, the world’s steepest inflation, and a surge in emigration.Their accuracy or completeness is not guaranteed and the giving of the same is not to be deemed as an offer or solicitation on our part with respect to the sale or purchase of any securities or futures.Any decision to purchase or sell as a result of the opinions expressed in this report will be the full responsibility of the person authorizing such transaction.
Anonymous have denied claims that they hacked the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, after a post appeared claiming that the hacktivist group was now in control of the site.A post titled ‘END OF HATE: ANONYMOUS NOW IN CONTROL OF DAILY STORMER’ appeared on the far-right site earlier this morning, suggesting that Anonymous were going to bring an end to The Daily Stormer following the events of the Charlottesville Unite The Right rally, which saw white nationalists converge to protest plans to remove a Confederate statue.The rally led to multiple conflicts between the nationalists and counter-protesters, ultimately leading to the death of civil rights activist Heather Heyer, who was one of many hit by a vehicle driven by white supremacist James Alex Fields.Many outlets reported that Anonymous had infiltrated The Daily Stormer website in response to the events of Charlottesville, with the post on the site reading: WE HAVE TAKEN THIS SITE IN THE NAME OF HEATHER HEYER A VICTIM OF WHITE SUPREMACIST TERRORISM.However, Anonymous have stated that they believe the post was made by The Daily Stormer in a stunt designed to woo their clueless base.The clarifications were made by @YourAnonNews, the largest Anonymous Twitter account, who believe that The Daily Stormer had made the post themselves in order to explain away technical issues the site was experiencing, after web hosting company GoDaddy had banned them from using the service.— Anonymous (@YourAnonNews) August 14, 2017 And all the old content is left up by a "UNITED FORCE OF ELITE HACKERS" on a shit post site "UNDER THE CONTROL OF ANONYMOUS."The post suggesting Anonymous were now in control of the site also stated that The Daily Stormer would be taken offline within 24 hours, suggesting that its creators are looking for a conspiratorial explanation as to why the site has disappeared if GoDaddy removes it from the internet.
Channel 4 have been accused of brownfacing in a row over a documentary showing a white woman disguised as a Muslim complete with darkened skin.The show documents Ms Freemans experiences in Manchester in the week after a terror attack at the citys arena that killed 22 people.Described as an attempt to challenge stereotypes, the show aimed to give the the 44-year-old a "chance to meaningfully walk in the shoes of someone from a different background."Katie Freeman starred in the documentary (Channel 4) However, when a trailer for the show aired on Tuesday, viewers took to social media to slam the nature of Ms Freemans disguise.Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to put prosthetics on somebody to make them a caricature of people of a different race (as if being white and Muslim are exclusive anyway)?Before Ms Freeman underwent the transformation, she admitted she would avoid sitting next to a Muslim on public transport because "you see them and think theyre going to blow something up", the Daily Mail reported.She later said she was shocked by the level of abuse she suffered in the course of the programme.The shows executive producer, Fozia Khan, defended the programme, told the Daily Mail: "The programme allowed Katie to meaningfully walk in the shoes of someone from a different background and to experience what it is like to be a part of the British Pakistani Muslim community rather than just observe as an outsider."
Are you tired of Liberals and lawmakers trying to undermine our Constitutional right to keep and bear arms?They preach that we need more and more gun control every single time there is some sort of mass shooting, even though the mass shootings are nearly always a crazed Democrat.The gun used by Stephen Paddock in the Las Vegas massacre on Sunday was already an illegal gun!As Sean Davis explains at the Federalist automatic weapons (or machine guns) are already banned or almost unattainable under existing federal law.Thirdly, Paddock would have had to have done a lot of work beforehand to prepare for this unspeakable act.Finally, Ben Shapiro of the Daily Wire explains that making policy on the heels of a terrible event is usually a bad idea.Gun control laws remove guns from law abiding citizens, so that they can no longer defend themselves, and emboldens criminals, who won’t follow the laws anyway.The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com
For the first time ever today two junkboxes messaged the Turtleboy business page to ask if we had Xanax for sale.One of them was Jessica Kane, who according to her Facebook page lives in Pawtucket, but she insists she lives in Smithfield, RI.As you can see she is alleging that we are the ones who solicited her to see if she wanted to buy drugs off us.She just forgot that in the very blog she was commenting on anyone could clearly see that she was the one who initiated contact: Oops!turtle riders are savage) Next up in the ratchet script was the threat to call the cops: So if you’re keeping score at home, this woman approached us about buying drugs, admitted to the cops that she did so, and the cops responded by turning their focus on cyberbullying.Last year she made headlines when she was getting her biweekly free ambulance ride to the ER when she claimed she was abused by one of the first responders.They noted that Kane was difficult to deal with, writing that, Jessica was yelling and screaming in the middle of the road and was extremely belligerent.That’s when she said she found the video she recorded in the ambulance in her iPhone’s Recently Deleted folder.In August we blogged about this Lawrence ghettopoon selling Xanax on Facebook: Evidently Jessica Kane read the headline of this blog, assumed that we were the ones selling zannies, waited until she got her check on the first of the month, and then hit us up for the hookup.
The Aspiring Ashanti Regional Chairman of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) Alhaji Mohammed Sani has called on the founder of Liberal Party of Ghana (LPG) Kofi Akpaloo to publicly apologise to Northerners in Ghana for saying they can never be Presidents.Mr Akpaloo in a recent interview with Abusua Nkommo hosted by Kwame Adinkra said ‘no Ghanaian will vote for a Northerner to be a President of Ghana’ after the abysmal performance by the former President John Dramani Mahama in the 2016 elections.According to Akpaloo, Northerners who were given the nod to lead the country failed Ghanaians and that Ghanaians will not vote for Northerners in 2020 elections.But speaking on Abusua Nkommo with Kwame Adinkra, Alhaji Sani described as ‘misguided missile’ the tribal comment by Mr Akpaloo that Northerners cannot be in the helm of affairs of the country.He advised the founder of Liberal Party of Ghana to retract his statement warning to retaliate in equal measure if he fails to do so.‘…This is a misguided missile by Akpaloo, his comment is an insult to Northerners, what research has he conducted to come out with such comment.What kind of language is that, he should stop insulting a group of people, is he important than other people.‘He should withdraw and apologise, I am highly offended by his comment, if he refuses, I will be forced to wage war words against him,’ he stated.
Donald Trump will address the nation from New York City this evening as the president elect of the United States.The Trump campaign has been holding its election night party all night at the New York Hilton Midtown, with the festivities beginning at 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time.Trump’s supporters have become more and more energized as the hours have ticked on, and Trump will take the stage to address them soon.Donald Trump went into this election night being seen as having no real shot at the White House, with many Democrats not even expecting the race to be remotely close.Trump has pulled off what will likely go down as the most shocking political upset in history, and the election result proved nearly every single poll and electoral projection wrong.After all, when he was asked during the presidential debate whether he would concede to Hillary Clinton if he loses, Trump refused to commit to doing so, saying, I’ll keep you in suspense seemingly because part of him doubted he could pull this thing off.Hillary Clinton is also expected to speak from the Javits Center in New York City, although many of her supporters have already left the arena in tears.Read more about Donald Trump and Melania in Spanish at AhoraMismo.com: Join over 240,0 people who get the most important news stories and the best shopping deals from Heavy – Delivered right to your inbox.
Rush Limbaugh agreed by positing another reason: The only reason we’re even talking about global warming — well, the real only reason — is its part of the left’s agenda of expanding government worldwide, raising taxes worldwide, and a key ingredient of this is blaming average citizens for the problem.The claims from the liberal agenda of these organizations are so outlandish that it wouldn’t be surprising for them to throw in some type of zombie apocalypse.Neuman points this out: the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has acted as the main scaremonger for the global warming lobby that led to the Kyoto Protocol.Regardless of the causes of these variations, the planet’s ecosystems have been adapting since the beginning of time.As one of the senior analysts of the office, I took no real part in the discussions.I read that there was a swordfish in the Smithsonian that was over 150 years old, and that a group of global warming advocates would have conclusive proof of the effects of industrial man if the tissue in the swordfish was significantly different from fish of today.When I was living in the D.C. area, one of the stations was particularly proud of their new Doppler radar that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.The other stations predicted the weather just as well without the radar, one station even used an old wooden yardstick to show the depth of the snow.
Frank; VanityFair: With Donald Trump busy spreading havoc around the world—most recently tweeting about James Comey’s testimony, or feeding into the crisis over Qatar—it’s reasonable to ask who can be bothered to gripe about Hillary Clinton.Or maybe one doesn’t, but in a two-party system there’s only one alternative to the party of Trump, and the role of Clinton in that party is therefore important.Hillary has been making high-profile public appearances and started talking frankly about her distaste for Trump and her dismay over the people and things that cost her the election.(On the occasions that I’ve had an inside view of something in the glare of the press, those with the darkest take on it have usually been wrong.)By Brian Brinker; OpsLens: Now that Hillary Clinton is making her way back into the public spotlight, we’re starting to hear a lot more about who’s to blame for her loss.So too are members of her campaign staff, pollsters, The New York Times, supporters who didn’t show up at the polls, James Comey, Putin and the Russians, and various others.Still, it wasn’t sexism that inspired Hillary to ignore voters in Michigan and Wisconsin and to jet set out to California to meet with rich donors.She can’t pour a beer, she hasn’t driven a car in years, and she always seemed to struggle to relate to people directly.
General Issam Zahreddine in Deir Ezzor BEIRUT, LEBANON (4:50 P.M.) – The battle for Al-Mayadeen proved to be a decisive victory for the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) and their allies, as they were able to successfully uproot the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) from this large city in the Deir Ezzor Governorate.For ISIS, their defeat at Al-Mayadeen could not come at a worse time, as their battlefield woes in Al-Raqqa and central Syria have handicapped their remaining forces inside the country.On Sunday, Syrian news channels posted several videos showing the aftermath of the Al-Mayadeen battle and the recently liberated areas surrounding the city.The footage showed scores of dead ISIS terrorists and a large number of armored vehicles that were destroyed by the Syrian Arab Army during their one week long offensive.Gone.With Al-Mayadeen liberated, the Syrian Army will now turn their attention to the provincial capital and Al-‘Umar Oil Fields in order to expel the Islamic Sate from more areas in Syria.
rally wore Trump T-shirts and hats, posed for pictures with Trump signs and waved Trump flags to show their support for the president’s agenda.We are here to support and endorse what he has been doing for the military and the economy, said Sajid Tarar, a Muslim immigrant from Pakistan and founder of Muslim Americans for Trump.And the rally was held the same day as marches with speakers expected to be critical of the president were staged across the country in support of racial justice.The rally, co-sponsored by Muslim Americans for Trump and Sikh Americans for Trump, was intended to bring together minority communities not typically associated with Trump’s largely white base and demonstrate support for Trump’s ideas.Tarar has been a vocal Trump supporter from early on; he prayed onstage at the Republican National Convention and spoke favor of the then-candidate.He said Trump’s travel ban, which originally blocked immigrants from Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Sudan, isn’t a ban at all but a pause, to ensure thorough vetting of the people from these countries.But the bus that dropped him off in 1986 is the bus that he is still taking today, adding that the more impressive airports are now the ones in his home country of India.Garcia-Hidalgo spoke of a booming economy, a low unemployment rate and a strong stock market, and defended Trump’s response to the devastation to Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.
And so First Lady Michelle Obama captured the sentiments of a majority of Americans during an emotional stump speech for Hillary Clinton on Thursday afternoon that lambasted Republican nominee Donald Trumps repeated demeaning and derogatory treatment of women.Speaking before a crowd in Manchester, New Hampshire, Mrs. Obama stated that the leaked Access Hollywood video of Trump bragging about groping, kissing, and trying to have sex with women has "shaken [her] to [her] core."Though Trump has repeatedly claimed the "locker room talk" defense since the tape leaked last Friday, numerous women have since come forward to report their own sexual assaults at the hands of Donald Trump—meaning that this wasnt just talk, it was predatory action.Like millions of Americans, Mrs. Obama, felt shock and outrage over Trumps behavior, and could not believe that there are still people in this country who view women with such little regard, let alone the fact that one of them is trying to become the next president of the United States.Asserting that Trump is in no way qualified for the executive branch or be a role model for children who look up to the president, the first lady then praised Hillary Clinton for her longstanding commitment to public service (even saying that she has more experience than both "Barack or Bill"), before declaring that the former secretary of state would be the only candidate who could unite the country and guide the American public with strength and compassion.Making a call to undecided voters, Mrs. Obama urged them not to cast a protest vote or sit the election out entirely, saying that doing so would only help clear a path for Trump to the White House.Though that figure might have seemed like a definitive win for the incumbent president, it broke down to a total of just 66 votes per precinct—or, dozens of votes that could make or break a candidates victory.Mrs. Obama invited all women to take this power seriously and use it to elect a candidate who has not only been a pillar of support for women, but would teach Americas children that any kind of degrading, hateful rhetoric is wholly unacceptable.
WASHINGTON — Former undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson is looking to crowdfund enough money to buy Twitter so President Donald Trump can’t use it.Wilson launched the fundraiser last week, tweeting: If @Twitter executives won’t shut down Trump’s violence and hate, then it’s up to us.The GoFundMe page for the fundraiser says Trump’s tweets damage the country and put people in harm’s way.As of Wednesday morning, she had raised less than $6,0 of the billion-dollar goal.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders calls the fundraiser a ridiculous attempt to shut down the president’s First Amendment rights.Wilson’s identity as a CIA operative was leaked by an official in former President George W. Bush’s administration in 2003.If @Twitter executives won’t shut down Trump’s violence and hate, then it’s up to us.#BuyTwitter #BanTrump — Valerie Plame Wilson (@ValeriePlame) August 18, 2017
protected by reCAPTCHA Privacy - Terms Privacy - Terms The FBI issued the warning because kidnappers have widened their pool of potential victims by no longer targeting only specific individuals and Spanish speakers.In a recent investigation, the FBI found that more than 80 people have fallen victim to the new tactics in California, Minnesota, Idaho and Texas.An FBI spokeswoman for the Kansas City offices said she was not aware of any instances that have occurred in Kansas or Missouri where the FBI was involved.The scam works this way: The potential victim answers a call and hears a woman screaming, Help me!The victim might blurt out a name, like Mary, asking her if she’s OK. At that point, the caller will tell the victim that Mary has been kidnapped and she will be harmed if ransom isn’t paid quickly.The amount is typically less than $2,0 because of legal restrictions for wiring larger amounts across the border, the FBI said.The charges are the first federal indictment in a virtual kidnapping case, the FBI said.Robert A.

This, of course, was in response to that pathetic performance in the wake of the tragedy in Charlottesville, Va., when he suggested moral equivalence between white supremacists and those who protest them.The reference is not to the shellacking he took from pundits or the reprovals of GOP leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan.But you did not expect the Chairman and CEO of Merck to quit the president’s American Manufacturing Council.Members of the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities also resigned en masse.The Washington Post listed the Salvation Army, the American Red Cross, Susan G. Komen and the American Cancer Society among those who have chosen to hold their galas elsewhere.Bob Corker, a respected Republican senator who has heretofore sought to engage with the president, raised sharp questions not just about Trump’s competence, but also his stability, and called for radical changes in the White House.And it was announced that the president would not be attending the Kennedy Center Honors in December, nor host the traditional White House reception for the five honorees after three of them had spoken of boycotting the event.A president uses what Theodore Roosevelt called the bully pulpit — the honor and prestige of his office — to stand for what is right and remind us to do likewise.
After the violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, over a Confederate monument, internet companies are making it difficult for white supremacist groups to organize online.Neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer was booted from web host GoDaddy after the rally.The Daily Stormer then tried to move to Google and then a Russian domain, but both hosts rejected the site.SEE MORE: Phoenixs Mayor Wants President Trump To Delay A Rally In The City White supremacists arent being allowed to express themselves through song, either.This was a trend before the "Unite the Right" rally even started.Airbnb deleted accounts of users it suspected were trying to book rooms in Charlottesville before the event.White supremacists arent just being blocked from posting on the internet.Crowd-funding sites like Patreon and GoFundMe blocked the accounts of alt-right figures and groups, forcing some to use a knockoff called Hatreon.
The Veterans Recognition Foundation built Veterans Park in Longview, Texas to serve as a thank you for the work of veterans in all branches of the military and as a reminder of their sacrifice.Unfortunately, something happened earlier this week in the park that has deeply upset many veterans and visitors.The Longview News-Journal reports that the statue of the Unknown Solider has been destroyed.Air Force veteran David Applewhite posted a photo to Facebook saying, One of the statues guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier monument has been pushed over by vandals at the Veterans Plaza in Longview!Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any news on who could have ruined the statue, nor if this was definitely an act of vandalism.Some are speculating that it could have been the result of a structural failure in a weak part of the sculpture.Several Longview residents are expressing their anger on social media, calling for all kinds of punishments for the vandals.The Veterans Plaza website has a  support page where they accept donations to rebuild what was lost.
Despite what youve been reading about the far rights consternation with Bruce Rauner over his ostensible support for abortion in Illinois, I think its been a pretty good month for the governor.It looks like he may be able to put together the band of rabid right-wingers and abortion-rights moderates who helped elect him in the first place.Backed by many pro-choice moderates in DuPage County, the North Shore, and the Gold Coast, Rauner edged out Quinn and promptly went to work bankrupting public education by vetoing the budget.Over the summer he made a real show of inviting various pro-choice women to his office to explain to him how important it was to pass HB40.And then on September 28, he signed it, making a big deal about it, like he was King Solomon making a wrenching decision as opposed to a lifelong abortion supporter doing what hed promised to do four years ago.Even if the strategy fails and he doesnt win reelection, Rauners in a perfect position to achieve his great dream of damaging, if not destroying, public unions in Illinois thanks to the Janus case.Mark Janus is a state employee who argues that his First Amendment rights are being violated because state law requires him to contribute a "fair share" portion of his paycheck to the union that represents him—in this case, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.Janus is being represented by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, a union-busting outfit thats financially supported by the Koch brothers, the Walton Family Foundation, and other stalwarts of the far right.
Images FBI Labels Black Identity Extremists As Threat To Police This is how it starts.Everyone needs to pay attention because one day we might look back at this moment as a pivotal moment when the federal government reinvigorated a campaign against Black protesters and activists.According to ForeignPolicy, the FBI’s counterterrorism unit is warning that black identity extremists are a major threat to law enforcement officers.Peep the langage used here: The FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist (BIE) perceptions of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence, Perceptions.Perceptions of police brutality against African Americans…ain’t no perceptions, b!tc#!Our collective response to the police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson is the catalyst for the Black boogie men who are taking aim at cops if you let them tell it: The FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement, Again, alleged.Something that the President didn’t do when addressing the tiki-torchers in Charlottesville.You know what America does when they perceive a group of people to be terrorists…at least when they’re Black or brown.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 97 people after raiding a Tennessee meat processing plant, in what civil rights activists say was the largest crackdown at a single place in almost a decade.ICE spokeswoman Tammy Spicer announced the raid in a statement on Friday and said that of the 97 people taken into custody from Southeastern Provision meat processing plant in eastern Tennessee, 11 people were arrested on criminal charges, 54 were placed in detention and 32 were released.She said they were all arrested on suspicion of being in the country illegally.The National Immigration Law Center said it believes this was the largest single-workplace raid since George W. Bush was president, the Washington Post reported.Federal immigration officials did not confirm if it was the largest.This was the latest crackdown on illegal immigrants by the Trump administration after he announced last year that ICE agents would be targeting employers that choose to hire immigrants knowing they are illegal.A total of 21 people were arrested after immigration agents raided 7-11 stores nationwide in January.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Image via SAUL /Getty Images Trump has told sources that he expects to appoint three more Supreme Court Justices before the end of his first term, Axios reports.Trump believes that Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, who​ is 81 years old, will soon be out."Sotomayor," Trump said, referring to the relatively recently-appointed Obama justice, whose name is rarely, if ever, mentioned in speculation about the next justice to be replaced."No good.Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 84 years old, while Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor is just 63 years old.Sotomayor, who was appointed by President Obama, is the first Latina to serve on the Supreme Court.Ironically, Trump is the oldest person to be elected president in U.S. history.One source is quoted as saying, "its all about the numbers for him," which is not surprising because we are talking about a man who constantly bragsabout numbers, whether it be rating numbers, the size of the crowd at his inauguration or crowds for his rallies in general.
These are the kids the left-wing media has promoted because of their demands for gun control, since the mass shooting in Parkland that killed 17.The left embraced the creation of the Brady Center to Prevent Handgun Violence after its creation in the 1980s.Ignoring the fact that it is one of the preferred tools of tyrants, gun control simply does not work.The issue for Americans is not simply the removal of the right to bear arms.Thomas Jefferson wrote in the draft of the Virginia Constitution, No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.One of the fundamental rights that any free man or woman has is the right to self-defense.In 1783, William Pitt spoke in the House of Commons and said, Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom.It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves.
An unattended package near the north fence of the White House was cleared by the Secret Service and Metropolitan Police Tuesday afternoon.The White House was placed on an apparent lockdown Tuesday while President Trump was en route to Arizona for a rally in Phoenix, according to multiple reports.The Hill reported that Secret Service cleared the White House’s North Lawn and sent media members and construction workers in the area into the West Wing.The Secret Service confirmed via Twitter that it and the Washington, D.C. Police Department were responding to an unattended package near the north fence of the White House complex.Trump is reportedly heading to a campaign-style rally in Phoenix late Tuesday, an event which is also expected to draw major protests.The president will also reportedly visit a Border Patrol facility in Yuma, Arizona before Tuesday’s rally.Immigration is a major issue for Trump’s supporters, and the president campaigned extensively on the topic during last year’s White House race.Trump has long vowed to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, arguing it will reduce illegal immigration and increase America’s border security.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, FEMA said they would only give aid to victims if they had received (unspecified) vaccinations.In late August and early September 2017, false rumors began to spread on Facebook and Twitter that FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) was refusing to give aid to victims of Hurricane Harvey unless they had been vaccinated, and that the agency was forcing people to undergo vaccinations in order to receive aid.These rumors are entirely false, and we could not find any iteration of them which provided even a fabricated source or citation.Fema is saying that Texans will have to have a vaccine shot in order to get aid are you paying attention.A search of FEMA’s press releases, Facebook account and Twitter account shows that the agency has not said any such thing.Not only that, but a FEMA spokesperson definitively rejected the rumors in a statement sent to us: There is absolutely no requirement for Hurricane Survivors to be vaccinated in order to receive assistance from FEMA.They only need to register with FEMA for assistance.This is just the latest in a series of false claims surrounding FEMA, and forms part of the long-standing  FEMA camps conspiracy theory, which holds that the federal government is planning to build concentration camps and impose martial law in the aftermath of a natural disaster.
In one of the strangest war of words we’ve seen here at PolitiFact, President Donald Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un traded insults recently, culminating in the use of the insult "dotard."Older PolitiFact staffers informed our younger counterparts that a dotard is someone who has entered his or her dotage, and that dotage is "a state or period of senile decay marked by decline of mental poise and alertness," according to Merriam-Webster.Kim Jong Un hurled the word at Trump in response to Trump’s recent speech at the United Nations, saying that Trump’s speech was "unprecedented rude nonsense one has never heard from any of his predecessors.I’d like to advise Trump to exercise prudence in selecting words and to be considerate of whom he speaks to when making a speech in front of the world."Later in the statement, Kim said, "Whatever Trump might have expected, he will face results beyond his expectation.Trump responded on Twitter: "Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesnt mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!"Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesnt mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 22, 2017 Where this war of words will lead is anyone’s guess.PolitiFact recently reviewed the issues surrounding North Korea as a preview to Trump’s speech at the United Nations, and we fact-checked Trump’s speech as well.
Jerry Drake Varnell was arrested August 12 in Oklahoma City after the FBI reports he planned to detonate a bomb outside an downtown bank.(Courtesy of the Oklahoma DOC) Jerry Drake Varnell was arrested August 12 in Oklahoma City after the FBI reports he planned to detonate a bomb outside an downtown bank.(Courtesy of the Oklahoma DOC) OKLAHOMA CITY (KOKH) — An Oklahoma man has been arrested after attempting to detonate a vehicle bomb parked outside a downtown Oklahoma City bank.Court documents show that the FBI learned of Varnells plot in December 2016 after being notified by a confidential informant of his plot to "bomb the Federal Reserve Building in Washington D.C. in a manner similar to the Oklahoma City Bombing."The DOJ reports that Varnell continued to advance his plans to build a device and had a statement ready to be posted to social media following the explosion.All of the items used to construct the bomb were inert and provided by the undercover employee.United States Attorney Mark Yancey and FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Raul Bujanda spoke to the media Monday to discuss the arrest.We take comfort and our company embraces a deep appreciation and admiration for the men and women of the FBI for their diligent and dedicated work in protecting our nation.
Noting that Republican senators such as Jeff Flake (Arizona), John McCain (Arizona), and Thom Tillis (North Carolina) delight in making rounds on the news talk shows to criticize Trump, Ingraham pointed out their own plunging approval numbers as the American voters wait for them to fulfill their campaign promises.No, it’s not ISIS and it’s not a 5,0-point [drop] in the Dow, but a successful Trump presidency, Ingraham said.And despite the hyperventilation and alarmism we’re hearing from the national press corps — they’re prematurely declaring the Trump administration a failure, of course — but in fact, it’s the resistance to Trump that is playing a risky gambit.Chuck Schumer’s is 26 percent, and [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell’s is a very impressive 17 percent, Ingraham said, noting that McConnell has failed repeatedly to rally 50 of 52 GOP senators in support of various measures to repeal and replace Obamacare.Now while of course it’s true that key legislative successes are lacking, whether on health care, tax reform, infrastructure — but it’s equally true as well that President Trump has done a lot even without Congress to make our lives better.Pointing to the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s slashing of Obama-era red-tape and regulations, the thriving stock market, consumer confidence and more, Ingraham said that Trump’s presidency hasn’t been the failure that the media, the Left and the Never-Trumpers are making it out to be.But considering the 24/7 media onslaught against him, the distraction of the Russia probe, and the resistance from Congress — both sides in Congress — he’s done a heck of a lot in just 200 days, she said.And if he can keep focused and he can keep his team motivated, keep them together, and put pressure on the Hill to deliver on some of these big issues, he’ll improve his numbers and he’ll grow the populist movement.
Donald Trump was speaking at an NRA rally (Niall ) Donald Trump has defended the use of guns in America by comparing a London hospital to a war zone because of knife crime.Speaking at a pro-gun rally, the US president claimed that knife crime in London is so bad that one unnamed hospital in the capital is like a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds with blood all over the floors.He told the National Rifle Convention (NRA) in Dallas: I recently read a story that in London, which has unbelievably tough gun laws, a once very prestigious hospital right in the middle is like a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds.We believe that our liberty is a gift from our creator, and that no Government can ever take it away.We believe in the rule of law - and we support the men and women of law enforcement.The one thing that has always stood between the American people and the elimination of our Second Amendment rights has been Conservatives and congress willing to fight for those rights, and we’re fighting.The terrorists would have fled or been shot and it would have been a whole different story, he said.The 2015 attack left 130 dead after terrorists carried out a series of suicide bombs and mass shootings in the French capital.
Screen Shot 2015-12-01 at 10.29.56 AM Obviously the big story of the day is the massacre that occurred in Las Vegas last night at a Country Music concert, where at least 50 people were killed by a man from a 32nd floor hotel room at Mandalay Bay casino.Here’s his initial reaction to the mass shooting: He might not have finished his GED, but he basically sees the world the same exact way 99% of employees at CNN do – everything is Trump’s fault.He was just getting started though: But he’s one of the good guys because he admits to donating his profits from drug transactions towards disaster relief: Oh yea, he’s a winner.He even rocks the Chicago Bulls winter hat when he’s pouring out some Henny for the homeys in the January: Easy on the Henny Allen – it’s not good for your bowels: I know when I die I want people to come to my headstone and drink copious amounts of Red Bull and Henny, the nectar of the hoodrats.He really misses his boy, who I’m sure lived a noble and worthwhile life, because now that Sito isn’t around, he doesn’t have anyone to come scoop him up to he can turn up on these fuck n words: You can also find Allen Lozada on Deadbeatdirectory.com, with his own profile: Oh good, he’s a cokehead deadbeat dad, who allegedly threatened to choke his baby until she turned blue.Especially considering his overall philosophy on women: When he eventually gets killed by a cop and SJWs pretend like his death is an actual loss to the community, he wants you to commemorate him by burning Hartford to the ground: He’s very familiar with the inside of a courthouse: He lives the good life by cashing in his SSI check for stays at the Marriott: Last year things were beginning to look up for Allen.He was trying to stay out of the police logs, and gave himself one Internet cookie for going a full month without stabbing, shooting, or running over someone with a car: He gets another Internet cookie for going four days sober: And he’s going legit because the feds out here snatching everybody: Also this: I have no idea what that means, but it sounds important.Either way, Allen Lozada is a useless sack of gutterpubes, and the 50+ who died in Las Vegas are much, much bigger losses to society than he could ever be.

Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, at a Women for Hillary event at West Los Angeles College on June 3, 2016, in Culver City, Calif. An article by the Daily Caller says Abedin forwarded some government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009, when Clinton was secretary of state.[Irfan Khan | Los Angeles Times via TNS] WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump made his first "Crooked Hillary" Twitter post less than 48 hours into the new year Tuesday, accusing a former Clinton aide of "disregarding basic security protocols," and calling his own Justice Department a "deep state."Also on Comey &amp; others" Attacking his former Democratic opponent from the 2016 presidential election and taking aim at his own Justice Department struck familiar tones for the new year.The article said Abedin forwarded some government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009, when Clinton was secretary of state.The emails were found on the laptop of Abedin’s now estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, and were released as part of a public records request.James Comey, the former FBI director, had notified Congress shortly before the 2016 election about the existence of newly discovered emails that could be relevant to the closed investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state.In his Twitter post, Trump also referred to the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine.According to a report in Fox News, the sailor had hoped to receive a pardon from the president, but has not.
Ever since last week’s High Court judgment threw a spanner in the works of the Government’s plan to use the Royal Prerogative to trigger Article 50 there have been all sorts of rumours and suggestions as to how the Government is going to deliver Brexit.Another suggestion is to bring forward a Bill that specifically rejects the High Court’s ruling and hands the Government the power to act alone.Back in February, when he was setting out to MPs the details of the pathetic deal he had negotiated with the EU, Mr Cameron made clear what he thought would and should happen if we voted for Brexit: If the British people vote to leave there is only one way to bring that about, namely to trigger Article 50 of the treaties and begin the process of exit and the British people would rightly expect that to start straightaway.Mr Davis confirmed that Mrs May has already said she will appeal to the Supreme Court But Mr Cameron was clearly right that the British people would expect the process to have started straightaway.With hindsight it is surely now clear to everyone who isn’t plotting to stop Brexit – and was clear after the referendum to many of us – that Mrs May should have done what Mr Cameron said would happen and triggered Article 50 as soon as she entered Downing Street.Instead of politics being consumed with questions of procedure and timing – almost all of which are fig leaves pushed by Remainers who don’t want us to leave – and instead of the Remainers being handed ever more time to plot how they can frustrate the will of the British people, the path would have been set and the referendum result honoured.Who will be next to leave the EU On Monday the Brexit Secretary confirmed in the Commons that the Government could introduce a one-line Bill triggering Article 50 now, bypassing any Supreme Court decision.They would in reality have no choice but to accept the result of the referendum and implement Article 50 – or risk sticking two fingers up to the very idea of a sovereign people.
Hes madly tweeted lies about his tax plan, applauded himself for single-handedly causing the stock market to rise, insulted the media, slandered old friends and condemned some of the famous men who have been fired for sexual harassment.Hes put on quite a show and all of it has further degraded the presidency and embarrassed the nation before the world.One purported to show a group of Muslims pushing a boy off a roof, another claimed to show a Muslim destroying a statue of the Virgin Mary and a third supposedly showed a Muslim immigrant hitting a Dutch boy on crutches.These anti-Muslim videos are the worst kind of hate propaganda, the kind of thing one expects to find deep in the bowels of the extremist right-wing internet.The British people overwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far right, which is the antithesis of the values that this country represents; decency, tolerance and respect.London Mayor Sadiq Khan said May should use "any influence she and her government claim to have with the president to ask that he delete these tweets and to apologize to the British people.Trumps state of mind at the moment is that following his racist instincts are what got him to the most powerful office on earth and following those instincts is the winning formula going forward.Quite likely he doesnt know who they all are either, but he obviously likes what they have to say and hes happy to use his platform of tens of millions of followers and the prestige of the White House to spread their message far and wide.

My wife [and] I were at a Hollywood function last year [and] a high level Hollywood executive came over 2 me and groped my privates.Crews added that he told everyone he knew and worked with about what happened to him.And that the executive called him the next day to apologise, but never explained his reason for the assault.He said he never took it further, as we would be "ostracized, [which is] par for the course when the predator has power and influence.Credit: PA Images "Hollywood is not the only business where this happens, and to the casualties of this behavior- you are not alone," Crews added.It comes after a number of high-profile women in Hollywood went public with claims of inappropriate behavior by film producer Weinstein, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Mira Sorvino, Asia Argento, and Rosanna Arquette.As we have previously noted at LADbible, figures released previously by the Ministry of Justice, showed that more than one in 10 victims of rape or attempted rape in the UK are male.A report published in 2015, titled Silent Suffering: Supporting The Male Survivors Of Sexual Assault, revealed that as few as 3.9% of male victims of rape and sexual assault report the crime to police.
Clinton now baselessly blames election-integrity laws for loss, media parrots By Kathryn Blackhurst, LifeZette: American Spectator Senior Editor John Fund blasted the media for refusing to cover former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s ravings claiming that voter suppression contributed to her Election Day loss, during an interview Wednesday on The Laura Ingraham Show.Pointing to the Public Interest Legal Foundation’s Monday report proving that more than 5,556 illegal voters were enrolled across 138 of Virginia’s counties and cities, Fund claimed that voter fraud is far more substantiated than Clinton’s claims.What we have is the Democrats actively trying to hide the ball on any attempt to find out if there is voter fraud, Fund continued.Fund referred to Clinton’s recent interview with New York magazine in which she insisted, I would have won had I not been subjected to the unprecedented attacks by Comey and the Russians, aided and abetted by the suppression of the vote, particularly in Wisconsin.Declaring this unsubstantiated claim to be utter nonsense, Fund noted that even liberal organizations such as the fact-checking site Snopes, Vox, and Slate have all called Hillary’s assertion that she lost because of voter suppression just a fantasy.Terry McAuliffe, Fund noted that he has desperately tried to prevent groups like the Public Interest Legal Foundation to go into voter registration rolls and try to find out who has been removed from the rolls in Virginia because they were illegally registered to vote when they obtained a driver’s license.Not the whole state, just part of it, [that] 5,500 non-citizens have been removed from the voter registration rolls in the last 5 years.The real issue, Fund insisted, is former President Barack Obama’s reluctance to investigate or illegal voting or allow others to investigate whether the country’s democratic election process had been compromised.

The mainstream media is floating rumors that Trump White House Chief of Staff John Kelly was removed from Air Force One this week and may be resigning.According to conversations with Steve Bannon John Kelly is not allowing President Trump to receive his news from conservative news outlets.Pajamas Media reported: Bloomberg White House correspondent Jennifer Jacobs reports on Twitter that Trump’s chief of staff, General John Kelly, was originally going to be on the Air Force One flight to Las Vegas but was pulled off flight at the last moment.Gen. Kelly was originally going to be on AF1 to Vegas with Trump today but was pulled off flight, Im told.WH not answering Qs about it.— Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) October 4, 2017 Although the White House initially refused to answer her questions about this rather akward move, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders eventually said that there’s nothing to read into here, explaining: He is basically always on the manifest.Sometimes he travels, and sometimes he doesn’t.An important caveat, of course, but Huckabee’s explanation did not prevent Scott Dworkin from tweeting that not one, not two, but three people have told him that this may very well be General Kelly’s last week as Trump’s chief of staff.I’ve heard from three people from different circles on the Hill that this may be John Kelly’s last week as Trump’s Chief of Staff.
President Donald Trump speaks to reporters before leaving the White House in Washington, Friday, Dec. 15, 2017, for a trip to Quantico, Va., to attend the FBI National Academy graduation ceremony."Its a shame whats happened" with the FBI, the president said as he left the White House for a speech at the FBI training academy in Quantico, Virginia.He called the agencys handling of Hillary Clintons email investigation "really disgraceful" and told reporters "were going to rebuild the FBI."Trump used the speech to promote his administrations tough-on-crime policies, delivering a stern warning to members of the international gang MS-13 that his administration will root them out and arrest them."There is extreme bias against this president with high-up members of the team there at the FBI who were investigating Hillary Clinton at the time," Gidley charged, as special counsel Robert Mueller pushes on with a probe of possible Trump campaign ties to Russia.Edits to the Comey draft appeared to soften the gravity of the bureaus finding in its 2016 investigation of Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state.Gidley said the disclosure of politically charged text messages sent by one of the agents on the Clinton case, Peter Strzok, were "eye-opening."Strzok, who was in the room as Clinton was interviewed, was later assigned to special counsel Robert Muellers team to investigate potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign.
Iran and Russia plan to destroy Western Europe, the US, and Canada by means of a new wave of millions of Syrian Sunnis fleeing to the West to escape the Shiite takeover of Syria.The brutality of Russian involvement and the cruelty of Shiite militias overcame the anti-Assad forces, the turning point occurs when in 2015, Turkey’ s Erdogan was forced by Russia to cease his aid to the rebels and ISIS.Iran has been moving Shiites from Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan to Syria for a long time in a clear attempt to change the demographic makeup of the country from the Sunni majority it had before the civil war broke out in 2011.The Alawites intend to prevent a third rebellion and the best way to do that is to change the majority of the population to Shiites instead of Sunnis.The Shiite majority in Syria will play along with Lebanon’s Hezbollah, their natural allies, and it is possible that some form of federation might be created between the two in order to push the Lebanese Christians out of the picture, persuading them to flee to other countries, leaving Lebanon to its rightful Shiite masters.I predict a process that is the exact opposite of the one the world expects to take place when peace breaks out in Syria: Instead of refugees returning to their birthplace, expect the mass flight of Sunni refugees from the region, and expect a heightened incidence of Islamist terror in the countries that allow them in.Increased economic, social and security problems in Europe and North America as a result of the rise in the number of migrants will lead to a rise in the strength of the right and the extreme right.And that is how the agreements Iran and Russia will soon coerce Syria into accepting are going to start a chain reaction increasing the number of refugees and pulling Europe down to a point of no return, without the world understanding what is going on.
President Trump responded to the Senate Republicans inability to pass a skinny version of Obamacares repeal the only way he knows how: Twitter.The bill, titled the Health Care Freedom Act, would have repealed the individual insurance mandate.GOP leaders and Vice President Mike Pence huddled with McCain, Murkowski and Collins before the vote, which was stalled for nearly an hour.A few minutes before the vote, McCain crossed the chamber to huddle with Democrats.The vote is a devastating blow for Republicans who have fought for months to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and will likely have to start the process all over again."This is clearly a disappointing moment," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said shortly after the final vote tally was called.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer admitted that the current health care law is not perfect and called for Republicans and Democrats to work together to fix the problems with Obamacare.Other memorable moments from the health care debate: Now the Senate will move on to the defense budget.
That means no thumbing through the ex-president’s correspondence on the health care fight or first drafts of his State of the Union addresses.All archivists are waiting to see how this will work, because we are all struggling with how to make things available digitally, Peggy Glowacki, a manuscripts librarian at the Richard J. Daley Library at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told the Chicago Tribune.An interesting piece of information to note is evidence surrounding Susan Rice’s role in the ‘unmasking’ probe have been moved to the future library.The documents were moved to the Obama Library and under the Presidential Records Act, Presidential records remain closed to the public for five years after an administration has left office.President of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton said Wednesday on Fox &amp; Friends that President Trump can obtain these records from the Obama Presidential Library because they are federal records.Fox &amp; Friends host Steve Doocy said that the President himself could obtain the records if he were to ask for them.Special Counsel Mueller, if he decides to actually investigate real crimes like the unmasking, the illicit surveillance, the leaking–he could get them if he issued subpoenas.There are options to get these records and they need to be taken because there could be elements of the records in the other agencies, but these are key White House records about what the White House was up to and that to me is as important as anything else.
New applications will be halted for President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which has provided nearly 800,0 young immigrants a reprieve from deportation and the ability to work legally in the U.S. in the form of two-year, renewable work permits.Here’s the statement by Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger: The decision by the Trump Administration to rescind DACA is discriminatory, harmful and sets our country back.These young people deserve every opportunity to continue living, working, and thriving in the United States – for nearly all of them the U.S. is the only country they have ever known.Cummins stands in full support of Dreamers and we ask Congress to take immediate action to pass the Dream Act or find a permanent legislative solution to support these young people before anyone is affected by this decision.We hope that Americans speak out and make it clear to Congress and the President that we stand with the Dreamers.#DefendDACA — Cummins Inc. (@Cummins) September 2, 2017 Cummins currently employs approximately 55,400 people worldwide and serves customers in approximately 190 countries and territories through a network of approximately 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 7,400 dealer locations.In an announcement about the rally, organizers said President Donald Trump is planning to rescind the executive order known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).DACA protects from deportation young undocumented immigrants (known as Dreamers) who were brought to the United States as children by their parents, the announcement states.

An online fundraiser for the family of Heather Heyer, who was killed in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday when a car plowed through a group of counterprotesters, has raised nearly $225,0 -- exceeding by more than four times its original goal.The family is aware of this and is in complete charge of when and where the funds will be released.The banner image on Heyer’s Facebook page spoke of civic engagement: President Donald Trump addressed Heyer’s death via Twitter without naming her, writing: Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia.First person piece: ‘ This is not my Charlottesville’ Authorities arrested James Alex Fields, 20, of Ohio, and charged him with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death.JUST IN: Booking photo of James Alex Fields, Jr. @NBC29 pic.twitter.com/9nxtsvqNmt — Henry Graff (@HenryGraff) August 13, 2017 In a statement on Saturday, Trump blamed many sides for inciting the violence -- an equivocation that’s drawn criticism from across the political spectrum.Here are comments from Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer, U.S. Sen.

Thursdays New York Times features accounts by two women who say Donald Trump made unwanted sexual advances.The Trump campaign called the article "fiction," and his lawyer demanded the paper retract its story and issue an apology.Michael Barbaro, New York Times national political reporter and host of the Run-Up podcast, and reporter Megan Twohey join "CBS This Morning" to discuss their article.
The Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley (R-IA) is asking the FBI questions in what he describes as an alarming development about the debunked Trump dossier.Senator Chuck Grassley sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray last week asking if there is a possibility that the contents of the dossier were surreptitiously funneled from foreign intelligence agencies to U.S. intelligence agencies essentially creating an echo of reporting information from the dossier.As previously reported, a third deadline passed for the FBI and Justice Department to hand over subpoenaed documents to the House Intelligence Committee relating to the debunked Russian dossier on September 22nd.What we do know is that Comey cited this dossier in some of his briefings: FBI Director James Comey has cited the dossier in some of his briefings with lawmakers in recent weeks as one of the information sources used by his bureau to bolster its probe, U.S. officials briefed on the investigation told CNN.Via Paul Sperry of the New York Post: A secretive Washington firm that commissioned the dubious intelligence dossier on Donald Trump is stonewalling congressional investigators trying to learn more about its connections to the Democratic Party.Zerohedge reports: CNN reports that Nunes earlier this month issued subpoenas to the founders of Fusion GPS, the Washington opposition research firm that originally helped procure the dossier, demanding that they participate in public hearings before the House Intelligence Committee, and turn over all pertinent documents.Earlier this year, Nunes announced that he was stepping aside from directing the committee’s Russia inquiry when he became the subject of an ethics investigation into his handling of classified information after he informed the White House about the possibility that members of the Trump campaign were legally surveilled during the race before informing his own committee.[…] Nunes’ Democratic colleagues have repeatedly accused Nunes of deliberately trying to undermine the FBI’s investigation by forcing the agency to reveal sensitive details about the dossier that the intelligence community previously decided to withhold from the January report on the intelligence community’s finding that Russia had interfered with the election.
Stephen Paddock has been identified as the sole suspect in the Las Vegas concert shooting that took place on Sunday night.Police say that Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort &amp; Casino, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more.Just about 12 hours following the attack, the Associated Press reported that ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, adding that Paddock converted to Islam months ago.— The Associated Press (@AP) October 2, 2017 The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the mass shooting in Las Vegas, saying that the perpetrator was ‘a soldier’ who had converted to Islam months ago, without providing any evidence to support the claim… It did not name the suspected shooter…but said he had ‘executed the operation in response to calls to target countries of the coalition’ batting the extremist group in Iraq and Syria, reports the Associated Press.Many people are skeptical about Paddock’s involvement with the group and officials have yet to confirm or deny any ties between ISIS and Paddock.Paddock’s brother, Eric, spoke to the Daily Mail about the shooting.He told the outlet that his brother didn’t have any political or religious affiliation.Eric also clearly stated his opinion on the shooting, saying it was not a terror arrack.
Notre Dame Students Walk Out During Mike Pences Commencement Speech More Dozens of students walked out of Vice President Mike Pence’s commencement speech at the University of Notre Dame on Sunday.One student sported a rainbow cape, while a number of others who walked out in protest bore rainbow flags on their graduation caps.Pence, a former governor of Indiana, has a history of hostility toward the LGBTQ community.In his remarks at the Indiana university, the vice president criticized what he called campus safe spaces and urged students not to suppress free speech.While this institution has maintained an atmosphere of civility and open debate, far too many campuses across America have become characterized by speech codes, safe spaces, tone policing, administration-sanctioned political correctness ― all of which amounts to the suppression of free speech, he said.These practices are destructive of learning and the pursuit of knowledge.Pence is not the only political speaker who’s received a mixed welcome at the university.In 2009, then-President Barack Obama faced protests over his support for abortion rights, with some graduates choosing to skip the ceremony altogether.
Is the White House trying to pull a fast one on us by using a Melania Trump stunt double?There’s a lot to dissect here, but first things first: why would the White House need to deploy a Melania Trump stunt double?Nobody really knows the answer to that question, but it doesn’t have anyone less convinced that President Donald Trump had a Melania decoy by his side during a press conference on the White House lawn on October 13.Is he letting the world know that this isn’t Melania, and the real one’s chilling in Air Force One?Thinking about it, this isn’t the first time that he’s seemingly been confused about Melania’s whereabouts while they happen to be in the same room.During their trip to Texas to visit the victims of Hurricane Harvey, he said, Melania wanted to be here today during a press conference.Of course, the most logical answer here is that Melania was simply having a bad hair day, wore a little too much lipliner, and on impulse bought a pair of sunglasses that her friends haven’t told her don’t work yet.Let these voters tell you why they’re absolutely convinced we’ve got a bodysnatcher in the White House: HollywoodLifers, do you think the White House is using a Melania Trump stunt double?
Erin Lee Macke, 30, of Johnston, is charged with four counts of child endangerment – substantial risk, and one count of transfer of pistol or revolver to a person under 21.Tompkins said the children were left alone for 24 hours before the police department and Iowa Department of Human Services received a tip and visited the children.The children told police, Mom left them and left the country, police said."All of her sitter options fell through, and she left the kids in the care of the two 12-year-olds," Tompkins said.We have situations where parents go next door or parents may go out for the night, and while that’s not advisable either depending on the age of the children, obviously leaving the country is a totally different situation.This, where a parent has left the country and left the kids home alone, I’ve never heard of it before.Police said the 12-year-old children are staying with family and the seven- and six-year-old children are with their father.Macke is charged with one count of transfer of pistol or revolver to a person under 21 because there was a firearm within reach of the children in the home, according to police.
The Destruction of History (Image by YouTube, Channel: Lauren Southern) Permission Details DMCA As I predicted, the erasing of American history will not be limited to Confederate monuments.Last week a member of the board of trustees of the Dallas, Texas, school district recommended changing the name of James Madison High School.James Madison was the father of the US Constitution, considered by Identity Politics, the political ideology of the Democratic Party and the American /left, to be a "racist document."From a British reader comes the news that the various segments of Western society divided into victim groups by Identity Politics have divided very finely and have turned on one another.The NYT is referring to Crimea, for 300 years a Russian province with a Russian population that voted by a 97% majority to rejoin Russia when the US overthrew the Ukrainian government in a coup.My northern acquaintances believe that the South, by definition, is racist even though the cities that were the heart of the Confederacy are ruled by black mayors.The mayor of Richmond, Virginia, the capital of the Confederacy, Levar Stoney, is black.In the United States -- indeed, in the entirely of the Western world -- history has become a construction that serves not the truth but special interests.
Getty Images Hillary Clinton’s niece is turning her back on her selfish aunt — to endorse Donald Trump for president.I support Donald Trump 100 percent, Macy Smit, the daughter of Bill Clinton’s half-brother Roger Clinton, declared to RadarOnline.I have been a Democrat my entire life, but Trump is what we need right now — somebody who is going to stand up for us.I think at this point Hillary just wants it for the history books — to be the first woman president for selfish reasons, the Tampa hairstylist continued.Smit, 25, admitted she’s never met Hillary Clinton, and said that side of the family doesn’t think much of her.Something tells me the Clinton side looks at me and my mother as not good enough, but we’re hard-working, Smit told the gossip site.Roger Clinton was a deadbeat dad who dumped Smit’s mom, Martha Spivey, shortly after she became pregnant with his child, according to RadarOnline.Hillary says she’s all about family, but she’s got a niece she’s never met and never acknowledged.
They have the right, that theyre doing the right thing or that they had the right to do it, not that theyre doing the right thing.What the issue is that -- in that poll, 60 percent of Americans think that President Trump did the wrong thing by criticizing the athletes.In this country, African- Americans, no matter what we do -- when we sit in, when we freedom ride, when we kneel in, whatever it is, the initial response from the public tends to be overwhelmingly negative, because basically were kind of raining on folks parades, I dont want to hear this stuff.And I think he is made the mistake here kind of along the lines of what Van is saying by casting his view in the way that he did.There was a point just a week ago where the owners and management in the NFL were a lot closer to the position of the President by castigating the players in this way, he has driven the owners closer to the players because they -- I think been able to see that, ok, now when you have the players versus the President of the United States, you can see more clearly what the players are trying to do.The players have said Colin Kaepernick has said, his former teammate Eric Reed said in "The New York Times" this week that they chose kneeling specifically, because they wanted to do a protest in the most respectful way possible.Is that this President has had the chance to elevate and educate people to realize that just by draping yourself in the flag is not necessarily patriotism.Van, when you step back and think about all the President has said about the NFL players, and I know that -- is this a white lash against the players and the supporters that is whats resulted here?
Hamburg police officers have received £3.9 million worth of equipment to battle ISIS Officers from the BFE, Germany’s special police unit, modelled their elaborate gear at a special press conference in the city.Haenel assault rifles, heavy-duty ballistic protection helmets and body armour are items amongst the long-list of equipment that at least 70 police officers received to use in the event of a terrorist attack.According to the German news website NDR.de, the decision to equip the police force with the expensive heavy-duty equipment was due to the ongoing threat posed by Islamic State.The Survivor 1 armoured personal carrier, which will be used for anti-terror police operations, can deal with chemical, nuclear and biological warfare agents in order to protect officers inside the vehicle from exposure.Germany splashed the cash on the Hamburg’s police unit a few weeks after ISIS claimed responsibility for the stabbing of two people in Hamburg on October 16.A few days later, German police officers were called to raid refugee centres and homes in Hamburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria, Saxony and Thuringia to find suspects who were involved in organised criminal actives such as bodily harm, blackmail, illegal restraint and harassment.The heavy-duty SK4 rated protection gear can even stop a round fired from an AK-47 rifle Germany splashed the cash on the Hamburg’s police unit a few weeks after ISIS claimed responsibility for the stabbing of two people in Hamburg on October 16.The armour can deal with chemical, nuclear and biological warfare agents A few days later, German police officers were called to raid refugee centres and homes in Hamburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria, Saxony and Thuringia to find suspects who were involved in organised criminal actives such as bodily harm, blackmail, illegal restraint and harassment.
While Cruz revealed he was leaving the race as there no longer seemed to be a viable path to the White House, Ohio Governor John Kasich has not announced the end of his campaign.However, even with Kasich still in the race, Trump sits in a comfortable position to officially take the nomination if he secures the required 1,237 delegates needed to win his party.While Kasich’s camp continues to be optimistic, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton‘s campaign – which also took a blow to her campaign when Senator Bernie Sanders won Indiana – released a statement, condemning the announcement that Trump is the Republican party’s presumptive nominee.Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he’s too divisive and lacks the temperament to lead our nation and the free world.Hillary Clinton has proven that she has the strength to keep us safe in an uncertain world and a lifelong record of fighting to break down the barriers – economic and social – that hold working families back.While Trump ignored any criticism, saying during his victory speech at Trump tower, We’re going to win in November, he faced backlash from another opponent in the form anti-Trump adds that the Progressive Change Campaign Committee has released in an accelerated campaign against Trump.WATCH: Voters React to Ted Cruz Dropping Out of the Presidential Race Other opponents of the real estate mogul quickly vocalized their opinions, including former adviser to Jeb Bush Tim Miller who currently serves as the spokesman for an anti-Trump super-PAC, Our Principles PAC.Simple as that, Miller tweeted Despite lots of criticism, the presidential hopeful did find support in Sarah Palin, who has endorsed the former reality star before, but also took to Facebook sharing a video in which she calls for unity on the road to making America great again.

Apparently, condemning the NFLs kneeling protests of the national anthem is a step too far for CNN commentator Keith Boykin.He believes that, because of President Trumps tweeting, he sees an anti African-American trend -- that Trump is a racist puppet master, attempting to pull the strings on the black community.Boykin said, "We have a white supremacist president of the United States.Hes encouraging white supremacists."And the CNN host even called him out for saying that, questioning whether he could back up that statement.But, then he said something even more radical: Its not about respect for the flag.Its about fanning the flames of racial hatred and this president is a master of that and thats the reason why he’s playing plantation politics.He thinks apparently that he is a slave master of black people in the NFL, of black people in the country.
Former chair of the House Democratic Caucus Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif. (AP Harnik) A clearer picture is coming into focus on the Democrat IT scandal that may help explain why Democrats have been so reluctant to condemn the Awans or help the police with the investigation.New information about a massive cybersecurity breach, gleaned from a senior House official with direct knowledge of the investigation, implicates the former chair of the House Democratic Caucus, then-Rep. Xavier Becerra, who is now the attorney general of California and a rising star in Democratic politics.Kudos to Luke Rosiak of The Daily Caller for chasing down this story, even as the Democratic media complex either poo-pooed or ignored the growing scandal.As Ace of Spades noted, at some point the legacy media is going to have the explain to their audiences why they didnt report on this major story all year long.Police grew suspicious and requested a copy of the server early this year, but they were provided with an elaborate falsified image designed to hide the massive violations.The falsified image is what ultimately triggered their ban from the House network Feb. 2, according to a senior House official with direct knowledge of the investigation.Police informed Becerra that the server was the subject of an investigation and requested a copy of it.Fear among members that Awan could release embarrassing information if they cooperated with prosecutors could explain why the Democrats have refused to acknowledge the cybersecurity breach publicly or criticize the suspects.
Donald Trump lit a fresh controversy this week with his suggestion that "Second Amendment people" could stop Hillary Clinton from naming her judicial picks, if she becomes president - a remark many interpreted as a suggestion that gun rights activists could violently target Clinton or her judicial nominees.And some have pointed to a similar gaffe Clinton made in 2008 to argue that Trump deserves the benefit of the doubt.As the Democratic nomination was slipping from her grasp in May 2008, Clinton faced calls to drop out and endorse then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, whod at that point built a virtually insurmountable lead in the primary.When she was asked by a South Dakota newspaper at the end of that month why she was still running, Clinton replied, "You know, my husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June, right?To some, Clintons response suggested she was staying in the race because there was a possibility Obama could be killed, as Bobby Kennedy had been during the 1968 Democratic primary.After an indignant eruption from Obamas team, Clinton quickly backtracked: "I regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation and in particular the Kennedy family was in any way offensive."What she clearly said, and what she meant, was that, in previous election cycles--and she referenced first her husbands in 1992, and then 1968--weve had campaigns that have gone on into June and actually beyond," he said.The people in the room in South Dakota where she said this at the newspaper found nothing peculiar about it.
On July 28 1982, President Ronald Reagan designated August 14 as Navajo Code Talkers Day.Reagan called it a day dedicated to "all members of the Navajo Nation and to all Native Americans who gave their special talents and their lives so that others might live.""When called upon to serve the United States, [the Navajo Nation] contributed a precious commodity never before used in this way.In the midst of the fighting in the Pacific during World War II, a gallant group of men from the Navajo Nation utilized their language in coded form to help speed the Allied victory."According to the U.S. Marine Corps, Code Talkers took part in every assault by Marines in the Pacific during the war from 1942 to 1945 serving in all Marine six divisions.The Code Talkers were a vital part to the Allied forces victory as the Navajo language is the only spoken code to have never been deciphered."The dedication and unswerving devotion to duty shown by the men of the Navajo Nation," Reagan said the proclamation, "should serve as a fine example for all Americans."PHOTOS: Honoring the Navajo Code Talkers
However, if you ask yourself if you should support the proposed resurgence of the flagrantly unconstitutional and unjust amnesty that greatly disadvantages American millennials, the answer is less clear.The resurgence of the debate over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy would put all millennials in direct competition with illegal immigrants who were granted DACA permits, whether it be through college admissions, job opportunities, or wages.The California Dream Act, embolden by DACA, has set a precedent for states to generously allocate funding to students who have entered or were brought into the country Illegally.Implementing the California Dream Act made certain that undocumented and nonresident students are eligible for state financial aid, and that alone accounts for $67 million of the increase in Cal Grant spending.There are 800,0 millennials from other countries who are competing legally in the workplace for the same occupations where American millennials are looking for work.According to the Migration Policy Institute, there are an estimated 2.1 million illegal immigrants who are DACA-eligible in the United States in addition to the 800,0 already enrolled.Refusing to enforce the law equally, by making special exceptions for favored groups, puts a burden on citizens and lawful residents in the states (especially border states) with the irresponsible federal abdication of immigration law.The narrative on DACA touts the promise of the American dream by advertising the many who have benefited from the system.
By: Rachel Blevins/ The Free Thought Project President Trump issued his first official pardon on Friday, sparing former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was found guilty of criminal contempt after he violated a court order in a racial profiling case by continuing to target illegal immigrants.In fact, according to a report from the Associated Press in December 2011, Airpaio’s office failed to investigatemore than 400 sex-crimes that were reported in Maricopa County from 2005 to 2007, including dozens of alleged child molestations—that were inadequately investigated and in some instances were not worked at all.The report cited current and former police officers familiar with the cases who claimed that victims of the horrific crimes were as young as 2 years old.While Arpaio made headlines for his infamous Tent City Jail, a camp in which nearly 1,0 illegal immigrants were forced to live outdoors in Arizona’s sweltering 120-degree heat, he did not make headlines for his treatment of the children of illegal immigrants.After Arpaio’s contract ended, and his office was no longer required to provide police services for El Mirage, Detective Jerry Laird told the AP he found that an overwhelming majority of the cases he received from the office hadn’t been worked, which meant that there were no follow-up reports, no collection of additional forensic evidence and zero effort made after the initial report of the crime was taken.While some of the cases Arpaio’s office neglected were turned over to prosecutors, the report noted that the El Mirage Police Department claimed most were no longer viable—evidence dating as far back as 2006 had grown cold or wasn’t collected in the first place, victims had either moved away or otherwise moved on.As The Free Thought Project has reported, a number of cases involving pedophiles have come to light under the Trump Administration, such as a pedophile ring investigation that resulted over 900 arrests in May, and a sex-trafficking investigation that resulted in over 1,0 arrests earlier this month.If a child is a victim of a sex crime, the question of whether the predators are illegal aliens or legal American citizens should not keep officials like Sheriff Arpaio from holding them accountable for their actions, and he should be held accountable for his failure to do so.
There has been no shortage of talk recently about taking action to remove President Donald Trump from office, with Trump’s Charlottesville response proving to be a breaking point for many Republicans who had previously supported him.However, journalist Joan Walsh cautioned Americans to take a long, hard look at Trump’s would-be successor Mike Pence before we get excited about Pence being behind the Resolute desk in place of Trump.Wrote Walsh in an article bluntly titled Why Mike Pence is Worse than Donald Trump in The Nation, You probably have these debates with your friends, too: Do we want Donald Trump to resign, or be impeached, which would leave us with Vice President Mike Pence in charge?…Would the low-charisma Pence, who looks like a B-movie producer’s idea of a president, be easier to defeat, especially given the GOP fratricide that would commence with Trump’s departure, however it came about?He should go, because he’s a racist authoritarian who got help from a foreign adversary to become president.But I never let that obscure the truth, either: Pence is a far worse person, because of his creepy Handmaid’s Tale patriarchal approach to women’s equality.But also because he usually knows he’s lying about Trump, and their administration’s agenda, and he lies anyway.Said Pence, protesting the removal of Confederate monuments, When I walked, back in 2010, across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with John Lewis, arm in arm, and we remembered Bloody Sunday, and the extraordinary progress of the civil rights movement, I can’t help but think that rather than pulling down monuments, as some are wont to do, rather than tearing down monuments that have graced our cities all across this country for years, we ought to be building more monuments.Commented Joan about Pence, I don’t think he gives a damn about the folks who protest these shameful statues.What was most galling about Pence’s comment, though, was that he used his bond with Lewis to clean up Trump’s despicable equation of Nazis and white supremacists with their opponents, who are the modern-day incarnation of John Lewis.
MSNBC host Joe Scarborough expressed wariness on Thursday morning about the timing and source of the recent slew of sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump.The Morning Joe host speculated that allegations by multiple women in publications such as People magazine, The New York Times, BuzzFeed, and the Palm Beach Post may have been coordinated by Hillary Clinton’s campaign.He argued that sexual assault victims would have had months to come forward with allegations, and cited Trump’s inflammatory comments about Fox News host Megyn Kelly as a potential triggering event.@JoeNBC on new accusations against Trump: I’m sceptical about the *timing*… Talk about an October surprise.2gP5QD99 — Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) October 13, 2016 I’m talking about the timing of all of this dropping, talk about an October surprise, Scarborough said.The allegations come after a 2005 video was released on Friday showing the Republican presidential nominee boasting about kissing and forcing himself on women without their permission.Trump’s attorneys sent a letter to the New York Times early Thursday morning denying the allegations and threatening to sue the paper for defamation if the paper didn’t issue a retraction.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2016 Why didn’t the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the incident in her story.
Souvenirs from this weeks Republican National Convention in Cleveland took no prisoners.From Trump bumper stickers that call Clinton the B-word (wow) to a poster depicting Clinton in dominatrix gear (double wow) to Trump- and Clinton-themed condoms (triple wow), the swag was as surreal and distasteful as this historic election has been — and thats saying something.Photos by Steve Truesdell.
Crews—who was recognized as one of the Silence Breakers, TIME’s Person of the Year—realized that men had a responsibility to lend credence and support to these women’s claims.Crews spoke to TIME about the reception to his story and why it’s imperative that men advocate for women’s rights.And I had a realization: I didn’t check with my wife, I didn’t check with my publicist, I didn’t check with anybody.The reason I have the authority to say it is because I was like it.Until I had a major paradigm shift in my own life—it was like I hit rock bottom in order for me to see that I had it all wrong.There’s no reason why—why should I be the guy to survive Flint, Michigan; survive forty-nine years on this Earth; married twenty-eight years with five kids, the whole thing—and then I just sit in my big house and relax.It’s not Democratic, it’s not Republican, it’s not Russian, it’s not American, it’s not black, it’s not white.When it’s like, as a black man, I’m equal to a white man, but they don’t believe that a man is equal to a woman.

Sabrina Rubin Erdely An attorney for the former University of Virginia dean suing Rolling Stone for defamation alleged during closing arguments that the magazine’s campus rape story was reported with a reckless disregard for the truth.Attorney Tom Clare charged that Rolling Stone needed a villain for the Nov. 2014 feature piece — and the story’s author, Sabrina Erdely, decided former associate dean of students Nicole Eramo fit the bill.Every one of her stories has a victim, a villain and a vindicator … Ms. Erdely and Rolling Stone were intent on imposing that on this story, Clare said.Eramo, who is seeking $7.5 million, claims the since-discredited story portrayed her as turning a blind eye to gang rape claims made by a former student identified as Jackie.The lawyer said Erdely left out important details in her piece on purpose, like the fact that Eramo took Jackie to the police on two separate occasions.‘Every one of her stories has a victim, a villain and a vindicator…’ They made a decision to remove [from the article] every reference to the police and that’s actual malice, he said.Rolling Stone’s attorney Scott Sexton countered that Erdely put a tremendous amount of work into the article, but was ultimately fooled by Jackie.Sexton argued that Eramo’s attorneys are intent on proving that the story was republished in Dec. 2014 — when the magazine added an editor’s note to the piece after Jackie’s rape account had been called into question — because they, have no case for actual malice before then.
Both of these are very real issues, but today I want to talk about a third issue that many people don’t even realize about sexual abuse victims: the effect that the abuse has had in obscuring our own understanding of our sexual and gender identities.It is unfortunate, however, that the well-intentioned desire to keep the LGBT community from being maligned has resulted in the experiences of many CSA victims being silenced because it confuses the narrative.It is a testimony that is actually quite simple: for many victims of CSA, especially repeated CSA, nothing about their identity can be fully separated from the early trauma.Which means that many CSA survivors will tell you that they cannot say with a straight face that their perception of their gender identity or sexual orientation was not shunted down a different road by their experiences.It is a testimony that is actually quite simple: for many victims of CSA, especially repeated CSA, nothing about their identity can be fully separated from the early trauma.I’ve seen the term abuse reactive to label the difference between people who are able to know themselves apart from the abuse and people for whom the self before the trauma is a black hole difficult or even impossible to ever fully explore.One of the confusing aspects to this is that throughout history and even to this day, boys who showed effeminate characteristics were and are more likely to be denied a proper support system.The risk here is that conversation like this only gives fire to the bigots who want to say that there is something wrong with everyone who identifies as LGBT.
People are hungry to learn more about Hillary Clinton’s Wikileaks scandal, but you wouldn’t know it if you get your news from the mainstream media.The search term Wikileaks dwarfs the term Trump Women, according to an info graphic shown on Fox &amp; Friends on Saturday, but the network news coverage does not reflect the interest.ABC News devoted four minutes to discussing Trump’s sex scandals while NBC did 5 minutes and CBS did 3 minutes on the topic.By contrast, ABC spent a paltry one minute on Clinton’s Wikileaks scandal while CBS devoted two minutes to the email leaks.pic.twitter.com/9wY725Tipa — Fox News (@FoxNews) October 14, 2016 This the game Hillary is playing, The accusers come out of the woodwork and chew up the Air Time, all the Plan — OhReally (@OhReally22) October 15, 2016 @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson What hope do we have for a fair and prosperous future if the media insists on covering up corruption?😪🙏🇺🇸🙏 — Deb (@ddefrankie) October 15, 2016 The MSM is so afraid of Hillary’s negatives they avoid — Hopper (@sofshoe) October 15, 2016 @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Of course it is covered more.Media is not supposed to be biased, but these outlets are bought by the Clintons.#clintonslaves — Tommy Mora (@TommyTommyjmora) October 15, 2016 @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Of course they do not report news, they are a Dems PR outlets no journalists, come on!
In order to go to prison, Harvey would have to be convicted of a felony, like rape, Darren Kavinoky, California Criminal Defense Attorney of 1.800.No.Cuffs shared EXCLUSIVELY with HollywoodLife.com.In order for him to go to prison, he would have to get sentenced for more than a year.What is dangerous about Harvey’s behavior, and crimes of a sexual nature, is that he could be subject to consecutive sentencing.If multiple women come forward and he is accused then convicted of many sex crimes, molestation, harassment and ultimately rape, he could easily be behind state prison bars for 10, 20, 30 years or even longer depending on how many women come forward and what he is ultimately convicted of, Darren continued.With a net worth of an estimated $800 Million Dollars, depending on the number of victims, Harvey could easily lose his fortune in court, to his victims.He could be wiped out, and spend the rest of his life behind bars, broke, penniless and disgraced.In addition to the general sexual assault accusations, Harvey made headlines this week after it was reported that his company, The Weinstein Company, allowed him to sexually harass women as long as he paid all the money owed if he got sued.The controversial reports surrounding the film producer have caused a lot of backlash on social media with stars speaking out against him and there have been reports that he has recently checked into rehab for his issues.
Theyre demanding that the Justice Department appoint a special counsel to investigate Clinton, or more specifically, a couple of different matters relating to her, including the sale of a company that mines uranium and the Russia dossier, in which an opposition researcher assembled potentially damaging information on Donald Trump in 2016.However, every bit of the previous sentence is false, other than that there is a person named "Hillary Clinton," a thing called "uranium," a place called "Russia," and an organization called the "Clinton Foundation."In fact, the Russian government controls a company that has rights to mine a portion of the uranium located within the United States (far less than 20 percent), and the uranium isnt allowed to leave the country.The sale of that company was approved in 2013 by a board that includes representatives of nine different federal agencies; though the State Department is one of the nine, Clinton had no personal role in the decision.The donations to the Clinton Foundation that supposedly were payback actually occurred in 2007, before she became secretary of state, from a man who no longer had any stake in the company by the time the sale took place (you can read more here or here).Since this story involves Russia too, it can potentially create a fog in the addled mind of the American public, to the point where "Russia" is just associated with a bunch of Washington corruption that involves both parties.The trouble with the project, however, to return to where we started, is that Hillary Clinton is not the president and is never going to be the president.But they probably wont get it, so theyll just have to content themselves with defending the toddler in the Oval Office and worrying about which of their candidates are going to turn out to have a thing for teenage girls.

Defense Secretary James Mattis warned Monday that the US Army needs to stand ready for put into action its various options for attacking North Korea, saying neither you nor I can say what the future holds, and that it’s purely up to President Trump.Mattis presented the preparations to attack North Korea as necessary because of continued provocations by Pyongyang, despite North Korea not having said much of anything in recent weeks, other than being concerned that Trump has declared war during the many, many times he’s talked about destroying North Korea.While Trump has largely been driving the North Korea war hysteria for months on end, he’s been virtually the sole instigator of such talks lately, condemning diplomacy on a near-daily basis,and insisting that  only one thing will work against them, ominously threatening to show us all what that is pretty soon.Repeated threats to totally destroy North Korea have been among his most favored talking points on any subject since the UN General Assembly.Mattis’ talk of keeping the Army ready to carry out that threat only adds to concern that the US could start a massive war at any moment.Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz
It was then that the two teamed up to promote the Birther Lie that President Obama was not born in the USA.The birth records show that Barack Hussein Obama II was born at 7:24 pm on August 4, 1961, in the Kapiolani Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu, to Stanley Ann Dunham Obama and Barack Hussein Obama.Moore, who began his involvement in the cause in 2008, declared to World Net Daily in 2010 that there was substantial evidence that Obama was not born in our country.Moore combined his birther claims with the Islamophobic lie that Obama was secretly a Muslim, while Trump cleverly used the lie in his Presidential campaigns of 2012 and 2016 to solidify the nationalist, racist, anti-Obama core of his base.The political effectiveness of the Birther Lie can be seen in the results of the NBC poll of September 2016.The Birther Lie appears to have sowed doubt about the President being born in the U.S., and thus the legitimacy of his Presidency, among nearly three-quarters of registered Republicans.When Trump gave up the lie, however, he replaced it with another one – naming his opponent Hillary Clinton as the originator of the whole birther idea, again of course without any evidence.So why should we believe them when they completely deny the credible testimonies of the more than 21 women who accuse one or the other of these men of sexual molesting them?
The Dallas Cowboys will go back to their previous stance on the national anthem Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams, receiver Dez Bryant said.That show of solidarity was about joining the brethren across the league in responding to the expletive-filled attacks from President Donald Trump against the players who kneeled during the anthem in protest against racism and social injustice.We’re going to stand, we’re going to stand and going to put our hand over our heart and we’re going to do what we did before, Bryant said.You all know what that was, that was just a response to Trump and that’s all that that was.protected by reCAPTCHA Privacy - Terms Privacy - Terms Owner Jerry Jones said earlier Friday on his radio show that Bryant was absolutely torn about the decision and was getting a lot of pressure to kneel.Sports Highlights Up Next: Rapoport: Theres newfound optimism in Rams contract talks with Aaron Donald Your video will play in: 5 seconds Rapoport: Theres newfound optimism in Rams contract talks with Aaron Donald NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport reports that the Los Angeles Rams seem to be making progress on a new contract for Los Angeles Rams defensive end Aaron Donald.00:52 Rapoport: Theres newfound optimism in Rams contract talks with Aaron Donald NFL Los Angeles Rams | 00:52 01:34 Patrick Peterson highlights | Preseason Week 3 NFL Arizona Cardinals | 01:34 02:50 How good will Dak and Zeke need to be for Cowboys to make playoffs?NFL Dallas Cowboys | 02:50 05:24 Texans vs. Rams highlights | Preseason Week 3 NFL Los Angeles Rams | 05:24 04:51 Cardinals vs. Cowboys highlights | Preseason Week 3 NFL Arizona Cardinals | 04:51 00:52 Cant-Miss Play: Muffed punt turns into wild scramble and Cardinals TD NFL Arizona Cardinals | 00:52 00:38 Cant-Miss Play: Patrick Peterson jumps in front of receiver for easy pick-six NFL Arizona Cardinals | 00:38 02:04 Sunday Ready: Dak Prescott NFL Dallas Cowboys | 02:04 02:06 What does Fredericks absence mean for Cowboys?
New York Police Officer Miosotis Familia was brutally gunned down in cold blood by Alexander Bonds early Monday morning in an unprovoked attack.Officer Miosotis Familia was rushed to the hospital where she was pronounced dead.According to Infowars Bonds encouraged people to vote for Hillary Clinton.Would you look at that we have another cop killer, and the cop killer is a Hillary Clinton supporter.Wednesday’s identified assassin of a New York Police Department (NYPD) officer was a Hillary Clinton supporter, according to the killer’s Facebook page.So there you have it America this cop killer was another radicalized American done in by Obamas war a cops which Hillary Clinton supported as well.This once again shows the danger that Obamas and Hillarys rhetoric have given cops nationwide, as the last Presidency of Obama in the last two years of his administration made the environment for LEOs a very dangerous one as both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama stated over and over again that police officers target blacks.Go figure though we have a cop killer again who is not only a Hillary advocate but an all out Democrat.
In a bizarre turn of events, NBC News reports Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock wired $100,0 to the Philippines one week before Sunday’s mass murder.Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock wired $100,0 to an account in his live-in girlfriend’s home country of the Philippines in the week before he unleashed the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, according to multiple senior law enforcement officials.But while officials have confirmed that Marilou Danley was in the Philippines on Sunday when Paddock opened fire on a crowd attending a country music festival on the Vegas Strip, it was not known whether the money was for her, her family, or another purpose.Danley, 62, who had traveled to Hong Kong on Sept. 25, could fill in some of the blanks when she returns to the U.S. on Wednesday, the officials said.As Americans begin to pick up the pieces from Sunday’s mass shooting in Las Vegas, new details are emerging in connection to Stephen Paddock’s financial activities.ABC News reports: As authorities pick apart the life of Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock, they have come across one major thread of suspicious behavior: how he handled his money.Paddock’s recent financial transactions have become a key focus for investigators looking to learn more about the Nevada man and why he launched the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.Sponsored Sponsored

Fox News panel with Katie Pavlich and Adrienne Elrod (Photo: Screen capture) A Fox News host and panelist alleged that it was Hillary Clinton that colluded with Russia and thus should be taken to jail — not President Donald Trump.Well, if it’s really a big threat and we want to stop them from meddling in our elections, why is it that during a three-year time span the Obama administration really didn’t do much to stop this from happening, asked Town Hall editor Katie Pavlich.Pavlich and the host then turned to wonder why 300 elected officials didn’t show up for the classified briefing held at the FBI involving the Gang of 8.The Gang of 8 all have the proper security clearance level to have viewed the documents.Given the security level, it’s likely much of the information available at the time could not be made public.She noted she wished Obama had acted prior to the election but asked what Trump is doing today to stop Russia from acting in the 2018 election.The Fox host along with Pavlich went on to claim that Clinton was colluding with Russia because her campaign partially paid the law firm that bought the opposition research dossier from Christopher Steele.Another portion of the dossier was paid for by Republicans hoping to discredit Trump prior to the general election.
The NFL Players Association is making an attempt to open up the lines of communication between the camps of Richie Incognito and Jonathan Martin.NFL Medias Albert Breer reported that the NFLPA contacted the agents of Incognito and Martin on Wednesday morning to request a meeting, according to a source apprised of the plan.The proposal calls for the meeting to occur in Florida with union chief DeMaurice Smith present.Incognito was suspended indefinitely by the Miami Dolphins after the team was presented with evidence that Incognito sent abusive and racially insensitive messages to Martin via text message and voice mail.The suspension was handed down six days after Martin abruptly left the team after an incident at the Dolphins dining facility.NFL Medias Jeff Darlington reported last week that Martin sought treatment at a South Florida hospital immediately after leaving the team.He left the hospital a short time later and now is at home in California with his parents."This will pass."

CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. -- Hillary Clinton will be telling her side of the story.Clinton, a Chappaqua resident, is set to write "What Happened," her recounting of her loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.The book will be published on Sept. 12 by Simon and Schuster.In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I’ve often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net.Now I’m letting my guard down," Clinton, who previously served as Senator and Secretary of State, said.The book will discuss what it was like to face Trump, Russian interference and the experience Clinton had of being the first woman nominated for president by a major party.Clinton had previously written the memoirs "Living History," and "Hard Choices."In November, Clinton is set to speak at the Business Council of Westchesters annual dinne r, where she will receive the Westchester Global Leadership Laureate Award Click here to sign up for Daily Voices free daily emails and news alerts.
While officially the White House is condemning the ISIS suicide attacks in Tehran today, in keeping with their policy of being against ISIS, President Trump’s own statement on the matter appeared less than wholly sympathetic, attributing the attacks to Iran  falling victim to the evil they promote.President Trump has made clear since the campaign that he does not like Iran, and spent much of his recent trip to the Middle East pushing hostility toward Iran, as well as portraying Iran as being to blame for most of the terrorism in the region.That ISIS is the world’s biggest terrorist organization, and that Iran has been heavily supporting both Iraq and Syria in fighting ISIS, doesn’t fit into Trump’s narrative, and the fact that ISIS just launched terrorist attacks in Tehran is particularly unwelcome to the US agenda of trying to spin everything wrong in the Middle East as being Iran’s fault.President Trump’s answer to this, then, is to remind everyone that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, an official designation by the US government which means effectively nothing, and only currently applies to three countries that the US doesn’t like, none of whom has anything to do with ISIS, al-Qaeda, or other major international terrorist groups.Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz
Today’s breaking story of the DOJ surveilling the communications of POTUS Trump’s longtime personal attorney is just now filtering through news watchers across the country.Remember, the Cohen surveillance was referred to by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, (and signed off by the DOJ’s #2 Rod Rosenstein who was the one who originally pushed for President Trump to fire then FBI Director James Comey) meaning it was effectively Mueller’s operation.And what THAT means is Robert Mueller was wiretapping the Trump White House.In a normal world, as soon as the President of the United States was on the line, the DOJ would have initiated an all stop on surveillance.That didn’t happen which would indicate capturing the President’s communications to Cohen was the primary purpose of the Mueller-originating surveillance all along.Consider this that the Department of Justice is charged with upholding the powers of the Constitution but in this case (and likely many-many others) it has shredded those same Constitutional protections in order to bring down a duly-elected President of the United States.This is about America, our personal liberties, and the now-fractured foundation that was the Constitution.For if the government can go after a sitting president via such means it can come after any of us at any time.
The MOAR rally began its opening ceremonies at the north end of the Mall, near the Washington monument, at 11 a.m. Eastern, according to their website.Panel discussions on a number of hot topics are also planned and much will be happening throughout the day and evening.Peter Boykin, president of Gays for Trump and a speaker at the rally, told the Washington Post that some topics discussed at the event will be more controversial, including transgender men and women in the military, Sharia law, and the dreamers immigration program.According to the event’s website, the rally is focused on freedom, putting America first, and uniting everyone under the American flag: …No confederate flags, communist flags, or foreign flags allowed.The event’s Facebook page mentions that the event is in support of American values, American culture, American traditions, and of course President Donald Trump.About 2,0 people RSVP’d for the event on Facebook, and an additional 6,200 indicated that they were interested in the event.But both Jason Webber, an organizer of the Juggalo rally, and Peter Boykin, a speaker at the MOAR rally, told The Washington Post that their events don’t plan to interact with each other and they don’t expect any brawls.Some counter protesters showed up too: The website for the event took pains to set itself up as different from the Charlottesville rally, saying that they wanted American flags and Confederate flags would not be allowed.

I was listening to a Christian radio show awhile back before I was scheduled to go on, and one of the guests before me was talking about the organization he formed to fight back against powerful liberals in the United States and the ideologies they are spending billions of dollars to advance.This man kept talking about how liberalism is a threat to Christianity, and how any number of liberal political ideologies are going to somehow damage the faith, though he wasn’t very specific as to how.The idea that something could be a threat to Christianity implies that, somehow, Christianity could be put on a sort of endangered religions list, or that Christians could become extinct altogether.Christianity, defined by the gospel of Jesus Christ and the implications of that gospel, offers the world what other worldviews cannot.So, Christians who want the best for their communities and the world are right to work for Christianity’s spread around the world.Christianity’s existence and well-being is not dependent on how widespread it is accepted in America or the world.When you claim that ISIS or the Democrats or whomever else is threatening Christianity, you spit in the face of the God who conquered sin and death because you’re afraid he can’t conquer competing worldviews.Sometimes I think American evangelicals push for the widespread acceptance of Christianity because they want to be right more than they want the world to flourish in the grace of God.
| Photo Credit: US President Donald Trump on Thursday dismissed an upcoming book on his campaign and administration as "full of lies" and invented sources, after unsuccessfully attempting to block its release.I authorised Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book!Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that dont exist, Mr. Trump tweeted in reference to Michael Wolffs Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.Look at this guys past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!It was unclear to whom Mr. Trump was referring, with possibilities including Steve Bannon, his former chief strategist, and Steve Rubin, the president of Henry Holt and Company, which is publishing Wolffs book.The book quotes key Mr. Trump aides, including Mr. Bannon, expressing serious doubt about his fitness for office.Mr. Trump has been enraged by the betrayal by Mr. Bannon — a man who engineered the New York real estate moguls link to the nationalist far right and helped create a pro-Trump media ecosystem.After Mr. Trump instructed his lawyers to try to block the release of the book, the publishers responded by moving the release date up by four days to Friday.
Hotel Guard Opens Up Jesus Campos, the Mandalay Bay security guard who alerted police to the Las Vegas shooter, is speaking out for the first time about the violent encounter that left him with gunshot wounds.Jesus opened up to Ellen DeGeneres .detailing the harrowing moments leading up to him discovering Stephen Paddock on the 32nd floor, just as he was starting to open fire on the crowd of concertgoers below.He thinks a loud slamming door during his routine check of the floor is what tipped off his location to Paddock, who then started shooting into the hallway -- and hit Campos in the leg.Miraculously, Campos says he was still able to somehow get on his radio and tell his team shots had been fired.You can hear his full story on Wednesdays episode of Ellen.
It’s a good strategy, though if he gets elected, many people will probably be upset when the revolution doesn’t arrive, when the billionaire class continues to exist, and when big money continues to influence politics.¹ Trump, on the other hand, is perceived as honest because he says and does so many ludicrous things, compared to traditional candidates.The 21st century is a time in which the countries of the world need more than ever to cooperate with one another, consider a global perspective, and devise strategies that will make the human enterprise sustainable through the 21st century and hopefully far beyond.He’s explicitly stated that he wants to build a wall around much of the United States, and he’s made comments that reveal a frighteningly uncritical and violent approach to international relations (on ISIS: I would bomb the shit out of ’em, and  … you have to take out their families.).If one wanted to appeal to conservative-minded people, it follows then that one could paint a picture of the world as One Giant Threat to America and propose an extremely aggressive plan to ameliorate the situation.He’s a master of a number of other tactics as well, and the cumulative effect of these tactics is that he’s gone from being considered a joke candidate to having a decent chance of becoming the next leader of one of the most powerful countries in the world.This potent combination of fear-, anger-, and aggression-mongering then sets Trump up for one of his most effective lies: that he is the only big, strong man tough enough to do what needs to be done to kick everyone else’s ass and make America great again.And again, when people are afraid and angry, they are primed to accept whatever convenient narrative promises to allow them to escape their fear, and thus the absurdly vague and reductive America is Going to Start Winning So Much Again That We’ll Have Nothing to Worry About story begins to seem quite alluring indeed.But when it comes to choosing the leader of one of the most powerful countries in the world, it might be a bad idea to vote for a guy because his smile gives you the warm fuzzies.
The New McCarthyism revealed its full absurdity this week via the ACLU’s Twitter stream, which had the temerity to post a picture of an adorable young toddler holding an American flag and a doll with the tag line This is the future that ACLU members want.Because the girl (TRIGGER WARNING: I assume it’s a girl, given the doll) happens to be blonde and Caucasian, the ACLU was promptly attacked – the ACLU!The organization shortly responded with a Kermit the Frog image saying That’s a very good point and the post When your followers keep you in check and remind you that white supremacy is everywhere.This is a weapon used cynically and viciously -- little girls are apparently acceptable collateral damage -- by the left to isolate and demonize opponents, and particularly President Trump and his supporters.If I had a dollar for every time the mainstream media accused Trump and his voters of racism, I’d be about as rich as the recent Powerball winner.But the digital rage mob holds people like me in particular contempt, as I saw during the 2016 campaign in the form of a constant stream of online slurs.Yes, today’s liberals are quick to use racism’s terms when it suits their purposes, calling me a coconut (brown on the outside, white on the inside) and Tio Tomas (Uncle Tom in Spanish).One of the main reasons America has succeeded as a country lies is our rejection of the tribalism that afflicts and paralyzes so much of the world.
Hillary Clinton Before Democrats burn James Comey in effigy, they should think about how the FBI director came to have an outsized influence in the election in the first place.They did it, in part, because they could never bring themselves to fully acknowledge the seriousness of the email scandal and, relatedly, the ethical miasma around the Clinton Foundation.A parade of Democratic operatives pooh-poohed the whole thing, from Clinton spokesman Karen Finney (a politically motivated series of attacks) to James Carville (not going to amount to a hill of beans) to Howard Dean (hooey).When they first got on a debate stage together last October, Bernie Sanders, the only man who had a chance to stop Clinton, pleased the crowd with a ringing denunciation of interest in her emails.But he also put on the record the recklessness of Clinton’s practices as secretary of state in an attempt to create public accountability.All that can be said is that if Democrats didn’t want the FBI to have any part in the election, they could’ve considered that before nominating Clinton.Trump may be a deeply flawed candidate, but he caught a wave of popular fervor; Hillary, with her astonishing vulnerabilities, is a production of the Democratic elites who did everything to get her over the finish line.If it weren’t for the new trove of Huma Abedin emails, the blockbuster news this week would come via a Wall Street Journal report that the FBI is investigating the Clinton Foundation — although Fox News reported the same thing at the beginning of the year, and Hillary, of course, dismissed it as an unsourced and irresponsible claim that has no basis.
Van Der Beek added his voice to the chorus of men and women condemning disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, in the wake of numerous sexual misconduct allegations.This week, in the wake of the Weinstein scandal, Crews also revealed via Twitter that he was groped in the past by an unnamed Hollywood executive.This whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD, Crews wrote before explaining he was targeted last year by a high-level Hollywood executive who groped my privates.Hollywood is not the only business [where] this happens, and to the casualties of this behavior — you are not alone.In a statement to The New Yorker, which detailed numerous allegations — including claims made by actress and filmmaker Asia Argento that Weinstein raped her by forcibly performing oral sex on her — the producer unequivocally denied allegations of non-consensual sex.The statement, released by his representative, continued, Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual.Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.
Thankfully, his boy is OK. "If your baby is going to die and it doesnt have to, it shouldnt matter how much money you make," said an emotional Kimmel in May.He went on to say, "And by the way, before you post a nasty Facebook message saying Im politicizing my sons health problems, I want you to know: I am politicizing my sons health problems."Rather, the Congressional Budget Office review of the AHCA found that of the 24 million Americans who would no longer have health insurance after an Obamacare repeal, 14 million would choose not to buy insurance in 2018 in the absence of a penalty.States would be allowed to apply for waivers to change what qualifies as an essential health benefit as long as they still preserve "adequate and affordable health insurance coverage" for people with pre-existing conditions.Its a shame that Kimmel didnt provide a number to call for the tens of millions of Americans who have seen their premiums and out-of-pocket costs skyrocket under Obamacares strictures.Is there no number available for those who are sick of being in exchanges that coerce them to buy plans they dont need that are sold by companies they dont like in fabricated, noncompetitive "markets" with dwindling choices?Kimmel doesnt believe Americans deserve the chance to reduce the cost of health care with market-based reforms on the state level, or in giving states any flexibility in catering their plans to their own citizens.Kimmel doesnt believe that individuals and families should be allowed to contribute to health savings accounts or use them to help pay ever-growing insurance premiums.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks during an event in Scranton, Pennsylvania, August 15, 2016 and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump holds a rally in Roanoke, Virginia, September 24, 2016 in a combination of file photographs.Donald Trump reported raising $100 million for his presidential campaign and the Republican party in September, a number that trails far behind Hillary Clinton’s fundraising haul in the same month.Trump’s campaign sent a statement Saturday announcing its new fundraising record, which will fill the coffers for his presidential bid as well as the joint efforts of the Republican National Committee, and various state GOP parties.In total, the campaign and its affiliated joint fundraising committees finished September with approximately $75 million cash on hand.But Trump’s campaign apparatus is playing a catch-up game compared to Hillary Clinton’s behemoth fundraising efforts, which drew in more than $154 million for her campaign and the Democratic Party in September alone.HFA, along with the campaign’s other joint fundraising committees, began the month of October with a combined $150 million cash on hand.And when it comes to advertising, the numbers in the final stretch of the campaign continue the election-cycle trend of Clinton outspending Trump.The amount is more than twice what Trump and his super PAC backers have scheduled -- $50 million, according to Kantar Media.
The latest map, from the NHC, shows that the eye of the hurricane is travelling along the coast of Florida towards Georgia and the Carolinas.The NHC said that the hurricane is due to track run parallel along the coast of Florida and Georgia all the way to South Carolina.When a hurricane is forecast to track roughly parallel to a coastline - as Matthew is forecast to go from Florida through South Carolina - it becomes very difficult to estimate the impacts this far in advance, the NHC added.This map shows the possible path of the hurricane The Met Office said: "It is likely the eye of Hurricane Matthew will pass very close to the entire eastern coastline of the US state on Friday."Over the weekend it is expected that Matthew will weaken and turn north and northeast and affect the coastal areas of Georgia and the Carolinas.Met Office tropical prediction scientist Julian Heming explained that there are differences between the models that track the very oblique path of the hurricane towards the US.A NHC spokesman said the eye of the hurricane looks "like its going to impact the Carolinas" at the end of the week or over the weekend.Tue, October 4, 2016 At least 108 people have been killed by Hurricane Matthew in Haiti and the Dominican Republic as the United States braces itself for the worst storm in a decade.
Mrs Clinton has been a champion of family issues and womens rights throughout her career, so the idea that she was the enabler of someone Mr Trump has called "the greatest abuser of women in the history of politics," appeared outrageous.The New York Times today has a long article outlining Mrs Clintons role in the political handling of her husbands sexual affairs.It was grim, and the image of Chelsea steadfastly holding both parents hands as they walked, heads slightly bowed, to the helicopter on their way to that summer holiday in Marthas Vineyard will stick with me as one of the more poignant family portraits ever taken.What is disconcerting now, however, is Hillarys role in pursuing the women themselves - Gennifer, Paula, Monica, they all, according to both the New York Times and previously published accounts, became the subject of brutal, organised discreditation campaigns.The Clintons hired a famous private investigator to dig up the womens pasts with the aim of destroying their reputations.Why should the character or the sexual past of these women be relevant to the truthfulness of their claims?By discrediting the women, the Clintons were spreading the subliminal message that it was somehow their fault more than Bills.Young women today expect women to stand up for other women, particularly in the area of sexual relations and particularly when those sexual relations involve a very powerful man and a younger woman.
With 11 days left in the presidential election, the FBI’s decision to launch another investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email system for government business threatens to upend an already volatile race.At the most, it could turn at least some voters to rival Donald Trump, who has rested much of his pitch on the argument that Clinton is dishonest and who grabbed at the news immediately as a gift to salvage his trailing campaign.The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation, Comey wrote in the letter.By McClatchy Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta called the announcement so late in the campaign extraordinary and urged the FBI to release all of the details of what it is examining.We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July, Podesta said, referring to the FBI decision earlier not to seek any prosecution of Clinton.His eagerness to address the matter as fast as possible underscored the mysterious nature of the new investigation and the impact it could have.Clinton email scandal + Anthony Weiner = a volcanic news cycle that will serve as an 11 day negative ad worth millions.— Ron Bonjean (@RonBonjean) October 28, 2016 Trump will have to rely on news media coverage to drive much of that message, having made the tactical decision much earlier not to spend as much time as Clinton did raising money – money he now could use to buy ads on the FBI news.EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM Both campaigns now agree Director Comey needs to put forward more information about what prompted this letter to GOP chairmen.— Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) October 28, 2016 Indeed, voters have already seen thousands of Clinton’s emails released by the State Department and thousands of her aides’ emails released, some illegally, by news organizations, conservative groups and the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks.
This is how you remake a society.Muslims pray in the streets of France A 2014 study in France found that one-third of French births were non-white.The was before the mass migrant invasion of Europe supported by French, German, EU and Vatican leaders.73% of children born in Paris are African.The national rate in France of African births is 39% African births will outnumber French births in France in 3 to 5 years.This will not end well.By 2022, African births will outnumber French births in France.This type of multiculturalism will kill the entire country and culture.pic.twitter.com/57IydjhZP7 — /pol/ News Infinity (@polNewsInfinity) October 14, 2017 Sponsored Sponsored
Two of the five men, he said, attacked him directly while the other three just kinda hung back, but he disputed the story’s premise blaming anti-fascist groups: I honestly dont think antifa had anything to do with this.Big League Politics interviewed Wormer after he posted a picture of himself on his Facebook page with a visible cut to his stomach, which he told us came from a box cutter blade.He said there is a loosely organized antifa group in the area, which contacted him after the incident trying to figure out what happened [and] who’s responsible, and have been very very supportive.Wormer, who has not sought medical attention but filed a police report after the attack, first attracted media attention when he was interviewed in a Burlington Free Press story about Ryan Roy, a local man who was fired from his job after being identified as one of the participants in a white supremacist march held in Charlottesville, Virginia on 11 August 2017.That legislation, which was signed into law by then-President Lyndon B. Johnson on 3 October 1965 and went into effect in June 1968, did away with quotas for immigrants to the U.S. based on their country of origin and instead gave priority to immigrants whose relatives already lived in the country, as well as those with specialized skills..According to Wormer, he was completely shocked to see Roy in a Vice News report about the rally and did not agree with his beliefs, but still opposed subsequent demands online for him to be fired or lose custody of his child.He said that he was attacked shortly after he made a separate comment about Roy on Facebook, which read: I believe he’s doing what he truly believes is right, and despite all the anger and hate pointed his way right now he stands by his choices.Wormer also told us that Roy contacted him after the attack: He and his mother both reached out to me and made sure I was okay and safe, and thanked me for standing up for him.

Former Dems Now Backing Trump: Our Countrys Going in the Wrong Direction Donald Trump joined Bill OReilly on "The Factor" tonight to discuss a wide range of topics, including his claims that the election is rigged against him."The system is rigged," Trump said, arguing that the media has been "horrible" in their coverage of him, while giving Hillary Clinton a pass for her various scandals.He added that Clinton was also given a pass by the Justice Department and the FBI for her private email server and mishandling of state secrets."She is so guilty in so many different ways that she shouldnt even be allowed to run for president," Trump stated.The Republican nominee added that he also isnt ruling out the possibility of widespread election fraud, with votes being miscounted at locations around the country.OReilly pointed out that there arent any "hard facts" to back up such allegations.Trump asserted that there are 1.8 million deceased people registered to vote and 2.8 million people registered to vote in two states.Watch the "OReilly Factor" interview above, and let us know what you think in the comments.
On Sunday Vice President Mike Pence attended the Indianapolis Colts game against the San Francisco 49ers.But after the NFL millionaires disrespected the US flag and military by kneeling during the national anthem, Vice President Pence and his wife walked out of the game.The liberal media is attacking the vice president for defending the flag and military.Now this… CNN actually tabulated the cost of Mike Pence’s trip to the game.This is CNN: How much did Vice President Mike Pence’s trip to Indianapolis to watch — and then abruptly leave — a football game Sunday between the Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers cost?Here is an estimate of just the air costs (which does not include costs of advance personnel, Secret Service or support on the ground): According to the Air Force, flying a C-32, the model of plane used for Air Force 2, for one hour costs about $30,0.Pence’s flight from Las Vegas to Indianapolis Saturday took about three hours and 20 minutes, so it cost about $100,0 Pence then flew from Indianapolis to Los Angeles on Sunday, which took about four hours and 45 minutes, costing about $142,500.Sponsored Sponsored
So her recent expression of disgust over Weinstein’s activities ring hollow: At long last, the people who do the strategic planning for Hillary Clinton and tell her what emotions she should imitate in response to various stimuli have weighed in and they have decided that Harvey Weinstein is not a nice man: I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein.Weinstein has been joined at the hip with the Clintons for a couple of decades… Ironically, as it turns out, he was a major defender of Bill Clinton in the Lewinski affair though Weinstein seemed to favor aiming at the ficus bushes rather than blue dresses.Hollywood was a major funder of both the Clinton and Obama political machines, and many a Hollywood star defended Bill Clinton’s sordid activities as a personal matter as long as he was doing a good job as President.They similarly defended Weinstein as Michelle Obama once did, as a wonderful human being, as well as a good friend and just a powerhouse Both the Obamas and Clintons knew Weinstein well and neither should be given a pass for feigning ignorance and shock at his activities: None other than CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on Tuesday evening that former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama should not get a pass on Harvey Weinstein.And we all need to build a culture -- including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect -- so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future… As Breitbart News has reported, Weinstein visited the Obama White House on at least 13 occasions and Obama’s daughter, Malia Obama, recently wrapped up an internship at the New York City offices of The Weinstein Co.Juanita Broaddrick’s story is a credible one, and one of the many  bimbo eruptions that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton handled during her husband Bill’s presidential campaign As Linda Tripp, confidante of former Clinton intern Monica Lewinsky, told the Daily Mail of how Hillary both enabled and covered up Bill’s many dalliances: Tripp said: His political success was largely dependent upon Hillary.At a Trump press conference in 2016, Broaddrick, tired of being accused of being part of that vast right-wing conspiracy, and afraid that her attacker would once again occupy the White House with the woman who orchestrated the attacks on Bill Clinton’s bimbo eruptions, repeated her accusation: Actions speak louder than words, Broaddrick said.Broaddrick, who has said Hillary threatened her, appeared with fellow Clinton sexual assault victims Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey appeared in an interview at presidential suite of the historic Watergate and related the taleof Bill’s assaults and their fear of Hillary’s retaliation: In an exclusive video interview at the presidential suite of the historic Watergate Hotel, the victims of Bill Clinton’s alleged sexual assault -- Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, and Paula Jones -- got together for the first time in person to express their personal fear of Hillary Clinton and to warn voters that Clinton does not stand for women’s issues.
The Daily Record has yet another story linking Celtic fans to extremism, and this one is as bent looking as it’s possible to be.He or she has a grand total of 59 followers and follows a grand total of 125.This is the textbook definition of a complete non-story; if this person exists at all The Record has elevated them beyond utter irrelevance and used them to beat the rest of our support.I had a look at this Twitter twat’s timeline; he is a clown.The Record knows full well this is an idiot with a few fried brain cells, but I said the other day that an agenda is being pursued here and this is another demonstration of it.To have blown a tweet by a complete nobody off Twitter into a story that smears the Celtic support as a whole is an act of malevolence against our club, and as per usual with that arse-rag the story is so weak that no-one wants to stand their own name beside it.It carries the standard appellation for a story which is Utter Mince; Daily Record Online Reporter – or Daily Record Shit-Stirring Troll, a far more accurate description.I know nobody in our support still reads this gutter-rag … I still do not understand why anyone from our club is willing to talk to its journalists or entertain their presence at our ground.
Colin Kaepernick is one of the most divisive players to have ever played in the NFL, on the back of his stance against police brutality last year, and his refusal to stand during pre-game national anthems as a result.The 29-year-old is currently unemployed because of his actions, however, and NFL clubs are reluctant to touch him because of the publicity that his protests attract.Kaepernick is one of the most courageous sports stars in the world, and should be lauded for not accepting what others know is wrong, but keep their mouths shut anyway.US president Donald Trump was speaking at a rally in Alabama on Friday night when he took declining NFL TV ratings to task, going on to claim that the lack of physicality in the game was a reason for this.Then he turned his attention to the Milwaukee mans tendency to kneel during national anthems, and without mentioning by name, referred to him as a "son of a bitch."Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL Owners, when someone disrespects our flag to say, ‘get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he’s fired, he’s fired, Trump said to the crowd.Love this: @realDonaldTrump on NFL players disrespecting our : "get that son of a bitch off the field right now - YOURE FIRED!"A protest for the eradication of racism that violates millions of those people is not disrespect.
Donald J. Trump said he would "listen to the generals" in deciding how many troops to commit to the battle against ISIS -- and the numbers he is hearing are 20,0 to 30,0.Mr. Trump said the families of some Sept. 11 hijackers were allowed to leave the U.S. days before the attacks.Mr. Rubio said two-thirds of the votes cast in the Republican primaries and caucuses to date have gone against Donald J. Trump.Mr. Rubio said Hillary Clinton wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.Hillary Clinton said that, because of the Affordable Care Act, "We now have driven costs down to the lowest theyve been in 50 years."Senator Marco Rubio said President Obama had played down the threat of the Islamic State, which practices "genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region."Mr. Rubio said the Islamic State took root because of Bashar al-Assads decision to bomb his own people, and because of President Obamas unwillingness to arm the rebel groups.I got to know him very well because we were both on ‘60 Minutes,’ Mr. Trump said, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia Mrs. Fiorina said she met President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia not in a green room for a show, but in a private meeting.
The line of Republican cowards attempting to curry favor with Donald Trump stretches out the door, around the building, down the block, through the next door overflow room, and extends up to space, where it circles around the moon like Dr Manhattan.Theres sniveling turdface Ted Cruz, who, among other things, listened to Trump call his wife ugly and his dad a traitor and a murderer.And of course theres Most Racist Cracker Barrel Manager Ever Jefferson Sessions, whos remained mute as a Nazi church mouse as Trump continues to drink his milkshake on Twitter every day.But none of these cowards compare to the cowardice standard exhibited by John McCain; whose cowardice is legion and legendary, massive and magnificent.And now, heres McCain jumping out of his government-funded death futon to deny government-funded death futons to other sick people, all to support a President who disrespected the fuck out of him and whose only substantive agenda and platform is to erase everything the preceding President did.But John McCain has created, attached himself to, and submerged himself in this maverick narrative; that hes somehow different from the rest of those craven motherfuckers.And this story only exists and has been able to persist because he was a bad pilot.His "bravery" is to bravery what Arbys "roast beef" is to roast beef.
Officials familiar with the situation say that NATO has agreed to join the US-led anti-ISIS coalition on an alliance level, with indications that Germany and France were the last nations to agree to the formal move, which will be announced during the Brussels summit.All NATO members are already individually members of the anti-ISIS coalition, and diplomats say that the move will have no actual consequence, and seemingly is being done just for the sake of a purely symbolic gesture during President Trump’s visit.President Trump has always been keen to bring NATO deeper into the ISIS war, of course, and has made a big deal about NATO’s obsolescence because it wasn’t formed specifically to deal with terrorism, claiming in April that  back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.While shortly after his election most NATO officials were just attacking Trump for being too pro-Russia, recently they seem to be eager to please him, so long as it only requires symbolic actions that won’t amount to anything.Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz
Surprisingly a lot of people are standing with Colin Kaepernick in his decision not to stand during the national anthem, "calling the Star Spangled Banner "weak" and saying that he doesnt truly love the song.Here is what he had to say on twitter: For those defending the current anthem, do you really truly love that song?Like, one of the best He continued to add: My vote is for America the Beautiful.62FAbxj — John Legend (@johnlegend) August 30, 2016 John Legend linked to an article titled, "Colin Kaepernick Is Righter Than You Know: The National Anthem Is A Celebration Of Slavery" The article makes the arguement that an unsung verse of the Francis Scott Key poem is a moral "atrocity."The author claims the end of the rarely sung third verse "literally celebrated the murder of African-Americans."The verse reads: No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave, And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.The lyrics were never Colins argument in the first place — Lindsey (@Lindsey50783746) August 30, 2016 All of John Legends tweets were made in support of the 49ers quarterback who refused to stand while the national anthem was being played during a preseason game.Kaepernick said that his sitd own was for "people that are being oppressed" and hell end the protest when "I feel like that flag represents what its supposed to represent."
From Israel’s prime minister down to the lowliest clerk, from the Commander in Chief down to the lowest ranking officer, from the Mossad down to the police by way of the Shabak – since 1994, everyone has been chanting the same mantra about peace with Jordan.The prevalent reasoning is that peace with Jordan is Israel’s most important strategic resource for the following reasons: 1.Security: The 500-kilometer border between Israel and Jordan is Israel’s longest border with another country, reaching from Hamat Gader and the Yarmouk River in the north down to Eilat in the south.The plan was to bring this water from the Sea of Galilee, but the drought of the last few years has lowered the level of the water in the lake, so Israel has substituted expensive desalinated water instead.One reason is the recognition a treaty grants Israel and another is the fact that it does not include the so-called right of return of the 1948 refugees to within Israeli borders, including compensation for the possessions they left behind them and the years of suffering they underwent in refugee camps.The king respects their position for two reasons: One, he has no way to force the peace agreement upon them, and two, he is quite content to show Israel that the peace agreement is not secure because of Palestinian opposition, allowing him to demand more and more from Israel in order to guard its interests and keep the king in power.King Abdullah II has turned Jordanian policy around and is an ardent supporter of the establishment of a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria., one that will be able to look over at Israel and threaten it with missiles and short range mortars that hit from Dimona and Beer Sheva in the south, up along the coastal plain from Ashkelon, the Ashdod port, greater Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion airport, to Haifa and its port and all the way to Afula and Beit She’an.We would do well to remember what most of us have long forgotten: The clueless group of irresponsible Israeli politicians who gave Jordan its unconditional and unlimited special status in Jerusalem is the same group whose idiotic policies brought terrorist Arafat back from the garbage bin of politicians in Tunisia and granted him the closest thing to a state, The stars of this stellar group included Shimon Peres, Yossi Beilin, and Alon Liel, who dragged Yitzchak Rabin into the most dangerous political trap, endangering the continued existence of the State of Israel.There is no reason that the Jewish people, who returned to its land after 20 years of exile, should pay with its very existence for the survival of the Hashemites brought by the British from Hijaz to rule the most artificial country in the world – Jordan.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, thinks much too much has been made of Hillary Clinton’s statement to the FBI that she did did not know that the (C) markings on her emails meant and speculated that they referred to paragraphs marked in alphabetical order.Pelosi was asked by CBS News’ Josh Elliott whether Americans should be concerned that Clinton said she didn’t know what the markings meant.I think that the secretary of state deals with a large number of issues -- 30,0 emails -- we’re talking about a few that may have been marked ‘confidential.’ ‘Classified.’ and ‘secret’ and ‘highly sensitive’ is where it becomes more problematic.The fact is that whatever it was that Hillary Clinton dealt with in that manner had no threat to our security, Pelosi continued, and I think that too much has been made of this.The attention being paid to the issue, she called a distraction from Congress’ unfinished business.There are two things it must get done -- prevent the government from shutting down on Oct. 1 by passing a short-term spending bill and provide funding for the fight against the Zika virus.The House minority leader complained that the president had asked for the resources to fight Zika in February, but not one cent has been appropriated by Congress.Zika funding has been held up because Democrats and Republicans have been fighting over how much to allocate to stop the virus, whether the money should be taken from anti-Ebola efforts, and they’re also arguing about funding for contraceptive measures.
Steve Bannon hired Bill Burck, a co-managing partner of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan LLPs Washington, D.C., office, who also represented Don McGahn and Reince Priebus.(AP Brandon) Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, has hired a lawyer as he prepares to appear before the House Intelligence Committee as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, according to a report.Bannon hired Bill Burck, a co-managing partner of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan LLP’s Washington, D.C., office, according to The Daily Beast.White House counsel Don McGahn and former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus hired Burck in September to represent them in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.Bannon was hired as chief executive of the Trump campaign in August 2016 and was tapped by President Trump to serve as White House chief strategist.But, Bannon and Breitbart parted ways earlier this week amid a spat between President Trump and his former chief strategist.Bannon made derogatory comments about the president and his family in a new tell-all book, prompting a fiery condemnation from Trump.Though Bannon had previously avoided being swept up in the Russia probe—until the House Intelligence Committee asked last month for him to appear before lawmakers—he had been discussing the probe with Trump behind the scenes.
Former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama have enlisted Chance the Rapper for their first-ever Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago.Taking place Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, the inaugural event is set to bring hundreds of leaders from around the world together to exchange ideas, explore creative solutions to common problems and experience civic art, technology and music from around the world, according to Billboard.In addition to performing, Chano will serve as curator alongside some all-star musical guests, including Gloria Estefan and the National, who will headline.I’m curating a concert on Nov. 1 for the #ObamaSummit.His father once worked for President Obama, while Michelle has publicly praised his $1 million donation to Chicago Public Schools.Chance, I am grateful for everything you’ve done on behalf of our young people back home, said the former POTUS during a recent concert.I’m hopeful that everyone who is at the concert today, everybody who is getting involved, everybody who’s been part of the parade, all of you are of the mindset that you can do anything that you want to do, as long as you put your mind to it.Last year, Chance beamed while discussing his famous supporters, who still resided in the White House at the time.
What’s more, the goal was to not just damage the Trump presidency but set the Republican president up for impeachment, according to Ed Klein’s latest from Regnery Publishing, All Out War: The Plot to Destroy Trump.Klein, a former New York Times editor who has written several insider accounts critical of the Clintons and Obamas, said that Obama knew of Rice’s efforts to disclose the names in hopes they would leak to the media and spark an investigation.He knew Rice wanted to encourage leaks to the Washington Post and the New York Times accusing Trump and his campaign of colluding with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the American presidential election, Klein wrote.If Rice’s plot succeeded — that is, if it could be proved that Trump had colluded with Putin during the campaign or, later, if it could be proved that he had tried to prevent an investigation into such collusion — Trump would likely face charges of impeachment, said the new Klein book.She wanted, said the book, to make sure that the alleged links to the Trump campaign and Russia became public before Trump came to office.At that point during the dinner, the former first lady, said the book, cautioned that the plot could bite us in the ass.As her husband mulled Rice’s plea to unmask the names by lowering security clearances, Jarrett’s friend told Klein, Most of the time he had to choose between the lesser of two evils.But Barack could argue that it was his patriotic to duty to draw attention to the possibility that the Trump campaign had conspired with the Russians to influence the outcome of an American election.
Occasionally this brand of extremism arises elsewhere along the ideological spectrum, such as Islamo-fascism, but Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany remain the archetypes of the socialist genre of dictatorship among many incarnations which clearly include today’s liberal Democrats in the United States.America’s so-called liberal Democrats resort to the most aggressive tactics out of the Saul Alinsky manual, i.e., destroy any threat to the radical agenda.Black Lives Matter extremists demand the murder of police, and the misnamed Antifa ironically lives the fascist ideal of causing mayhem whenever someone utters a thought contrary to liberal Democrat political correctness.(6) A telling symptom of the left’s nascent despotism is the public shaming of any entity that disagrees with them, e.g., organizing against businesses that violate leftist dogma by supporting a traditional position.(8) One of the liberal Democrats’ favorite slander devices is the accusation of racism, which has become the supreme insult in our society.Recognize, however, that for the past 45 years, the only legally permissible, sometimes legally mandated, racial discrimination in the U.S. is that which is committed in favor of minorities against Caucasians.There is a more substantive reason for the liberal Democrat amalgam’s resort to this odious tactic, beyond findings of its marketing effectiveness: Liberal Democrats cannot permit the mass healing of race relations in our country.(9) Perhaps the worst of the Big Lies was if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, designed to give liberal Democrat government absolute life-and-death power over all citizens through the enactment of Obamacare.
U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks at his election night rally in New York early on Nov. 9, 2016.Trump stunned America and the world Wednesday, riding a wave of populist resentment to defeat Hillary Clinton in the race to become the 45th president of the United States.
Yet again we see more evidence that the media and leftist government officials are lying to the American public.What is the agenda?Why are they risking violence when it is unnecessary?Watch this video posted on Facebook by Will Johnson, a common sense conservative, who intends to be a part of a free speech rally this weekend in San Francisco.As he states it is intended to be a pro Trump rally, however it is clearly being painted by politicians and the media as a white supremacist rally with a call for the presence of Antifa.How is it possible to have a white supremacy rally when the rally barely has any white people attending?I’ll let you figure that one out!/videos/1875854002678972/ 60 Celebrities Who Are Mega Trump Supporters - #20 Is Unbelievable!
Credit: YouTube Considering over 60 percent of United States citizens support going to war with North Korea, one would hope the majority would be able to, at the very least, locate the country on a map.Unfortunately, no such luck.The laughable discovery was made when Jimmy Kimmel and his team visited Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California, and asked passersby to locate North Korea on a map.Many citizens were upfront about their lack of geographic knowledge but guessed anyway.Their estimates ranged from Canada to the Middle East to Australia.Only the minority actually knew where North Korea is located.Though the political situation in the United States is less than ideal at present, at least the people interviewed aren’t in charge of firing any missiles.What are your thoughts?
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Friday called allegations of Russian election meddling a hoax, and insisted the media was the greatest influence on the 2016 campaign.Trump’s tweets early Friday appeared to respond to Facebook’s announcement that the social media giant will provide to congressional investigators the contents of 3,0 ads bought by a Russian agency.The Russia hoax continues, now it’s ads on Facebook.He later added: The greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media ‘screaming’ for Crooked Hillary Clinton.The Russia hoax continues, now it’s ads on Facebook.What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?— Donald J.

According to Law enforcement sources, a woman has accused the rapper of raping her on his tour bus in Washington.The alleged rape is reported to have occurred at approximately 3:45 AM Saturday, with Nelly being arrested on second degree rape charges around 7:00 AM.Q13 FOX correspondent and anchor Brandi Kruse reports that Nelly met the alleged victim in Seattle after the show.Nelly is the victim of a completely fabricated allegation.Our initial investigation, clearly establishes, this allegation is devoid of credibility and is motivated by greed and vindictiveness.Nelly is prepared to address and pursue all legal avenues to redress any damage caused by this clearly false allegation.It reads, "Anytime you feel like the whole world is against you you need to scratch that shit its really you against the whole world because the whole world dont know you exist."TMZ has posted a video of the rapper that was reportedly filmed earlier in the night.
The Golden State has a population of 39 million people, more than any other state in the union, and more people than in all of Canada.California is also culturally distinct from much of the rest of the U.S. It’s synonymous with liberal causes, from environmental protection to gun control to health care, and that has other Americans judging Californians, and not in a flattering way.California has the largest immigrant population in the union, approximately 10 million in total, a quarter of those undocumented.In response to Trump’s ambitions to engage in large-scale deportation of illegal immigrants, the state legislature is considering a bill that would declare the state a "sanctuary.""Trump claims California is ‘out of control,’ " writes columnist George Skelton in the Los Angeles Times, though the irony is undoubtedly lost on the president.The problem is that, like residents of Canada’s "have" provinces, Californians contribute more money to the federal treasury than what comes back.In January, the group Yes California was given permission to circulate a petition with the intention of putting the sovereignty question on the 2018 ballot.If the petition is successful — close to 600,0 signatures are required — a special vote to decide the state’s future would follow in 2019.
TAMPA BAY, Fla. - Americans around the country are being urged to donate blood at their local blood center in order to assist victims of Hurricane Irma.OneBlood, a Florida based blood center, resumed blood collections on Tuesday.All blood types are needed, however, there is an urgent need for platelet donors and people with O negative blood.Hurricane Irma forced OneBlood to suspend operations for three days and as a result, there is an urgent need to replenish the blood supply in Florida.Donors should visit for donor center hours and blood drive locations.OneBlood, in coordination with America’s Blood Centers and Blood Centers of America, has been actively arranging for shipments of blood to be brought in to Florida by blood centers from around the country.OneBlood is urging people living outside of Irma’s path to visit their local blood center and donate blood as soon as possible to assist those desperately in need in Florida.Those interested in donating blood may contact the following organizations to find a local blood drive and to schedule an appointment: AABB: +1.301.907.6977
Facebook has set up a crisis response page so people who are in Las Vegas can let people know they are safe.More than 50 people died in the shooting and at least 400 people have been injured in the shooting, according to Las Vegas police.Those numbers would make this the deadliest mass shooting in United States history.The suspect has been identified as local man Stephen Paddock, 64.Paddock was shooting from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay, Sheriff Joe Lombardo said.Police believe Paddock killed himself before law enforcement entered the room, Lombardo said.People can check in to let Facebook friends now they are in Las Vegas and that they are safe.Police also advise people to call 1-866-535-5654 to check in on loved ones.
Ninety-two percent of Muslims in the U.S. are proud to be American, even though 75 percent say there is "a lot" of discrimination against Muslims in the U.S. Nine-in-ten Muslims reported having a positive feeling about living in the U.S., even though 75 percent believe it has become harder to be Muslim in the U.S. in recent years.The survey found that Muslims feel that the main problems they face in the U.S. are negative media coverage about the religion (60 percent), misconceptions about Islam (9 percent) and President Trump’s attitudes policies towards Muslims (9 percent).The survey was conducted Jan. 23 to May 2, and 1,001 U.S. Muslim adults participated.Researchers at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) found that the number of hate groups specifically targeting Muslims in the U.S. has nearly tripled in the past year.SPLC reported that there were 34 hate groups in 2015 and the figure has risen to 101.The SPLC attributed the increase in hate groups in part to Trumps campaign rhetoric."The growth has been accompanied by a rash of crimes targeting Muslims, including an arson that destroyed a mosque in Victoria, Texas, just hours after the Trump administration announced an executive order suspending travel from some predominantly Muslim countries," SPLC said in a statement.But despite the backlash Muslims have received from Trumps presidency, participants said they have experienced support in the past few months from non-Muslims
It is a rich if tragic irony that the same progressives denouncing Richard Spencer and demanding that municipal statues be torn down for their alleged white supremacist qualities are themselves closely aligned with a white supremacist-tied group.I am speaking, of course, of Planned Parenthood, which is to the abortion-loving Left what Adolf Hitler’s bunker would have become to fascists had Germany not demolished it in the late 1980s: a sort of holy shrine upon which adulation and adoration can be fixated.Read Full Article »
One of those promises was to be the best, the hugest, the most competent infrastructure president the United States has ever seen.Trump was going to fix every infrastructure problem in the country and Make America Great Again in the process.In that case, you’re on your own, even after a massive natural disaster like Hurricane Maria.Puerto Rico’s debt, which the Puerto Rican citizens not in government would have no responsibility for, has nothing to do with using federal emergency disaster funds to save the lives of American citizens there.The infrastructure is certainly a mess at this point after a Category 5 hurricane ripped through the island, and 84 percent of Puerto Rican people are currently without electricity.Emergency efforts after Hurricanes Irma and Harvey reportedly went very well and Trump praised himself as well and even saw his disastrous approval ratings tick up slightly as a result.However, the insufficient response in Puerto Rico has nothing to do with Trump, in his mind, and can only be blamed on the people there who do not live in a red state and have no electoral college votes to offer the new president for 2020.Featured image screengrab via YouTube

Credit: Do It Wiser Plastic is plaguing the environment left and right and one of the single biggest contributors is the use of single-use plastic bottles.This includes water bottles and those used for other beverages, like sodas and sugary sports drinks, and the demand for them is only increasing despite global efforts to stem plastic usage in the bud.Manufacturers complain that using recycled plastic ruins the appeal of the bottles and that it costs more to use these materials, which will fall on the consumer.There is a desire for healthy living and there are ongoing concerns about groundwater contamination and the quality of tap water, which all contribute to the increase in bottle water use.Credit: Bottle Ban If municipalities would clean up their water or work to provide safe drinking water to certain regions for the first time, it’s likely that plastic pollution, especially when it comes to bottles, would decline dramatically and slow the environmental health crisisthat is building every day.Sadly, it’s estimated that approximately 5 to 13 million tons of plastic leak into the ocean every single year, ultimately to be worn down into fragments that float in the water column and can sometimes become a part of one of the many garbage patches.There are several solutions that groups and experts have suggested to reduce the number of plastic bottle usage, ranging from cutting bottles out cold turkey to encouraging a payment system to use plastic bottles.Surfers Against Sewage is currently campaigning for a deposit return system to be implemented in the UK, which the equivalent of CRV that is collected in the U.S. that can be returned to people that recycle their bottles or cans.
And it was also simply coincidental that just a few days later, the director of the FBI – who served under Attorney General Lynch – announced that he wouldn’t recommend a prosecution of Hillary Clinton.What we haven’t known, until now, is that a frantic scramble erupted in the halls of the FBI to cover up this meeting.What we haven’t known, until now, is that a frantic scramble erupted in the halls of the FBI to cover up this meeting.In fact, the FBI turned its sharp light not on the scandalous meeting between the attorney general and Bill Clinton – but rather on one of the whistleblowers who got the word out.The organization I head, Judicial Watch, asked the FBI on July 7, 2016, for any records that might pertain to the infamous tarmac meeting.Because, in responding to another one of our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits, the Justice Department gave us heavily redacted documents that showed there were additional documents tucked away at the FBI headquarters.The documents show that FBI officials were concerned solely about the leaking of details of the tarmac meeting.None of the documents show top agency officials cared one whit about the propriety of the meeting itself, but only about who blew the whistle on the covert tête-à-tête.
Ever since a 2015 poll revealed that a certain slice of Americana supported bombing Agrabah, the fictional city Disneys Aladdin calls home, its been interesting to consider what other fictional countries have actually messed with the United States and totally gotten a pass.Their children are taught assassination techniques and espionage practices from an early age, their highest medal is the Double Cross and their mysterious dictator (known only as "Fearless Leader") makes Kim Jong-Un look like a teddy bear.These guys had the balls to shoot down an American F-16, capture its pilot, and then sentence him to hang in a show trial.Luckily, the pilots 16-year-old son Doug (an Air Force Academy reject) and Chappie, an Air Force Reserve pilot, steal two F-16s of their own and fly off to Bilya to rescue him.For some reason, all of their worst representatives seem to end up in the United States, ready to coerce American heroes to do their bidding.In "Commando," a deposed dictator named Arius kidnaps John Matrix daughter to force him to kill the current president (of Val Verde).Even George W. Bush could convince the world that this guy needed to be ousted, and he wouldnt have to throw Colin Powell under a bus to do it.The Fantastic Four can bring down Hitler, a being who eats planets, and the Prince of Darkness, but cant seem to overthrow this tiny country and oust its metal-faced dictator?
Donald Trump has responded to the emotional speech given by the father of a fallen Muslim U.S. Army soldier at the Democratic National Convention this week.In an interview with ABC News‘ George Stephanopoulos on Saturday, Trump fired back at Khizr Khan’s statement that he has sacrificed nothing for his country.I’ve created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures.Khan addressed Trump directly in his Thursday speech at the DNC, challenging the Republican presidential nominee’s proposed ban on Muslim immigrants to the U.S. Have you ever been to Arlington Cemetery?In his interview with Stephanopoulos, Trump also took a jab at Khan’s wife Ghazala, who stood silently next to her husband at the DNC as he spoke about their son Capt.Humayun Khan, who was killed by a car bomb in Iraq in 2004 and posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his heroism.When Dowd asked him about Khan’s heartfelt speech, Trump’s only response was, I’d like to hear his wife say something.Ghazala told MSNBC in an interview on Friday that she was too emotional to speak about her son at the DNC, but opened up to MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell about her son’s bravery.
It’s not so easy to contemplate what makes so many people think America’s greatness is in desperate need of reformation, or what would make them turn to someone like Donald Trump to make it a reality.It’s worth going back and reading the transcripts of his debates with Hillary Clinton just to remember how he speaks when he’s answering questions off the cuff.He’s lashed out and punched down, attacking the parents of a dead soldier, a former beauty pageant winner who gained weight, countless reporters and anyone he perceives as insulting him.It is impossible to predict exactly how deep a disaster Donald Trump’s presidency would be, but there’s no limit to the potential for horror.Think how much we still don’t know about Trump – how he hasn’t released his taxes, how many women there likely are who haven’t come forward – and you can imagine the scandals and corruption that lie in wait.And while Trump has a considerable movement of supporters who see him as a great conquering hero, who believe every word of his lies, no matter how outlandish and easily disproven, there are many people, even at this late hour, who are torn about whether they can support him.What you cannot do is vote for Donald Trump and pretend that this is just another election, and he is just another candidate.It is your minimum duty as a citizen not to support a racist, sexist, unqualified, dishonest, corrupt manchild who celebrates everything that’s ugly about America and not a single thing that’s great about it.
The NFL plans to allow the FBI and IRS investigations into the businesses run by new Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam to sort itself out before it decides whether it will take any action.Haslam told the Associated Press on Friday that he will continue to run the Browns.I havent done anything wrong," Haslam said Friday while speaking at his companys headquarters in Knoxville, Tenn. "It still appears to us that this investigation is focused on a very narrow band of a very large company -- questions about how rebates were handled to a very small percentage of our trucking company customers."An FBI agents affidavit, which was unsealed Thursday alleges that Pilot Flying J -- the truck stop operator owned by the Haslam family -- engaged in a fraud scheme designed to keep money owed to its customers.According to the documents, multiple current and former employees of the company told authorities that Haslam, who purchased the Browns for $1.05 billion last October, knew of the fraud and was present at meetings where it was discussed.I maintain that the foundation of this company is built on its integrity and that any willful wrongdoing by any employee of this company at any time is intolerable.I value the relationships we have with our customers, our vendors and our team members across this country and regret that they have to go through this with us, but I trust and believe their faith in this company and its principles has never been misplaced."The AP reported that at a Tuesday news conference in Knoxville, Haslam revealed the government is investigating rebates offered by the truck stop chain, but said, "We believe we did nothing wrong."
Earlier this morning, President Trump took to Twitter to announce his decision to ban transgender individuals from serving in the U.S. military.After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow…… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017 ….Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017 ….victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.Thank you — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017 After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military, Trump announced via Twitter.Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.— Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) July 26, 2017 Trump’s decision will roll back military policy after the Obama administration lifted the ban last year, allowing transgender soldiers to openly serve in the United States Military.This is the right thing to do for our people and for the force, former Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in announcing the policy.It is not yet clear what effect this decision will have on the roughly 250 transgender individuals currently serving openly in the armed forces.
The crisis is a function of growing levels of popular antisemitism spurred by mass immigration from the Islamic world and the resurgence of indigenous European Jew-hatred, particularly on the far Left.In the face of an utter lack of evidence, when Jewish institutions were subjected to a rash of bomb threats last winter, Reform and Conservative leaders led the charge insisting that far-right antisemites were behind them and insinuated that the perpetrators supported President Donald Trump.Survey data shows that the more active Jews are in the synagogue, the less politically radical they are and the more devoted to Jewish causes they are.The government also rescinded a previous decision to have representatives of the Conservative and Reform movements receive membership in the committee that manages the Western Wall Plaza.The Antiquities Authority nixed the construction of the passage due to the adverse impact construction would have on the antiquities below the surface.And yet, rather than acknowledge that the decision was a setback but it didn’t harm the status of egalitarian prayer at the Wall, the Reform and Conservative movements declared war against the government and dragged much of the organized Jewish establishment behind them.And I understand the source of the frustration and the source of the anger.The first step toward fulfilling our duty is to recognize the basic fact that while it is true that the American Jewish community is in crisis, the leaders of that community are in an even deeper crisis.
The unearthing of this donation led to protests from gay rights activists and the h igh profile call for a boycott of Firefox by dating site OkCupid.com.Prior to his resignation, Eich told tech site CNET [i]f Mozilla cannot continue to operate according to its principles of inclusiveness, where you can work on the mission no matter what your background or other beliefs, I think we’ll probably fail.In the same interview, he said that he wished for those who were calling for his ouster to know that without getting into my personal beliefs, which I separate from my Mozilla work — when people learned of the donation, they felt pain.This may or may not be the case, but I’d wager that many of them aren’t such dogged defenders of rights when asked about, say, the Second Amendment.The uncomfortable fact for the left is that 2008 was the same election in which minority voters pulled the levers in droves for President Obama.An Associated Press piece about Eich’s resignation asks whether the episode undercuts the well-groomed image of Silicon Valley as a marketplace of ideas and diversity of thought, and whether, in this case, the tech world surrendered to political correctness enforced through a public shaming on social media.The trite knock at the religious right is to be expected from a regular guest on Bill Maher’s show, but Sullivan is right to call the gay rights activists out on their bullying tactics.In a society which encourages the personal destruction of dissenters, any one of us can develop the desire to spend more time with family at any time.
It’s easy to focus on the angry white men in paramilitary gear who looked like they were mobilizing for a race war in the Virginia college town, Blake wrote.But it’s the ordinary people — the voters who elected a reality TV star with a record of making racially insensitive comments, the people who move out of the neighborhood when people of color move in, the family members who ignore a relative’s anti-Semitism — who give these type of men room to operate.If so, would it also, given the fact of his warped logic here, be fair to use his logic against him and say that he is responsible for the violence of the knockout game, Black Lives Matter and the advancement of Black Power movements like the New Black Panthers and Louis Farrakhan’s Nation of Islam?That was the twisted formula that made the Holocaust and Rwanda possible and allowed Jim Crow segregation to survive: Nice people looked the other way while those with an appetite for violence did the dirty work, Naison said.Blake then went on to say that there are four groups of people who play a part in racial divisions in the country, based on Ms. Naison and others.Many voted for Trump because they liked the persona he cultivated as the star of ‘The Apprentice, he continued.Reality TV rewards characters who say rude and reprehensible things, characters are often cast as racial stereotypes, and those who provoke the most chaos get the most attention, says Joy Lanzendorfer, author of the Vice article, ‘How Reality TV Made Donald Trump President.Perhaps, Mr. Blake should look in the mirror and then take a look at the lying, manipulative and deceitful propaganda outlet he is working for, then maybe, he might get a clue at just how badly he has been indoctrinated before he points the finger at people who have light skin and labels them all racist because of some delusional logic that he possesses.
President Donald Trump once left his son, Donald Trump Jr., stranded on a tarmac after he was five minutes late for a flight, the presidents first wife Ivana Trump wrote in her new book "Raising Trump."Ivana referenced the anecdote when describing a key feature of Donald and the rest of the Trump family that she learned when she and the future president first began dating."The entire Trump clan arrived exactly on time," she wrote."I learned early on that they were punctual to an extreme."When Donald arrived in a boardroom, or took his seat on an airplane and the door closed, that was that," she continued."If you werent on the inside, the meeting or the flight would start without you.Donald once left Don Jr. standing on the tarmac for being five minutes late to the airport."Join the conversation about this story » NOW WATCH: Roger Stone explains what Trump has in common with Richard Nixon See Also: SEE ALSO: McConnell gives strongest hint yet that GOP should gut the biggest weapon Democrats have to halt Trumps judicial nominees
Dickerson asked Biden about a lesson from his Grandfather Finnegan: Public servants are obliged to level with everybody, whether or not they’ll like what he, the public servant, has to say.He asked the vice president, Do you think that applies to Hillary Clinton’s dealing with this private server that she set up?She thought it was, ‘This is okay to do.’ Clinton has said she set up her private server for the sake of convenience, but she has since acknowledged that it was a mistake and that she would use the government system if she had to do it over again.Biden further suggested that Clinton may be a bit battle-scarred from her long time in the public eye, and he said that may have contributed to her initial clumsy response to the email controversy.I think then when faced with, ‘This is a problem,’ I think instead of just cutting it and dealing with it immediately, there’s always an inclination to overthink it.Everything from this issue of violence against women, to income inequality, to the cancer ‘moonshot,’ I’m gonna devote the rest of my life to this.I have been so proud of being involved in public service that I’m not sure exactly how I’m gonna do it, he added, other than the structure of [the] American political system.When Dickerson asked Biden what he’ll do on his final day in office, the vice president replied, What I’m going to do is go home and begin to figure out what I do for the rest of my life.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and his wife, Jane Sanders have hired prominent defense attorneys amid an FBI investigation concerning possible bank fraud, according to CBS News and Politico Magazine.The investigation centers on a loan that Jane Sanders secured to expand Burlington College when she was its president.Jane Sanders allegedly distorted school donor levels in a 2010 loan application for $10 million from Peoples United Bank to buy 33 acres of land for the school, which shut down in 2016.Bernie Sanders told the Washington Post that the investigation would clear his wife of any wrongdoing.Rich Cassidy has reportedly been hired to represent Bernie Sanders, while high-profile Washington defense attorney Larry Robbins is reportedly representing Jane Sanders.
He began with his strongest argument — that the political class represented by her has failed us and it’s time to look to a successful dealmaker for leadership — and kept to it pretty well for the first 20 minutes.Then due to the vanity and laziness that led him to think he could wing the most important 95 minutes of his life, he lost the thread of his argument, he lost control of his temper and he lost the perspective necessary to correct these mistakes as he went.Her purpose was to show she was rational and policy-driven, the kind of person who could be trusted to handle a careful and delicate job with prudence and sobriety — and that he was none of these things.By the end of the 95 minutes, Trump was reduced to a sputtering mess blathering about Rosie O’Donnell and about how he hasn’t yet said the mean things about Hillary that he is thinking.By the end of the 95 minutes, Trump was reduced to a sputtering mess blathering about Rosie O’Donnell and about how he hasn’t yet said the mean things about Hillary that he is thinking.His reply to Hillary’s recitation of the fact he’d begun his career settling a Justice Department lawsuit about racial discrimination in Trump housing was that there was no admission of guilt, which is the sort of thing the villain said at the end of LA Law and sounded no better in real life.By the time the last 15 minutes rolled around, he was reduced to yammering about Rosie O’Donnell being mean to him and Hillary running mean commercials about him and praising himself because there are some really terrible things he could have said about Hillary but hasn’t.By performing this incompetently, by refusing to prepare properly for this exchange, by not learning enough to put meat on the bones of his populist case against Clinton, he displayed nothing but contempt for the people who have brought him this far — and for the American people who are going to make this momentous decision on Nov. 8.
That being said, there are some promising new treatments (with some currently still in the investigational stages) targeting cancer, and they could prove valuable to millions of patients in the U.S. and beyond in the future.This technique can zero in on specific areas or heat the whole body, which will break down protein cells within a tumor and cause them to die, notes the source.Hyperthermia Therapy is very exciting because, if it turns out to be a viable treatment, this will destroy the cancerous tumors from the inside out and hinder its ability to infect more healthy cells, adds the source.Cellular Adoptive Immunotherapy Also called adoptive cell transfer, the experimental technique aims to improve the ability of a patient’s natural T-cells (lymphocytes for immunity) to fight cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute.Doctors can take the best and most active T-cells that have invaded a tumor and extract them to multiply in a lab – the patient’s immune cells are then wiped out and the lab-grown cells are re-infused back to them, it adds.The team found that ovarian cancer cells express an abnormal level of TNFR2 that can promote tumor growth – and the source points out other types of cancers, such as colon and kidney cancer, also show unusual TNFR2 production.Tumor Treating Fields This therapy, which the American Brain Tumor Association said was recently approved by the FDA for glioblastoma (an aggressive brain cancer), usually follows surgery and radiation therapy, adds the source.The site notes that almost 300-patients with various forms of cancer in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. have been treated with this therapy, which infects cancer cells and causes them to explode.
Metal Man is the easiest second easiest third easiest Robot Master from Mega Man 2, AKA the Best Mega Man game ever.Dr. Wily made Metal Man for combat purposes.But since Wily is stupid enough to model Metal Man after Cut Man, Metal Man is weak to the Mega Buster.But he never really died.He is now figuring out his revenge alongside Quick Man against Mega Man (And Air Man).Youll figure it out.Metal Man, although the coolest ever Robot Master, literally cant beat Air Man, due to Air Man being immune to uber weapons.Interestingly, Metal Man and Shadow Man are very similar, as they are the coolest Robot Masters in their respective games (although Metal Man is arguable, given the majority of RMs in 2 are awesome), weak to their own weapons, which are cutter weapons made of metal, and neither of their weapons can touch Air Man and are strong against Bubble Man.
Writing in the Yorkshire Post, Sir Bernard Ingham warned Donald Trump that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not be contained by sweet talk.He also told the President-elect he was America’s people’s idea of the best of a bad job.Donald Trump was asked to show some humility by Sir Bernard Ingham The president-elect has a chance to bring about world peace Sir Bernard, who was the former Prime Minister’s press secretary from 1979 to 1990 warned Mr Trump could not succeed by ignoring US debt and hoping to bomb Islamic terrorism out of existence.He wrote: You need to convince people that what is good for Americans would be good for them, too.Sir Ingham was an aide to PM Thatcher You will only do that if America becomes happier with itself.You will be considered a great president if, at the end of your first term, the world is more stable and prosperous than you found it on taking the oath.
President Obama wont just be handing over the keys to the Oval Office in January — he will also be relinquishing the all-important @POTUS Twitter account.Obama is the first sitting president to join Twitter, making this transition unprecedented.However, theres already a plan for what happens next.On January 20, 2017, when either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton takes office, theyll gain access to the @POTUS account and its 11 million followers, according to Twitter.The National Archives and Records Administration will also archive other Twitter handles, including @WhiteHouse, @VP, and @PressSec, according to Twitter.One big question mark is what will happen to the @FLOTUS Twitter account.While its also included in the transition, its possible Twitter may need to change that to @FMOTUS come January 20 if we elect our first female president.
News Modal Trigger Getty Images Alex Jones and his conspiracy-obsessed website InfoWars prompted a series of disruptions at pro-Clinton rallies this week by offering $5,0 to anyone who can be heard shouting Bill Clinton is a rapist.During an event in Greensboro, NC, on Tuesday night, President Obama was bombarded by protesters who donned shirts with slogans accusing the ex-president of rape.Jones, an avid Donald Trump supporter, has been offering up the bounty to Bill-bashers for about a week now.His supporters have since been spotted at Hillary events in Miami and Wisconsin, where the former president was targeted during an appearance in Milwaukee Saturday.The typically-jovial Arkansan looked visibly rattled when a protester shouted rapist at him during a discussion about the billionaire candidate’s position on global warming.No one can dispute the fact, Clinton said about climate change, after which the person in the audience added: That you’re a rapist!The spokesman added that none of the protesters had been paid yet and that checks were set to be mailed at the end of the week.According to the website, the Bill Clinton Rape offer will be running through the election, or until $100,0 in prizes have been given out.

Fake news web sites capitalized on the tragedy of the 1 October 2017 mass shooting event in Las Vegas by proffering various unfounded conspiracy theories as news, particularly those positing that a second shooter took part in the carnage in additional to the one who rained bullets onto a concert crowd from a room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel.In particular, fake news sites focused on Jesus Campos, the Mandalay Bay security guard who reportedly went to investigate a door alarm on the 32nd floor and was wounded in the leg when the shooter fired an estimated 200 bullets through his hotel room door.Those sites initially reported (without any evidence) that Campos was not an innocent victim wounded in the course of his duties, but was actually suspected of being an accomplice in the mass shooting.On 12 October 2017, an impostor CNN lookalike web site doubled down on that tidbit of fake news by posting an article holding that Campos (whose name was repeatedly misspelled as Compos) was not only suspected of being an accomplice to the shooting, but had actually been arrested on the grounds that he, too, shot at concert-goers from the Mandalay Bay’s 32nd floor suite — and then shot the real perpetrator in the head (fatally) and himself in the arm (superficially) to provide cover for his actions: Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Compos has been arrested accused of being an accomplice and second shooter in the Las Vegas massacre that claimed the lives of 59 people and injured more than 500.Jesus Campos had originally been praised for his apparent heroics on October 1st, as he supposedly rushed to Paddock’s suite, was shot in the upper thigh through the door, and continued to help get people to safety despite his wounds.However, FBI officials involved in the investigation now believe he was an accomplice of Paddock’s, and was involved in the initial shooting as a second gunman from the other broken window in Paddock’s 32nd-floor room.We believe he killed [the shooter], shot holes through the door and his own arm to produce physical evidence for his cover story, then went and lay next to the elevator, the FBI official told CNN.Although some confusion remains, as of this writing, about the precise timing of when Campos was wounded relative to the onset of the larger mass shooting rampage, law enforcement has not at any time suggested that Campos was an accomplice to that mass shooting, much less taken him into custody on that basis.
Here’s one thing we can all say for certain regarding the latest twist of the Hillary Clinton email scandal: James Comey, who was once regarded as the Eliot Ness of law enforcement, a modern day straight-shooter impenetrable to political pressure, will instead leave the office of FBI chief as something closer to Inspector Clouseau.Don’t take my word for it; that’s the assessment of just about every law enforcement official, both former and present, I spoke to in the hours following his bizarre decision on Friday to reopen the case on the legality of Hillary Clinton’s email server, just days before the Nov 8 presidential election.It was bizarre, these people tell me, because the whole sordid Hillary Clinton email saga should never have gotten this far; Comey launched an investigation that developed far more evidence than anyone in law enforcement ever believed existed that Hillary Clinton broke the laws involving the receipt of sensitive government documents over an easily hacked private email server while she was President Obama’s secretary of state.My sources in law enforcement were pretty convinced Comey would do the right thing and recommend charges to the Obama Justice Department, despite its political consequence, because the evidence was there and Comey was supposed to be so non political.It was such an odd set rationale that Comey laid out for not bringing that case that most people listening to him at first thought he was laying out his reasoning to bring charges, as he explained one reckless move after another from Clinton in establishing the private server and private emails for handing all her government business.But that wasnt the sentiment inside the FBI, where according to my law enforcement sources, a near mutiny broke out among career agents who believe there was plenty of evidence pointing to Clintons gross negligence that Comey initially said never existed, and that their boss caved to political pressure from the Obama DOJ.Her supporters point out that others like Bush Administration Secretary of State Colin Powell used a private email account, but that omits the fact that Powell’s email was from a computer he kept at the state department and he used it before the document laws were beefed up post 9-11.That’s probably because Powell didn’t have a reason to have a private server that he could control and erase its contents; He didn’t have a private charity that would do business with the federal government and would become a private enrichment vehicle, as Hillary and her former-president husband Bill have in the form of the Clinton Foundation.
The problem is that the Democrats have something going for them that those on the other side simply don’t seem to be able to do.A great example is when Sally Brown, DNC Chair hopeful, stated that, My job is to listen and be a voice and shut other white people down when they want to interrupt…We have to teach [others] how to communicate, how to be sensitive and how to shut their mouths if they are white.The problem is that the Democrats have something going for them that those on the other side simply don’t seem to be able to do.How is it possible for a party to have the majority control at both the state and national levels and yet not be able to enact the very legislation that it ran on?Not only were they able to keep the Republicans from moving on their platform, they now get to pass the buck on the failure of Obamacare to the Republicans.Now, in a continuing show of their exceptional ability to control the government even when not in power, they have managed to have special council appointed to look into the Russian involvement in the election cycle.Knowing this allows the left to continue to move their position and policies forward, even when not in power, and the right is doing the same thing that they always do.The sad thing is that in this case, this was the banner that the American people elected their officials to turn into reality.
Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press, former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway called on President Obama and Secretary Hillary Clinton to calm protests that have broken out in opposition to Donald Trump’s election as president.Referencing thousands of protesters outside Trump Tower in Manhattan, chanting Not my president, Conway said I think it’s time for them to give this man a chance, too.According to Conway, President-Elect Trump has already addressed the protesters and he will continue to address them.It’s time really for President Obama and Secretary Clinton to say to these protesters: ‘This man is our president,’ Conway continued.Conway cited what she claimed was media hypocrisy, saying that if Hillary Clinton had won and if there were two Donald Trump protesters somewhere, people would be freaking out that his supporters were not accepting the election results.Conway commented on reports RNC Chair Reince Priebus and Trump Campaign CEO Steve Bannon are the top candidates being considered for the post.While she said both will have big roles in a Trump administration, she particularly highlighted what she sees as Bannon’s qualifications for the job.While calling Secretary Clinton a woman of enormous gifts and talents, Conway said I just can’t believe it’s always somebody else’s fault.
(Matt Images) Singer Seal is calling out critics for suggesting he attacked Oprah Winfrey over her relationship with Harvey Weinstein, insisting he was speaking out against hypocrisy in Hollywood.The Kiss From a Rose star came under fire earlier this week after he took to Instagram to question Oprah’s friendship with the disgraced producer, writing.Oh I forgot, that’s right… you’d heard the rumours but you had no idea he was actually serially assaulting young stary-eyed (sic) actresses who in turn had no idea what they were getting into.Let me start by saying that I have an enormous amount of respect for everything that Oprah has achieved and contributed in her life.She just happened to be the person photographed with the pig (Weinstein) in the picture.No, what I re-posted was commentary on the hypocritical and double standard nature and behaviour of Hollywood… In his message, Seal also slams actress Stacey Dash for tweeting a link to an article about Seal’s original post and writing, Ouch, he does make a good point though.This was an observation of the toxic nature of Hollywood and I believe that a conscious people are a progressive people… Oprah addressed the Weinstein sex scandal on her Facebook account late last year, writing: I’ve been processing the accounts of Harvey Weinstein’s hideous behavior and haven’t been able to find the words to articulate the magnitude of the situation.Weinstein maintains that while he may have behaved badly in the past he has never forced a woman to have sex with him.
It is painfully obvious that the communism lovers in our institutions of higher education have had the run of the asylum and wreaked havoc.The rich will just have to pay for it — in other words, the takers will get more from the makers.Failure in government, failure in the economy, failure in foreign policy and national security, and failure in the ability of a citizen to realize the American dream.It is painfully obvious that the communism lovers in our institutions of higher education have had the run of the asylum and wreaked havoc.I don’t know what form it will take or how it will happen, but the groundswell of public outrage and alumni queasiness about the lack of freedom of speech on campus is coming to a head.There was a study released recently which delved into the political beliefs and tendencies of Generation Z as they move to take the place of the Millennial generation.They have been able to observe the two different views of the world, the two ways of living your life as a taker and a maker.Perhaps they have seen that the Democratic Party — the Left, the ‘progressives,’ the cultural Marxists, the racists, whatever you want to call this rag-tag opposition to President Trump and Make America Great Again — have nothing to offer that will make their lives more successful or fulfilling.
President Trump gives a thumbs-up after speaking to reporters before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House.While speaking to reporters, the president said he felt "very badly for Flynn" and declared that the FBI treated the former national security adviser much more harshly than it did Clinton."Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI," said Trump, per Politico.He specifically referenced Clintons grilling by the FBI over her email server in July 2015.Flynn lied and its like they ruined his life.As USA Today points out, former FBI chief James Comey testified to the contrary before Congress."We have no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI," Comey said in July 2016, when he still ran the agency.Theres no such gray area on Flynn: He admitted lying to the FBI in his plea agreement.

Shoutout To This Father-Son Duo Who Avenged Their ’s Death By Kidnapping And Kicking The Shit Out Of Her Heroin Hookup Until He Named Names Want to advertise with Turtleboy?Police arrived on Baldwin Hill Road in the small Berkshire County town of Egremont around 4:15 p.m. to find the late woman’s father allegedly choking and striking a struggling man while his son helped hold down his arms.The man was able to escape the slow-moving van on Baldwin Hill Road, whereupon both Lombardis allegedly followed him out and continued the attack, which residents of the street observed and reported to police, who intervened in a quick response.I don’t normally condone vigilantism, but at the same time, we’re living in a state filled to the brim with Deval Patrick judges that let scumbags out onto the street time and time again.Big shoutout to this father and son duo who realized that this was the only way they were going to receive any sort of satisfaction.Meanwhile the son appears to be your average Berkshire hippie jock who is no stranger to craft beer festivals: Never in a million years did the victim think that guy right there was gonna kidnap him in a van and waterboard him to kingdom come until he named names.Nestled next to Alford, Mount Washington (there’s a town called Mount Washington), New York state, and the metropolis of Great Barrington, there’s no reason for anyone to ever go to Egremont.The fact that this nudnik jumped out of the van and people were actually there to see it is nothing less than a statistical miracle.
amid protests that followed the resignation of the town’s police chief.The shooting was first reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.Ferguson Police Lt. Col. Al Eickhoff told the paper that he did not believe the officers were from his department and had no information on the extend of their injuries.The Post-Dispatch reported, citing a police source, that one of the officers was from St. Louis County, while the other was from Webster Groves, another St. Louis suburb located south of Ferguson.KTVI reported that as many as 200 protesters had gathered outside the police station to demand more changes in the city’s government after the resignation of Police Chief Tom Jackson Wednesday afternoon.The Associated Press reported that the crowd had appeared to be dwindling when the shots were heard.The Missouri Highway Patrol told the AP that troopers were heading to the scene.Jackson was the sixth Ferguson employee to resign or be fired after a Justice Department report cleared white former officer Darren Wilson of civil rights charges in the shooting of black 18-year-old Michael Brown this past August, but found a profit-driven court system and widespread racial bias in the city police department.
Department of Homeland Security and counter-terrorism officials are in contact with Spanish authorities in the aftermath of the terrorist attack that killed at least 13 people and left more than 80 injured on Thursday at a busy tourist area in Barcelona, Spain, according to DHS officials who spoke with Circa.DHS spokeswoman Anna Franko, said that the acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke has been briefed on the situation in Barcelona, Spain and remains in contact with U.S. allies in Europe in lieu of the ongoing investigation.The area was reportedly crowded with locals and tourists who frequent the restaurants and shops in the historic district.Some U.S. Law enforcement officials say the attack bears similar hallmarks of past attacks and the groups of has reportedly called for using vehicles as primary weapons against civilians, followed by secondary attacks using weapons against bystanders."DHS has reached out to Spanish authorities, and the Department is standing by to support our allies as they respond to and recover from this horrendous attack," Franko added.DHS will continue its efforts to raise the baseline of our security across the board and to work with foreign partners to help them do the same."FBI is not currently commenting on the situation as it is fluid and the Spanish authorities are leading the investigation.Spanish authorities continue to remain vigilant and local authorities have asked people in the Las Ramblas area of the city, where the attack took place to remain on alert, according to reports.
Eminem ignited a social media firestorm at the BET awards Tuesday with the release of a blistering rap on President Donald Trump.The recorded video shows the rapper in a parking garage freestyling on political controversies like the NFLs national anthem protests, Trumps proposed border wall and his international diplomacy.Warning: Explicit language in video below In one verse he rapped: "This is his form of , he gets an enormous he attacks the NFL, so we focus on of talking about Puerto Rico or gun reform for of these horrible tragedies and hes bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers."In another: "But we better give Obama what we got in the office nows a kamikaze thatll probably cause a nuclear holocaust."Soon after "The Storm" was released, the video became a top trending topic on Twitter, racked up hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube and sparked reactions from multiple celebrities.LeBron James quoted his lyrics in a tweet: "Racism is the only thing hes Fantastic 4(fantastic for), cause thats how he gets his rock off, hes orange.🔥🔥✊🏾🔥🔥 #United pic.twitter.28BCWpy— LeBron James (@KingJames) October 11, 2017 In the video, Eminem also raised a fist in support of NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, whose decision to kneel during the anthem sparked the current controversy.
Pentagon officials are used to looking for ISIS everywhere they can nowadays, and have found a security threat from them in the Caribbean, where ISIS obviously isn’t a huge thing, but where growing numbers of people trying to join ISIS are seen as a concerning trend.Marine General John Kelly, set to retire later this month, says that these small numbers of ISIS supporters are a particular risk, because in small nations like Trinidad and Tobago, they don’t have anything comparable to the US military or the TSA to combat ISIS.Gen. Kelly declared that just a few of these nuts can cause an awful lot of trouble down in the Caribbean, complaining many of the islands don’t even have proper militaries, let alone something like the US military, a leviathan that intervenes globally and rivals the scope off any in human history.ISIS issued a video for Trinidadian recruitment way back in 2015, showing a recruit from the island and his three young children calling on the island’s Muslim population to join the fight.The indications are that Caribbean-wide ISIS recruitment was around 150 people, up from 100 the prior year.In reality, the threat here is much less about Trinidad not having a globe-hopping military, than that ISIS isn’t making such a big deal about recruits coming to Syria anymore, and is instead pressing them to launch attacks at home.This is particularly problematic for the US because many Caribbean islands are popular tourist destinations, and American tourists are a likely target.Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz
I’ve called him the worst CEO in America because he entangled his company in radical leftist politics — including the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an organization tied to terror and called by many experts a front group for Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.One ex-MGM security guard called to say Murren’s first act in taking over Luxor and Mandalay Bay was to disarm most of the guards and declare MGM hotels gun-free zones.This certainly paints the picture of a CEO with a lack of faith in his own company.Also in September, while MGM’s CEO and insiders were selling off huge amounts of their own company stock, MGM announced a billion-dollar stock buyback program.In other words, they used other people’s money to buy back MGM stock on the open market to prop up the price.Shareholders were forced to spend $1 billion to buy undervalued MGM stock at the same time the CEO and his team couldn’t wait to get out.Question: What if MGM had used that same $1 billion to upgrade security or hire twice as many security staff instead of to prop up its stock price while the CEO was selling?Hear or watch the nationally syndicated WAR Now: The Wayne Allyn Root Show from 3 to 6 p.m. daily at 790 Talk Now and at 5 p.m. on Newsmax TV.
Chris Brown, 27, was stopped from a potential physical altercation by police at a charity basketball game on the anniversary of 9/11 (video below).The singer got into such a heated argument with someone in the stands that the cops were called in to intervene before the situation escalated any further.The incident occurred at the Power 106 Celebrity Basketball Game at USC, reports TMZ.Brown walked away twice but came back moments later each time to continue the quarrel, according to the Daily Mail.At one point, the R&amp;B singer was encircled by cops as he tried to explain the situation.Before the basketball game, Brown did not observe the anthem.The anthem was sung by R&amp;B singer Tank, who asked the audience to stand in the wake of 9/11 and in respect for those who lost their lives in the September 2011 terrorist attacks.During the event, Brown posted videos on social media in which he denounced the police and said he was being unfairly demonized.
Barack Obama has shortened the sentence of whistleblower Chelsea Manning, She will be released on May 17, instead of remaining in military custody until 2045 as originally sentenced.
But it is the breakthrough of the AfD into the German Parliament that is causing headlines around the world.In elections last September the AfD were elected to representative roles in most of the country’s regional assemblies and beat Merkel’s party into third place in her own constituency.In a media landscape where very few papers can afford any foreign coverage at all, and a social media landscape which blows around slightly sourced stories with a further splash of personal self-aggrandisement, understanding a phenomenon like the AfD is harder than it should be.This obviously suits the incumbents, and is best achieved by depicting any and all parties concerned about immigration – including the mass immigration which people across the political spectrum now say they acknowledge to have been an unrepeatable disaster – as Nazis, fascists and racists.The few people who continue to claim that the public’s concerns are all racist are themselves the ones who now look ridiculous.For if the media and political class call everybody a racist and a Nazi for years, and the public can see that these people often called racists and Nazis (Ukip in Britain, for instance) are – whatever else you might think of them – clearly not Nazis or racists, then you set up another problem down the road.Anyone who has heard a hundred different people being called Nazis who they knew not to be Nazis is unlikely to have their anti-Nazi antennae intact when the accusation is made for the hundred and first time.Instead it is to recognise that the concerns of the public are concerns that should be addressed and remedied by the political mainstream.
******************************************************************************** While North Korea dominated much of the news of late and the recent events in Charlottesville, VA have been the talk of the internet over the last couple of days, the recent revelation of the Memo that rocked Washington, which exposes the deep state subversion against President Trump and explaining the tactics being utilized, is being spun as crazy with the writer of the memo being labeled a nutcase by the MSM, who has converged on a narrative in a weak attempt at damage control.So a man that specialized in irregular warfare tactics for the Pentagon, writes a seven-page memo which details a plot to overthrow the President of the United States, by globalist members of the deep state, with the intentional help of propaganda being fed to the media in order to influence the public, using tactics he was responsible for observing while at the Pentagon in order to save American militarylives, and the media starts screaming nutcase, and crazy, and conspiracy theory!MEMO THAT ROCKED THE NSC &amp; SENT THE MSM INTO DAMAGE CONTROL MODE The memo is titled POTUS &amp; Political Warfare, and starts off detail some background on the information campaigns designed to first undermine, then delegitimize and ultimately remove the President, calling it political warfare at an unprecedented level that is openly engaged in the direct targeting of a seated president through manipulation of the news cycle.On page #6 we see Political Warfare Executive – The Meaning, Techniques and Methods of Political Warfare, which accurately captures what we at ANP have been documenting and reporting on for years, including how the media is being used to deliberately push pseudo-realities, in a campaign to delegitimize President Trump, with preferred narratives including the Russia hacked the election, Obstruction of Justice, Hiding Collusion, and Putin Puppet.As is explained, each of these pseudo-realities, is geared toward a specific propaganda point, the first an attempt to push the illegitimate narrative, the second to push the corrupt narrative, the third to push the dishonest narrative and the last to push the idea of treason.McMasters, despite the fact that his stances on Iran, Islamic Terrorism, the Paris Accord, were more in line with Obama policy than President Trump’s policy, where in each case McMasters lost his argument and the President aligned himself with the promises made, keeping them rather than allowing McMasters to influence his decisions, but according to recent reports, the second McMasters saw this internal memo, he detonated, and then proceeded to fire the man that wrote it.The firing of the director of strategic planning for the NSC on the other hand, for utilizing his experience in known irregular warfare methods for and tactics for the Pentagon, to warn of a campaign against a sitting president by multiple factions, including globalists, deep state members within the intelligence community, and the media, forces us to ask the question of whether McMasters is part of the political warfare campaign against President Trump?BOTTOM LINE The fact that the media was called out directly in the memo, highlighting the part they play in pushing pseudo-realities, in order to generate a narrative to influence the general public, explains clearly why they are in all-out damage control mode trying to discredit the writer of the NSC memo that rocked Washington, because he just publicly exposed them all.

More than 100 NFL players took a knee during "The Star Spangled Banner" on Sunday in response to President Trumps fiery comments slamming players who kneeled during the National Anthem.But during Sundays NASCAR Cup Series opener in Loudon, New Hampshire, seemingly all drivers, crew and team members stood with their hands on their hearts before the race after multiple team owners threatened to fire drivers who refused to do so.AP has further details: Several team owners and executives had said they wouldn’t want anyone in their organizations to protest.Richard Childress, who was Dale Earnhardt’s longtime team owner, said of protesting, It’ll get you a ride on a Greyhound bus.Dale Earnhardt Jr.—whos set to retire with a staggering 26 wins at the end of this season—disagreed with his late fathers former colleague.The 72-year-old Hall of Fame driver said that anybody who takes a knee should be thrown "out of the country.Period" Richard Petty’s sentiments took it a step further, saying: Anybody that don’t stand up for the anthem oughta be out of the country.NASCARS organization-wide refusal to protest garnered praise from President Trump, who tweeted that he was "proud" of supporters and fans who "wont put up with disrespecting" the flag.As the final game of NFL Week 3 commences Monday night, many are wondering if the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones—who contributed $1 million to Trumps inauguration fund—will protest alongside his players before taking on the Arizona Cardinals in Phoenix.
I am the red man driven from the land, I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek-- And finding only the same old stupid plan Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.Yet Im the one who dreamt our basic dream In the Old World while still a serf of kings, Who dreamt a dream so strong, so brave, so true, That even yet its mighty daring sings In every brick and stone, in every furrow turned Thats made America the land it has become.O, Im the man who sailed those early seas In search of what I meant to be my home-- For Im the one who left dark Irelands shore, And Polands plain, and Englands grassy lea, And torn from Black Africas strand I came To build a "homeland of the free."For all the dreams weve dreamed And all the songs weve sung And all the hopes weve held And all the flags weve hung, The millions who have nothing for our pay-- Except the dream thats almost dead today.O, let America be America again-- The land that never has been yet-- And yet must be--the land where every man is free.The land thats mine--the poor mans, Indians, Negros, ME-- Who made America, Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain, Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain, Must bring back our mighty dream again.Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death, The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies, We, the people, must redeem The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.The mountains and the endless plain-- All, all the stretch of these great green states-- And make America again!
A lot of voters woke up this morning happy that Donald Trump had won the election, but the other half of them, especially here in California, were very upset, Kimmel noted.As a result, the late-night host decided to walk his viewers through the five stages of grief.The first stage in the process is denial, which Kimmel summarized as no, the host of Celebrity Apprentice can’t possibly be our president, CNN must have the math wrong.How is it possible that half the country is too busy to even vote?After getting that out of his system, Kimmel moved on to the third stage: bargaining.This rationalization period was quickly followed by depression, where you get a spoon and you just eat peanut butter out of the jar.Finally, many jars of peanut butter later, Kimmel suggested that tearful voters will eventually reach acceptance – possibly with the aid of some narcotics.No matter how you feel about it, Donald Trump is the president of the United States of America, Kimmel said.
Brits travelling to America could be subject to Muslim Labour MP Tulip Siddiq has called on Trump to clarify whether to not Brits travelling to the US will be subject to ideological tests in order to gain entry.But his campaign team were not clear on whether this process would apply to the millions of tourists who visit the country each year.Trump did state that if he was elected, those excluded from visiting the country would include people who didn’t believe in the U.S Constitution, support bigotry and hatred, believe Shariah law is more important than US law, or would not flourish in the country.Trump spoke about bringing in the vetting process back in August Tulip, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, told the Telegraph: With the stark reality of the American election now beginning to settle in, Mr Trump needs to clarify immediately whether or not British tourists will have to take these so-called ‘ideological tests’ before being able to continue on their holidays in the US.Jack Dromey, a shadow Labour business minister, added: Is Donald Trump really saying that a proud British Muslim mum and dad travelling to America to their daughter’s wedding will have to undergo extreme vetting first?The best hacks for smart travellers Muslim Labour MP Tulip Saddiq is now calling on Trump to clarify whether the screenings will happen It is foolish and irresponsible behaviour which can only feed fundamentalism.Anyone who has travelled to the US will know the queues in the airport for their passports to be inspected are long.The pre-clearance programme will see passengers going through the immigration and customs inspection before they board the flight to the US.
First of all, the Harvey Weinstein thing, people like this false equivalence of that’s somehow equivalent to what happened in Las Vegas, Kimmel added, arguing that the alleged assault of dozens of women does not deserve the same reaction as the killing of nearly 60 people.On GMA, Kimmel went on to accuse gun nuts of trying take any comedy bit I did out of context and use it as some kind of proof that he is not an ally for women, including some pretty gross moments from The Man Show.A defiant Kimmel added that he doesn’t say I don’t mind because he preferred everyone with a television to watch the show.Shapiro noted at the onset that Kimmel did something last night that I find truly abhorrent which was discard any and all facts as part of his effort to become the social justice king of late-night television and all-heart representation of all leftist causes.It’s really nasty because he’s suggesting that you and I don’t care.It’s because there are certain people in the American public discourse who feel it necessary to impute bad motives to people who disagree and that’s what Kimmel’s doing here.Shapiro on Kimmel’s take about AR-15s: So, number one, the Founders would have wanted us to have AR-15s because the fact is, back in the day, all the weapons that people had were military grade weapons, right?For him to say the Second Amendment doesn’t cover things like AR-15s — a semi-automatic rifle, is akin to me saying the First Amendment doesn’t cover TV because the Founders hadn’t seen a TV, would never know what it’d look like, and don’t understand how it works.

President Obama Male voters must break their sexist inclinations so the country can get over the hump and elect its first female president, President Obama said Tuesday.In a message directed to the guys out there at a campaign rally at Capital University in Columbus, Ohio, Obama said, [T]here’s a reason why we haven’t had a woman president before… And we have to ask ourselves, as men — because I hope my daughters are going to be able to achieve anything they want to achieve — and I know that my wife is not just my equal but my superior, he continued.I want every man out there who’s voting to kind of look inside yourself and ask yourself, if you’re having problems with this stuff, how much of it is that we’re just not used to it.So that, like, when a guy is ambitious and out in the public arena and working hard, well, that’s okay; but when a woman suddenly does it, suddenly you’re all like, well, why is she doing that?he added.Obama’s closing argument for his possible successor comes as GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has a slight edge over Hillary Clinton in the Buckeye State.The RealClearPolitics average of Ohio pollsshows the mogul with a 2.5-percentage-point lead, with Trump getting 46.8 percent of the vote and Clinton 44.3 percent.
(Screenshot) On Friday, a day after former Mesa, Arizona police officer Philip Brailsford was acquitted of second-degree murder charges, state officials released a graphic video of the shooting, showing the victim begging for his life.In the video, another officer, now-retired Sgt.Charles Langley, orders seemingly-terrified Daniel Shaver to cross his legs, crawl and keep his hands raised straight up in the air prior to the fatal shooting.The officers were responding to a call alleging a man was pointing a gun out of a window, The Washington Post reports: "After the officer involved was acquitted of second-degree murder charges, officials in Arizona released graphic video showing Daniel Shaver crawling on his hands and knees and begging for his life in the moments before he was shot and killed by police in January 2016.""The shooting, by Philip Mitch Brailsford, then an officer with the Mesa Police Department, occurred after officers responded to a call about a man allegedly pointing a rifle out of a fifth-floor window at a La Quinta Inn.Inside the room, Shaver, 26, had been doing rum shots with a woman he had met earlier that day and showing off a pellet gun he used in his job in pest control."test test Please support CNSNews today!(a 501c3 non-profit production of the Media Research Center) DONATE
Modal Trigger Tom Arnold Comedian Tom Arnold is claiming Hillary Clinton begged him to release footage of President Trump using racial slurs just days before the November election.The 57-year-old alleged last year he had video of Trump repeatedly saying n—– and every bad thing ever, every offensive, racist thing ever, but is now saying Clinton called him just two days before Americans went to the polls to plead for its release, the Telegraph reported.I had all the outtakes from Trump saying the N-word on ‘The Apprentice,’ said Arnold, who was just voted off Australia’s I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here![Clinton] called me two days before the election and said, ‘Please release that, Arnold claimed, alleging that the Democratic nominee said, The weight of the free world is on your shoulders.Arnold says he might still release the reel with their permission, thought it remains unclear if he was referring to the targets of Trump’s vitriol or The Apprentice producers.In an interview before going on the British sitcom, Arnold told a radio host he didn’t want to release the hate speech out of respect for those involved.The American actor and comic, who starred alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1994 film classic True Lies, also said he didn’t think releasing the racist rant would work.Trump still managed to cinch the electoral vote despite national outrage surrounding the October release of the notorious grab them by the p—- video.
According to the latest damning snippet from Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury, President Donald Trump tried to rationalize why people would join the K. From the New York Times review: There are lots of arresting details in the book.Wolff writes that after the white supremacist mayhem in Charlottesville, Va., Trump privately rationalized why someone would be a member of the K.K.K.Many believe the anecdotes and quotes from Wolff’s book should be treated with a healthy dose of skepticism, but this one is not implausible.Trump went on the record in the wake of the Charlottesville white supremacy march that left Heather Heyer dead, saying he believed there were  good people on both sides of the protest, one side of which was rife with Neo-Nazis and white supremacists.Trump was widely criticized for the response, which many considered a tacit endorsement of white supremacy.During his presidential campaign, an old New York Times story was unearthed that reported Trump’s father, Fred, back in 1927, was arrested at a rally in 1927 where K members were present.It was never proven whether he was participating in the rally or a member of the group.David Covucci is the Layer 8 editor at the Daily Dot, covering the intersection of politics and the web.
INDIANAPOLIS (WTHR) - Former Colts head coach Tony Dungy announced on Twitter Thursday morning that hes donating money to help a city near Tampa Bay remove a Confederate statue.Dungy tweeted a picture of the front page of the Tampa Bay Times saying Hillsborough would need $140,0 in private funds in the next 30 days to move the statue.He said he and his wife "are in for $5K" and then challenged Tampas sports teams to pitch in as well.Since Charlottesville, there has been a surge in efforts to move or outright destroy statues of Confederate war leaders from Gainesville, Florida to Baltimore, Maryland.There has also been a renewal of efforts to protect the monuments.President Donald Trump tweeted that its "Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart" with the removal of such statues around the country.Maines Republican governor Paul LePage went so far as to say removing Confederate statues is "just like" removing a monument to victims of the 9/11 attacks.
Take a look at this nutty-ass booshit: From New Boston Post— As it did in 2015, the Massachusetts Senate passed a bill nearly entirely along party lines on Thursday dictating how school districts teach sex education; and just like two years ago, the biggest sticking point for the bill’s opponents was the lack of an opt-in stipulation for parents and guardians.Unlike in 2015, however, it is likely this version of the bill will reach the House floor for a vote, but it remains to be seen if lawmakers on the other side of the State House attach the failed parental opt-in amendment touted Thursday by House Minority Leader Bruce Tarr (R-Gloucester).Following the 31-6 vote in favor that saw the only Democratic opposition come from state Senator Michael Rush of West Roxbury, Tarr praised the robust and healthy debate that transpired Thursday afternoon but expressed hope that as it makes its way through the legislative process that lawmakers outside the Senate will wind up adopting proposals like a parental consent stipulation.Keenan and Chang-Diaz added that a parental consent requirement would add an unnecessary level of bureaucracy, with Keenan claiming that it would require school districts to chase down the parents of every single student while Chang-Diaz noting that many of my colleagues in the chamber in the minority are avid proponents of small streamlined government.That somehow this bill is jeopardized by the fact that we might want to involve parents in the decision making — what does that suggest about the priorities of the bill?It suggests that somehow we ought to subordinate the role of the parent to the role of the state.Conservative organizations, including the Massachusetts Family Institute, are vehemently opposed to the bill over the proposed curriculum’s subject matter, which suggests that instruction regarding sexual aspects such as anal intercourse is age-appropriate for children as young as 12.Some of the instructional material approved by state education officials was created by Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts.As it did in 2015, the Massachusetts Senate passed a bill nearly entirely along party lines on Thursday dictating how school districts teach sex education; and just like two years ago, the biggest sticking point for the bill’s opponents was the lack of an opt-in stipulation for parents and guardians.
Save Photo by Franco Images On Thursday, President Trump signed an executive order that will begin to deplete the Affordable Care Act, and allow companies to offer cheaper healthcare plans with fewer benefits.Just a few hours later, the Trump administration announced its ending federal subsidies for health insurance companies that help millions of low-income people pay deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.These subsidies were projected to cost about $9 billion this year, according to the New York Times, and nearly $100 billion in the coming decade.The new decision will go into effect immediately, the Health and Human Services Department announced on Thursday.According to the Times, without the subsidies, "insurance markets could quickly unravel."The government cannot lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction payments, the White House said in a statement.Congress needs to repeal and replace the disastrous Obamacare law and provide real relief to the American people.In a joint statement, Senate and House Minority Leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi said Trump has apparently decided to punish the American people for his inability to improve our health care system.
Heres the truth about the relationship between global warming and hurricanes Irma and Harvey.And we all know that warm ocean water is the fuel that power hurricanes.Something else to consider is that, as the world warms, more ocean water evaporates into the atmosphere (which has been documented.its happening).What most people dont realize is that, as summer wanes and we transition into fall, hurricanes are the atmospheres natural mechanism to return the summertime water vapor back into the ocean.The only problem is that people get in the way, and hurricanes of the future likely will have higher rainfall and increased potential for catastrophic flooding events -- also due to higher storm surges, resulting from higher sea levels from the warming climate.There is no question that the warmer ocean temperatures we’re experiencing now have been impacted by the warming climate.So, global warming may have been part of the reason that Harvey rapidly intensified just before landfall, and Irma became a record-breaking hurricane.The bottom line is that, while global warming may have provided Harvey with extra water vapor to generate increased rainfall, the bigger reason for the catastrophic rain amounts was the storms unusually slow movement.

Even Jerry Springer Thinks This Election Is Too Much © 2016 Bloomberg Finance LP A chat with the host of the trashiest talk show in television history about Trump, Hillary, and the State of the Union.After all, the Jerry Springer Show traffics in drama and dysfunction, and that ugly scene—minus the chair throwing—played out live at the second presidential debate last week, one of the most brutal in recent history.Faced with the prospect of a Trump presidency, Springer, a former Democratic mayor of Cincinnati who once ran for governor of Ohio, has thrown his hat back in the political ring to make the case for Clinton.I mean, I think about the issues of the people that come on our show, the language they use, the relationship dysfunctions.TRENDING THIS VERY SECOND travel-and-eats Where to Eat and Drink in Houston, the New Capital of Southern Cool culture Serena Williams Catsuit Is Banned from All Future French Opens news-and-politics No One Knows Why This QAnon Conspiracy Theorist Was in the Oval Office with Trump Well he’s far better on television than I am, so Im not worried, because Im 73 years old.He’s smart enough to know that he is giving cover, he is giving voice to a very ugly notion that you will be judged in this country based on where youre from and what your religion is, what your ethnicity is, and in some instances, even what your color is.I always knew we were all alike and the only thing that separated us [is] some of us were luckier in the gene pool of parents, and some of us had more money, and stuff like that.But again, it’s one thing to have a television [show] about that, which is the purpose of the show, to have it about dysfunctional behavior, and another thing to say, "Gee, why doesnt the person on this show run for president?"
Fast forward to present day (or, more accurately, last night), and we now have former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (and current Trump surrogate) literally daring Kelly to call Bill Clinton a "sexual predator" on live television after trying to denounce the coverage of Trumps numerous sexual misconduct allegations as unfair and biased.What began as a conversation between the Fox News anchor and former speaker of the house about Donald Trumps dwindling poll numbers soon turned into a hostile exchange about sexism, media bias, and the election.I dont think so," Kelly countered—before he launched into an attack on the media as a whole for focusing on the Access Hollywood tape and the numerous women who have come forward to corroborate the things Trump articulated on the leaked footage, rather than the leaked transcripts of Hillary Clintons Wall Street speeches or her plans to allow "600 million people" to migrate to the country.Kelly articulated that "if Trump is a sexual predator"—which Gingrich quickly denied—and was revealed to have a lengthy history of sexual misconduct, Americans—especially American women—have the right to know this about a presidential nominee and the media should be required to cover it."You are fascinated by sex and you dont care about public policy," said a man who spent his tenure as speaker of the house obstructing the president and twenty-plus years dwelling on Bill Clintons sexual history.Kelly responded to this, saying, "You know, Mr. Speaker, Im not fascinated by sex, but I am fascinated by the protection of women and understanding what were getting in the Oval Office and I think the American voters would like to know."The poll numbers show us that the women of America, in particular, are very concerned about these allegations, and, in large part, believe they are a real issue and dont want to dismiss the women."The polls also show the American public is less interested in the deeds of Hillary Clinton’s husband than they are in the deeds of the man who asks us to make him president, Donald Trump.
Prior to Sundays presidential debate, four women who have accused the Clintons of wrongdoing, including allegations of sexual deviancy, spoke at a press availability with Republican Donald Trump.Observers said Trump meant to contrast his vulgar leaked 2005 audiotape with the allegations from the women about their mistreatment at the hands of the Clintons.the words that Donald Trump uttered--hes very embarrassed.hes apologetic for those words," Juanita Broaddrick, 73, told Sean Hannity.Broaddrick has accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting her in 1978, and has said that Hillary Clinton attacked her character after she came forward with the original accusations."Ive never heard one apology for what Hillary Clinton did to me after she threatened me after her husband raped me.I did have an apology from Bill Clinton, although hell never admit it--Id like to see him do it in-person," she said.Broaddrick added that she "feared" a Clinton presidency because she suspected that Hillary Clinton would seek retribution against her for speaking out once more.Watch the full clip above and let us know what you think in the comments.
And now the former secretary of state and defeated Democratic presidential candidate says those of us still interested in the investigating of her conduct are engaging in an abuse of power.The FBI’s investigation of Hillary Clinton was referred to as special in an email sent by current FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.He was the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington Field Office before his promotion to the second-ranking spot in the bureau.Despite a deep web of connections to Clinton, McCabe formally recused himself from the email investigation only a week before the 2016 election.While the FBI was very concerned with punishing the agent who disclosed the Lynch-Bill Clinton meeting, the impropriety of the gathering garnered far less attention.When Lynch told then-FBI Director James Comey to refer to the Hillary Clinton investigation as a matter rather than an investigation, language had a special meaning.Some at the Department of Justice and the FBI seem to have a special bias against the president.As members of the Judiciary Committee, we have demanded an investigation into the FBI’s procedures, practices, oversight and reporting.
As seen on Justice With Judge Jeanine Issa: Comey Reopening FBI Clinton Email Probe Matter of His Integrity In her Opening Statement last night, Judge Jeanine Pirro said FBI Director James Comey owes it to the American people to reveal what new information made him decide to reopen the Hillary Clinton email investigation."Hes got to tell us what was discovered what was so big that he violated Justice Department and FBI guidelines and alerted the nation.She also called for a "thorough, unbiased investigation," with search warrants, empaneling a grand jury and a deal with Huma Abedin to get the top Clinton aide to talk.Liberals Bash FBI Director Comey Over Clinton Probe After Praising Him in July Mother of Jailed Sailor: Hold Hillary to Same Standards as My Son on Classified Info The FBI’s ability to get Huma Abedin- Hillary Clintons closest advisor, confidante and State Department deputy chief of staff - to sing will make or break this election.The American people are entitled to know before we go to the voting booth what it was that caused FBI Director Comey to reopen the case.You have been invited by the target and her surrogates to release the information that caused you to reopen a closed case.In 2013 Huma signed a document under penalty of perjury when she left the state department that she had turned over all classified materials and that she was not retaining copies.It’s time for you to buck up put on your big boy pants and make a deal with Huma for the sake of this nation.
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops called out former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon just days after he accused the Catholic Church of having ulterior motives in helping undocumented immigrants.Rogers was referring to Steve Bannons interview with Charlie Rose on "60 Minutes" where he claimed the Catholic Church only needs "illegal aliens" as worshipers."And the Bible is so clear, so clear, that to treat the immigrant with dignity and respect, to make sure that society is just in its treatment of the immigrant is Biblical mandate," Dolan said."Its clear in the Old Testament -- my Jewish neighbors remind me of that all the time -- and its clear from the lips of Jesus when he said, Whatever you do to the least of my brothers you do to me.Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New York, said in an interview on the Catholic Channel on Sirius XM, "I dont really care to go into what I think is a preposterous and rather insulting statement that the only reason we bishops care for immigrants is for the economic because we want to fill our churches and get more money."Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is accusing the Catholic Church of needing "illegal aliens" as worshipers.[It’s] because [they’re] unable to really to – to – to come to grips with the problems in the church, Bannon continued on CBS’s 60 Minutes.They need illegal aliens, they need illegal aliens to fill the churches.
The reason could be technical – the apex of the triangle was likely to be accompanied by a turnaround and since we just saw a more visible top a couple of days ago and apparently gold doesn’t want to form a bottom here, then the only remaining outcome is a local daily top that doesn’t change much – which is what we saw.Moreover, the mentioned support line could be viewed as a neck level of a head and shoulders pattern (with a rather long right shoulder, similar to the one that we saw in the euro), which serves as an additional bearish indication (it’s only a small addition to the bearish implications of the breakdown as such, as its implications are bearish regardless of the H&amp;S formation being in place or not).As far as the apex of the triangle is concerned, it’s actually a combination of two such patterns – they are based on the same tops and bottoms, but in one case (red lines) they are based on the intraday extremes and in the other case (black lines) they are based on the daily closing prices.It was almost two months ago, so even if you read it at that time, it might be worth reading it once again today (by the way, we are making that alert available publicly, so if you know someone who’s interested in precious metals, but has doubts about using technical analysis to analyze it, please send them the link to that alert – they might change their minds - - - -more-things-change-the-more-they-stay-the-same/) – it’s truly amazing how the similarity continued almost to the letter even though the two cases are almost a decade apart.In 2008, the first interim pause was at the most recent important low and the second pause was approximately the level from which the sharpest part of the previous huge rally started, which was strengthened by another support level (the previous low).The big decline in PMs appears to be underway as the previously discussed long-term signals remain in place: gold’s huge monthly volume, the analogy in the HUI Index, the analogy between the two most recent series of interest rate hikes, and the RSI signal from gold priced in the Japanese yen.To summarize: Trading capital (supplementary part of the portfolio; our opinion): Short positions (150% of the full position) in gold, silver and mining stocks are justified from the perspective with the following stop-loss orders and exit price levels / profit-take orders: Gold: exit price: $1,218; stop-loss: $1,366; exit price for the DGLD ETN: $51.98; stop-loss for the DGLD ETN $38.74 Silver: exit price: $15.82; stop-loss: $19.22; exit price for the DSLV ETN: $28.88; stop-loss for the DSLV ETN $17.93 Mining stocks (price levels for the GDX ETF): exit price: $21.23; stop-loss: $26.34; exit price for the DUST ETF: $29.97; stop-loss for the DUST ETF $21.37 In case one wants to bet on junior mining stocks prices (we do not suggest doing so – we think senior mining stocks are more predictable in the case of short-term trades – if one wants to do it anyway, we provide the details), here are the stop-loss details and exit prices: GDXJ ETF: exit price: $30.28; stop-loss: $45.31 JDST ETF: exit price: $66.27; stop-loss: $43.12 Long-term capital (core part of the portfolio; our opinion): No positions (in other words: cash) Insurance capital (core part of the portfolio; our opinion): Full position Important Details for New Subscribers Whether you already subscribed or not, we encourage you to find out how to make the most of our alerts and read our replies to the most common alert-and-gold-trading-related-questions.The levels that we do provide are our best estimate of the levels that will correspond to the levels in the underlying assets, but it will be the underlying assets that one will need to focus on regarding the signs pointing to closing a given position or keeping it open.
The couple left a bag containing $166,0 in the planes overhead compartment!Lucky for them, the story has a happy ending… The couple was able to go through customs using ID cards, not realizing that the bag they left behind contained their passports and American cashier’s checks – worth a total of $166,0, according to T+L.The man had just inherited the large sum of money from his mother.A cleaner saw the bag on the plane and turned it over to the airline.The airline then gave it to the local police who found the cashier’s checks inside.When the police figured out who the owners of the bag were, they had already left the airport.According to T+L the police tracked them down to their home about two hours away.Once the man was told what he had left on the plane he headed right back to the airport to claim the valuable bag!
Despite the skepticism, postpartum depression in fathers is very real, with estimates that around 10 percent of men report symptoms of depression following the birth of a child, about double the typical rate of depression in males.In an attempt to solve this mystery, my colleagues and I recently tested whether men’s levels of the hormone testosterone are related to their postpartum depression risk during early parenthood.Among animals that engage in the biparental care of offspring – Mongolian gerbils, Djungarian hamsters, California mice and cotton-top tamarins – males show lower testosterone levels following the birth of pups.In one of the largest studies of testosterone and fatherhood, anthropologist Lee Gettler and his colleagues followed over 600 single men in the Philippines for about five years.Given that many men show drops in testosterone over the transition to parenthood, this finding may help explain why the postpartum period is such a high-risk time for depression in men.But after we statistically controlled for the relationship between low testosterone and depression, we saw that higher testosterone put men at greater risk of experiencing problems in the parenting relationship.In terms of resilience to depression and stress, men with average levels of postpartum testosterone seemed to fare best.If new dads (or moms) are experiencing depressed moods after the birth of their infants, they can take some comfort in the fact that these feelings are normal – and may even be rooted in our evolutionary biology.
In recent weeks he’s assured Democrats he backs legalizing the Dreamers, affirmed a commitment to foreign aid in front of the United Nations, and said he’s adding troops in Afghanistan.Bannon says he’s enjoying having my hands back on my weapons, but he’s outside looking in at a West Wing filled with elites from Goldman Sachs -- the very definition of the swamp that Bannon is always frothing about.There, a president is spending political donations on legal fees while his staffers go deep in debt with mounting lawyer bills, visitor logs are kept secret so voters have no idea who is permitted into the Oval Office to influence the president, and a kleptocracy thrives where Trump and his children continue to be enriched by business connected to foreign governments, including the Chinese.He’s got the travel ban (or at least a modified version of it), and maybe the promised withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement; Bannon will claim credit if Trump pulls out of the Iran nuclear deal -- but that’s about it.On trade and immigration, the president has retreated from Bannon’s barricade-crashing proposals and has not withdrawn from NAFTA, not imposed tariffs on Chinese steel imports, has three times backed off threats over funding for a border wall and now come out in favor of what Bannon calls amnesty.After all, when Trump threatened to withdraw from NAFTA, the president’s kids and other aides made calls to the Canadian government and arranged for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to call Trump and talk him off the ledge.Bannon remains fixated on the threat China poses to the United States, has grimly predicted we will be at war with that nation within five-to-10 years over its buildup of military installations in the South China Sea, and said we’re already at economic war with China.The Wall Street Journal reported he described Trump’s great respect for President Xi and prospects for trade, but that the U.S. needs to play a stronger role in changing the system in China, an attendee recalled.
U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton acknowledges the crowd at a campaign rally in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, U.S. November 1, 2016.Hillary Clinton’s campaign is refocusing on Donald Trump and turning away from the latest investigation of her emails, reminding voters of all the reasons why she believes Trump is unqualified to be president.I want all the girls in America to know: you are valuable, Clinton said at a rally in Fort Lauderdale.For proof of her closing argument, Clinton turned to former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who Trump publicly shamed in 1997 for gaining a little weight.The Clinton campaign released a series of ads Tuesday -- all of them with the same message.But in Fort Lauderdale, a protester interrupted Clinton with a sign that said her husband, former President Bill Clinton, is a rapist -- a common sight at Clinton rallies that set her off last night.The campaign says that is not a sign of nervousness -- it’s a sign that they still have a startling $150 million in the bank so why not put it to good use, especially if it helps Democrats down the ballot.But that doesn’t explain why Clinton has added a stop in one of those states -- Michigan -- to an already packed schedule.
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Rolling Stone’s deputy managing editor admitted on the stand Thursday that mistakes were made with the magazine’s since-discredited campus rape story, testifying that it broke a lot of us.Everyone was yelling at us and rightfully so, Sean Woods said of the reaction to the story after gang rape claims made by a University of Virginia student, identified only as Jackie, were called into question.The editor testified at the defamation trial against Rolling Stone, which is being sued for $7.85 million by former UVA associate dean Nicole Eramo, who claims the magazine’s A Rape on Campus story painted her as being indifferent to Jackie’s allegations that she was gang raped at a fraternity.I’m sorry if I hurt you, Woods told Eramo in court.Earlier, he’d said that none of the journalists involved with the piece ever fully recovered.Woods said he offered to resign after they decided to retract the story in Dec. 2014, but Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner wouldn’t let him.He testified that he was in denial when he left a voicemail for Jackie after the story was retracted saying, We are standing behind the story.We want to stand by the story.’ It’s like the stages of grief, he told jurors.
Photos: Chelsea Clinton through The Years Photos: Presidential Daughters Photos: White House Weddings WASHINGTON Newly leaked emails show consternation among those closest to Hillary Clinton about how Bill Clinton’s business dealings might damage his reputation and potentially affect her presidential hopes.The emails, posted Monday by the WikiLeaks organization, also give insight into tension and turmoil within the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was serving as secretary of state.The emails that circulated among Podesta, Chelsea Clinton and former Bill Clinton aide Doug Band detail internal tensions that simmered inside the Clinton Foundation and appear to have played a role in Band’s departure from the family charity.But the new emails provide raw glimpses of an apparent power struggle between the Clintons’ daughter and Band, who worked closely for Bill Clinton for more than a decade after the end of the Clinton administration.Chelsea Clinton told Podesta and others that two people separately came up to her at a London event for the Clinton Foundation to raise concerns that someone representing Teneo clients had been calling members of the British Parliament on behalf of President Clinton without her father’s knowledge.The younger Clinton was recently was anointed as the Clinton Foundation’s future leader if her mother wins the presidency next month.Also in December 2011, Clinton Foundation chief operating officer Laura Graham contacted Band to complain that stress she blamed on the former president and Chelsea Clinton was causing her to consider suicide.She called me to tell me the stress of all of this office crap with wjc and cvc as well as that of her family had driven her to the edge and she couldn’t take it anymore, Band wrote in an email to Podesta and Cheryl Mills, then Hillary Clinton’s chief of staff.
As we are writing this, Donald Trump is clothed in his war regalia as he prepares for a battle with the judiciary, the press, the CIA and probably innocent Americans.He said that This is a great opportunity to step back and remind ourselves and the American people of the oath we take as members of the military.Goldfein said that the oath they too and they always retake every time they were promoted was to defend and support the American Constitution against any enemy both in the domestic and foreign arena.The military is not too friendly with the president according to Goldfein, one day; the military may be protecting the people from Trump.Goldfein indirectly criticized the disastrous raid in Yemen authorized by Trump, the assurance of Trump that the SEAL was going to have a field only pointed out that he was a local fish without the experience of swimming in the international waters.One of the things that Goldfein is proud of is the fact that the military cannot lose sight that they go to war with their values.People who are critical of the efforts that the military undertakes each day to stop causalities are not aware of who the military are.They have rejected the requested Trump made for the military to go for the fascist-style military parade for his Inauguration Day.
I remember our entire family, mom, dad and five kids gathered around our single television; nail-biting tension in the air as we nervously awaited the final out for our Baltimore Orioles to win the World’s Series over the Pittsburgh Pirates.Obama rolled out the red carpet welcoming tens of thousands of illegals to invade our country for welfare benefits; even benefits unavailable to American citizens.The late queen of cosmetics, Mary Kay Ash said the speed of the leader is the speed of the gang.Under Barack Obama, JFK’s words inspiring Americans to strive for excellence for the good of their country were thrown on the junk-heap of forgotten history.Due to decades of our Leftist controlled public schools abandoning teaching U.S. history, far too many Americans quickly surrendered their precious God-given and fought for freedom and liberty for a free Obama phone and his promise to Robin Hood the rich.In my song, We Are Americans , I ask my fellow Americans to repent and return to our founding principles.I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Mark Levin recently penned a book in which he brilliantly articulated the source of my heartache for my country; the well-orchestrated cultural and moral decline of America.Levin’s book is titled, Rediscovering Americanism And The Tyranny of Progressivism The good news is Donald Trump winning the WH in an electoral landslide proves that despite decades of Leftists trying to convince Americans that we are the greatest source of evil in the world, the masses still love our country and long to see her made great again.
Only hours after President Donald Trumps aide, Kellyanne Conway, had a fiery exchange with CNNs Chris Cuomo over whether or not the White House was obsessed about Hillary Clinton, the president completely undercut her argument.On Thursday morning, the president, spending his " Executive Time" watching "Fox &amp; Friends," angrily tweeted about his Democratic opponent in 2016, while slamming the infamous dossier in an attempt to distract from the ongoing probe by special counsel Robert Mueller into the Trump campaigns alleged ties to the Kremlin.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2018 But just the night before, Conway vociferously defended Trump and insisted no one in the White House cared about Clinton.Kellyanne Conway claimed that while many cannot get over the 2016 presidential election, the White House does not talk about Hillary Clinton.— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) September 5, 2017 The two continued to talk over each other, and Cuomo brought up the alleged Russian election meddling, as well as the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting in which top Trump campaign officials met with a Russian lawyer with potential ties to the Kremlin in order to receive dirt on Clinton."The idea that we would have to look any further than Hillary Clinton to beat Hillary Clinton is a fantasy," Conway said.Either Conway — who delivered to America the phrase "alternative facts" — was deliberately lying about Trumps personal obsession with deflecting and pointing the finger at Clinton, or she has proven yet again that the right hand still has truly no idea what the left is doing.5EspkRE — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) January 11, 2018 And the coda of this story comes from Kellyanne Conway, who went on "Fox &amp; Friends," where she talked about Hillary Clinton.
Hails of "traitor" and "justice has arrived" erupted from the 545 pro-government delegates during the unanimous vote to remove the top law enforcement official, Luisa Ortega, from her post.The delegates said they were acting in response to a ruling by the government-attacked Supreme Court, which was separately considering a request to sanction Ortega.The new legislative bodys constitution would nullify the other branches of government, leading opposition leaders to call on citizens to protest in the streets in objection.Maduro is expected to seat the 545-member body at the legislative palace in the capital of Caracas on Friday, just yards from the opposition-led National Assembly.He plans to attend the assemblys opening session and promised to use the assembly itself to attack his political opponents.The U.S. State Department condemned the assembly on Thursday, claiming the rigged election only served to empower "the Maduro dictatorship.""At a time of deep divisions in our own politics, both the left and the right here in the United States support the people of Venezuela and condemn the Maduro government," said Rubio."Nicolas Maduros decision to move forward with a sham election to create a constituent assembly and shred his countrys constitution offers yet another disturbing example of how dangerously unfit this man is to lead country," said Menendez in a statement released on Monday.
Spanish police are looking for the missing migrants According to the mayor of the Cadiz town Rota, on Spains southernmost coast, the authorities have found 12 of the migrants after they fled on foot and are looking for 30 others.It has been reported in the Spanish media that all of the asylum seekers are men and the missing migrants fled by running into nearby fields when they arrived.Moroccan Police look at immigrants trying to jump the six-meter-high fence in Ceuta, Spanish enclave on the north of Africa, 09 December 2016.The 12 migrants who have been found are from the sub-Sahara and Morocco and they arrived on the beach known as Juan and Juana.A crane has moved the dinghy from the beach where the migrants managed to paddle their craft ashore despite strong winds in the area.After thousands of migrants from Africa crossed over to Spain in 2014 and 2015, the country’s authorities stepped up security and passed a law enabling its border police to refuse migrants the opportunity to apply for asylum.The European Union (EU) is now desperately attempting to cut the number of African migrants making their way to Europe.Thousands of migrants have targeted Spain as a route into the EU and the UK.
If conservative investors had any courage, this would be the time to make a hostile takeover of the movie business.Wealthy conservatives are delighted to support the Philharmonic, but when it comes to popular culture they turn away, as if afraid to get their hands dirty.They have abandoned the culture -- and our children -- to the creepiest people imaginable.So many previously silent assaulted or raped women are coming out of the woodwork, it seems like a long-belated remake of Cheaper by the Dozen.Time to award her her greatest Oscar yet -- for playing someone deaf, dumb, and blind while living as a troglodyte in the Gobi desert.As for the great feminist George Clooney -- the first male star out of the box to condemn Weinstein’s behavior -- let’s give him the Nobel Prize in virtue signaling.(For those who may have missed it in the onslaught of sleazy details, Damon assured then New York Times reporter Sharon Waxman that Miramax’s high-paid Italian representative was a genuine creative film executive and not Harvey’s European procurer, as was, evidently correctly, rumored.Damon is the same progressive movie star who makes films opposing school choice for the masses while living in a thirty million dollar house and sending his kids to private school.
(Source: KWES) ODESSA, TX (KWES) - An Odessa man and his company are donating $1 million to the American Red Cross towards Hurricane Harvey relief efforts.The Red Cross said theyre expecting to spend $30 million from their funds on the rebuilding.As The Red Cross is helping with the aftermath, theyre also preparing for an even stronger hurricane to hit the country."This is a marathon, its not a sprint, so this is gonna go a long way to help those people recover," said Tracy Austin, Executive Director of the American Red Cross of The Permian Basin.John Bushman, owner of Investment Centers of America (ICA), decided to give back after watching families and single mothers trying to survive the high floodwaters.Irma could possibly hit Florida or the east coast, needing the American Red Cross to give even more help."We will deploy and we encourage everyone to take cover, to go to their shelters, and also to prepare in advance," said Austin."Right now, thats our messaging to make those preparations in advance and to take cover and go to a shelter because this is going to be a massive storm."
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. - The reporter of a botched Rolling Stone article about a brutal gang rape at the University of Virginia willfully ignored facts and statements that disproved her preconceived storyline about the school’s callousness toward sexual-assault victims, an attorney for the former associate dean of students said in his closing arguments Tuesday.University administrator Nicole Eramo is seeking $7.5 million from the magazine over its portrayal of her in the 2014 story by Sabrina Rubin Erdely about the alleged sexual assault of a woman identified only as Jackie.Eramo claims she was unfairly portrayed in the article as trying to sweep Jackie’s sexual assault under the rug in order to protect the university.Attorney Tom Clare argued Tuesday that Erdely set out from the beginning to tell a story of institutional indifference, brushed off statements from her sources that didn’t fit that narrative and pushed her own views about the administration onto the vulnerable women she was interviewing.The story about Jackie’s rape set off a firestorm at the University of Virginia and in schools nationwide and prompted police to launch an investigation into the alleged assault.Eramo must prove that Rolling Stone statements about her made her appear odious, infamous or ridiculous and that the magazine acted with actual malice, meaning it knew that what it was writing about her was false or should have known it was false.A lawyer for Rolling Stone, Scott Sexton, said in closing statements there is no evidence the magazine knew a botched story about a gang rape at the University of Virginia was false before publishing it.While the women Erdely interviewed - including Jackie - told her that Eramo was their fiercest advocate, Clare argued that Erdely was so invested in her preconceived storyline that she was blind to the facts.

Yost asked the woman why she was buying so many gift cards.The elderly woman said her granddaughter was in jail with a broken nose and that she needed to buy the gift cards to bail her out.This is a scam that we know happens, Yost told her, but the woman refused to believe it.I asked her if she would please wait, and let me call the Sylvania police, so they could tell her that they would never accept gift cards as payment for somebody in jail.Yost stalled the frightened woman for as long as she could while she quickly slipped away to call the police.Yost also noticed the woman had a keychain from an assisted living facility and called them.The police arrived and talked the woman down.The next day, they showed up, and they were the most genuine people, said Yost.
MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace Former George W. Bush communications director Nicolle Wallace reported Tuesday multiple senior Republican officials have told her that to expect that special counsel Robert Mueller is pursuing an obstruction of justice case against President Donald Trump.Three Republicans with close ties to the Trump White House, all veterans from previous Republican administrations, tell me that it’s clear from their conversations and contacts with the president’s inner circle that Bob Mueller is trying to build an obstruction of justice case, MSNBC host of Deadline: White House reported Tuesday.One of them going even farther and saying that the White House is now flying blind and doesn’t know who else might already be cooperating with Mueller’s team, Wallace explained.That was not the only major news Wallace broke in the first minutes of her show.Wallace also introduced former U.S. Attorney Chuck Rosenberg, who worked on the staff of both Robert Mueller and James Comey of the FBI.I was a federal prosecutor for a long time and a white collar prosecutor, at the beginning of any case what you need are leads, how do you get those?The first thing you do, you get credit reports and you get tax returns, Rosenberg explained.I don’t know that they have the tax returns, but I know what white collar tax attorneys do, they get tax returns, Rosenberg noted.
The 100 Funniest Tweets From the Unending Nightmare Thats Been the 2016 Election Illustration by Shakeil Greeley for GQ / Getty Images Laugh to stop yourself from crying.All we know is that the 2016 election has done to American democracy what cocaine did to Gary Buseys career, and, much like being stuck in an elevator with Gary Busey, its hard not to pray for the sweet release of death.A presidential candidate bragging about sexual assault, a presidential candidate threatening to put is political opponent in jail, dog-whistle racism, actual straight-up racism; its fair to say were at a historic low-point in the story of American democracy.Previously home to die-hard One Direction fans and a few hundred-thousand accounts pretending to be Will Ferrell, Twitter was undoubtedly responsible for some of this election cycles most vile rhetoric—I mean, just look at Trumps tweets.It wasnt fun watching Donald Trump routinely debase our countrys political system, but Im not going to pretend the well-crafted tweets that sparked into existence as a result werent also a welcome catharsis.To commemorate this bizarre time in our nations history, weve compiled a chronological list of the 100 funniest* tweets of this genuinely terrible, and mostly unfunny, election.Hopefully, if theres anything left in the smoldering rubble that will be America after November 8th, they can be a reminder that there was at least some good in the parade of garbage.TRENDING THIS VERY SECOND travel-and-eats Where to Eat and Drink in Houston, the New Capital of Southern Cool culture Serena Williams Catsuit Is Banned from All Future French Opens news-and-politics No One Knows Why This QAnon Conspiracy Theorist Was in the Oval Office with Trump /status/695438054887026688 16.
Fulfilling his role as the titular head of The Resistance, Barack Obama took to Facebook Tuesday to snipe at the Trump administration’s announcement that it was rescinding the 44th president’s 2012 executive action called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.It also provided a path to citizenship for an estimated 11.6 million illegal immigrants, provided they paid a fine and back taxes, met English and civics requirements, and stayed on the right side of the law.As everyone in the Senate understood, this was a poison pill designed not to shore up the bill, but sink it.In June 2012, with shifting public opinion polls now in his favor, Obama issued DACA, which he called a temporary, stopgap measure to curb the practice of deporting undocumented Americans brought to this country before their 16th birthday.It might have been, had the president announced that because his Justice Department lacked the personnel to adequately adjudicate 11 million cases, it was necessary to prioritize law enforcement’s areas of emphasis and that, henceforth, no federal government resources would be spent on deporting the Dreamers.Hillary Clinton’s erstwhile rival had this to say: Trump’s decision on DACA is the ugliest and most cruel decision ever made by a president of the U.S. in the modern history of this country.When one considers Woodrow Wilson re-segregating the federal workforce or FDR interning 110,0 Japanese-Americans who committed no crime, the thought occurs that this is possibly the most ignorant utterance by a U.S. senator in the modern history of this country.Perhaps they were written by a certain ex-president trying to help us forget that when he and Hillary Clinton -- along with Barbara Boxer, Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer, and Bernie Sanders -- had the chance to grant 11 million immigrants access to the American Dream, they instead chose, for partisan purposes, to keep them in the shadows.
Harvey could potentially be the fiercest hurricane to hit the United States in years.(The Associated Press contributed to this report) The National Hurricane Center has issued an advisory on Thursday, instructing Texas residents along the Gulf of Mexico coast to "rush" their preparations as hurricane Harvey strengthens.The hurricane is forecast to become a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 80 mph, according to National Hurricane Center.The center reportedThursday afternoon that the tropical storm will make landfall late Friday night or early Saturday morning along the south-central Texas coast."Harvey has intensified quickly this morning, and is now forecast to be a major hurricane at landfall, bringing life-threatening storm surge, rainfall, and wind hazards to portions of the Texas coast," the center wrote.A hurricane warning was issued for the Texas coast early Thursday, blanketing an area from Port Mansfield to Matagorda.The U.S. National Hurricane Center said additional strengthening is expected, resulting in Harvey emerging as a hurricane by the time its expected to reach Texas’s southern coast Friday.The governor also pre-emptively declared a state of disaster for 30 counties on or near the Texas coast to speed the deployment of state resources to those impacted.
The most self-confident man or woman knows that it doesn’t take much skill to walk up behind them, point a gun to the back of their head, and pull the trigger.Raymond Dehn revealed the radical approach to public safety he’ll be taking should he be elected mayor in an interview with Fox 9 Minneapolis less than two weeks following the death of an Australian national by the name of Justine Damond.No one will ever know for sure whether it was the fireworks taking place in the area that night or if it was the alleged slapping of the patrol car by the victim just before the shooting that caused it.As is the case with every high-profile (Officer Involved Shooting) OIS, the equation cannot be balanced by departmental explanations that offer no objective truth in the minds of the masses.Each of the eleven officer-involved shootings involving unarmed females in the past three years is tragic—but the trend shows that seven of them were killed while engaging in criminal activity with boyfriends with a penchant for violence.The most self-confident man or woman knows that it doesn’t take much skill to walk up behind them, point a gun to the back of their head, and pull the trigger.Four days prior to that, there was Detective Miosotis Familia, who was shot one time in the back of the head in the Bronx while writing in her note pad.To pretend that police officers anywhere in America can do the job we do without access to a firearm by our side is to be willfully ignorant of the dangers we face daily in a society armed to the teeth with guns.
Photo via Gage (CC-BY-SA) Screenshot via John (Fair Use) The infamous Access Hollywood tape in which Donald Trump brags about his ability to grab women with impunity because he’s famous is real, Access Hollywood‘s hosts asserted on Monday—just in case the president had any doubts.In response to a report that Trump was questioning the authenticity of the 2005 hot-mic recording, which captured the former reality TV star saying he could grab [women] by the pussy, Access Hollywood host Natalie Morales said on Monday’s show that the tap is, in fact, very real.Remember his excuse at the time was ‘locker room talk.’ He said every one of those words.TRUMP: The "Access Hollywood" tape might be fake After the Washington Post revealed the tape ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Trump apologized and at no time stated that the tape was faked.When CNN’s Anderson Cooper pressed Trump on whether he understood that what he said was an admission of sexual assault, Trump pushed back, dismissing his comments as locker room talk.test test News that Trump reportedly questioned the tape’s veracity—once to a senator and, more recently, once to an adviser, according to the New York Times—brought the tape back to the surface amid an outpouring of allegations against high-profile men across entertainment, politics, and media.During Monday’s press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders refused to address Trump’s reported skepticism of the tape’s legitimacy and characterized the tape as unimportant because Trump won the election.The president addressed this, this was litigated and certainly answered during the election by the overwhelming support for the president and the fact he’s sitting here in the Oval Office today, she said.
The slaughter that happened last Sunday evening in Las Vegas, when an American man shot randomly into a crowd of around 22,0 at a music festival, was the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.This means of course that none of these terrorists came from the countries listed in Trump’s travel ban, even though the United States is supposedly a safer place thanks to the travel ban.In fact, as New America points out: None of the deadly attackers since 9/11 emigrated or came from a family that emigrated from one of these countries nor were any of the 9/11 attackers from the listed countries.The deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history prior to the Las Vegas killings took place in June 2016, when Omar Mateen, an ISIS-inspired terrorist who was an American-born citizen of Afghan descent, opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, murdering 49 people and injuring another 53.While Trump is busy keeping American citizens safe by denying innocent Muslims the right to enter the U.S., he is also increasing the number of people the U.S. is guilty of killing worldwide.In the years since 9/11, the U.S. has been responsible for thousands of deaths, including 7,0 of its own soldiers, in the War on Terror.The invasion of Iraq by the U.S. helped destabilize the entire region and lead to the creation of ISIS, which has been waging its brutal war in the Middle East since then.The U.S. has sold billions of dollars worth of deadly weapons to Saudi Arabia, which has used them to attack Yemeni civilians, resulting in the deaths of over 10,0 people.
The Daily Beast reported Thursday that the Department of Justice has taken an interest in a familiar subject — the infamous email server of the former Democratic presidential candidate and her alleged bungling of classified information.Citing a source close to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, The Daily Beast claims that the Justice Department wants to know how those tasked with investigating Clintons private email server went about their probe.DOJ officials are also reportedly interested in tallying the classified material contained in her emails and finding out "who put that information into an unclassified environment," The Daily Beast says.Before Clinton was cleared of criminal wrongdoing by the FBI in July 2016, the former secretary of state claimed that many of the emails on her server were classified after the fact or that she was unaware of which "headers" denoted that an email was classified.As such, people within the DOJ are reportedly concerned that Trumps vocal tweets on the matter could cause the impression that the law enforcement agency is only doing the presidents bidding.An unnamed former DOJ official even suggested to The Daily Beast that it was "an open question" if this inquiry would occur "without a political directive from the White House."The Justice Department would not comment on the reported inquiry to The Daily Beast.Kelly OMeara Morales
The news source reported on Sept. 18 that the surveillance continued into the early part of 2017, when Manafort had long since left the Trump team but was still in communications with the President.Several sources told CNN that the intelligence which the investigation collected included communications that sparked concerns… that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign, though at least two sources specifically added that the evidence wasnt conclusive.CNN reports that the FBI was not surveilling Manafort during the now-infamous meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer with Kremlin connections in June 2016, which then-campaign manager Manafort and Trumps son-in-law and current White House adviser Jared Kushner also attended.But even with the missing pieces, the fact that government investigators were able to get the warrant, with such a high bar for approval, means that things are getting real for the investigation into Trump campaign leaders dealings with Russia.On the other hand, the report also gives some near-credibility to Trumps old claim that former President Barack Obama was wiretapping him (and by "credibility," I mean you have to tilt your head and squint to "see" it).CNN notes that Trump and Manafort continued to communicate for months after Manafort left the campaign, even after the FBI investigation into the former campaign manager became public knowledge.Special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the investigation into Russian interference in the election, reportedly told Manafort in July that the investigation planned to indict him, according to The New York Times.A physical search warrant is unusual for someone whose lawyer has already been in touch with the Justice Department, as Manaforts has been — and is an indicator that prosecutors had probable cause to believe that the home contained evidence of a crime, and were concerned about destruction of evidence.

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton failed to shake hands at the startof the second presidential debate on Sunday, October 9, bunking tradition and kicking off the evening with two cold shoulders.The presidential candidates took to the stage in St. Louis for their second face-off, with Anderson Cooperand Martha Raddatz at the helm.( After the two candidates were introduced, Clinton, 68, and Trump, 70, walked onstage from opposite sides of the floor and retained grim expressions and stiff body language as they greeted one another, pointedly choosing not to shake hands prior to their explosive 90-minute debate.The political opponents’ icy demeanor comes just two days after the GOP presidential candidate was caught on newly released 2005 footage bragging about forcibly kissing and groping women to Access Hollywood host Billy Bush.You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them, Trump can be heard saying on the controversial audio clip.Trump’s lewd remarks have had serious repercussions in the subsequent 48 hours, including a string of high-status Republican officials denouncing the real estate moguland the RNC withdrawing their financial support from the candidate.Despite the GOP leadership’s distancing itself from Trump, however, the former Apprentice host vowed not to drop out of the race.The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly — I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN!
Daily Show Joe Biden Donald Trump Comedy Central Honestly, at this point in the 2016 presidential election, nothing should surprise you anymore.That includes when a sitting vice president says at a rally that he’s ready for fisticuffs with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.But it’s just another nugget for the late-night shows to feed off of, and that’s what The Daily Show did Wednesday night.Host Trevor Noah broke down the situation: Vice President Joe Biden said on the campaign trail for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that he doesn’t want to debate Trump, and instead he wishes they were in high school so Biden could take Trump behind the gym.Trump responded by saying at one of his rallies, Joe Biden wants to take me to the back of the barn… I’d love that.Noah, now confused about where the fight is actually going to take place, points out, This is why you don’t let old guys into Fight Club.The first rule of Fight Club is remember where Fight Club is.Watch the complete clip below: NOW WATCH: Briefing videos Follow Business Insider Australia on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.

Trump Jr. allowed Tuesday night in an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel that "he has probably met with other people from Russia" but insisted that he did not attempt to coordinate to impact the election or try to damage Hillary Clinton."It was such a nothing there was nothing to tell" his father, said Trump Jr. Donald Trump Jr. eagerly accepted help from what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid his fathers campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton, according to the emails.He is a great person who loves our country!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017 White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read a brief statement from the president Tuesday in response to revelations that Trump Jr. agreed to hear damaging information on Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian governments effort to help his father.050r5n5LQ— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017 The messages were the latest disclosure to roil the ongoing investigation into potential coordination between Trumps campaign and Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said sought to influence the outcome of the election in Trumps favor.1Xi4nr2gq— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017 In the emails, Goldstone wrote to Trump Jr. that the information "would be very useful to your father.""If its what you say I love it especially later in the summer," Trump Jr. replied to Goldstone in one of a series of email exchanges the younger Trump posted to Twitter.A day later, Trump Jr. changed his account, acknowledging that he was told beforehand that Veselnitskaya might have information "helpful" to the Trump campaign, and was told by her during the meeting that she had something about Clinton.He said that he first wanted to speak by phone, but that when that didnt work out, he was told that the attorney would be in New York "and I decided to take the meeting."
3evTw0mw— While President Donald Trump was inside the Pensacola Bay Center auditorium in Florida on Friday night, urging people to vote for Senate candidate Roy Moore, Ivanka Trump’s pointed comment on accusations against the Alabama Republican was plastered on a political ad outside.The giant ad covered the sides of a truck that was parked across the street from the auditorium and then was driven around the rally.The ad featured a giant photo of Ivanka’s face along with her cutting comment about Moore in an Associated Press interview last month.(She also said in that interview that she had no reason to doubt the victims’ accounts.)She criticized Moore just days after The Washington Post reported he had had inappropriate relationships with teens when he was in his 30s.Try as Trump and the Republican Party might, there’s no way to escape the truth about Roy Moore or Ivanka Trump’s own words, American Bridge spokeswoman Allison Teixeira Sulier said in a statement.It’s a disgusting new low that the President, the RNC, and the rest of the Republican Party are trying to help send a pedophile to the US Senate, and the American people won’t soon forget it.Related Video:
FBI Director James Comey caused a major shakeup in the presidential election with his letter Friday revealing a review of newly-discovered emails related to the FBI previously-closed investigation into Hillary Clintons use of a private server.What we do know is that the FBI believes they are "pertinent" to its investigation into Clintons use of a private server during her tenure as secretary of State.In a speech Friday, Clinton said she is "confident" that the new developments wont change the FBIs recommendation not to prosecute her for improperly handling classified materials.Although Comey could not put a timetable on how long it will take to review the new material, a source tells USA TODAY that is unlikely it will be completed before Election Day.The emails were discovered as part of an investigation into former New York congressman Anthony Weiner, who is suspected of having sexually charged communications with a 15-year-old girl.In his letter to lawmakers, informing them of the latest developments, Comey said he thought it was important to update them "in light of my previous testimony," which said the investigation had been concluded.Lynch objected to Comeys decision to notify Congress that the FBI was reviewing newly discovered email, an official familiar with the matter told USA TODAY.The FBI director weighed the attorney generals advice during a spirited discussion of the matter Thursday and early Friday, but in the end, Comey felt compelled to act.

Endless Self-Promotion Despite criticism from Puerto Rican leaders and the fact that only 32 percent of Americans approve of how he’s handled the disaster, Trump has spent much of his time on the island insisting that everything has been going terrifically!Here’s an idea: rather than telling people what a great job he’s done, Trump should actually just do a great job, and then the people of Puerto Rico will do the complimenting for him.According to Trump in the same tweet, the leadership of Puerto Rico was ineffective and they couldn’t manage to get their own people to participate in the relief work.Trump Is In the Dark About What’s Happening While handing out flashlights to hurricane survivors, Trump couldn’t help but comment on the supposed pointlessness of the exercise.Minimizing the Scale of the Disaster In the face of his initial inaction, Trump has repeatedly tried to downplay the scale of Hurricane Maria.While speaking to Puerto Rican officials he said, If you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds of people that died… Trump said.It’s true that the death count in Puerto Rico is significantly lower than that of Hurricane Katrina, but if that’s enough to make Trump proud (his own words) of how he’s handled this crisis, he’s completely off base.Honestly, it was one of the most productive ideas to come out of the Trump administration throughout the disaster… too bad it seems that Trump was babbling without having consulted with his staff who are not on board with this idea.
Nigerian police force used to illustrate the story Nigerian Police personnel of the Kaduna State Police Command are presently carrying out a peaceful protest against the non-payment of their August and September salaries.Eight Police commands namely: Kaduna, Kebbi Gombe, Nasarawa, Ekiti ,Bayelsa, Imo and Ogun are reportedly owing August and September salaries, PREMIUM TIMES learnt.The protest, which cuts across the rank and file of the command, has over 20 protesters who are gathered in front of the Salaries Office inside the command headquarters.Cyril Abeh, the state commissioner of police, who said the delay in payment was from the finance ministry’s IPPS office and not the fault of the police, appealed for restraint.They are police officers operating under the law, if they misbehave, we will deal with them according to the law.This is mutiny.I am in the field attending to a very important security matter, but will be on my way back to headquarters to address them now, he said.Some of the protesting officers accused the minister of finance, Kemi Adeosun of refusing to allow President Muhammadu Buhari to know the exact situation regarding the non payment of the police salaries.
He added that the national security team had been speaking to the president all throughout the evening and the morning.The State Department, meanwhile, provided a full-throated critique of Russia in a statement on Saturday night that claimed that the nation had breached its commitments to the United Nations and called into question [Russia’s] commitment to resolve the overall crisis and to larger non-proliferation priorities.If [the president] doesn’t follow through and live up to that tweet, he’s going to look weak in the eyes of Russia and Iran, Graham said on ABC’s This Week on Sunday.Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said on CNNs "State of the Union" that Trump should rethink his plans for an early withdrawal from Syria and consider another targeted attack on Syrias military facilities, such as the one he ordered a year ago."But it is further reason why it is so important that the president ramp up the pressure and the sanctions on the Russian government, because, without the support of Russia, I do not believe that Assad would still be in office."Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also blasted the president, as he said Trump signaling last week that the U.S. would withdraw from Syria only served to embolden Assad, Russia and Iran to conduct the attack.In the House, Republicans were also riled up and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said that the United States should continue to lead in holding Assad and Russia accountable.The United States must not waiver in our utter rejection of the use of chemical weapons anywhere in the world, by anyone, for any reason," Menedez said in a statement.
This is now bigger than who becomes the next president.Trump is a threat to our democracy.
GOP congressional candidate Paul Nehlen has drawn on anti-Semitic sympathy to rally support for his fledgling campaign, BuzzFeed News reported Friday.Nehlen — who is running against House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in a Republican primary this summer — ran a Twitter group chat where he rallied white nationalists to attack his opponents, BuzzFeed News reported.One of Nehlens stated adversaries was the "Jewish media," who he believed had "coordinated" to smear him after he lost the support of Breitbart News for sending tweets about white pride.The candidate turned to his Twitter group to ask for some backup, writing, "Cardillo and others like him are working for Jewish media.Sources who spoke to BuzzFeed News said that "such requests were common" from Nehlen.One of the group chats most notable participants is Richard Spencer ally Eli Mosley, who heads a white nationalist group of his own called Identify Evropa, BuzzFeed News points out.Mosley is a polarizing figure even among white nationalists, as many reportedly think he sparked the violence at last years "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a woman was killed by a white nationalist.Kelly OMeara Morales
King, who was attempting to confirm the identities of the men behind the beating, found that one of the men, Alex Michael Ramos, identifies as Latino.A group called the Atlanta Antifascists then tweeted that Ramos was affiliated with the Atlanta chapter of the far-right organization Proud Boys and the far-right militia called the Georgia Security Force.Latinos, both here and in Latin America, do and say plenty of things that promote anti-blackness — and most of the time we don’t even blink an eye when it happens.When it comes to discussing racism, we often subscribe to the black vs. white binary that we often see in the United States.What about last year, when Black Lives Matter was marching in the streets and you heard someone (maybe it was you) say, Latinos need to fight for our causes, like immigration reform, completely ignoring the fact that there are black Latinos?The idea that anti-blackness is only a thing perpetuated by white Americans is what leads a Mexican sports newspaper to make jokes like this one, literally days after a person died in Charlottesville: Meanwhile, in Mexican print media… ?0QWfJc — Laura Martínez® (@miblogestublog) August 17, 2017 Yes, Real Madrid are nicknamed Los Blancos, but the joke is clearly rooted in the idea that white supremacy is a problem over there in the U.S. and not in Mexico, where they released a stamp celebrating a cartoon character that is a racist stereotype.please check your URL or return to homepage Right now would be a good time for us to revisit that and not just stop there, but continue to educate ourselves on how we can make sure we’re not promoting white supremacy.
A lady identified as Monisola (@Monaayy), has taken to the social networking platform to talk down on women who are in the habit of broke-shaming men.There is a mentality in this part of the world which has led to a lot of unrealistic expectations from women who believe it is their entitlement to be taken care of and to be with a wealthy men and as a result of this, they tend to look down on struggling men.The lady who appears to be fed up with this mentality, took to the online platform to share her opinion concerning the issue.To expect a man to be financially buoyant simply because he’s a man is just as offensive as expecting a woman to cook and clean simply because she’s a woman.If we’re kicking against patriarchal norms then we can’t *expect* men to be rich because they’re men, especially if you as a woman don’t even have your own money!If you don’t want the validity of your womanhood to be evaluated based on your domestic prowess, then stop devaluing men for being broke.If you don’t want to date a man without money, fine, you have every right to make that choice.The post which went viral on social media, received several reactions from people who seemed to be in agreement with her post.

People pass French flags lowered at half-mast in Nice on July 16, 2016, following the deadly Bastille Day attack.(VALERY /Getty Images) The Islamic State has released an official statement via its Amaq News agency regarding the July 14, Bastille Day terrorist attack in Nice, France, carried out by Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel.Police have identified Bouhlel as responsible for murdering up to 84 people by ramming into them with a truck and shooting at them at a Bastille Day celebration.The 31-year-old French-Tunisian attacker told police he was delivering ice cream in order to get on the promenade, which was closed to traffic for the celebration, The Daily Mail reports.ISIS released a statement about the attack this morning citing an insider source.Read it below: The attack followed the orders of a previous video purportedly released by the Islamic State, in which it told its jihadists in France who could not make it to Iraq or Syria to use cars or trucks as weapons.Join over 240,0 people who get the most important news stories and the best shopping deals from Heavy – Delivered right to your inbox.
When you’re caught in a lie, it can be difficult to know what to do.As much as it may be morally correct to admit your wrongdoing, that’s too embarrassing and shameful for some individuals to handle.In order to cover up for themselves, they just keep making up more and more details until their story spirals out of control.One group of people that tend to know how to deal with liars easily are legal professionals.So when this cop tried to make up a law right to an attorney, you can imagine that things quickly got out of hand!Like many people looking to make a few extra dollars these days, Wilmington, North Carolina resident Jesse Bright had been using some of his spare time to serve as a driver for the ride-sharing app Uber.One day, Jesse was unexpectedly pulled over by a police officer, who detained his passenger, confiscating his items.He thought that the whole situation seemed suspicious, to the point that he was afraid that one of the cops may have slipped something onto his passenger seat.
The Vietnam War, a bitter and close presidential election, antiwar protests, racial riots, political assassinations, terrorism and a recession looming on the horizon left the country divided between a loud radical minority and a silent conservative majority.But America suffered a collective psychological depression, civil unrest, defeat in Vietnam and assorted disasters for the next decade -- until the election of a once-polarizing Ronald Reagan ushered in five consecutive presidential terms of relative bipartisan calm and prosperity from 1981 to 2001.Century-old mute stone statues are torn down in the dead of night, apparently on the theory that by attacking the Confederate dead, the lives of the living might improve.The EU has been paralyzed by the exit of Great Britain, the divide between Spain and Catalonia, the bankruptcy of Mediterranean nation members, insidious terrorist attacks in major European cities and the onslaught of millions of immigrants -- mostly young, male and Muslim -- from the war-torn Middle East.In the meantime, its new Shiite hegemony in the Middle East is feeding on the carcasses of Syria and Iraq.Will the bedlam within the United States descend into more nihilism, or offer a remedy to the status quo that had divided and nearly bankrupted the country?Is the instability less a symptom that America is falling apart and more a sign that the loud conventional wisdom of the past -- about the benefits of a globalized economy, the insignificance of national borders and the importance of identity politics -- is drawing to a close, along with the careers of those who profited from it?But for now, the fight grows over which is more toxic -- the chronic statist malady that was eating away the country, or the new populist medicine deemed necessary to cure it.
On 12 August 2017, just after the occurrence of violent and tragic events at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, left multiple people dead, an image was widely circulated via social media seemingly showing a black police officer calmly standing guard to protect a group of racist protesters carrying Confederate flags, wearing Ku Klux Klan garb, and issuing Nazi salutes: Although this photograph was genuine, it was not — as was widely assumed (or stated) in social media posts — a picture snapped at the 12 August 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.pic.twitter.com/3keTS7bdX2 It was also posted on Facebook at that time by Kimberly Payne Hawk, who described the pictured policeman as Charlottesville Police Officer Nash: A few days later, Frank Somerville of Oakland television station KTVU wrote of the latter posting that: Kimberly’s post went viral.He is getting attacked for being an African American police officer who was protecting the free speech rights of the klan and I am getting accused of being a supporter of racism because my sister is a police officer.The image originated with a Ku Klux Klan rally held in downtown Charlottesville on 8 July 2017: The photograph was snapped by during that protest by Jill Mumie, one of several shots she captured on her iPhone: That afternoon, she positioned herself near an area that had been cordoned off in anticipation of what might unfold.She purposefully stayed in front of the officer, waiting for what she felt was the right moment that captured the bizarre scene that was unfolding.In one outtake, a girl stands beside the officer, snapping a picture of the commotion as the officer stares elsewhere.In another outtake, the attention is focused on a man behind the officer who displays a middle finger in Mumie’s direction.The officer pictured in the image was a Charlottesville High School school resource officer named Darius Nash, who said, I don’t feel like I’m a hero for it.
Watkins hit the the net with her heartbreaking story about her cousin, 25-year-old Eddie Russell, Jr., who was shot multiple times and killed by police in Peoria, Illinois.The department is investigating the fatal shooting death, however T-Boz and her family are disputing the officer’s account of what happened.T-Boz posted the tweets above with the following caption: My Cousin Was Shot 18 Times Including the Face and Back of His Head!The cops told his mother to call him out on a bullhorn USED her saying WE WILL GIVE HIM THE HELP HE NEEDS and He Came Out Because He Heard His Mother and They used beyond excessive force to gun him down also with heavy artillery used in warfare!They Lied and told family members Eddie Jr was at the hospital to get them away from the house knowing he was dead outside the house where they killed him!They didn’t even wait for the negotiator to arrive or is it that the negotiator took his time getting there?PLEASE HELP HIS MOTHER AND SPREAD HER STORY SO SHE CAN GET THE HELP SHE NEEDS AND JUSTICE FOR HER SON!According to police accounts, Russell, Jr. exited the home in an aggressive manner and the officers stated they believed he was holding the same handgun used in the robbery.
Turns Out The Uxbridge Fresh Prince Of Bad Hair Is 19, Still In High School, And Put Uxbridge High On Lockdown After A Gun Incident On Snapchat Want to advertise with Turtleboy?Earlier today we blogged about the Uxbridge Fresh Prince of Bad Hair, who thought it would be wise to shoot a cop car with a BB gun, and then shoot an autistic man the next day.This year Tre, who recently moved here from down south, and claims to have enrolled at Uxbridge High School because the coach at UConn told him it would help him get recruited, was suspended multiple times.One of the incidents happened when he got the school put on lock down because he had beef with kids from another school on snapchat, and he claimed he had a gun on snapchat, DURING SCHOOL HOURS, and the other kids were coming to UHS with more guns.After being uncooperative with the principals AND the cops about it, he was escorted off the premises and suspended.Here he is all dolled up for the first of many junior proms to come for Tre-Tre: Of course he’s the cool kid because he can legally buy booze in Canada and no one else can: Don’t worry though, the fam is holding it down on Facebook and has gone full free my boi!Apparently his response to the cops after he shot the autistic man was that he didn’t know he had autism.This is what happens when administrators value their graduation rates more than the well-being of the entire school – they keep shitheads like this in school instead of expelling them.
In his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, he had 23 guns, some of which were outfitted with bump stocks (devices which allow semi-automatic weapons the capability to mimic the gunfire of automatic weapons).In the wake of the worst mass shooting in modern United States history, the NRA CEOs response to the Las Vegas shooting was defiant, belligerent, and utterly tone deaf.The NRA CEO lashed out and accused them of trying to politicize a tragedy, and attempting to piggyback their whole agenda to ban guns, restrict law abiding people for the last 20 years, this circus, on the back of this tragedy.The CEO became especially agitated when discussing what he believes to be the double standard coming out of Hollywood: We spend millions of dollars every year, teaching people safety and responsibility, and this Hollywood crowd makes billions teaching gun irresponsibility to the American public.When LaPierre accused those unnamed "Hollywood elites" of "protecting themselves with guns," while supposedly wanting to get rid of guns, he has clearly forgotten that few people who have weighed in on stricter gun control have not called for an outright ban of firearms, according to Salon.Americans own nearly half of the civilian-owned firearmsin the world, according to CNN, 310 million of the 650 million civilian-owned firearms worldwide.There are more public mass shootings in the United States than any other country in the world, according to the same study by the PEW Center.The reality is, the families of those victims need a real, informed, empathetic response to the mass shooting.
******************************************************************************** If you recall, then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was one that was always talking about money in politics while hypocritically soliciting donations from some of the world’s most corrupt people and organizations.Now, it’s come to light that Clinton apparently funneled over $800,0 from her campaign money to her new political PAC, Onward Together, which is backing several groups of resistance against the current administration, including ANTIFA.Clinton transferred$800,0 from her failed 2016 presidential campaign to Onward Together shortly before announcing the group’s launch in May, documents the campaign filed with the FEC reveal.In an email signed by her that went out last week asking for money, Clinton wrote, You may not have heard much about the work we’re doing at Onward Together, Clinton wrote.That’s because we’re working behind the scene to fund, support, and amplify the work of the groups we’re supporting.Revolutionary Hearing Aid Is Now Giving Free Fit &amp; Feel Samples Each of five political groups that were mentioned were contacted by The Daily Caller and asked if they were being funded and supported by Onward Together.Kalla added that Clinton’s group has been amplifying and highlighting our work through their digital networks, which she explained has consisted of retweeting [Indivisible], and they’ve highlighted our work via their emails to their list too.Meanwhile, because the Trump administration did not keep its promise to investigate and seek prosecution of Mrs. Clinton, she is freely promoting her blame book, What Happened, and now she is funding the little Communists known as ANTIFA, which are working against the administration and against the very heart and soul of American culture and history.
Trump is creating a pro-business majority at the National Labor Relations Board, which will roll back Obamas efforts to make it easier for workers to organize, and make it possible to hold home companies responsible for the employment practices of their franchisees.Unions increase the voice and power of workers in the workplace, helping to keep executive accountable, and to protect workers from abuse.But as the money in politics has gotten bigger and the unions have gotten weaker, the Wall Street wing of the Democratic Party has become more powerful.As the parties have polarized, Republicans have taken the gloves off, risking the votes of the 40 percent of union members who back Republicans in order to crush a pillar of the Democratic coalition.And if the Supreme Court bans the collection of agency fees in the public sector (thus imposing "right to work"), public-sector union membership could halve in a decade.Trump is creating a pro-business majority at the National Labor Relations Board, which will roll back Obamas efforts to make it easier for workers to organize, and make it possible to hold home companies responsible for the employment practices of their franchisees.Unions increase the voice and power of workers in the workplace, helping to keep executive accountable, and to protect workers from abuse.But as the money in politics has gotten bigger and the unions have gotten weaker, the Wall Street wing of the Democratic Party has become more powerful.
When the Graham-Cassidy bill failed to reach the Senate floor last week, the media wanted to put a stake in the heart of the administration’s agenda, declaring all Obamacare repeal efforts to be dead.We outline five popular conservative actions Congress and the president can take by the end of the year to protect taxpayers and those disproportionately harmed by the ACA while the larger repeal effort remains delayed until next year.Americans should be encouraged to know that conservatives in the Senate have introduced legislation to stop the health insurance tax and the medical device tax.While bipartisanship is a key to success in getting legislation passed, the president and conservatives in Congress ought to fight back against all efforts to bail out this law.The third step needed to cripple the health care law and protect Americans is for President Trump to direct the IRS to weaken the individual mandate and expand the hardship exemptions.The two final steps the president and Republicans in Congress can take before the end of the year is to fully implement 90 percent cuts to Obamacare marketing, which would save the federal government some $90 million, and fully protect American seniors from new taxes on Medicare plans.Time is running out, and President Trump and Republicans in Congress must act now to stop new Obamacare taxes, end the cronyism of bailouts, free Americans from burdensome federal mandates, cut wasteful ACA marketing, and protect America’s seniors.President Trump and conservatives have it within their power today to stop the most harmful aspects of the health care law, but time is short; the time to act is now.
Here’s what Booker found when he investigated the hacking of the temperature data computer models: From The Real Global Warming Disaster by Christopher Booker: (bold emphasis added) Nothing alerted us more to the curious nature of the global warming scare than the peculiar tactics used by the IPCC to promote its orthodoxy, brooking no dissent.The most notorious instance of this was the extraordinary prominence it gave in 2001 to the so-called ‘hockey stick’ graph, mysteriously produced by a relatively unknown young US scientist, which completely redrew the accepted historical record by purporting to show temperatures in the late twentieth century having shot upwards to a level far higher than had ever been known before.Then it transpired that, in order to show the twentieth-century section of the graph, the terrifying upward flick of temperatures at the end of the ‘hockey stick’, spliced in with the tree-ring data had been a set of twentieth-century temperature readings, as recorded by more than 2,0 weather stations across the earth’s surface.It was these which more than anything helped to confirm the most dramatic conclusion of the study, that temperatures in the closing decades of the twentieth century had been shooting up to levels unprecedented in the history of the last 1,0 years, culminating in the ‘warmest year of the millennium’, 1998.The reluctance of the IPCC to take proper account of this, he observed, confirmed the suspicion of ‘many scientists involved in the process’ that the IPCC’s stance on global warming was ‘guided more by policymakers and politicians than by scientists’.The question the two researchers had asked of every study was whether or not it showed a ‘discernible climate anomaly’ at the time of (1) the Little Ice Age and (2) the Mediaeval Warm Period; and (3) whether it had shown the twentieth century to be the warmest time in the Millennium.The conclusion of Soon and Baliunas was that ‘Across the world, many records reveal that the twentieth century is probably not the warmest nor a uniquely extreme climatic period of the last millennium.’ But if Mann and his colleagues had got the picture as wrong as this survey of the literature suggested, nothing did more to expose just how this might have come about than a remarkable feat of analysis carried out later in the same year by two Canadians and published in October 2003.When these were put together, however, the algorithm emphasised the twentieth-century rise by giving ‘390 times as much weight’ to the bristlecone pines as to the trees from Arkansas.45 In other words, although Mann had used hundreds of tree ring proxies from all over North America, most showing a flattish line like that from Arkansas, the PCAs used to determine their relative significance had given enormously greater weight to those Californian bristlecones with their anomalous ‘hockey stick’ pattern.
Many Muslims are peaceful and tolerant, and it has become fashionable in the West to portray Islam as a peaceful and tolerant religion, even in the wake of terrorist attacks like the recent one in New York.In "Heretic," Ayaan Hirsi Ali explains the shackles of sharia for women, including "the right of men to have unfettered sexual access to their wives, the right of men to practice polygamy, and the restriction of womens legal rights in divorce cases, in estate law, in cases of rape, in court testimony, and in consent to marriage."As chronicled in the Islamic State on-line magazine "Dabiq," "After capture, the Yazidi women and children were then divided according to the Sharīah amongst the fighters of the Islamic State who participated in the Sinjar operations, after one fifth of the slaves were transferred to the Islamic States authority to be divided."According to a report in The New York Times, one of the captives, a 12-year-old Yazidi child, was raped by a devout Muslim fighter who "took the time to explain that what he was about to do was not a sin.In 627, Muhammad and his fighters invaded the villages of the prosperous Banu Mustaliq Jewish tribe on the shores of the Red Sea.As with the Yazidis, the Jewish men and boys murdered by Muhammad and his Muslim hordes were spared the unthinkable atrocities their loved ones were about to suffer.Because, as chronicled in "Dabiq," what the Islamic State does in the 21st century is an authentic application of the teachings and practices of Muhammad.Hank Hanegraaff is the author of "MUSLIM: What You Need to Know about the Worlds Fastest-Growing Religion" and the host of the "Bible Answer Man" radio broadcast and the "Hank Unplugged" podcast.
By FoxNews: City officials in Los Angeles have been trying to legalize street vending for years — L.A. is one of the few major cities where the practice is still illegal — but their efforts are finally gaining ground with local lawmakers.So, in order to prevent U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officials from having another reason to detain, arrest or deport vendors, the Los Angeles City Council is moving to legalize vendor operations across the city.Well this sovereign citizen’s vehicle license was to the point, displaying the special characters PRIVATE below which were the words Not for Commerce Use – Private Mode of Travel.Since Garrison’s vehicle was involved in the commission of a crime, law enforcement authorities reserve the right to tow said mode of transportation.This is not the first time a self-professed sovereign citizen motoring down a tax-payer funder public roadway was stopped by police and arrested for vehicle’s attached license plate.Therefore, the Tea Party –whose mission is to bring awareness to any issue which challenges the security, sovereignty, or domestic tranquility of our beloved nation, the United States of America– is definitely not in the cards for this bunch.The FBI defines sovereign citizens as  domestic terrorism made of members who are deemed anti-government extremists who believe that even though they physically reside in this country, they are separate or ‘sovereign’ from the United States.He may also have had the experience of listening to lyrics such as I Fought the Law and the Law Won.
The outage only lasted around 30-45 minutes, but users believe it had to do with WikiLeaks, the U.S. election, and a DDoS attack.Before the outage, WikiLeaks tweeted about #DNCLeak2, a release of 8263 new emails from the DNC.It seems to be true that #DNCLeak2was trending on Twitter before the blackout, but has since been removed from the trends list.A bit after the outage, the hashtag was added to the trends list once again.A screencap of Twitter’s U.S. trends taken at 11:54 PM PST on November 6, 2016 (after the outage).(Twitter) Many are connecting the #DNCLeak2, which implied the Clintons were responsible for the killing of Vince Foster — whose death was ruled a suicide.— Deplorable Jack!(@risetoflyy) November 7, 2016 Do you think Twitter was in on the outage?
Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Mr Sanders, a senator from Vermont, was asked whether he would have fared better against President-elect Trump than Mrs Clinton.There are polls out that suggest that but the answer is you don’t know, you really don’t know, he told the Today programme.Pressed again on whether he would have proved a tougher challenge for Mr Trump, Mr Sanders continued to dodge the question.The 75-year-old then said it was important to note Hillary Clinton actually won the popular vote ahead of Mr Trump.While more people voted for the former Secretary of State, Mr Trump triumphed in the all-important electoral college, winning 290 electoral votes to Mrs Clinton’s 232.In his new book, ‘Our Revolution’, Mr Sanders has called for a fundamental reassessment of the Democratic Party – which he believes has lost sight of its basic principles.Speaking to NPR Mr Sanders said: I think it’s time for a fundamental reassessment and I think what that reassessment has got to entail is to understand that we cannot have a party that will win if we continue to become dependent on big money interests and campaign fundraisers all over this country.Discussing the shift of voters from Barack Obama to Donald Trump , Mr Sanders added: I think a lot of people who voted for Barack Obama in 2008, voted for Barack Obama in 2012, and who like Barack Obama, said ‘You know what, I am going to go for Trump because he has been clear about feeling the pain of working families.
Shahs of Sunset Recap With a tumultuous and long-standing feud between Reza Farahan and Golnesa GG Gharachedaghi finally resolved, the Shahs of Sunset can get back to more important things, like peace in the Middle East.And everyone knows you can only sell kaftans out of a non-working refrigerator for so long before you have to upgrade to a ramshackled store front, which is exactly what Asa is doing.Never mind that, Asa has some sage to burn and twirls of happiness to make around the space so that it is cleansed and ready to sell kaftans.He also isn’t known for being culturally sensitive but he explains that being a refugee from a war-torn country, where you can be hung for being gay, leaves him with a desire to poke fun at it as a way of coping with his feelings.Fashion Week, GG (not to be confused with Gigi, an actual supermodel), has arrived to the show and is already swigging champagne and ordering around hair and makeup like she’s been a horrible person all her life.Shervin comes to support her but can’t manage to even have a conversation, thanks to all the naked models in the room.Yes, Mike opened a moving company and he says it’s not sexy but it’s a solid investment in a business because you can’t replace movers with robots.That’s enough for GG to fully get on board and agree to go to Israel so she celebrates by grinding on Mike, proving that all you need is love and a little dry humping to make the world a better place.

Clinton asked followers to put politics aside and stand up to the NRA.Our grief isnt enough.We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get.Her response, which also called for a change in access to firearms, contrasted President Donald Trump’s response: My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting.Trump called himself a defender of gun rights and the Second Amendment, while Clinton called for common sense regulations on who was able to buy weapons and the need for background checks.It is positively infuriating that my colleagues in Congress are so afraid of the gun industry that they pretend there aren’t public policy responses to this epidemic.The primary suspect, Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nev., was found dead in his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, where he had at least 10 rifles and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

When the constitution was being forged, there was much discussion about what exactly the nation was to be.Some wanted only the loosest of connections between the states, with states being more like individual nations and the Federal Government being little more than a common union, agreeing to join together to protect from outside forces that would attempt to harm any state.When the northern states decided that slavery was to be illegal, southern states were concerned about how they would continue to run their plantations.The issue of "states rights" was one of the largest concerns during the time before the civil war broke out.Southern states wanted to decide for themselves if slavery was to be legal, not letting northern states make such decisions for them.People from the north found the practice to be so reprehensible that they wanted to force the south to stop the practice.While slavery was a significant reason for the civil war, States Rights divided the nation and the defeat of states rights was a significant blow to the efforts of the original founders of the constitution.19 people found this useful
Former President Barack Obama has reportedly been called to serve jury duty next month, according to The Chicago Tribune.On Friday, Chief Judge Tim Evans reportedly told county commissioners during a budget hearing that Obama had not only been called for jury duty in Cook County, but that he was also planning on serving it, according to the Tribune.He made it crystal-clear to me through his representative that he would carry out his public duty as a citizen and resident of this community, Evans later told the newspaper.Last week, Obama joined forces with the four other living former United States presidents to host a relief concert to aid victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.The event, Deep From the Heart: The One America Appeal, was held at Texas A&amp;M and featured performances by Sam Moore, Yolanda Evans, Lyle Lovett and a special guest appearance from Lady Gaga — and it apparently also featured a little comedy from George W. Bush.Bush, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton After all five former presidents took the stage at the event, Bill Clinton stepped to the mic to deliver remarks.Meanwhile, behind him, the younger Bush made an unknown comment to Obama out of the corner of his mouth, prompting his predecessor to break into laughter.While Bush’s remark was sadly inaudible to the rest of us, Stephen Colbert stepped up to offer some guesses at what he said during Monday’s episode of The Late Show.
Source: giphy By Tom.During the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in New Delhi on Friday, former President Barack Obama threw some expert-level shade President Donald Trumps way.As the world knows, Trump cant tear himself away from Twitter.He seems to thrive on approval, especially on social media.So imagine how it burns that Obama has twice as many followers as Trump.In a conversation with journalist Karan Thapar, Obama said: And look, Ive got 100 million Twitter followers.I mean, I actually have more than other people who use it more often.
Long before President Trump was a glint in the Tea Party’s eye, the Breitbart News chairman was hard at work laying the foundation to what would be a dominating force in Republican politics at the intersection of Conservatism, Libertarianism and Populism – promoting the likes of Sarah Palin, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul to national prominence.CNN’s Dana Bash reports the political tactician is setting his sights on the 2018 midterms, crisscrossing the country in search of populist candidates to remake the Republican Party, and blackballing swamp creatures who refuse to be drained.From CNN: The populist movement is going to do a house cleaning of all those individuals that made a living off the conservative grassroots while stabbing them in the back, a source familiar with Bannon’s thinking tells CNN.Bannon is spreading the word that he believes Roe is responsible for dirty tactics against Moore, and alleging that Roe worked with President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner to mislead Trump about the state of the race in Alabama in and around Trump’s endorsement of Strange.As President Trump and Steve Bannon, two of the Right’s most influential figures today continue to remake the Republican Party, an important question arises; In whose image will the future of the Conservative movement be cast?For some reason, however, Trump’s most vocal opponents on the right didn’t seem to be caught off guard by his deal, with a smirking Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, as ‘Never-Trumpers’ have long warned that the President was nothing more than a chameleon who couldn’t be trusted to prosecute the Republican agenda.Bannon’s endgame Steve Bannon’s refusal to bend the knee to deep-state establishmentarians would betray his mission; elect enough Populist Conservatives to Congress to successfully implement the MAGA agenda in earnest – reshaping the country to such a degree that even if a Democrat manages to win the presidency, Populism and Economic Nationalism continue to dominate the political spectrum – restoring faith in government among the abandoned middle class.This approach appeals to Trump’s base, who went to the polling booths to actively resist threats to National Security, the economy, and the American way of life.
Show Caption While President Donald Trump is attempting to fulfill his campaign promise to reduce illegal immigration, some young adults who were raised in America are fearing deportation.Among those who could be deported is Jesus Contreras, a 23-year-old paramedic who worked six-straight days last week, rescuing fellow Houston-area residents from the flooding left behind from Hurricane Harvey.Contreras told NBC News last week that his family came to the United States when he was age 6.Those 800,0 young undocumented immigrants were those who entered the United States as a child and have been in the United States since 2007.Those who qualify under DACA are given two-year work permits, which allows them to stay in the United States with some legal status."People werent sure if they were trying to round up people from the water and take them straight to the immigration center."On Tuesday, Trump is expected to announce that DACA will come to an end in six months.In the meantime, people like Contreras continue to go to work not knowing how many days they have left in America.
Donald Trump defended past disparaging remarks about women during Thursday’s GOP debate, saying he doesn’t have time for total political correctness and that oftentimes he’s just kidding.Youve called women you dont like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals, Fox News debate moderator Megyn Kelly told Trump.Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, she added.Trump said those comments were directed at TV personality Rosie O’Donnell, who has publicly feuded with Trump in the past.I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct.Ive been challenged by so many people and I dont frankly have time for total political correctness and to be honest with you this country doesnt have time either, Trump shot back to cheers.Frankly what I say and oftentimes its fun, its kidding, we have a good time, Trump added.

In this Dec. 7, 2017 file photo, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., speaks during a House Judiciary hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington.(AP Kaster) (Newser) – If his TV was tuned to Fox News on Tuesday, President Trump surely didnt like what he heard.Rep. Trey Gowdy, a Trump ally and chairman of the House Oversight Committee, appeared on the network to poke holes in Trumps claim that the FBI planted a spy in his 2016 campaign.According to memos from James Comey, "President Trump himself … said, If anyone connected with my campaign was working with Russia, I want you to investigate it, and it sounds to me like that is exactly what the FBI did," Gowdy said, referring to reports that FBI informant Stefan Halper reached out to Trump advisers George Papadopoulos and Carter Page before the 2016 election.Gowdy added that a Justice Department briefing last week convinced him the move had "nothing to do" with Trump.What Politico calls Gowdys "significant pushback against the president" then received backing from another Trump supporter, Fox News commentator Andrew Napolitano."There is no evidence" to support Trumps claims that a spy infiltrated his campaign in order to pass information to the Obama administration and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and "Id want to see evidence before I made an allegation that outrageous," he said, before describing Halpers actions as "standard operating procedure in intelligence gathering and in criminal investigations."Despite anchor Shepard Smith later saying much the same, Trump stuck to his "Spygate" theory at a Tuesday rally in Nashville, asking the crowd, "How do you like the fact they had people infiltrating our campaign?"
The US Supreme Court has ruled that Donald Trump’s ban on travellers from six Muslim-majority countries and two others can go into full effect, even as legal challenges against the executive order continue in several states.The ban means that the US can refuse entry visas to travellers from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, as well as North Korea and Venezuela.The ruling does not mean that the Supreme Court has accepted the ban as constitutional, but that it finds persuasive the Trump administration’s argument that an emergency injunction against the ban was unnecessary, The Guardian reports.US Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the ruling "a substantial victory for the safety and security of the American people".The Constitution gives the President the responsibility and power to protect this country from all threats foreign and domestic, and this order remains vital to accomplishing those goals, Sessions said.Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project said he was disappointed by the court’s decision.President Trump’s anti-Muslim prejudice is no secret - he has repeatedly confirmed it, including just last week on Twitter, Jadwat told The Washington Post.We continue to stand for freedom, equality, and for those who are unfairly being separated from their loved ones.
Courtesy Danielle Beatty YORK, PA — A video circulating on Facebook has some residents in York city crying foul, while the York City Police Department is encouraging residents to not jump to conclusions.CBS21 News Brandi Proctor spoke with York City Police Chief Wes Kahley who explained the video showed only a small portion of what happened and that his officer was defending himself.Watch the video here: Chief Kahley stated he does believe the 10-second video is disturbing, but added that its the events leading up to the video that caused the officer to react.Police allege Penn caused a disturbance inside the popular bar on the 400 block of East Market Street in York before attacking the office and kneeing him several times.Residents CBS21 News spoke with say seeing a woman being punched is hard to watch, regardless of the circumstance.Police say there is more video that may be released in the future.In the meantime, they are asking the public to not draw any conclusions.Police said the woman depicted in the video has been arrested, but did not release the charges pending against her.
A Hillary Clinton campaign staffer responded to an interview with a Black Lives Matter activist with one word: yuck.Clinton staffers circulated a radio interview in January with one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter Alicia Garza.Clinton herself flagged the interview, according to a new batch of hacked emails released by Wikileaks.In an email, Clinton’s research director Tony Carrk asked his team to find the interview because HRC said there was a segment with a woman from BLM who said ruined black lives.Another staffer then sent a transcript of an interview on the New Yorker radio hour with Garza, who said Hillary shunned and lectured Black Lives Matter during a  tense meeting with the group in August 2015.At the end of the interview Garza said she would not vote for Hillary Clinton in the general election.Sara Solow, a domestic policy adviser to Clinton, responded to the transcript saying, yuck.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence agencies provided advanced warning to Russia about a major terrorist plot in St. Petersburg, allowing Moscow to thwart an attack that could have killed large numbers of people, the White House said on Sunday.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called President Donald J. Trump today to thank him for the advanced warning the United States intelligence agencies provided to Russia concerning a major terror plot in Saint Petersburg, Russia, the White House said in a statement.
Finally, if they wish to highlight a truth or develop an opinion by the encouragement of a great example, they form an association."The love and respect of your neighbors must be gained by a long series of small services, hidden deeds of goodness, a persistent habit of kindness, and an established reputation of selflessness.Tocqueville considered Americans remarkable spirit of charitable giving a matter of enlightened self-interest: "American moralists do not claim that one must sacrifice oneself for ones fellows because it is a fine thing to do but they are bold enough to say that such sacrifices are as necessary to the man who makes them as to those gaining from them.Enlightened self-love continually leads them to help one another and inclines them to devote freely a part of their time and wealth to the welfare of the state."A 2006 Los Angeles poll found just 3 percent of Republicans and 4 percent of Democrats said they would not vote for a black presidential candidate.In fact, more Americans (14 percent) said they would not vote for a Mormon or a 72-year-old than the number who refused to vote for a black president.If America were as racist as many in the media think, why do blacks excel in two of the most competitive fields -- sports and entertainment?On Forbes list of highest-earning celebrities, blacks occupy seven of the top 25 slots, including Sean Combs, who clocks in at $130 million annually; Beyonce at $105 million; and Drake at $94 million.
Hillary Clinton jad vowed to open up UFO files if she made the White House Mrs Clinton had courted the so-called alien disclosure community for the past year after it emerged she and campaign manger John Podesta were keen to release any top-secret files held by the US Government about the subject of aliens and UFOs.Their pledge was closely followed by the Paradigm Research Group, a campaign organisation set up by Steve Bassett, the only registered lobbyist on the UFO issue in the US.Mr Bassett has been calling for an end to an alleged "truth embargo" that he and other UFO enthusiasts believe was put in place by global government to hide the truth about aliens visiting earth from the public since the infamous 1947 Roswell UFO incident in New Mexico.But, now Mr Bassett is hoping Hillary Clinton and Mr Podesta can still influence incumbent President Barack Obama to disclose the files and reveal the truth before he leaves office in Janaury.A statement on the PRG website says: "There are 70 days left to persuade Secretary Clinton, John Podesta and President Obama to engage the media on the extraterrestrial issue leading to a White rapprochement and Disclosure under President Obama."In January, Mrs Clinton said she also wanted to open up on what is happening at the mysterious Area 51 military base in Nevada, where UFO conspiracists believe evidence of alien technology is hidden away.Clinton claimed she would get to the bottom once and for all of questions and controversy over what the US Government does or does not know about the mysterious subject.Clinton and husband former president Bill Clinton have allegedly tried to force disclosure of UFO files before, but even when the latter was in the White House it did not fully happen.
thats hot I mean, it worked in Brazil, where Gisele Bündchen — supermodel, World Wildlife Federation representative, and behind-the-scenes shaper of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady’s political consciousness — tweeted at Brazilian President Michel Temer: Its our job to protect our Mother Earth.@MichelTemer, please say NO to reducing protection in the Amazon!4MrhGg Bündchen’s tweet concerns legislation that would have removed protection from some parts of the Amazon rainforest.Temer’s administration has been remarkably anti-conservation, threatening indigenous lands in favor of new agricultural, mineral extraction, and hydroelectric developments.Temer responded: That means, I vetoed those bills, because you are extremely beautiful.It just means, I vetoed those bills.This seems like a good approach to try in America.Can someone please text Kendall Jenner to ask if she feels like doing something substantive for the greater good?
It was reported in the same story that a friend of Diana, Selina Scott, said the princess felt stalked after her divorce from Prince Charles; Trump bombarded Diana at Kensington Palace with massive bouquets of flowers.The only thing she’s got going is the women’s card.The Republican candidate followed that remark up by calling Clinton an enabler of her husband’s infidelity.Read This First "Gesture of love": Photo of police officer breastfeeding malnourished baby goes viral Members of Amazon tribe never seen by outsiders filmed by drone Natasha Aponte, woman who tricked thousands of men on Tinder, explains purpose behind dating competition Ivana Trump Ivana Trump worked for the Trump Organization after they were married.He wrote in his book The Art of the Comeback that he regretted taking Ivana out of the role of being his wife and making her a businesswoman, because business then dominated their personal lives as well.When she filed for divorce from Trump, instigated by his affair with Marla Maples, she stated in a deposition that her husband had raped her.In a 1991 phone interviewwith People magazine reporter Sue Carswell, a recording of which was released in May 2016, a rep who identified himself as John Miller explained why Trump had left Maples for Italian singer-model Carla Bruni.In the interview, Miller bragged that Trump was constantly pursued by famous women and that he’s living with Marla and he’s got three other girlfriends.In the recording of the phone conversation, Miller -- whose tone, cadence and style of speaking are all remarkably Trump-like -- gave intimate details of Trump’s encounters with celebrities like Italian singer and model Carla Bruni and pop star Madonna.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is recommending to the Justice Department that no charges should be brought against Hillary Clinton for her use of private email servers as secretary of state, FBI Director James Comey announced Tuesday.Comey announced that the FBI has completed its investigation of Clintons use of a personal email server and is now referring the matter to the Justice Department to decide whether to prosecute.When one of the servers was decommissioned in 2013, the software was removed, but millions of email fragments remained in a "slack space of the server" which the FBI had to use to piece the puzzle of her emails back together.From the group of approximately 30,0 emails that Clinton provided to the State Department, the FBI found 110 emails in 52 email chains that "have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received," Comey said."There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information," he said, adding that anyone in Clintons position or in the positions of people she communicated with "should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation."The conclusion of the investigation comes after Clinton met with FBI officials in Washington for three and a half hours Saturday about her use of the private email server she used while she was secretary of state, her campaign said.There has been increased scrutiny of the Justice Department, which oversees the FBI, and Attorney General Loretta Lynch after she had a spontaneous half-hour-long meeting with former President Clinton early last week.The attorney general said Friday of the meeting with Clinton that she "certainly wouldnt do it again," a sentiment seconded by the former president and by Hillary Clinton, who told MSNBC in an interview that "hindsight is 20-20."Lynch confirmed Friday that she would be accepting the recommendations of the career prosecutors in the email case, though she stopped short of formally recusing herself from the matter.
Getty Bono and the Edge are seen playing a set in honor of the new iPod in 2004.(Getty) U2 has cancelled its September 16 concert in St. Louis, Missouri after a night of unrest over a police officer’s acquittal that saw rocks thrown at officers, injuries, and arrests.In the midst of all of this, U2 wrote on Saturday morning on Twitter: Tonight’s St. Louis Show Cancelled ‘We cannot risk fans’ safety.The iconic band released a lengthy statementexplaining the decision to no longer play at The Dome America Center.We have been informed by the St. Louis Police Department that they are not in a position to provide the standard protection for our audience as would be expected for an event of this size.Here’s the band’s tweet on the cancellation: Here’s some of the reaction on Twitter.Some people expressed sadness, others said they were angry (at those causing the unrest, at U2), and others wanted the band to make a social statement.The concert being cancelled upset fans on social media, but it was just one of multiple closings in St. Louis because of riots and protests over a judge’s acquittalof a white police officer in the shooting death of an African-American man, Anthony Lamar Smith.
Ann Coulter pronounced it the death of the GOP brand; Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, an immigration hardliner, claimed it would crack Trump’s core base of support; various commenters on conservative news sites theorized that Trump had been taken over by aliens.Since before Trump’s inauguration, Democratic attorneys in the nation’s capital have contemplated replacing Trump under the 25th Amendment’s requirement that the president is able to discharge the powers and duties of his office, i.e. impeaching him on grounds he’s intellectually incapacitated.A new book arrived, unsolicited, in the mail recently with a long title: The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.The cover gives the game away, but the publisher also included a foreword from 91-year-old psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, who offers the melodramatic view that clinicians who don’t warn the world about Donald Trump’s shortcomings are akin to Nazi doctors who worked at Auschwitz.In October of that year, when educated elites were just as unhinged over the idea of a Republican populist in the White House as they are today, provocative left-wing pamphleteer Ralph Ginzburg published an article in his Fact magazine with an incendiary headline: 1,189 Psychiatrists Say Goldwater Is Psychologically Unfit to Be President!Key in the creation of the U.S. Air Force Academy, Goldwater was also a decorated World War II pilot, a fiscal conservative, a fierce anti-communist, and friends in the Senate with John F. Kennedy.As Donald Trump would do 52 years later, Goldwater wrested the GOP nomination away from the Establishment, creating a fissure in Republican politics that exists to this day.I’ve never heard any political observer blame the Fact magazine article for that defeat, but it was so nasty and gratuitous that when the campaign was over Goldwater filed a libel suit in federal court.
He said: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate.He said: After the border is secure and after everything gets normalised, we’re going to make a determination on the people that they’re talking about who are terrific people, they’re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that.Not only are they in the country illegally, they have broken their obligation to live by the rules of the host country.Tue, December 13, 2016 Donald John Trump is an American businessman and politician who is President-elect of the United States as well as chairman and president of The Trump Organization Theresa May suggested she might further streamline visa application processes for Indians Conservative MP Peter Bone said: What Donald Trump is tapping into is the deep frustration that people here have, that people come here illegally, commit crime and then can’t be deported because of their human rights.Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets since the results from Tuesday showed Mr Trump had secured enough votes in the 538-person electoral college to clinch the presidency.A protestor in New York holds a sign which reads, Trump is not my President The protests come as it emerged that Hillary Clinton could receive two million more votes than Mr Trump when the final tally is made.Millions of votes are yet to be counted in the pro-Democrat state of California and experts believe Mrs Clinton’s win of the popular vote could be extended to two million.The result is similar to the situation which arose in the 20 election when Al Gore lost having defeated George W Bush in the popular vote.
Public pressure against the event was immense, and after receiving threats of violence, the Texas Confederate Militia decided to postpone the event to a later date.That didnt stop the counter march the Austin chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America had planned.Chanting their way through downtown Austin, the capital of Texas, demonstrators denounced Confederate symbolism and called for the dismantling of public works and streets that bear the name of Confederate icons.At the end of the march, fights broke out both between protesters and between protesters and police.Two people were arrested.Just last week Texas House Speaker Joe Strauss called for removal of a plaque near the Capitol that asserts slavery was not the underlying cause of the Civil War.And finally after years of resistance, administrators at the University of Texas Austin decided to take down Confederate statues on campus.Related stories The University of Texas is removing its Confederate statues Workers removed a statue of Robert E.

When the removal of a sign becomes a sign of the times… In the open border utopia ushered in by President Barack Obama, it’s no longer socially acceptable to think Americans speak English and thus, down comes a famous sign at Geno’s Steaks in South Philly.More from Fox News: Geno’s has held its prominent location at South Philadelphia’s ‘cheesesteak junction’, at the diagonal meeting of 9th and Passyunk–and across from cheesesteak originator Pat’s, since 1966, but Vento’s contentious sign set it apart from the rest.Joey Vento, who died in 2011 at age 71, drew regional and national attention over his This is America, When Ordering Speak English sign posted to the walk-up window at ‘Geno’s’.After Vento’s death, his son Geno, named for his father’s shop, apparently decided to take the sign down.SEE ALSO: Dana Perino Erupts ‘Like Mount Vesuvius’: ‘After 20 Years Of Defending These Guys … Done!’ Turns out, the descendant of Italian immigrants never refused service to anyone and said he posted the sign as political commentary on illegal immigration, according to Fox News.Geno’s Steaks released a statement on the removal of the sign, saying it’s time to move on.While Geno continues to honor his father’s traditions of good quality food, cleanliness and giving back to the community, he has decided that after 10 years it is time to move on, the statement said.It’s about what you do and what your mark in life is, and Geno wants to change that mark in life.
Judging by the Sean Spicer Emmy reactions on Twitter, viewers were not pleased to see this angry little man joking around with his pal Stephen Colbert on their television screen.Maybe its a good thing the 2017 Emmys got this questionable political stunt out of the way early.The Former White House Press Secretary to President Trump was brought out on stage by host Stephen Colbert at the end of his opening monologue.He referenced his famously inaccurate judgment of the inauguration crowd size by saying, This is the largest audience to witness the Emmys, period.The audience laughed and cheered for this former face of the Donald Trump presidency, and then later in the night gave all the Emmys to The Handmaids Tale, you know, that show about how a dystopian, oppressive government is a bad thing.She said, Truly so grossed out by A GROUP of people ever even considering the idea of real life Spicer at the Emmys.And of course, though she didnt share her opinion on Twitter, Melissa McCarthys reaction when the camera cut to her during the real Spicers bit said a thousand words: She did not approve.And according to journalist Chris Gardner of The Hollywood Reporter, who attended the show, Spicer had no lack of fans and attention after the Emmys.
In fact, it seems like the only time you see a crime committed with a suppressor, it’s where having the suppressor itself is illegal for whatever reason.Congress could vote as soon as this week to repeal part of an 80-year-old law that has forced owners of silencers to register the devices with the federal government.Supporters of removing restrictions on silencers have dismissed the concerns of opponents by pointing out that suppressors, as they’re also known, are today rarely used in crimes.Even with the hurdles that silencer buyers must deal with, demand for the items is already increasing, fueled by a new generation of suppressors and some slick marketing.I’d like to applaud The Trace for at least acknowledging that criminals are unlikely to walk into a gun store and buy suppressors.All the information is on the internet for anyone and their brother to look at if they so choose.Take a look at this photo of a suppressed pistol, since handguns are the preferred weapon of the average criminal.They’re terrible options for their line of work, and with the internet’s instructions laying the mysteries of the suppressor bare years ago, there’s no reason to fear them getting into any crooks hands.
President Donald Trump renewed his attacks on the "fake" news media in a series of tweets early Saturday morning, lashing out at CNN after the network corrected a story on the Trump campaign and Russia.Trump accused CNN of making a vicious and intentional mistake and called on the network to fire those responsible, and also called for ABC reporter Brian Ross, who has been suspended, to be fired for a separate erroneous report.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is introduced during the CNN presidential debate at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 15, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada.In the corrected CNN report Trump referred to, it was claimed that Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., had received a heads up email on September 4, ahead of the release by WikiLeaks of a cache of emails stolen from DNC servers, allegedly by Russian government linked hackers.CNN later corrected its report to state that Trump Jr. had in fact received the email on September 14, subsequent to their public release by WikiLeaks.The network has said it will not discipline the reporters responsible for the story, because they followed company procedure and used multiple sources to verify the claims, and does not believe they acted with malicious intent.The network later corrected the report to state that Trump had made the request as president elect, prior to taking office in January.Fox News, whose coverage Trump has praised and contrasted with CNNs, also issued a correction for a story Friday in which it was claimed that one of the women who has accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual assault forged his signature in a high school yearbook.

credit: Notes of Aztlán In Chicano history, the women who formed a vital part of social justice movements have often been swept aside; forgotten or ignored as their male counterparts receive the bulk of the praise for their collective work.Chicana Tributes: Activist Women of the Civil Rights Movement aims to share those untold stories of the women who formed an important part of the movement.CREDIT: Chicana Diego State University Chicano Archive The book documents the experiences of 61 Chicanas from the ’60s to the present who have paved the way in the fight for human rights as educators, attorneys, activists, artists and more.The project came about by the Chicano Archive Committee at San Diego State University, which works to document the people and historical events that have occurred around the Chicano movement.Committee members and co-editors Sonia Lopez and Rita Sanchez selected the women featured in Chicana Tributes to document what they believe is missing from the history books.Any advancement in the Chicano community, the credit is mostly given to the men.Among the women featured are ACLU leader Norma Chavez, Laura Rodriguez, matriarch of the National Historic Landmark Chicano Park, Charlotte Hernandez Terry, the first woman to paint a mural at Chicano Park, and Delia Moreno, who along with her daughters form Trio Moreno, which played protest trio music during important events in the Chicano movement.In telling the stories of these trailblazers, Lopez says young women will have one more book they can see themselves in, which is necessary as there are few books that offer that.
An FBI agent was reportedly injured when a flash grenade detonated Wednesday in a New York City parking garage.Officials told NBCs local affiliate in New York that one person was taken to Bellevue Hospital to receive treatment for burns on his hand.The agent was handling the device when it went off, officials said.Witnesses told the New York Daily News that they called 911 after hearing a small explosion and seeing smoke coming from the back of a federal building that houses the FBI and U.S.Citizenship and Immigration Services.
President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that his administration will be taking strong action today to address what he complained are especially weak border security protections that must be addressed by Congress and the construction of a border wall.Trump’s online post, which did not come with further details as to what steps his administration would take, came one day after he announced that he would deploy U.S. troops to guard the southern border with Mexico until his promised border wall is completed.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said later Tuesday that Trump’s plan would mobilize the National Guard, which his two immediate predecessors had also done along the U.S.-Mexico border, and also press Congress to take steps to close loopholes in the nation’s immigration laws.Sanders did not say when or how many troops Trump would mobilize or where they would be deployed.The president has been especially preoccupied with border security this week, seemingly agitated by a group of migrants, mostly from Honduras, that was making its way north through Mexico, past immigration checkpoints and military bases, en route to the U.S. Trump said Tuesday that that group had been broken up by Mexican authorities, who he said did so only after he demanded they act.More broadly, Trump has struggled to get traction in Congress for his border security priorities, namely that the border wall he promised during the 2016 campaign would be paid for by Mexico.Democrats have thus far been largely unwilling to go along with plans for the president’s wall.Trump has complained loudly about what he has called their obstructionism and has urged the Senate GOP leadership to do away with the chamber’s legislative filibuster, something Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed never to do.
ISIS is "dreaming that Hillary Clinton becomes President.ISIS, their number one dream, Hillary Clinton, let her become President.Shes the one that allowed it to form, shes the one that watched it go, now they say its in 32 countries, worse than ever."A dozen interviews with ISIS extremists and a review of their social media networks by Foreign Affairs magazine found that the terrorist group has a strong preference in the 2016 election: theyd like to see Donald Trump elected, not Clinton.Fact checkers have also reviewed Trumps repeated claim that ISIS rise is directly Clintons fault and declared it to be false.
On Tuesday, Trump said he plans to send the U.S. military to guard the border with Mexico: We have very bad laws for our border, and we are going to be doing some things — I’ve been speaking with General Mattis — we’re going to be doing things militarily, said Trump at a White House meeting with leaders of the Baltic nations.Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military," he said.Since Easter Sunday, when Fox News and The Drudge Report featured news about a caravan of Central Americans making their way to the United States through Mexico, Trump has issued a dozen tweets on border security.On April 3, he tweeted: The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our Weak Laws Border, had better be stopped before it gets there.On April 2: As ridiculous as it sounds, the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from.ACT CONGRESS Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES.With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws.
SWAT teams quickly surrounded the concert and the casino, and officers used explosives to get into the hotel room where the suspect was inside, authorities said.Danley, who was out of the country at the time, is not believed to have been involved in the shooting.Eric Paddock told WESH that "its like an asteroid has hit the family," and that the family has "no reason, rhyme, rationale" for the attack.The gunman paused and then fired another volley of muzzle flashes from the gold glass casino as more victims fell to the ground while others fled in panic.A witness, only identified as Christine, describes the horrifying moment: "We saw Jason run off stage, and people all over on the floor the grassy area in front of the stage, someone falling, someone screaming and running," she said."It seemed there was a pause in the gunfire and the people in the yellow shirts were telling the people to go, go, go, go .Storme Warren described watching the chaos erupt once people began to run for their lives, saying: "We stepped over the bodies, we saw the people, we saw the heart-wrenching sadness from relatives grabbing hold of their loved ones."Orlando Police Chief John Mina tweeted condolences for all those affected by the mass shooting in Las Vegas, saying in part: "This community, and the men and women of OPD, know all too well the anguish that is gripping the residents, visitors and law enforcement community in Las Vegas."
Louis Smith was found guilty of a breach of British Gymnastics’ Standards of Conduct Through their bullying demands for submission to their dogma they are destroying the very liberties on which our democratic society is based.Louis Smith holds his Member of the British Empire (MBE) medal in 2012 He did not physically hurt anyone but in today’s Britain he is guilty of a thought crime by daring to indulge in religious satire.It is like a modern version of the Cromwellian regime that existed in the 17th century with its determination to crack down on any signs of heresy, only now the faith held to be sacred and inviolable is not Protestantism but Islam.In the wake of the Louis Smith incident the Muslim Council of Britain predictably bleated about Islamophobia, arguing that British society must realise the need for people to follow their faith with dignity.Nor does the state show much respect for Christian sensibilities, as highlighted by the case where a firm of devout bakers in Belfast was fined for refusing to make a cake with a political slogan in favour of gay marriage.Tue, July 31, 2012 All the best pictures of British artistic gymnast Louis Smith Louis Smith with his silver medal The intimidation is real, as shown by the relentless catalogue of global slaughter against those deemed to have offended Islam.The determination to punish Louis Smith is the flipside of officialdom’s impulse to surrender, as shown in the growing acceptance of sharia courts.As for Smith himself, he has embarked on a tour of abject repentance, visiting a number of mosques where he claims to have discovered the true meaning behind the religion of peace.
She was scared to death… And I said, ‘That’s the one I’m going to take home.’ Because B.B.I put her in the living room, and to go into the hallway, she would not cross that border [between rooms].I have two granddaughters who live with me, so I would put her in one of my granddaughters’ rooms, and she was terrified of rugs.She didn’t know what grass was, and she was terrified of it.She’s eating like crazy — she was originally about 3 and a half pounds, but I think she’s maybe about 10 pounds now.She loves the grass now, and she loves playing with the other dogs in the backyard.She was scared to death… And I said, ‘That’s the one I’m going to take home.’ However, because she spent her entire life in the dark and in a tiny cage, B.B.She never knew what sun was… She didn’t know what grass was, and she was terrified of it.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions warned Tuesday that sanctuary cities in the U.S. will lose millions in grant money if they do not comply with federal agents efforts to deport undocumented immigrants.Sessions issued a statement announcing new requirements for local governments that wish to receive money from a federal grant program called the "Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Programs."The rules require local governments to alert the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at least 48 hours before releasing inmates from local jails who are wanted by DHS agents.It also requires local governments to allow DHS agents to enter local jails and interview inmates suspected of being undocumented immigrants."So-called sanctuary policies make all of us less safe because they intentionally undermine our laws and protect illegal aliens who have committed crimes," Sessions said in his statement."These policies also encourage illegal immigration and even human trafficking by perpetuating the lie that in certain cities, illegal aliens can live outside the law.""We must encourage these sanctuary jurisdictions to change their policies and partner with federal law enforcement to remove criminals," Sessions added."These long overdue requirements will help us take down MS-13 and other violent transnational gangs, and make our country safer," he said.
Michael Bennett calls police confrontation a traumatic experience Michael Bennett promises to donate $25K to Harvey victims Bennett, who has recently remained seated during the national anthem prior to football games, posted a statement to Twitter detailing his side of the story.&gt;&gt; See photos here frame-by-frame from when Michael Bennett was put in the back of a police car The NVMPD first gave a news conference in early September about the accusations, saying there was no evidence Bennett was detained because of his race.Related coverage The events leading up to the encounter The Las Vegas Police Department has shared body camera video during a news conference of the scene that unfolded outside and inside the casino-hotel, The Cromwell and Drai Nightclub, leading up to the incident with Bennett on August 27.Thousands of people were in the area at the time of the active shooter call, according to police.What Bennett says in his letter Bennett wrote in his letter that he was visiting Las Vegas to watch the Mayweather-McGregor fight, and he was on the way to his hotel when he was detained.In his letter, Bennett called it an excessive use of force, simply because he was a "black man in the wrong place at the wrong time."What NVMPD say about bias-based policing In addition to explaining the events leading up to the encounter, police commented on social media commentary that the detention was motivated by race.About Bennett as an advocate Bennett is one of the 200 NFL players who didn’t participate in the national anthem over the weekend in the wake of President Donald Trump suggesting the NFL bar players from kneeling in protest.
Donald Trump could win the US election next November 8 This question is entirely rhetorical because the BBC and its crew of analysts and right-on comedians have told us already: America will be engulfed by a tidal wave of sexism, racism and xenophobia; the dollar will collapse and with it the global economy; by the end of his first week Trump will be so drunk with power that he’ll make a clumsy pass at some White House intern, miss and accidentally press the red button which triggers a nuclear war… Call me an optimistic fool but I don’t believe any of this nonsense.The world could be safer if Donald Trump wins against Hillary Cliton Let me stress that Donald Trump is by no means my dream candidate for the post of the next leader of the free world.The first is that he is not Hillary, a corrupt, ailing serial fibber with a dubious track record (from the Whitewater financial scandal to Benghazi, where her negligence may have resulted in the murder of the US ambassador) and a snooty contempt for the law demonstrated most by the FBI investigation into her hidden emails.This is at least in part because of a cosy stitch-up between the governing elite – lawyers, corporations, politicians and the overmighty US central bank the Federal Reserve – which has entrenched its own power by making it almost impossible for those lower down to climb the ladder.Adding to these financial pressures are the frustrations caused by mass illegal immigration and also by the liberal elite’s obsession with political correctness, which has led to a woefully bad state education system, an increase in Islamist terrorism and a burning sense of injustice, especially among blue-collar Americans that they can’t speak their minds and that their country is no longer their own.While Obama has fiddled during his eight years as president the world has burned: the Middle East crisis has worsened; terrorism has proliferated; Russia and China have flexed their muscles; the eurozone has stagnated; the refugee problem has got out of control; and almost nothing has been done to address the underlying economic problems that led to the 2008 crash.Tue, November 8, 2016 The top photos following the campaign journey of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the US Elections 2016 US Elections 2016 in pictures Take Russia: for the Washington establishment it’s the world’s biggest geopolitical threat with Putin being painted as the new Stalin.Donald Trump giving the thumbs up Trump is the voice of the everyday folk in America Let’s hope this strategy works because one of the bigger worries about Trump is his view on Nato: he has even suggested – against Nato policy – that if one of its member states were attacked, America wouldn’t necessarily go to its defence.
After another week of violence and mayhem, its clear Hillary Clintons controversial assessment of Trumps fans was, well, generous.
Goodell’s main talking point was that the NFL also will listen to its players about social issues and wants to be a part of the solution.It’s also important for us to honor our flag and our country and we think our fans expect us to do that.The best outcome for the NFL would be for the players to stop protesting without the league making a rule change.This is something, what we’ve tried to do is we’ve tried to deal with the underlying issue and understand what it is they’re protesting and try to address that matter.The important thing for us is to be able to do that and take that opportunity to make real differences in our community.I understand the way our fans feel about this issue, and we feel the same way about the importance of our flag, the importance of patriotism, and I believe our players feel that way.The will state to you and they have stated to everyone publicly, they’re not doing this in any way to be disrespectful to the flag, but they also understand how it’s being interpreted.I think you look at our clubs and what they do on a daily basis, look at our players and what they do and how they participate in that, we all feel very strongly about our country and our pride.

NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart said such actions are not a protest against the anthem or the flag.Very important that NFL players STAND tomorrow, and always, for the playing of our National Anthem.Respect our Flag and our Country!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017 Trump had earlier called on NFL owners to fire players who didnt stand for the anthem.He added: "I think they are afraid of their players, if you want to know the truth, and I think its disgraceful.""I believe there was a statement our owners are afraid of our players and owners requested intervention by political leaders to kick this off," Lockhart said.If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017 .our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem.Find something else to do!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017 "The owners are clearly united in a sense that the attacks on the game, on the NFL, on the players were unfair and unfounded, and that there was unity among the group," Lockhart said, noting that about two-thirds of the 32 team owners were at league headquarters this week for committee meetings."I think they made it clear they support our players, but also support our country, the national anthem, the flag—all of the things some have suggested we dont."
It will be only a matter of days before the Democratic Party press in America starts taking up the suggestion of Chancellor Merkel of Germany that we seek with North Korea a pact of appeasement like the one the Obama administration engineered with the ayatollahs at Iran.It is dog-whistling to the New York Times, which is no doubt scrambling to get aboard the Merkel appeasement.New York’s senior senator, now the minority leader, played a double role in the drama on the Iran appeasement.Yet he refused to take a leading role in the fight against it, even when opponents sought to have have the pact itself put to a proper vote.That was all the more disappointing because it was clear that if the pact had been put to the Senate it would have been rejected.This point is acknowledged even by the Times, which concedes that the Iran pact was opposed in the Congress overwhelmingly.The Obama administration took the unratified deal straight to the United Nations, where Ambassador Power voted against the Congress of her own country.It’s presumptuous of some people to suspect that France, Russia, China, Germany, Britain ought to do what the Congress tells them to do, Secretary of State Kerry snickered.
An FBI raid on Elbarasse’s home unearthed a trove of Islamic doctrinal books and key Muslim Brotherhood documents—which became evidence in the largest terrorism-financing trial in U.S. history.A document from the Elbarasse raid outlines the Muslim Brotherhood’s phased plan to destroy Western civilization from within: Phase One: Secret establishment of leadership.But for radicals, sharia is the legal and political foundation for jihad and global rule, a power play to force Islam on the world.It’s primarily political, not religious; though in America it masks itself as a religion to manipulate the First Amendment as a front for seditious activity.You Wont Believe Where It Was Stashed Ahok’s conviction—accompanied by violent rallies and death threats, shows the chilling influence on pluralism by hardline Islamism that the government and judiciary are reluctant to oppose, said Time reporter Nicola Smith.The late Ayatollah Khomeini, and his successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, sidestepped Shi’a believe that the Mahdi (12th Imam), a quasi-messianic figure, must return before waging jihad and adopted an ideology promoting a senior Shiite cleric to theocratic political power over Shiites worldwide.Khomeini inserted his doctrine into the 1989 constitution, in which the regime’s objective is global conquest under sharia rule and nuclear dominance is a surefire path to achieve that goal.Iran and its proxies not only menace Israel’s existence and portend regional upheaval, the bomb of Islamist ideology threatens the lives and freedoms of every sovereign nation in the world.
With the end of his second term on the horizon, President Obama spoke to 60 Minutes this week, reflecting on his achievements -- and on the problems not yet solved.At the top of that list is the protracted crisis in Syria, where more than 250,0 people have died, according to UN reports, and some 12 million have been forced from their homes."Steve, Ive got to tell you, if you think that running your economy into the ground and having to send troops in in order to prop up your only ally, is leadership, then weve got a different definition of leadership," he says."The most important thing I can do right now is just to keep on lifting up the issue and saying, It doesnt have to be this way," he tells Kroft.The two-part interview also touches on the 2016 presidential race, and the candidates on both sides of the aisle.At different moments in the interview, the president turns reflective, taking stock of his time in office and eyeing the year ahead.At the end of the interview, Kroft asks Obama if hes glad he cant run for president again."But by the time Im finished, I think it will be time for me to go," he says, adding that new blood in the White House is essential for a healthy democracy.
In fact, scholars had a pretty good idea of what the circumference of the Earth was, which was part of the dissent against Columbus making his trip- Columbus thought Asia was bigger than it is and the world much smaller, leading one of the scholars commissioned by the monarchy to investigate the plausibility of Columbus’ journey succeeding to say, it was impossible to any educated person).Christopher Columbus was brutal, even by the standards of his age, leading Bartolome de las Casa, who accompanied Columbus on one of his voyages, to write in his The History of the Indies, Such inhumanities and barbarisms were committed in my sight as no age can parallel… My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature that now I tremble as I write.Specifically, Columbus, upon seeing the Arawaks (the peoples of the region) come out of the forests frightened of the men with swords, but bearing gifts, wrote in his journal, They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance.Eventually, when it was realized there wasn’t much gold in the region, Columbus and his men just took the rest as slaves and put them to work on their newly established estates in the region.Finally we came to an agreement in such manner that I can tell you that she seemed to have been brought up in a school of whores… Going further, Columbus wrote in a letter from 1500, A hundred castellanos are as easily obtained for a woman as for a farm, and it is very general and there are plenty of dealers who go about looking for girls; those from nine to ten are now in demand.As illustrated in a recently discovered 48 page report found in the Spanish archives written by Francisco De Bobadilla (charged with investigating Columbus’ rule at the behest of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, who were troubled by allegations of some of Columbus’ acts), a woman who verbally insulted Columbus’ family was stripped naked and made to ride around the colony on a mule.Combined with his truly historic and widespread impact being incidental to what he was actually trying to do (so a little hard to celebrate him for even that side of his life), maybe it is time that we let go of the myths we learned about Christopher Columbus in elementary school and stop celebrating Columbus, the man.Further, while it is still somewhat up for debate if Columbus and his crew brought syphilis to the New World or if they brought it from the New World to Europe (the latter generally being the favored theory), what isn’t argued is that Columbus inadvertently quickened and widen the spread of these dangerous diseases on both sides of the Atlantic.

The former Indianapolis Colts kicker has been suspended from that role after a March incident in which Vanderjagt allegedly grabbed a student by the throat at Charter Middle School in Marco Island, Fla. (Darron Press) The Naples Daily News reported Thursday that Vanderjagt, a school parent, was investigated by police for attacking a student who taunted him with cries of "wide left, wide left" through a rolled-up piece of poster board doubling as megaphone.Flashback: Vanderjagt missed a game-changing field goal attempt at the end of the Colts AFC Divisional playoff loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in January 2006.According to police, Vanderjagt was crossing the schools parking lot when he heard the taunts.The student told authorities the former kicker "walked up to him, grabbed him by the throat and started cursing at him."Police went so far as to file the incident with the State Attorneys office, which ruled that no charges would be issued against Vanderjagt.He has apologized to the student and currently awaits word from the schools principal about his coaching future.In the meantime, this former NFL kicker is running a pizza joint on Marco Island.Strange days, indeed.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (KCRA) — California is now one step closer to becoming sanctuary state.The Assembly Judiciary Committee approved Senate Bill 54 on Wednesday along party lines -- with eight Democrats voting in favor and three Republicans opposed.Under the proposed bill, ICE agents would be prohibited from entering county jails unless they have a warrant.Get the full story in the video above.
Much of the ugliness we see on the Left today is embodied in groups like Black Lives Matter and ANTIFA.Both groups think they are oppressed, both are obsessed with identity politics, and both are steeped in Marxist ideologies.You’d think that they would get along just fine but that’s not the case.People who have their identities wrapped up in victimhood are narcissistic by nature.They want the spotlight at all times, and can’t stand to see someone else hog it.So it was probably just a matter of time before these two groups clashed.Odd Trick To "Fix" Sagging Skin In Seconds (Try This Tonight)
Judge Tosses Out Cop’s Case Against Black Lives Matter Remember when we told you how an injured officer sued the Black Lives Matter movement and DeRay McKesson after getting shot by Gavin Long in the infamous July 17, 2016 attack in Dallas?The cop, who only goes by John Doe Smith, was shot in the head and through the intestine during the attack that claimed two police lives and wounded several others.He blamed Black Lives Matter for their presence on the scene inciting violence to cause Gavin to snipe the cops, and sought damages to the tune of $75,0 for his surgery bills.The thing is… Black Lives Matter is a movement, not a specified group of people or a business.So there’s really no one in particular to sue.According to TMZ, the judge ultimately dismissed the case due to the fact that BLM is a social movement, and McKesson as an individual was only using his first amendment right by appearing at the protest — not inciting anyone to commit any acts of violence.It’s truly unfortunate what happened to his officer, but you can’t blame the peaceful protestors on the scene exercising their rights for the reckless actions of one disturbed individual.
According to Mary Mazzios documentary I Am Jane Doe, there are more than 1.6 million homeless or runaway kids on the streets of America, and up to 15 percent of them have fallen victim to sex-trafficking."I know what its like to be more afraid to go home than you are to get in a car with a stranger," said former trafficking victim Rebecca Bender.After a decade free from the life, Rebecca Bender is about to go back on the streets, posing as a sex worker to expose just how big the problem may be in your town.The judge granted Crime Watch Daily exclusive access inside the courtroom for the proceedings, where ultimately the defense requested a delay.And to all the "johns" out there feeding the illegal sex trade, you can be sure that law enforcement and Crime Watch Daily will not stop until you are in handcuffs.RESOURCES The National Child Traumatic Stress Network has resources for mental health professionals, law enforcement personnel, health care professionals, and survivors on the signs of trafficking and services for human trafficking survivors.Children of the Night is a privately funded non-profit organization established in 1979 and dedicated to rescuing America’s children from the ravages of prostitution.Since recovery from sexual exploitation is a long-term process, GenerateHope provides individualized support to work through past trauma until the women reach the ability to live independently and become a positive influence on their communities and future generations.
President Donald Trumps nominee for federal judge in Alabama was just approved by every Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee — even though he was unanimously rated "not qualified" by the American Bar Association.Brett J. Talley is 36 years old, has only practiced law for three years and made a series of partisan comments on his blog in 2016 that would normally be considered unbecoming of a judge, like referring to the Democratic presidential candidate as "Hillary Rotten Clinton," according to the Los Angeles Times.Although Talley does have degrees from the University of Alabama and Harvard Law School and clerked for two federal judges, he has never argued a motion, making it nearly unprecedented for him to be considered as a candidate for a lifetime appointment.One of Talleys most controversial statements was a blog post in which he claimed that President Barack Obama was "about to launch the greatest attack on our constitutional freedoms in our lifetime.""When you think of it, Mitch [McConnell] and I were saying, that has consequences 40 years out, depending on the age of the judge," Trump said in October.Charles Goodwin, who was nominated to the federal bench in Oklahoma, was the first judicial nominee since 2006 to receive a "not qualified" label from the American Bar Association.Jeff Mateer, who was nominated to the federal bench in Texas, aroused controversy by referring to transgender children as proof of "Satan’s plan" and denounced the Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage as "disgusting."John Bush, who was confirmed to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote a blog post arguing that slavery and abortion were the "two greatest tragedies in our country."
When asked by the reporter whether Muslims would be legally obligated to register in the database, the business mogul responded: They have to be.He said that the country’s Muslims would register for the database at different places, adding, It’s all about management.The comments come less than a week after terrorists wreaked havoc on the French capital, taking the lives of at least 129 people and injuring more than 300 others in a series of coordinated attacks.On Thursday, the House passed a bill to drastically tighten screening procedures on Syrian refugees, requiring key national security agencies to determine whether each Iraqi and Syrian refugee poses a threat, CNN reports.Trump’s recent comments stem from an earlier interview with Yahoo News on Thursday in which he did not reject the idea of requiring Muslims in the U.S. to register into a database or present a special ID that noted their religion.We’re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely, the 69-year-old said.The Council on American-Islamic Relations criticized the candidate for the comments in a statement on Thursday, and a council spokesman told NBC, We’re kind of at a loss for words, adding that the database plan is comparable to that of prewar Nazi Germany.He added that the U.S. would need to vet anyone coming in, a practice the White House called a religious test, CNN reports.
Sebastian Gorka, who served seven months as deputy assistant to President Trump, alongside former chief strategist Steve Bannon, sat down with Circa to talk about his time in the White House, the "deep state," the future of Trumps Make America Great Again agenda and the Washington, D.C. "bureaucratic swamp."Question and Answer with Sebastian Gorka: "Thats why I predict that in the near future, before Christmas probably, there will be some very high-level personnel changes in the White House that are driven by the President."When I was deputy assistant to the president, Id walk in and out of the Oval Office and Id regularly see people like Corey Lewandowski, Id see Dave Bossie in the Oval [Office] with the President.Now, neither of those individuals had a government ID card, neither of them worked for the White House, but they were in there with the president and I can assure you they werent talking about the weather.And if you remember, there was a film, a great John Milius film called "Red Dawn" in the 80s about the Soviet Cuban invasion of America and the resistance that American patriots put up to it.As a result, when we moved into the White House, Steve, myself, the president, it was the most leveraged, hostile takeover in political history in the modern age.In the intervening months, the establishment figures reacted to the antibodies that represent the MAGA agenda and boxed us out, tried to cut us out of the policy agenda.So, Im not gonna talk about individuals just yet, but Ill talk about principles and the fact is, um, Tucker Carlson had a segment after Steve left the White House that I think is crucial to understanding the reality of whats going on in the West Wing.
But the more I thought about it, the more I realized the meaning behind that statement.Since the founding days of the United States, a problem has always been the power balance between small states and big states.I remember hearing in government class how just a dozen or so of the largest cities in the United States could swing the popular vote to one political party and realizing just how valuable the electoral college is to modern politics.There’s no simple alternative to balancing out protecting the interests of the rural minority and forwarding those of the urban majority.From the U.S. Census: Rural areas cover 97 percent of the nation’s land area but contain 19.3 percent of the population.I remember watching the local news and finding out that in nearby Wise County, Virginia, the only time people can receive medical attention is once a year, when a mobile clinic known as the Remove Area Medical arrives.The fact that a colored piece of cloth is generating the most media coverage instead of a terrible healthcare crisis here is a sort of a slap in the face to the coal miner with permanent nerve damage or the diabetic who can’t access insulin.We tend to separate the world into us and the other, but we fail to realize that the other may also be struggling to come to grips with the world too.
Its a debate playing out across America.Should statues and memorials of Confederate soldiers and officers remain standing, or should they be removed.Those in favor of removing the statues say the statues represent racism.Those who want the statues to remain complain that removing the statues would be an attempt to get rid of history.What do you think?Should cities and states get rid of Confederate statues and memorials?
The grisly details are laid out in a new report by Nikita Malik called,  Trafficking Terror: How Modern Slavery and Sexual Violence Fund Terrorism.If they had breasts, they could be raped; if not, they would wait three months to check again, Victim 1 said, according to an interview cited in the report.The girls – many of them minors – were raped together in rooms as children looked on, she said after finally eluding ISIS’ grip."She was forced to do things that were disgusting to her and they kept her without clothes in this room so that anybody could come at any time and rape her.Yazidi women were told by brainwashed ISIS brides that they needed to be raped to become fully Muslim, according to the report.They were often sold, but lost monetary value the more times they were purchased by men in Iraq and Syria.The report also describes how sexual depravity continues to act as a pull factor for prospective terrorists Sexual slavery serves as an incentive for new recruits and foreign fighters, with the promise of wives and sex slaves.It’s believed ISIS could turn to kidnapping and sex slavery as a means to sustain itself as its shrinking caliphate continues to crumble.
The fallout against the former White House political strategist and Trump confidant is continuing this week, in the wake of his comments appearing in Michael Wolffs tell-all book, "Fire and Fury," and as his political foes are celebrating his perceived demise and his political friends are starting to distance themselves from him.One of Bannons strongest allies — the Mercer family, which is funding Breitbart — issued a stinging rebuke on Thursday, but limited the scope of their attack to what Bannon said about the president."My family and I have not communicated with Steve Bannon in many months and have provided no financial support to his political agenda, nor do we support his recent actions and statements."@CBSNews confirms Steve Bannons longtime benefactor Rebekah Mercer cut *all ties* with him at the request of White House officials in the aftermath of #FireAndFury.pic.twitter.com/8eICjpp6Qw — ryan kadro (@RyanKadro) January 5, 2018 But Mercer is continuing to finance Breitbart, which has not only been Bannons political agenda, its been his political essence.When Moores major flaws were exposed, Bannon dispatched Breitbarts staffers to attack the women who accused Moore of trying to date them when they were teenagers.After the election, Breitbarts editor admitted that they were acting as political operatives in their decision to cover the election.So while Breitbarts funders are wondering whether or not to cut ties with Steve Bannon, its important to realize that Bannons legacy will certainly live on.
But Trump is as much of a part and player in this latest chapter of the email saga, because of the one-syllable grenade that he keeps lobbing at the body politic, his furious mantra over these final weeks.Comey obviously felt that he was in a bind and clearly believed that by disclosing the emails as soon as possible — and not, say, delaying until he had some sense of what the F.B.I.Regardless, the media went nuts, declaring that the development could bend the shape of the race and assuming damage to Clinton without any polling or other evidence to back that up.We don’t know what this means yet except that it’s a real bombshell, the journalist Carl Bernstein said in a phone interview on CNN on Friday, adding: It is unthinkable that the director of the F.B.I.would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified emails and call it to the attention of Congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation.Even the many news organizations that stressed the possible innocuousness of the emails and emphasized how very little we knew contradicted that caution with the length, number and front-and-center placement of their stories about this development.Even as Trump was praising Comey and saying that the election might not be quite as rigged as he’d feared, Limbaugh was telling his listeners that Comey was just doing this to take everybody’s attention off of the WikiLeaks email dump that was embarrassing Clinton and her aides.The cynical view, he said, is that Comey is still carrying water for Clinton and is trying to get everybody to stop paying attention on the WikiLeaks dump because it’s starting to have an impact.
Of the people arrested during the protests, several were wearing masks while others were connected to assaults.The crowd began to diminish around 3:30 p.m., six hours after a march led to the protests.In a statement early Sunday, the group said "we fully intend to move forward with (the Rally Against Hate)" on the campus despite calls by the university police department for people to stay away for safety reasons.The rally was held in response to the planned right-wing protest "No To Marxism in America."However, organizer Amber Cummings canceled the protest on Friday, saying Berkeley officials and left-wing extremists made it impossible to hold the event and she would be the sole attendee.Before the unpermitted events, Berkeley police put into place several rules in response the protests, stating, "To ensure the peaceful expression of free speech, the City of Berkeley will be prohibiting sticks, pipes, poles and anything else that can be used for a riot at Civic Center Park."The group of more than 100 hooded protesters, with shields emblazoned with the words "no hate" and waving a flag identifying themselves as anarchist, broke through police lines, avoiding security checks by officers to take away possible weapons.Then the group blended in with the rest of the crowd.
The irony is, however, that the attack on American democratic rights has already been underway before Trump entered the White House, and without much protest from the same media outlets who are now railing against Trump over this rant.The crimping of Russian news media is part of a wider campaign to suppress all alternative media outlets, including US-based websites, which are being labelled as agents of "foreign interests" because of merely posting articles sourced from RT and Sputnik.Many of these "respectable" news outlets, such as the New York Times and Washington Post, have in the past been guilty of purveying outrageously fake news, like the "weapons of mass destruction" claims which led to the 2003 US war in Iraq that killed over a million people and unleashed on the world the ongoing scourge of jihadist terrorism.On this issue, Trump is right when he denounces as "fake news" the campaign to pillory Russia and to allege that the Kremlin directed state-owned media to influence the November presidential election in Trumps favor.The US media outlets that are piously railing against Trump over his "assault on the Fourth Estate" are the same outlets which have piled on the pressure to suppress alternative media outlets like Russias RT and Sputnik, as well as other US-based independent information sources that are being demonized in McCarthyite fashion as "foreign agents."The irony is, however, that the attack on American democratic rights has already been underway before Trump entered the White House, and without much protest from the same media outlets who are now railing against Trump over this rant.The crimping of Russian news media is part of a wider campaign to suppress all alternative media outlets, including US-based websites, which are being labelled as agents of "foreign interests" because of merely posting articles sourced from RT and Sputnik.Many of these "respectable" news outlets, such as the New York Times and Washington Post, have in the past been guilty of purveying outrageously fake news, like the "weapons of mass destruction" claims which led to the 2003 US war in Iraq that killed over a million people and unleashed on the world the ongoing scourge of jihadist terrorism.
Shutterstock A Republican student association at San Diego State University is facing backlash for sending a letter demanding Muslim students condemn last week’s terror attacks in Barcelona.The Republican Club at San Diego State University wrote to the Muslim Student Association, claiming that the campus community could not move forward creating ‘an inclusive environment for all students’ until radical terrorism was disavowed.The letter said if no condemnation was forthcoming, the leaders of the student group should be forced to resign.The letter, signed by SDSU College Republicans Chairman Brandon Jones, stated in part that until radical Islamic terrorism is disavowed by the Muslim Student Organization at SDSU, we cannot move forward in creating an inclusive environment for all students on campus.It added the Muslim Student Association’s leadership should resign if they do not disavow Islamic terrorism.The national Muslim Student Association expressed support for the San Diego State chapter for their solidarity, strength and perseverance in the face of ignorance and hate.The Young Democratic Socialists of SDSU responded by declaring: We condemn the San Diego State College Republicans’ disgraceful statement towards the SDSU Muslim Student Association and the SDSU Muslim community.The Transfronterizo Alliance Student Organization, which describes itself as working to create an inclusive campus environment for SDSU students who live a transborder lifestyle, joined the chorus.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stands on stage with female supporters during a campaign rally, Friday, Oct. 14, 2016, in Charlotte, N.C. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) What has happened to our country, that we will nominate a man for president who has bullied, bad-mouthed and intimidated the public for decades?Donald Trump does not care about the Constitution and shows his ignorance about it every day.He has incited violence and says if he wins he’ll put his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, in jail.He has encouraged his supporters to intimidate voters at the polls, and now they are threatening a revolution.Trump has spread conspiracy theories that the election is rigged to help anger his base, which includes the K, the mentally unstable and those who hate immigrants.It’s frightening to consider that he supports Vladimir Putin and has encouraged Russian hacking.President Obama has more dignity in his little finger than Trump has in his whole body.Pam Wixom West Haven
Yesterday Worcester City Councilor Michael Gaffney wrote a letter to Turtleboy about his disgust towards Worcester Magazine Editor Walter Bird for the way Bird sexually harasses and tries to hook up with women who he has business dealings with.Well, he was probably mad that Buttmunch Billy Shaner, his newest minimum wage reporter, insinuated in the recent copy of their free newspaper that Councilor Gaffney subscribed to white nationalist ideology: YIKES: Quoting a white supremacist is not the best look, especially after one of them rammed a car into a group of people, killing one and injuring 19.Gaffney gives a completely applicable quote about the dangers of censoring free speech, which he and most other people attribute to Voltaire – the philosopher whose writings most historians agree was a driving force in the American Revolution.For the record, even the far left attributes this quote to Voltaire: So did people in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo murders: Voltaire: "To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticise" #JeSuisCharlie pic.twitter.3yt6jzHNH — Persia (ر) (@persiatx) August 13, 2014 So did Trump’s lucky sperm: To find out who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.Voltaire — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) April 25, 2013 This is what you get when you Google image that quote: In other words, everyone thinks Voltaire said this.You don’t go out of your way to research a meme’s origins, and then attribute it solely to a white supremacist, unless you’re trying to tie Gaffney to that particular white supremacist.Apparently Billy was texting Gaffney wanting to know why a post from one of his trolls named Eric Malouin was deleted: Notice the face he forgot to crop out after he screenshotted: That would be fellow Worcester Magazine minimum wage employee Oh I see now – it was a group effort from Worcester Magazine.He’s only been on the job a couple months and his childish vendetta was about to lead to the public humiliation of his boss.
Alex Jones (Right Wing Watch) Alex Jones delivered one of his all-time wildest rants against MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, whom he compared to demons, parasites and disease.The InfoWars host attacked the Morning Joe co-hosts Tuesday in a crazed tirade that included a bug-eyed, tongue-lolling impersonation of a demonic Brzezinski, reported Right Wing Watch.They’re both like horrible foot-long tapeworms, man, I’m telling you, Jones said.Tapeworms that we vomited out and crapped out and they’re just trying to force-feed themselves back into our lives.They’re like gonorrhea or syphilis, I mean they are just — they’re like HIV, they’re like cancer.They are just — I mean, you have to understand, folks, they literally want to destroy you.He promised the friends-turned-critics of President Donald Trump would be removed once Jones and his followers triumphed over their enemies, and then launched into a frenzied spasm of unholy gibberish.They’re like from upside-down world, folks, Jones said, making a reference to the Netflix series Stranger Things.
The Columbia University Law School professor and confidant of former FBI Director James Comey refuted a charge by President Donald Trump and his advocates in the media Monday: that Comey shared classified information with journalists.Richman did share the contents of one memo, he said, but "the substance of the memo passed on to the Times was not marked classified and to my knowledge remains unclassified."During Senate testimony in June, in which he said he gave memos to someone he described as a Columbia University professor, Comey said he specifically wrote the memos to avoid including classified information."My thinking was, if I write it in such a way that I dont include anything that would trigger a classification, thatll make it easier for us to discuss, within the FBI and the government, and to -- to hold on to it in a way that makes it accessible to us," Comey told senators.On Sunday, writing in The Hill, John Solomon reported that, "More than half of the memos former FBI Director James Comey wrote as personal recollections of his conversations with President Trump about the Russia investigation have been determined to contain classified information, according to interviews with officials familiar with the documents."The Hills reporting raised "the possibility," Solomon reported, that "Comey broke his own agencys rules and ignored the same security protocol" that Comey criticized Hillary Clinton for disregarding.Solomon did not report that the possible breaking of FBI rules was determined to have happened, nor did he report that this would be a violation of the law.One of the issues at play may have to do with whether any contents of the Comey memos have since been upgraded to classified, although that has not been definitively reported by CNN.
Most of the country condemned Kathy Griffin’s now-infamous photo shoot holding a fake severed head of President Trump.As the Trump family reacted to the photo, it was reported that President Trump’s youngest child—11-year-old Barron—had seen the photo while watching the news and became understandably upset.Not only was Griffin’s photo shoot and full admission of wrongdoing completely unacceptable by anyone’s standards, it was disrespectful to victims of terrorism and their families.CNN has since announced that Kathy Griffin has been fired from her job as a New Year’s Eve announcer for the network alongside Anderson Cooper, who also expressed outrage over the violent photo.With serious reactions to the photo taking place in the United States, opportunists usually crawl out of the woodwork to make a sad attempt at humor.Attacking a child who was understandably disturbed by the gruesome image of his father’s mock beheading is a new low in our society.Regarding which, by the way, President Trump released a statement condemning the act as hatred that has no place in the United States.It seems like reactions to disturbing incidents like the Kathy Griffin photo expose the true nature of individuals and separate those with compassion for humans—regardless of political belief—from truly heinous people.
Despite the fact that the Las Vegas shooter would have passed any an all background checks, some on the left still think background checks will somehow solve all of our ills in this country.They’re absolutely convinced that universal background checks will miraculously keep guns out of the hands of not just criminals, but also the man who may someday open fire on an unsuspecting crowd enjoying some music.Attacks such as the San Bernardino massacre in California and the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon occurred in states that already have universal background checks.Last year, ABC News’s Jon Karl asked Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Why are we focusing on things that have nothing to do with the massacres that we are responding to?Murphy responded, We can’t get into the trap in which we are forced to defend our proposals simply because it didn’t stop the last tragedy.Michael Bloomberg’s groups are the source of contrary claims, but they fail to analyze the national data in an academic manner.The fact is that criminals have a pipeline for inexpensive black market guns that require no background checks either, as was illustrated by CBS in their report on Chicago gun crime.Right now, things are no different except they’re also trying to ban things that have no bearing on what happened, just because they figure the public will back it at the moment.
State Police say an investigation has revealed the information in the viral video not to be accurate.(Photo from ) ( ) -- The Michigan State Police out of Detroit took to Twitter reporting the claims of a viral video about human trafficking in a Metro Detroit suburb are not accurate."It was investigated by law enforcement and not a case of human trafficking.He was right about being vigilant but that’s about it," said the State Police on Twitter.This is the Facebook post where Nick Ahmad claims human trafficking almost happened to his wife and others.The video has been viewed over 650,0 times and shared close to 30,0 times.After an investigation the Michigan State Police took to twitter saying the viral Facebook video is not accurate.
After constant attacks from the political and media elites, Steve Bannon has some of the thickest skin in America.When asked what he thought of the diss, the Breitbart boss offered a classic response.Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon does not give a shit about Eminem’s freestyle roast in which he name-checks Bannon in his attempted takedown of President Donald Trump.On the record: Honey badger don’t give a shit, Bannon reportedly told Joshua Green, the Bloomberg reporter and author of the best-selling Devil’s Bargain book, on Wednesday evening.At the BET Hip Hop Awards on Tuesday, Eminem appeared in a video in which he attacked Trump and referenced Bannon.Complete with references to Steve Bannon and the K. Of course, there is no truth to anything Eminem was rapping about.Meanwhile inner cities across the US continue to suffer and wither away with their drugs, gangs and Democrat politicians.Sponsored Sponsored
Trump’s promise to Make America Great Again is a call to return us to a past in which white men of all classes could expect the government to protect their economic and social dominance relative to racial minorities and women.And despite his open disdain for the rule of law, he often justified his mission by invoking the language the reactionary right has long used to describe their quest to turn back time: restoring the Constitution.But while the Founders lacked the empathy or courage to recognize that We the People includes people of all colors, religions and genders, they enshrined revolutionary principles of what liberty entails and left room for us to interpret and amend the document to be more in keeping with those principles.Historically, we’ve made major strides by getting our fellow citizens to accept evolved interpretations of the Constitution’s text – for example, by arguing that segregation violates the right to equal protection of the law, and that forcing a person to carry a pregnancy to term against her will violates her 14th Amendment right to liberty.It’s a moment to remember that in the not-so-distant past a suffragette demanding the full rights of citizenship could be imprisoned and force-fed, and even more recently black people doing the same were beaten and lynched.Right now, in the days and weeks and months after Trump’s upset victory, we must articulate a vision of the Constitution to combat the idea that our changed country is a deviation from it.We need to be clear that there is no going back to when things were great just for white men – the changes we’ve seen are the inevitable result of moving closer to the equality the Constitution requires.But the more concrete and immediate reason we have to start talking about the Constitution is that many of the things Trump wants to do are not only terrible policy, but flagrantly unconstitutional.
