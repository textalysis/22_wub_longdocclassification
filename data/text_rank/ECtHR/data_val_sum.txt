7.  in december 2010 the applicant was arrested in the russian federation and extradited to moldova, where he was placed in detention on 29 december 2010 on the basis of the detention warrant of 14 february 2002. the applicant lodged a habeas corpus request in which he complained, inter alia, that he had not been informed about the detention warrant of 14 february 2002 within seventy-two hours, as provided by law, and that there were no relevant and sufficient reasons to deprive him of his liberty.13 in chişinău between 29 december 2010 and 22 march 2012 and after 10 january 2013. the applicant alleges that the cells were overcrowded and dirty; there was no ventilation system; there was no sufficient natural light because the windows were very small; the daily walks lasted for only one hour and the food served was of a very poor quality.whereas the special rapporteur notes that the minimum norms regarding nutrition of detainees (government decision n. 609 of 29 may 2006) are checked on a daily basis and that, according to the financial plan of the penitentiary department, the food budget for 2008 had almost doubled in comparison to 2004 and is set to rise further, he also received consistent allegations regarding the poor quality and quantity of food.“conditions of detention”) the human rights centre found, inter alia, that: “failure to adhere to the statutory cell size (4 square metres per person) in the living blocks of the institution has become an unpleasant problem which now affects the prison system across the entire country.in this connection, the minister of justice provided information to the ombudsman about the expenditure on prisoners’ food in 2010. the cost amounted to mdl 24.05 million, whereas the budgetary need for the same year was, according to the ministry of finance’s draft budget, mdl 29.05 million.
eventually the applicant gave in and agreed to write down a “statement of surrender and confession” (явка с повинной), as dictated by the officers, admitting to the robbery and murder of ms e. 11.  an investigator of the town prosecutor’s office, mr a., questioned the applicant as a suspect and later went to the applicant’s flat to seize a few items including the mobile phone contract for the applicant’s sim card.according to the government, during the visit the applicant confirmed his statement made in the presence of the lawyer in the course of the second interview of 19 march 2004. he also selected a knife similar to that used to stab ms e. from a selection of four knives available at a local shop.the applicant complained to the judge about his ill-treatment; she refused to take note of the allegations, however, stating that they could be examined in the course of the trial against the applicant.34.  on 20 october 2004 the regional court ordered an expert medical examination of the x-ray of 30 march 2004. it can be seen from the trial record of that date that n. informed the judge that he was not an expert in interpreting x‑rays and asked for a period of two weeks to consult a colleague; the judge acceded to the request.37.  the trial judge also examined in detail the evidence presented by the parties in relation to the allegation of ill‑treatment, including the decision of 18 june 2004 and the expert medical report ordered in respect of the x-ray.
such an attitude infringes the right of the minor s. therefore, given [the second applicant’s] age, the need for an emotional bond to be created between the minor child and the non-cohabitant parent, the need to protect her rights, as well (the need) to eliminate any possibility for manipulation that would prevent the expert team to supervise the enforcement of the contact arrangements between the minor child and the father, (the centre) decided the father’s visiting rights in respect of the minor s.s...”.12-07/33), specifying that his meetings with the second applicant were to take place in the centre every monday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. the order further stated that: “... the expert team (notes that) the minor s. is still breast-fed, but (since) it is necessary to further strengthen the [child’s] emotional bond with the non-cohabitant parent and to protect the right of [the second applicant] to have contact with the father, it considers that the visiting rights should remain once a week, but longer, which would enable that (the child) stays overnight after she would no longer be breast-fed.” 15.  the centre further set two dates on which the father could meet the second applicant, to replace the meetings missed in january and march 2008 (see paragraph 13 above)....the expert team considers that the forceful enforcement (of the order of 29 april 2008) as specified in (this decision) is in the absolute interest of the minor [second applicant] ...” 17.  the first applicant was ordered to take the second applicant to the centre on 2 june 2008 or risk being prosecuted for child abduction under article 198 of the criminal code.21.  the first applicant decided not to testify at the hearing held on 10 july 2008. the first-instance court heard the father, who stated that for reasons unknown to him he had not seen his daughter at any of the scheduled meetings since 29 april 2008. a representative of the centre stated that the first applicant had not complied with its orders of 29 april and 28 may 2008, notwithstanding the fact that she had been informed of the consequences of non-compliance.lastly, it stated that: “in assessing the severity of the sentence, the court took into consideration all relevant circumstances (aggravating and mitigating factors) ... in particular, the gravity of the charges and concrete consequences, the manner in which the crime had been committed, the fact that [the first applicant] had already been convicted of the same offence on 2 july [judgment k.br.133/07] and 17 december 2007 [judgment k.br.229/07] and [sentenced to an alternative penalty-suspended prison term].
10.  on 20 march 2007 the oleksandrivka prosecutor overruled the decision of 14 february 2007 as premature and on 21 march 2007 instituted criminal proceedings in connection with the infliction of bodily harm of medium severity on the applicant.15.  on 10 december 2007 the oleksandrivka prosecutor’s office, in response to the applicant’s complaint about the progress of the investigation, asked the kirovograd regional police department to have the police officers in charge of the investigation disciplined.20.  on 1 july 2009 the investigator refused to institute criminal proceedings against mr k. 21.  on 7 july 2009 the novomyrgorod prosecutor issued a bill of indictment against mrs k. 22.  on 24 july 2009 the oleksandrivka court remitted the case against mrs k. for further investigation, holding that the applicant had not been informed about the completion of the investigation until 3 july 2009 and had therefore not been given enough time to study the case file.23.  on 13 november 2009 the novomyrgorod prosecutor quashed the decision of 1 july 2009 not to institute criminal proceedings against mr k. subsequently the investigator again refused to institute criminal proceedings against mr k. 24.  on 21 december 2009 the new round of pre-trial investigation in the case against mrs k. was completed and another bill of indictment was issued by the novomyrgorod prosecutor.26.  on 13 july 2010 the novomyrgorod prosecutor quashed the decision not to institute criminal proceedings against mr k. on 26 may 2011 the investigator again refused to institute criminal proceedings against mr k. 27.  on 20 december 2011 the znamyanka court convicted mrs k. of inflicting bodily harm of medium severity on the applicant, sentencing her to restriction of liberty for two years, suspended for a one-year probationary period.
10.  prior notice of the demonstration of 2 april 2011 had been given to the relevant authority, the baku city executive authority (“the bcea”), on 18 march 2011. on 31 march 2011 the bcea refused to allow the demonstration to be held at the place indicated by the organisers, and proposed that it be held at another place on the outskirts of baku.14.  the applicant signed the part of the administrative-offence report acknowledging that he had been familiarised with the report, but left without signature the part with a pre-printed text which stated that “the rights and obligations under articles 371, 372, 374, 377, 379 and 410.4 of the cao of the republic of azerbaijan were explained”.22.  the applicant lodged an appeal before the baku court of appeal, presenting his version of the facts surrounding the arrest, and arguing that he had been arrested in connection with the demonstration scheduled for 2 april 2011. he also complained that his arrest had been unlawful and that the hearing before the first-instance court had not been fair.34.  the applicant stated before the court that he had been taken to a police station from his apartment, that it had been his father who had let the police officers in, that at the police station he had been questioned about his political activity, and that he was not guilty of disobeying a police officer or of swearing at the location indicated by the police.37.  the applicant lodged an appeal before the sumgait court of appeal, presenting his version of the facts surrounding the arrest, and arguing that his arrest had been unlawful, that the hearing before the first-instance court had not been fair and that his right to respect for home had been violated by the police.
17.  on 8 june 2010 the newspaper “segodnya”, issued in the kyiv region, published an article under the headline “a bad [police] station” («нехороший участок») about the alleged ill-treatment of the applicant’s son in the shevchenkivskyy police station in spring 2010. the author relied, in particular, on the statements of one of k.’s cell-mates.35.  on 30 september 2011 the sizo administration sent to the investigator the list of the staff members who had been on duty during the night of 9 to 10 april 2010. as regards the list of k.’s cell-mates at the time, the administration informed the investigator that no records were kept in that regard.she was represented by the same lawyer who had earlier represented k. 38.  on 9 december 2011 the chief of the shevchenkivskyy police department informed the applicant’s lawyer that the investigation, which had been initiated on 10 march 2011 (see paragraph 30 above), was ongoing.47.  on 8 june 2011 the sizo deputy governor and the chief of the medical unit replied that, following a planned x-ray that day, k. had been diagnosed with infiltrative tuberculosis of the right lung and had been transferred to the sizo’s medical unit for treatment.52.  in a letter of 28 november 2011 to the applicant’s lawyer the sizo management noted that they had previously asked the kyiv city court of appeal, which was dealing with the criminal case against k., to either accelerate the examination of that case or release k. on health grounds.
12.  all three applicants refused to sign the respective administrative-offence reports, which contained pre-printed texts declaring that “[the arrested person] was familiarised with the report” and “the rights and obligations under articles 371, 372, 374, 377, 379 and 410.4 of the cao of the republic of azerbaijan were explained”.14.  according to those administrative-arrest reports, copies of which were submitted to the court by the government, the first and second applicants had been subjected to administrative arrest at 7 p.m. on 22 may 2011. the reports also stated that the applicants had been released on the same date, without specifying the time of the alleged releases, and contained signatures of the first and second applicants.17.  according to the applicant, the hearing, which began at 12.40 p.m., was very brief and members of the public, including human rights defenders and journalists, were not allowed to attend, even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public.27.  according to the applicant, the hearing, which began at 12.30 p.m., was very brief and members of the public were not allowed to attend, even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public.36.  according to the applicant, the hearing, which began at 12.30 p.m., was very brief and members of the public were not allowed to attend, even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public.
when she told the officers she needed to use the toilet, s. hit her in the stomach and the head.she was then taken to the office of the head of the search unit, who stated that she was the main suspect in the theft case and that all her colleagues had indicated her as the likely thief.26.  on 9 february 2009 a forensic expert evaluation was carried out of the applicant’s handwritten statement on the official report on the questioning of 8 november 2008. the expert concluded that she had been “in an unusual state” when writing that note.29.  on 19 march 2009, however, the kharkiv regional court of appeal (“the court of appeal”) quashed that decision and remitted the case to the first-instance court for fresh examination.36.  on 15 november 2010 the court of appeal quashed the ruling of the first-instance court and remitted the case to it for fresh examination.
it further held that the decision had been issued in accordance with the law and that it had been justified taking into account the applicant’s aggressive and vulgar behaviour in the remand centre, his refusing meals and his unrepentent attitude towards the offences of which he had been convicted by the first-instance court.18.  the applicant appealed against the decisions of 23 december 2010 and 23 march 2011. in his appeal against the former decision the applicant claimed, in particular, that the commission had arbitrarily classified him as “dangerous”, that he had no access to the opinions and the prison authorities’ request leading to this classification, and he had been debased and humiliated by “[being] consciously kept ... in inhuman conditions”.the court further held: “further circumstances such as personal conditions, the applicant’s behaviour in detention and the extent of his lack of moral character are subject to assessment and the decision in this respect cannot be examined from the viewpoint of lawfulness.it could be examined as regards its equity; this however would go beyond the limits of examination laid down by article 7 § 1 of the code of execution of criminal sentences.” as regards the applicant’s further complaints the court held that they did not have any influence on the commission’s decision and as such “did not even merit examination.” 20.  on 11 may 2011 the lublin regional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 23 march 2011 holding that it had been based on “the applicant’s attitude and negative behaviour and the assessment of his rehabilitation progress”.on 17 december 2009 the lublin regional court convicted him of attempting to escape while being transported to a psychiatric examination on 14 august 2007. this conviction was upheld by the lublin court of appeal on 10 november 2010. on 10 february 2012 the applicant was convicted by the lublin regional court of having assaulted a public servant on 4 august 2009.
10.  on 29 january 1997 the constitutional court abrogated some of the provisions of the aptso, including the one stipulating the time-limit for lodging a purchase request (see paragraph 23 below) 11.  the applicant’s husband died on 15 april 2006.14.  in its judgment of 24 june 2008 the zagreb municipal court held that there was no dispute between the parties that the applicant, as a former holder of a specially protected tenancy of the flat that she occupied, had the right to purchase that flat under favourable conditions.she also relied on the opinion of the constitutional court that the very purpose of the sale to occupier act was to enable holders of specially protected tenancies in respect of socially and state-owned flats to purchase such flats (see paragraph 22 below).16.  the first-instance judgment was upheld by the zagreb county court on 12 october 2010. the relevant part of the second-instance judgment reads: “as regards the decisions of the constitutional court relied on in the [plaintiff’s] action, it is to be noted that these decisions exceptionally recognised the right of certain parties to purchase flats [they occupied] in particular circumstances (such as their having had no clearly regulated status of holder of a specially protected tenancy before that date – for example in decision no.the view of this court is that the holders of specially protected tenancies of state-owned flats were obliged to lodge a request for purchasing these flats before 31 december 1995 (with the exception that in certain circumstances it was possible to claim that a party was prevented from lodging such a request within that time-limit on objective grounds).” 17.  the applicant’s subsequent constitutional complaint was dismissed on 20 february 2013. the relevant part of that decision reads: “the constitutional court notes that the competent courts dismissed the applicant’s civil action on the grounds that she had not proved that any objective circumstances had prevented her from lodging a request to purchase the flat in issue within the prescribed time-limit.
the court found that there was a competitive relationship between the f. company and the applicants, and found the statements made by the applicants to be defamatory under article 1330 of the civil code and unethical under the unfair competition act (bundesgesetz gegen den unlauteren wettbewerb).as a result of that balancing exercise, the court of appeal found that the “locust” statement had to be considered a lawful criticism in the context of a public debate, and that the f. company could therefore not base its claim on article 1330 of the civil code.it referred to the extensive reasoning given in the interim injunction proceedings and added that, according to the case-law of the supreme court, the test used to verify whether a statement was covered by the right to freedom of expression required the assessment of whether a factual basis for such a statement existed; if a competitor participated in a public debate of general interest, freedom of expression had more weight with regard to the assessment of the statement than in the context of purely commercial communication.17.  the applicants lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law against that judgment, which was rejected by the supreme court on 14 july 2009. the supreme court found that the applicants had not only called the f. company a “locust”, but had also reproached this company for negative conduct, such as dominating doctors, dismissing doctors who did not act in accordance with company wishes, and focusing on economic factors rather than the welfare of patients (“herrschaft über den ärztlichen berufstand, kündigung nicht “spurender” ärzte, orientierung an ökonomischen erwägungen und damit nicht am wohl der patienten”).furthermore, the issuing of warnings concerning the potential risks of the provision of medical services by companies was not, as such, prohibited by the decisions of the austrian courts; the applicants had only been required to refrain from making untrue statements of fact in respect of their competitors.
7.  on 14 october 2011, the lublin remand centre penitentiary commission (“the commission”) imposed a special regime for detainees deemed to be dangerous (“the dangerous detainee regime”) on the applicant.the commission referred to the fact that the applicant had organised a collective protest in opole lubelskie prison, namely, a hunger strike by prisoners, and that he had planned an attack on a prison employee.10.  on 12 january 2012 the commission again reviewed the situation and upheld its decision, considering that the applicant posed a serious danger to the security of the prison.it also referred to the applicant’s highly deficient moral character (wysoki stopień demoralizacji), and the fact that he had been the leader of a collective protest in opole lubelskie prison (the prisoners’ hunger strike) and had planned an attack on a prison employee.the applicant was subjected to a body search every time he left and entered the cell, which in practice meant that he had to strip naked in front of prison officers and was required to bend over to allow his anus to be examined.
after that the armed men were taken to the karabulak town police department and the premises of the omon unit (the entire perimeter of the town police station had been surrounded by civilians expressing their indignation at the actions of the unidentified persons who had made several “insurance” shots to the head of the unarmed wounded young man who had fallen to the ground next to the nursery school and who, according to the nearby residents, then had placed an armed grenade under his body to make it look like the young man had offered resistance).the ingushetia minister of the interior and the head of the ingushetia fsb had arrived at the scene and taken the decision to immediately release the arrested persons to avoid making their identities known to the public ... the unidentified persons ... had offered resistance to the omon officers ... as a result [of the scuffle], the police officers [m.o.]the karabulak town prosecutor overruled this decision ... i lodged another complaint with the karabulak investigating department in which i requested that a criminal case be opened in order to investigate the killing of mr apti dalakov; witnesses to the incident, in addition to the police officers from the karabulak town police department and the ingushetia omon who had participated in the detention of the fsb officers who had shot mr apti dalakov, be identified and questioned ... and victim status in the criminal case be granted to me.the failure of the investigating authorities to act violates article 2 of the european convention of human rights... i request, on the basis of article 125 of the russian criminal procedure code that the court ... 1.  declare unlawful the failure of the investigating authorities to initiate a criminal investigation in respect of my complaint, to identify and question witnesses to the killing ... and grant me victim status in the proceedings; 2.  oblige the karabulak investigating committee (1)  to remedy the above breaches; (2)  to open a criminal case in connection with mr apti dalakov’s killing (3)  to grant me victim status in the criminal case (4)  to identify and question witnesses to mr apti dalakov’s killing (5)  to question officers of the karabulak town police department and the ingushetia omon who arrested those involved in mr apti dalakov’s killing ...” according to the government, the applicant lodged this complaint on 18 august 2008. the incoming mail registration stamp on the copy of the document indicates that this complaint was received on 14 august 2008.on the basis of the above, under paragraph 5 of article 125 of the russian criminal procedure code, the court finds that the complaint of mr magomed dalakov under article 125 of the russian criminal procedure code concerning alleged failure of the karabulak investigating committee to act should be rejected ...” 44.  according to the government’s submission, both parties were present during the examination on 18 and 23 september 2008. the applicant, who was represented at the hearing by his lawyer, was provided with a copy of the decision by letter from the court, sent to his address on the same date.
5.  while in detention, the applicants mr yevdokimov, mr rezanov, and mr morozov lodged defamation claims against private third parties; the applicants mr makhov, mr resin, mr anikanov, mr lebetskiy, mr gromovoy, mr gordeyev and mr vinokhodov brought claims seeking compensation for the allegedly inhuman conditions of their detention; and the applicant mr martirosyan lodged a civil claim for compensation, alleging that the criminal proceedings had been instituted unlawfully.the domestic courts refused them the possibility to be present at the hearing, on the ground that there was no domestic legal provision for bringing detainees to courts.in particular, they quoted article 77.1 of the code on the execution of sentences (see paragraph 11 below) and the relevant provisions of the code of civil procedure.7.  the applicants appealed, raising the question of their appearance in court in the appeal statement.the appeal courts either dismissed the applicants’ arguments or concluded that their absence from the court was in line with the legislation and did not contravene the principle of fairness.
noting that some of those comments could be regarded as an attempt to influence the court’s work, the president emphasised the following points: that throughout the trial the judges had acted pursuant only to the provisions of criminal law; that the purpose of the trial was different from that of the parliamentary commission of inquiry; and that as professional judges the members of the bench had been able to resist any pressure that might result from the media statements made in connection with the case by various journalists and politicians, or even by certain members of the commission.in view of doubts as to the weight of the vote of 28 may, the sejm endorsed the report by the mp zbigniew ziobro by its final vote of 24 september 2004. the position taken in that report was as follows: “leszek miller, prime minister, aleksandra jakubowska, junior minister in the ministry of culture, lech nikolski, the prime minister’s chief of staff, robert kwiatkowski, chair of the board of directors of the company tvp s.a., and wlodzimierz czarzasty, member of the broadcasting media council, committed, by deliberate and concerted action in july 2002, the offence of bribery, within the meaning of article 228 § 5 of the criminal code taken together with article 13 § 1 thereof; in that they, [while] influencing the content of the broadcasting act being amended and the parliamentary proceedings related thereto, in july 2002, through the intermediary of lew rywin, acting as agent of the ‘power-holding group’, made a corrupt proposal to the representatives of agora s.a, namely on 15 july 2002 to wanda rapaczyńska and piotr niemczycki and on 22 july 2002 to adam michnik, consisting in demanding a financial reward of 17.5 million us dollars (usd), the appointment of lew rywin as chairman of the channel polsat and an undertaking from the company agora that the newspaper gazeta wyborcza would refrain from publishing any criticism of the prime minister or government.38.  in response to the applicant’s complaint that the proceedings of the commission and their media coverage had undermined the fairness of his trial, the court of appeal found that this complaint was not substantiated by any tangible evidence; the applicant had not explained concretely how the media reports on the commission’s work had influenced the reasoning of the judges in their deliberations or the outcome of the criminal proceedings, or how the commission’s proceedings and report might have had any impact on the impartiality of the judges or on the reliability of the testimony given before the trial court.2. on the proposal of the president of the republic, or at least 115 members of parliament, a resolution to hold a cabinet member to account before the tribunal of state shall be passed by the sejm by a majority of three-fifths of the number of members of parliament provided for by the constitution.” article 175 “the administration of justice in the republic of poland shall be implemented by the supreme court, the ordinary courts, the administrative courts the and military courts.for violations of the constitution or of a statute committed by them in office, the following persons shall be constitutionally accountable before the tribunal of state: the president of the republic, the prime minister and members of the cabinet, the president of the national bank of poland, the president of the supreme chamber of audit, members of the national council of radio and television broadcasting, persons whom the prime minister has appointed to head a ministry and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
12.  on 21 november 2005 the applicant was examined by an external psychological expert who criticised in detail the diagnosis of sexual sadism during the trial, in particular the lack of information about the applicant’s inner experiences during the onset of the disorder, its further development, and the failure to evaluate his previous offences.in this context the regional court observed that neither the statement by the psychological expert at the hearing nor the current and prior expert opinions had excluded the possibility that the applicant was suffering from sexual sadism, although this diagnosis had been found to be rather unlikely (see paragraphs 10 to 14, above).lastly, the regional court noted, but explicitly without basing its decision on this fact, that the expert opinion which had been delivered in the course of the re-opening proceedings of the criminal trial had confirmed the diagnosis of sadism.the expert, who had not examined the applicant in person due to his refusal to permit such examination, found that the applicant was suffering from a disturbance of his sexual preference in the form of sadism and that the commission of further crimes was to be expected.29.  on 19 january 2015 the darmstadt regional court again decided not to suspend the order for the applicant’s placement in a psychiatric hospital and not to grant probation after obtaining a written opinion from the haina forensic-psychiatric clinic in which the applicant has been detained and after hearing the applicant.
19.  in a judgment and decision dated 13 january 2011 the supreme court dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant on 7 september 2010. it found that the lower courts had not made an error of law in the legal classification of the facts they had established, that they had not failed to take necessary evidence and that they had sufficiently reasoned their judgments.25.  the applicant argued, in particular, that all of the five challenged judges had taken arbitrary decisions to his disadvantage and in breach of his convention rights in relation to the previous injunction and other proceedings brought by him, and that the court, which was influenced by the executive, discriminated against foreign nationals such as the applicant.32.  the constitutional court stated that, in accordance with the principle that, if possible, a complaint of bias should not be decided upon by the challenged judge, the challenged judges, respectively, had not participated in the deliberations and the decision on the respective complaint alleging bias against them, which had been decided upon by the four remaining judges.35.  the constitutional court found that the total duration of the proceedings alone, which lasted almost seven years after the action of 10 june 2005 had been brought, did not justify the finding of a breach of the right to a decision within a reasonable time.there had only been a delay of two years and three months between the last hearing before the court of first instance on 6 september 2007 and the delivery of the judgment on 28 december 2009. such a period of inactivity could no longer be considered as reasonable despite the complexity of the proceedings.
the panel’s role was first, to establish whether, at the date of recall, there had been a significant risk of the applicant committing serious harm; and secondly, to consider whether the risk currently posed by the applicant was capable of being managed safely in the community, and, if not, whether there were steps that might be taken with a view to reducing the current risk to a level that could, in the future, be safely managed in the community.29.  the smith panel dealt with the applicant’s submissions on the unfairness of the proceedings by noting that: “... [counsel for the applicant’s] approach to the issue of [the complainant] being subpoenaed was a perfectly legitimate tactical manoeuvre by which he sought, on the one hand, to characterise the failure to subpoena [the complainant] as unfair, while on the other hand, he sought to avoid being instrumental in securing her attendance at the hearing and giving evidence with the consequent danger of the case against [the applicant] being strengthened.32.  on 4 july 2006 the applicant filed a notice of appeal against the judgment of the high court in which he argued that the smith panel had misdirected itself as to the standard of proof required to establish the allegations against him; that the procedure before the smith panel had been unfair and in breach of articles 5 § 4 and 6 of the convention, most notably because the applicant’s nieces should have been required to give evidence; and finally, that there had not been a “speedy determination” of the lawfulness of his detention.37.  on 5 december 2007, after hearing oral submissions, the court decided not to consider the applicant’s submissions on article 5 § 1. it noted that this issue had not been raised in the course of the appeal proceedings and, although it had been included in the initial order 53 statement (a statement lodged with the judicial review application setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it was sought), it had not been directly in issue before the high court and the judge had therefore made no findings on it.on the article 5 § 4 issue – namely, whether the evidence of risk before the first rodgers panel in march 2008 must inevitably have led it to the conclusion that the applicant’s detention was no longer necessary for the protection of the public –, the court noted that the evidence of the witnesses with regard to the risk the applicant posed had not been uniform and the panel had therefore been entitled to reach the decision that it did.
among other conditions, x undertook to “actively provide the investigation with information” about “mr ofitserov and mr navalnyy’s involvement in the misappropriation [of assets], their roles in the commission of the crime, the specific steps taken to implement the criminal plan, including at the stages of preparation and conclusion of the sales contract and demonstration of its feasibility and utility.” on 17 october 2012 the criminal case-file against x was disjoined from the applicants’ case.to implement n.’s criminal plan, o., acting in agreement with him, created in march 2009 ... the limited liability company “ooo vlk” ... thus facilitating the commission of the crime ... ... later, [x] ... acting deliberately and in agreement with n. and o., signed a sales contract with vlk ... in full realisation of the damaging consequences ... because of [vlk’s ]lack of adequate collateral ... ... in doing so, [x], n. and o. had sound knowledge that ooo vlk would pay for the goods under the terms of the contract and its annexes at a price known to be lower than that kirovles could have received without an intermediary ... ... in the period 15 april 2009 to 13 july 2009 ... [x] and o., in conspiracy with n., who had organised the crime and ordered its implementation, signed [thirty-six] annexes to the contract ... which stipulated ... a price which was deliberately reduced by all [of the] partners in crime without any economic need compared to the price kirovles could have sold its products for if it supplied the vlk customers of directly.in the period 15 april 2009 to 30 september 2009 in kirov, [x], acting in abuse of his official position, and o., in conspiracy with and on the instructions of n., deliberately implemented the terms of the sales contract ... and its annexes ... ... [x], acting in premeditated conspiracy with n. and o., out of acquisitive motives therefore abused his official position, ... unlawfully dissipated the assets he was in charge of ... for the benefit of third parties – partners in crime and ooo vlk under their control, thus causing significant damage to the assets of their owner, kirovles.however, it stressed that the first applicant had not been accused, or convicted, of any abuse of his official position at the governor’s office: “mr navalnyy [is not suspected of] committing a crime by abuse of his official position; consequently, the defence’s arguments that the governor’s volunteer consultant had no powers to give binding instructions to the companies’ management do not refute the accusation [or] prove that it was impossible for mr navalnyy to commit the crime and order its execution.” 65.  as regards the legal classification of the applicants’ offences, the court held: “the court finds that the arguments put forward by the defence about the absence of unlawfulness, a necessary element of theft, because a regular civil‑law transaction has been concluded by persons with legal capacity, are unfounded.[x’s] acts were classified by the court as falling under article 160 § 4 of the criminal code.” 66.  the court estimated that the damage caused to kirovles amounted to rub 16,165,826. it concluded that the first applicant was guilty of organising the theft of kirovles’ assets by x (article 33 § 3 in conjunction with article 160 § 4 of the criminal code), and the second applicant of facilitating that theft (article 33 § 4 in conjunction with article 160 § 4 of the criminal code).
12.  on 29 march 2010 the warsaw regional court extended the applicant’s detention until 31 july 2010. the court relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences, the severity of the anticipated penalty and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings due to the organised character of the criminal activities in question.the court also referred to the fact, relied on by the court which had imposed the detention on the applicant (see paragraph 8 above), that one of the charges against him concerned witness tampering by means of violence.it relied on the severity of the anticipated penalty and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings in finding that keeping the applicant in custody was necessary.34.  the applicant’s pre-trial detention was subsequently extended by the decisions of the warsaw regional court of 11 september and 11 december 2012 and of 21 february 2013, and of the warsaw court of appeal of 18 june and 22 august 2013. the courts continually justified their decisions by the existence of a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question.39.  the applicant’s detention pending trial was extended by the warsaw regional court on 17 september and 17 december 2013 and on 20 january 2014. the court repeatedly relied on the reasonable suspicion against the applicant, the severity of anticipated penalty and the risk that the applicant might obstruct the proceedings due to the organised character of the offences in question.
26.  following a request from the applicant’s lawyer of 12 october 2012, on 22 january 2013 the supreme court of justice of the republic of moldova quashed the judgment of the “tiraspol people’s court” of 1 july 2010. with reference to articles 114 and 115 of the constitution and section 1 of the law on the status of judges (see paragraphs 69-70 below), the court found that the courts established in the “mrt” had not been created in accordance with the moldovan legislation and could not therefore lawfully convict the applicant.his continued detention in the conditions of [pre-trial detention centres] appears problematic owing to the absence of laboratory equipment and specially qualified medical staff at [the centre] for the purposes of carrying out the required treatment and its monitoring.” 38.  despite the panel’s findings, the applicant was transferred on the same day to the ivs in hlinaia, which, as stated by the applicant and not contradicted by the respondent governments, was less well equipped than the centre.“... the de facto authorities in transnistria have ... pledged unilaterally to respect some of the key international treaties, including the two un covenants on human rights, the european convention on human rights and the convention on the rights of the child.” (p. 4) “the changes of the role of the prosecutor and the creation of the investigation committee would have an impact on the functioning of the judiciary as well.the osce has not been allowed to verify these claims.” in its annual report for 2006 the osce reported as follows: “... the 17 september ‘independence’ referendum and the 10 december ‘presidential’ elections in transnistria – neither one recognized nor monitored by the osce – shaped the political environment of this work ... to spur on the settlement talks, the mission drafted in early 2006 documents that suggested: a possible delimitation of competencies between central and regional authorities; a mechanism for monitoring factories in the transnistrian military‑industrial complex; a plan for the exchange of military data; and an assessment mission to evaluate conditions and make recommendations for democratic elections in transnistria.67.  in paragraph 18 of resolution 1896 (2012) on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the russian federation, the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe noted as follows: “the opening of polling stations in abkhazia (georgia), south ossetia (georgia) and transnistria (republic of moldova) without the explicit consent of the de jure authorities in tbilisi and chişinău, as well as the prior ‘passportisation’ of populations in these territories, violated the territorial integrity of these states, as recognised by the international community, including the parliamentary assembly.” 68.  on 10 may 2010 the international committee of the red cross (icrc) replied to a letter from the permanent mission of the republic of moldova concerning the applicant’s case, stating that an icrc delegate and a doctor had seen the applicant on 29 april 2010. during their visit, they had met with the applicant in private and had been told that he had regular contact with his family and could receive parcels from them.
8.  in december 2003 the kaunas county administration (hereinafter “the kca”) brought a claim before the kaunas district court (kauno rajono apylinkės teismas) seeking the annulment of the administrative decisions and the purchase agreements on the basis of which plots of land had been sold to the applicant and to several other individuals.the court annulled the administrative decision of 1993 assigning the land to the applicant and the land purchase agreement of 1995, and ordered the kaunas region municipality to return 29.70 “single-use investment vouchers” to the applicant.thus, in accordance with the civil code, the applicant should have received the monetary equivalent of what she had paid in 1995. the court remitted that part of the case for re-examination in order to assess the monetary equivalent.however, the court of appeal found that the lower court had incorrectly assessed the nominal value of the land in 1995. referring to the text of the purchase agreement (see paragraph 6 above), the court awarded the applicant ltl 2,976 (eur 862).the supreme court stated that the nominal value of the land had been indicated in the purchase agreement, so it had not been necessary to apply article 6.147 of the civil code and assess the monetary equivalent.
10.  in 1990, military prosecutors in bucharest, timişoara, oradea, constanţa, craiova, bacău, târgu mureş and cluj opened investigations into the use of force and the unlawful deprivation of liberty of the participants in demonstrations in the final days of december 1989. to date, the main criminal investigation into the use of violence, particularly against civilian demonstrators, both prior to and following the overthrow of nicolae ceauşescu, has been contained in file no.the investigation into crimes committed by civilians, members of the patriotic guards, militia members and prison staff was severed from the case file and jurisdiction was relinquished in favour of the prosecuting authorities at the high court of cassation and justice.12.  on 15 april 2011 the chief prosecutor at the military prosecutor’s office set aside the decision of 18 october 2010 on the grounds that the investigation had not yet been finalised and that not all the victims and perpetrators had been identified.13.  on 18 april 2011 the military prosecutor’s office relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the prosecutor’s office at the high court of cassation and justice on the grounds that the investigation concerned both civilians and military personnel.15.  in february 2014, after the entry into force of the new code of criminal procedure, jurisdiction was again relinquished in favour of the military prosecuting authorities and the file was registered under the domestic case file no.
12.  on the same day the director of the music academy sent a letter to the applicant stating the following: “as we have explained on several occasions to your mother, your father and yourself, since you have failed to provide a report from a fully equipped public hospital (tam teşekküllü devlet hastanesi[2]) confirming that you can study at the music academy ... we have been unable to enrol you ... we look forward to receiving your report from a public hospital mentioning your admission to the music academy as a student as soon as possible ...” 13.  on 20 september 2004 the applicant’s father wrote to the director of the music academy to inform him that the medical report had been forwarded to the music academy that same day, as requested.the director of the music academy asked the chief medical officer to prepare a fresh medical report taking account of the fact that no section of the music academy could be considered as not necessitating eyesight, and accordingly to specify whether or not the applicant was capable of being educated in the music academy.the relevant sections of the court’s reasoning read as follows: “... the principles governing entrance competitions and enrolments at the turkish national music academy attached to istanbul university were adopted by the university senate ... at the request of the section assembly, after having been debated in the music academy assembly and deemed lawful by the university’s educational board.... having regard to the relevant international agreements and legislative provisions, the course of action expected of the administration was not to force through amendments to a report drawn up by a hospital, thus impeding a blind citizen’s right to education ... in conclusion, the chief medical officer amended the form of the report, [but] its content remained the same, such that he cannot be accused of negligence.32.  by judgment of 19 february 2008, served on counsel for the applicant on 28 april 2008, the council of state dismissed the appeal on points of law and upheld the impugned decision, having found that the latter had fallen within the jurisdiction of the administrative court, had not been unlawful and had complied with the procedural rules.
(b)  forensic medical expert’s opinion 33.  on 14 march 2005 investigator b. ordered a forensic medical examination of the applicant, which was carried out by expert b. on 17 march 2005. the expert was requested to determine the degree of harm to the health of the applicant, who had allegedly been beaten up by police officers on 15 february 2005. the applicant complained of recurring headaches.(c)  decision of 17 march 2005 34.  on 17 march 2005 investigator b. ordered that by virtue of article 24 § 1 (2) of the code of criminal procedure (“ccrp”) no criminal proceedings were to be instituted in respect of the applicant’s complaint, in view of the absence of constituent elements of a crime under article 286 of the criminal code (abuse of power) in the acts of police officers sh.(e)  decision of 24 march 2005 42.  on 24 march 2005, on the basis of the results of the inquiry, investigator b. again refused to open a criminal case under article 24 § 1 (2) of the ccrp, on the grounds that the constituent elements of a crime in the acts of police officers sh., p., k., e. and four others were absent.as before, the investigator referred to a crime under article 286 of the criminal code (abuse of power), as well as article 301 of the criminal code (unlawful arrest or detention) in relation to sh., and article 302 of the criminal code (coercion to obtain statements) in relation to p., k. and e.. the investigator found that the applicant had been at the sovetskiy district police department from 11 a.m. until 3.20 p.m. on 15 february 2005 for an identity parade in a criminal case concerning assault and battery, and that at about 7 p.m. on the same day police officer e. had taken him to police station no.the investigator held that the results of the inquiry had showed that the applicant’s injuries were self-inflicted, as a result of his hitting the bookcase with his head, and that the allegations of ill-treatment by police officers were devoid of any foundation.
8.  on 23 july 2007, on the basis of the report of the investigative committee, the council of ministers decided to deprive the applicant of his cypriot nationality on public interest grounds, pursuant to section 113 of the census bureau law of 2002 (see relevant domestic law and practice at paragraph 37 below).the next day, at the applicant’s request, he was transferred to a private hospital and remained under police custody until his discharge from the hospital on 21 october 2010. after that he was detained at a police station in pera chorio nisou (nicosia district) and was transferred to the hospital on various occasions, where he remained in police custody.12.  on 30 september 2010, further to a complaint by the applicant’s wife to the commissioner for administration (the ombudsman), the ombudsman asked the minister of interior to suspend the applicant’s deportation because of his poor health and until she had completed an investigation.the eur 30,356 was broken down as follows: (i) eur 20,675 for the salaries of the police officers who guarded him when he was in hospital; eur 2,650 as expenses for his detention and maintenance at the police detention facilities for fifty-three days; and eur 5,831 representing 25% of administrative fees.the civil registry and migration department refused this application on 11 june 2012, stating that it considered the applicant a threat to public order for the same reasons for which he had been deprived of cypriot nationality and then deported on 29 january 2011. the applicant was asked to leave the country.
the relevant part of the ministry’s decision reads: “concerning the family reunification, based on which the request for the regularisation of the status of an alien in croatia has been submitted in the case at issue, [it is to be noted that] the case file shows that the appellant relies on the existence of a same-sex relationship with the croatian national d.b., which has allegedly lasted for two years ... the impugned decision shows that the [first-instance body], other than citing the [relevant] provisions of the aliens act, also cited section 3 of the family act, according to which the effects of an extramarital relationship, that is to say the rights and obligations following from its existence, relate to a union between an unmarried woman and man which has lasted for at least three years, or less if a child was born of [the union]; and section 2 of the same-sex union act ... which defines a same-sex union as a union between two persons of the same sex (partners) who are not married, or in an extramarital relationship or other same-sex union, which has lasted for at least three years and which is based on the principles of equality of partners, mutual respect and assistance as well as the emotional bonds of partners.it should also be taken into account that the provisions of the aliens act concerning temporary residence for family reunification do not provide for a possibility of regularisation of the status of an alien on the grounds of [the existence of] a same-sex union, nor does such a union fall within the scope of [the term] ‘immediate family member’ incorporated in that act, which makes it clear that there is no legal ground for granting the request of the appellant.therefore, the appellant wrongly considers that the first-instance body should have applied section 56 § 4 of the aliens act in her case ... because that provision clearly provides that exceptionally to the provision defining immediate family members, ‘other relative’ could be so considered if there are specific personal or serious humanitarian reasons for a family reunification in croatia.” 13.  on 24 july 2012 the applicant lodged an administrative action with the zagreb administrative court (upravni sud u zagrebu), arguing that she had been discriminated against in comparison to different-sex couples who had a possibility to seek family reunification under the aliens act.it therefore follows that the plaintiff cannot be considered an immediate family member within the meaning of section 56 § 1(1) and (2) of the [aliens] act and thus she did not justify the purpose (in the concrete case: family reunification) for which a temporary residence of an alien in croatia can be granted ... in view of the cited legal provisions, and the facts of the case, this court finds that in the concrete case it was not possible to grant the plaintiff’s request.” 15.  on 8 march 2013 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske), contending that she had been discriminated against on the basis of her sexual orientation.8.1.  in the proceedings before it, the constitutional court did not find facts or circumstances which would suggest that in the proceedings before [the lower bodies] the appellant was discriminated against on any ground ... thus her complaint of a violation of article 14 § 1 of the constitution, the constitutional court finds unfounded.
i request that this problem be examined at the meetings of the government and the state duma ...” “i am wiring you for the third time about the deaths of premature newborns in st petersburg ... [i] consider the existence of a waiting list for resuscitation treatment a crime ... waiting for [your] response about the action taken ...” 9.  the administration of the president of the russian federation forwarded the telegrams to the ministry of healthcare of the russian federation (“the ministry”) for examination.10.  the committee ordered an examination, which was carried out by a panel consisting of the chief neonatologist of the committee and the head of the paediatrics department at the advanced medical studies faculty of the st petersburg state paediatrics medical academy.the examination was carried out on the basis of the applicant’s and the twins’ medical records, which were obtained from the maternity hospital and the children’s hospital.12.  on 12 september 2003, in reply to her telegrams, the committee informed d. of the results of the experts’ examination of the twins’ medical records by briefly restating the conclusions in the report.13.  on the same day, the committee forwarded to the ministry a copy of its reply to d. and informed the ministry that, according to the conclusion of a commission formed by the maternity hospital where the twins had been born, the reasons for the applicant’s premature delivery had been her compromised obstetric‑gynaecological history – in particular, seven artificial abortions – and her urogenital mycoplasmosis infection.
moreover, a comprehensive assessment of the applicant’s personality revealed that, as a result of his condition and notably the sadistic tendencies which had manifested themselves in the offence of which he was found guilty, he could be expected to commit further unlawful acts and was therefore dangerous to the general public.moreover, the seriousness of the offence of which the applicant had been convicted in 1983, and the attack on a woman at a time when he had already been detained in the psychiatric hospital in 1990, had to be taken into consideration.17.  the regional court, having heard the applicant and having regard to the evidence before it, considered that the continuation of the applicant’s detention in a psychiatric hospital had to be ordered.in support of this view, it referred to the serious offence which had led to the applicant’s placement in a psychiatric hospital, to the fact that he had relapsed during the execution of his detention order and to the potential risk, as confirmed by the expert and the psychiatric hospital staff, that the applicant would reoffend if released.the applicant was transferred to the so-called “long-stay” department of the hospital in 2006, where he was detained during the time covered by the proceedings at issue and where he did not undergo any sex therapy.
the relevant parts of its judgment read as follows: “...the defendant [the applicant] was duly notified about the date and the place of the court hearing but has failed to appear before the court while the court has not accepted the power of the advocate who has appeared on her behalf as her representative, on the ground that the power of attorney was not duly certified.... taking into account that the ground [the mayor’s decision of 22 july 2005], based on which the lease agreement was concluded and the title registered, no longer exists, the court finds that ... the agreement on lease of land concluded between [the applicant] and the yerevan municipality should be terminated and her certificate of ownership/use [and] the right of lease of immovable property be annulled.” 17.  on 8 november 2006 the district court sent a copy of its judgment to the applicant by post.the relevant parts of this decision state the following: “the civil chamber of the court of cassation ... having examined the appeal on points of law against the decision of 1 november 2006 ...lodged by [the applicant’s] representative [g.] ... found that it should be returned for the following reasons: according to article 230 § 1 (4.1) of the code of civil procedure of the republic of armenia, an appeal on points of law should contain one of the grounds stated in article 231.2 § 1 of the code of civil procedure.... in view of the above reasoning ... the court of cassation decides to return the appeal on points of law against the decision of ... of 1 november 2006 lodged by [the applicant’s] representative [g.]...” 21.  on 19 january 2007 the court of appeal rejected the request to restore the missed time-limits for lodging an appeal and left the appeal against the judgment of 1 november 2006 unexamined stating the following: “having examined the appeal lodged by [g.], the representative of the defendant in the present case, and the request seeking to restore the missed time-limit, [the court of appeal] found out that on 28 november 2006 an appeal was lodged against the judgment ... of 1 november 2006 by ... [the applicant’s] representative g., who had failed to respect the fifteen-day time-limit prescribed by the law.in doing so, it stated, in particular, that: “the civil chamber of the court of cassation ... having examined the appeal on points of law lodged by [g.] against the decision of the civil court of appeal of 19 january 2007 to return [the applicant’s] appeal, found that it should be returned for the following reasons... the court of cassation finds that the admissibility criteria set out in article 231.2 § 1 of the code of civil procedure are absent in the appeal on points of law lodged in the present case.
8.  on 28 june 2003 the applicant was interviewed in sumy by an officer of the odessa regional police concerning the circumstances of his business trip to the odessa region from 10 to 18 june 2003. according to a written explanation signed by the applicant, he denied any involvement in the murder.according to the applicant, he was in fact questioned on 3 july 2003 and the record of his questioning was backdated to 30 june 2003. the applicant further maintained that the lawyer had left the interview in protest against the applicant’s poor state of health, but the lawyer’s signature was added to the record of the questioning afterwards.19.  in response to a request from the investigator i.g., on 23 october 2003 the itt informed him about the injuries observed on the applicant on 8 july 2003 and about the disagreement as to their full extent which had occurred on that day.the investigator relied on a certificate from the sizo, according to which at the time of the applicant’s admission to the sizo he had had no injuries, and on the itt records of 8 july 2003 describing the applicant’s injuries.the court of appeal questioned the investigator i.g., who stated that the injuries recorded at the itt could have been inflicted on the applicant in the course of arrest.
20.  the applicant appealed, arguing among others the following points of fact and law: the first-instance court ruled in breach of article 13 (b) of the hague convention, firstly in that they concluded that in the circumstances of the case there was a grave risk that the child’s return to the united kingdom would expose her to intolerable psychological harm and would place her in a disadvantageous situation, and secondly in that they wrongly assumed that the child would have to be separated from the mother even though the latter had not cited any objective obstacles to her returning to the united kingdom; the first-instance court ruled in breach of article 3 of the convention on the rights of the child and its general directive that the best interest of the child be protected; the facts as established by the domestic court contradicted the evidence produced in the course of the proceedings; the court’s conclusion that the child’s return would expose her to intolerable psychological harm contradicted the findings of the expert report; and the court should not have refused to adjourn the hearing at which the applicant was not represented by a lawyer....” 34.  the explanatory report on the 1980 hague child abduction convention, prepared by elisa pérez-vera and published by the hague conference on private international law (hcch) in 1982 ( “the pérez‑vera report”), provides the following comments on the notion of “the best interest of the child”: “... ‘the legal standard ‘the best interest of the child’ is that at first view of such vagueness that it seems to resemble more closely a sociological paradigm than a concrete juridical standard ... the general statement of the standard does not make it clear whether ‘the interest’ of the child to be served are those of the immediate aftermath of the decision, of the adolescence of the child, of young adulthood, maturity, senescence or old age’ ...” (§21, p. 431) “... [the philosophy of the convention] can be defined as follows: the struggle against the great increase on international child abductions must always be inspired by the desire to protect children and should be based upon an interpretation of their true interests...the right not to be removed or retained in the name of more or less arguable rights concerning its person is one of the most objective examples of what constitutes the interests of the child...’the presumption generally stated is that the true victim of the ‘childnapping’ is the child himself, who suffers from the sudden upsetting of his stability, the traumatic loss of contact with the parent who has been in charge of his upbringing, the uncertainty and frustration which come with the necessity to adapt to a strange language, unfamiliar cultural conditions and unknown teachers and relatives’ ...” (§24, pp.38.  the relevant provisions of the united nations convention on the rights of the child, signed in new york on 20 november 1989, read as follows: preamble “the states parties to the present convention, ... convinced that the family, as the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and particularly children, should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the community, recognizing that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding, ... have agreed as follows: ... article 3 1. in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration... article 7 1. the child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth... to know and be cared for by his or her parents... article 9 2. states parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child... article 18 1. states parties shall use their best efforts to ensure recognition of the principle that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child.... article 10 jurisdiction in cases of child abduction in case of wrongful removal or retention of the child, the courts of the member state where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention shall retain their jurisdiction until the child has acquired a habitual residence in another member state and: (a) each person, institution or other body having rights of custody has acquiesced in the removal or retention; or (b) the child has resided in that other member state for a period of at least one year after the person, institution or other body having rights of custody has had or should have had knowledge of the whereabouts of the child and the child is settled in his or her new environment and at least one of the following conditions is met: (i) within one year after the holder of rights of custody has had or should have had knowledge of the whereabouts of the child, no request for return has been lodged before the competent authorities of the member state where the child has been removed or is being retained; (ii) a request for return lodged by the holder of rights of custody has been withdrawn and no new request has been lodged within the time limit set in paragraph (i); (iii) a case before the court in the member state where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention has been closed pursuant to article 11(7); (iv) a judgment on custody that does not entail the return of the child has been issued by the courts of the member state where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention....” 40.  the european convention of 20 may 1980 on recognition and enforcement of decisions concerning custody of children and on restoration of custody of children (known as “luxembourg convention”) reads, in so far as relevant, as follows: “... article 1 for the purposes of this convention: a child means a person of any nationality, so long as he is under 16 years of age and has not the right to decide on his own place of residence under the law of his habitual residence, the law of his nationality or the internal law of the state addressed; ... d improper removal means the removal of a child across an international frontier in breach of a decision relating to his custody which has been given in a contracting state and which is enforceable in such a state; improper removal also includes: i the failure to return a child across an international frontier at the end of a period of the exercise of the right of access to this child or at the end of any other temporary stay in a territory other than that where the custody is exercised;

8.  on 13 and 21 november 2006 the applicant informed the vologda regional court that he did not wish to be represented by m. in view of the perfunctory nature of the services that she had provided.11.  according to the applicant, at the beginning of the hearing he asked the court to provide him with an opportunity to meet with ye.the court acknowledged that the applicant’s right to be provided with legal counsel had been infringed, quashed the appeal judgment of 18 april 2007, and remitted the matter for fresh consideration to the appeal court.according to the transcript of the appeal hearing, the applicant agreed that his defence would be carried out by lawyer m. he further asked the court for additional time in which to meet with m. to discuss his defence.the court adjourned the hearing in order to ensure that the applicant could meet with m. 22.  on 20 may 2011 the supreme court resumed the hearing.
21.  the government did not contend that they had informed the applicant that he had been free to leave; on the contrary, in their written submissions to the court they maintained that the applicant had remained at their disposal for questioning between 3 p.m. and 11.30 p.m. 22.  between 10 p.m. and 10.55 p.m. the applicant was informed of the charges against him and was heard by the investigators.by the same decision all the defendants were remanded in custody for twenty-four hours, the period of detention starting to run at 11.30 p.m. 26.  the next day, on 25 march 2009, at about 6.40 p.m., the nap asked the bucharest court of appeal to remand the applicant and the other two defendants in custody (the rector was released) for twenty-nine days, from 25 march 2009 until 22 april 2009.30.  an appeal on points of law lodged by the nap against this decision was dismissed by the high court of cassation and justice on 1 april 2009. the high court endorsed the decision of the bucharest court of appeal, noting that the applicant’s pre-trial detention appeared excessive, given that the applicant had no criminal record, had been of good standing in society, and there was no evidence in the file that he had evaded criminal proceedings.31.  by a decision delivered on 22 april 2009 the nap extended the prohibition on the applicant’s leaving the country for another thirty days, from 23 april to 22 may 2009. the reasons provided by the prosecutor for taking such a measure were that there was reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence, and that it was necessary to ensure the proper administration of justice.it concluded that although the imposition of a preventive measure should be justified by the necessity to ensure the proper administration of justice and to protect society by preventing the commission of new offences, in the instant case the nap had not managed to explain why allowing the applicant to leave the country could have negative repercussions on the administration of justice.
the court observed that the prosecutors’ decisions had been based only on statements by the two doctors and on the forensic report and held that the investigators in the case needed to clarify whether the patient’s state of health had required his admission to the gastroenterology unit and whether treatment in that unit could have influenced the course of the victim’s illness.the court also reasoned that, even if it could be accepted that rapid changes could occur in such conditions, it was hard to believe that the victim had had no previous symptoms and had not been under the supervision of medical professionals prior to 22 august 2005. in view of the above, the court further requested that the prosecutors take statements from the family doctor and gather evidence about the victim’s state of health prior to his admission to the sibiu county emergency hospital.27.  on 24 december 2010 the investigation resumed with a letter being sent to the sibiu police in which the prosecutor requested their assistance in obtaining a statement from the victim’s family doctor, as well as copies of any medical documents she might have concerning the victim’s state of health prior to his hospital admission on 21 august 2005. in january 2011 the family doctor, m.l.i., gave a statement to the police.30.  a complaint by the applicant against the prosecutors’ decisions of 25 july and 23 august 2011 was allowed by the timisoara district court on 21 december 2011. the court considered that all the facts had still not been clarified by the investigation and again ordered the reopening of criminal proceedings.45.  an appeal by the applicant against that judgment was allowed by the braşov court of appeal on 26 february 2008. the case was sent to the braşov county court for rehearing because the lower court had not examined any evidence other than the documents in the file, which had been the sole basis for its decision.
10.  x disputed the claim on the grounds, inter alia, that he was not the responsible editor of the show and that he enjoyed the freedom to communicate information as provided for under chapter 10, section 2 of the constitutional law and as clarified by the supreme court (högsta domstolen) in the case nja 2005 p. 884 (see paragraphs 32 and 33 below).as chapters 1-9 of the constitutional law were not applicable, x could not be held responsible for the programme content under chapter 6. the district court further held that the applicant’s claims under the penal code were to be determined following the main hearing in the case.x contested the arguments and submitted that it was the company viasat broadcasting uk ltd, whose seat was in the united kingdom, which was responsible for the programme service and decided on the final content of the programmes.it held that the issue for it to determine was whether the general provisions in the constitutional law were applicable to the programme in question, that is, whether or not the broadcasting of the programme could be considered to have originated from sweden within the meaning of chapter 1, section 6(2) of that law.it further stated that the burden of proof concerning the applicability of the constitutional law rested on the applicant and that he had not, in response to x’s refutation, established that the decisions concerning the programme content were taken in sweden.
he also complained about the fact that the first-instance court had not ruled on his claim for compensation, despite the fact that there had allegedly been enough material in the case file to enable it to rule on the matter.16.  on 28 august 2008 the supreme court, without having informed the parties of the date of the deliberation session, deliberated in private and upheld the request for the protection of legality, dismissing the applicant’s action as having been lodged out of time.17.  not being aware that the request for the protection of legality had already been decided, on 3 september 2008 the applicant’s representative requested the relevant documentation from the ljubljana district court.18.  on 5 september 2008 the ljubljana district court informed the applicant’s representative that the case-file documents had been with the supreme court since 30 june 2008. accordingly, on the same day the applicant’s representative requested from the supreme court the documentation regarding the request for the protection of legality.citing articles 14, 22 and 23 of the constitution, the applicant claimed that he had not been afforded equality before the law and that his right to judicial protection and his right to equal protection had been violated as he had not been given the opportunity to participate in the proceedings before the supreme court.
they complained that the two hectares of land assigned to them in 1995 had still not been provided, that they had been unable to receive any information from the vca about the ongoing land reform in the vilnius region, and that they had not been given the opportunity to participate in the planning of the reform, unlike other residents of the region.30.  on 30 may 2008 the supreme administrative court granted the applicant’s request and clarified its judgment of 5 may 2007. the court held that the vca was under the obligation to include the applicant on the list of candidates to be provided with land in the buivydiškės cadastral area by 30 june 2008 and to carry out the remaining administrative procedures necessary for the allocation of a specific plot of land of two hectares to the applicant within three months of the completion of the land allocation plan of the buivydiškės cadastral area.34.  in december 2008 the vca informed the applicant and her husband that the land allocation plan of the buivydiškės cadastral area was again being amended, and that the list of candidates to receive land in that territory would be compiled after the completion of the planning when the available land has been identified.however, on 20 november 2008 the supreme administrative court quashed the first-instance judgment and ordered the vca to provide the applicant and her husband with a satisfactory response to their request of june 2007. the court also noted that the applicant and her husband had repeatedly asked the vca for information about the implementation of the land reform and about the plot assigned to them, that they had petitioned several state institutions (see paragraphs 54-57 below), and that the lengthy non-enforcement of the supreme administrative court’s judgment of 5 may 2007, as well as the vca’s evasiveness concerning their requests, had caused them inconvenience and negative feelings.54.  in april 2006 the applicant and her husband submitted a complaint to the parliamentary ombudsperson, stating that they still had not been given the land assigned to them in 1995. in june 2007 the ombudsperson concluded that the complaint was well-founded, and recommended the ministry of agriculture provide assistance to the vca in enforcing the decision of the buivydiškės district council of 16 march 1995.
having accepted that the applicant’s illness was included in the list, and describing his condition as “stable [but] serious”, the court, nevertheless, found that the drugs necessary for his treatment were available in the prison tuberculosis hospital, and that the applicant was undergoing the necessary medical procedures.19.  on 16 october 2014 the court decided to indicate to the russian government, under rule 39, that it was desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicant be immediately examined by medical experts, including an oncologist, independent from the prison system with a view to determining: (1) whether the treatment he was receiving in detention was adequate for his condition; (2) whether his current state of health was compatible with detention in the conditions of a correctional colony or prison hospital; and (3) whether his current condition required his placement in a specialised hospital or release.-  certificates issued by the acting head of the prison tuberculosis hospital, indicating that the applicant had not been provided with chemotherapy for his lymphoma as he had not consented to that treatment when it had been offered to him, in march and june 2014. according to the acting head of the hospital, the applicant had refused to make a written statement to that effect.-  copies of the applicant’s complaints to various russian officials, including the chelyabinsk regional ombudsman, the prosecutor general’s office, the regional department for the execution of sentences and the acting head of the prison tuberculosis hospital, about the poor quality of his medical care in detention.22.  in their response to the second question about the compatibility of the applicant’s state of health with the conditions of the correctional colony and prison hospital, the government emphasised that the applicant’s hospital employed the necessary specialists, and had the necessary equipment and drugs to treat him.
5.  on 27 august 2008 the police arrested the applicant in the street on suspicion of being drunk.6.  further to a complaint by the applicant, on 8 december 2008 the pervomayskiy district court of izhevsk quashed the police decision, finding that the charge had not been supported by evidence.noting that the claim arising out of administrative detention fell outside the exhaustive list of examples of strict liability under article 1100 of the civil code, the court held that the lawful actions of the police officers could not give rise to liability in tort.it acknowledged that the applicant must have suffered frustration and anxiety as a result of his detention, but determined that his suffering had been “of no legal consequence”.9.  on 3 march 2010 the supreme court of the udmurtiya republic upheld the district court’s decision on appeal.
according to the subsequent submissions of the applicant and the detectives to the domestic authorities, the applicant attempted to flee; in order to stop him from fleeing the detectives tripped him up, he fell on the asphalt pavement and was then handcuffed.13.  on the same day the forensic medical expert, g. (referred to as mr h. by the government), issued a report stating that the applicant had the following injuries: a bruise on his forehead and, overlapping it, four long, deep, vertical parallel scratches; bruises on the bridge of his nose, his chin, wrists and neck; nine small bruises on the fingers of his right hand; and swelling of the back of his right hand.in reaching its finding that it had been the applicant who had stabbed n., the court referred to the testimony of his co-defendants, noting that it was consistent with p.’s testimony to the extent that all three had testified, contrary to the applicant, that it was v.s., and not the applicant, who had attacked p. the court also referred to the dna expert evidence which had found blood, possibly originating from n., on the trousers worn by the applicant on the night of the murder and seized by the police at the house where the applicant had left them.the lrpo indicated that the chervonograd prosecutor’s office should undertake a number of additional measures to establish the circumstances of the incident, most notably: (i) interview ms z. whom the applicant had been going to meet when he had been arrested; (ii) identify the ambulance staff who had visited the applicant on 6 december 2008 and interview them; (iii) interview the forensic medical expert to find out whether the injuries observed by the expert on the applicant on 6 december 2008 were consistent with the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment.42.  on 20 june 2013 the pustomyty district court quashed the decision of 18 may 2012. the court found numerous omissions in the pre-investigation inquiry, in particular that the authorities had failed to explore under what circumstances an ambulance had been called for the applicant while he had been in the itt; they had also failed to examine the records from the facilities where the applicant had been detained.
1.  proceedings before the munich district court and the munich i regional court challenging the lawfulness of the search warrant and the house search 10.  the applicant, represented by counsel, lodged a complaint against the search warrant before the criminal courts arguing that the warrant, and consequently the search, had been unlawful and had infringed his constitutional right to respect for his home under article 13 of the german constitution (“the basic law”; see paragraph 22, below).3.  first set of proceedings before the federal constitutional court challenging the admissibility of evidence found during the house search 16.  considering that it was legally unclear whether or not the court of appeal’s findings regarding the admissibility of the evidence found during the house search were binding on the lower courts, the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the federal constitutional court.furthermore, the regional court was of the view that the court of appeal’s findings in its judgment of 5 september 2006 (see paragraph 15 above) on the admissibility of the hashish as the sole evidence were binding and that hence the hashish found in the applicant’s flat could be used as evidence against him.it took the view that, considering the seriousness of the crime of drug possession and the substantial amount of hashish found, the public interest in prosecution outweighed the applicant’s interest in respect for his home because the applicant’s rights had not been deliberately infringed, the house search had not been arbitrary and the amount of hashish found would theoretically have justified a house search.7. second stage of the proceedings before the federal constitutional court challenging the admissibility of the evidence obtained during the house search 20.  the applicant lodged a fresh constitutional complaint, arguing that the admission of the evidence infringed his right to respect for his home under article 13 of the basic law and his right to a fair trial under article 2 § 1 read in conjunction with article 20 § 3 of the basic law (see paragraph 23 below).
6.  on 26 august 2003 the applicant published an article under the title “an inhabitant of verneşti is wanted by police across the country, having been accused of breaking into the headquarters of the local branch of the social democratic party” (“the psd”).in a case where there is information that the person has left the country, an international arrest warrant is issued, and the arrest of the fugitive is only a matter of time.” 7.  following the publication of the article, the father of s.a. sent a letter to the newspaper, which read as follows: “to the editor of monitorul de suceava, the undersigned a.d. found out from your newspaper that there was a national and local search order for my son, a.s., for the offence of aggravated theft.12.  on 19 november 2003 the court acquitted the applicant of the charge of defamation; however it ordered the applicant to pay, jointly with the newspaper, the sum of rol 10,000,000 to s.a. the relevant excerpts from the judgment read as follows: “taking into account the fact that the applicant obtained information concerning the suspect from the judicial office within the general police inspectorate, he cannot be found to have deliberately (mens rea) defamed the plaintiff ... under the civil limb of the action, defamation concerns public communication of a distorted, negative image of a person, which is likely to cause him or her personal suffering and damage to reputation, leading to changes such as social embarrassment and injury to self-esteem.the first-instance court considers that publishing the article in the newspaper caused damage to the standing of the civil party ... moreover, it must be noted that although the civil party’s father notified the newspaper that the facts published about his son were false, the newspaper did not publish a retraction of the article written by the defendant.” 13.  by a final judgment of 23 january 2004 the suceava county court rejected an appeal by the applicant and upheld the first-instance court’s judgment.the court stated in its reasoning the following: “even though there is no mens rea as far as the offence of defamation provided for in article 206 of the criminal code is concerned, given the source of information at the date of the publishing of the article, the defendant’s obligation to pay compensation to the civil party cannot be set aside.
9.  on 18 january 2006 the said court ordered the enforcement of the judgment and awarded the applicants the costs incurred in the enforcement proceedings.16.  on 27 november 2013 the constitutional court held that the applicants had suffered a breach of the “right to a trial within a reasonable time” with regard to the enforcement proceedings.the court, however, did not award them compensation for non-pecuniary damage, finding that only the period after the applicants had continued the enforcement proceedings following the death of their relatives (on 9 july 2013 and 15 may 2013, respectively) could be taken into account.17.  on 27 november 2013 the constitutional court held that the applicants had suffered a breach of the “right to a trial within a reasonable time” with regard to the enforcement proceedings.the court ordered the acceleration of the proceedings and declared that the applicants were entitled to compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered in the amount of eur 800 each, converted into the national currency at the rate applicable at the date of settlement.
5.  the applicant was born in 1941 and lives in murmansk.6.  the applicant sued the local office of the pension fund, claiming that her monthly pension had been miscalculated.7.  on 12 september 2003 the pervomayskiy district court of murmansk granted her claim and ordered that the pension due to the applicant be recalculated and increased.8.  on 11 august 2005 the pervomayskiy district court of murmansk quashed the judgment of 12 september 2003 and reopened the proceedings after an application by the respondent authority on the grounds that new circumstances had come to light.9.  on 23 august 2005 the same court rejected the applicant’s pension recalculation claim.
in particular, he proposed to him to act as an intermediary between z. and t. and tell t. that the price was eur 2,300. the difference of eur 800 between the price asked by z. and the sum paid by t. was to be split between the applicant and e. this information was not contested by the prosecution during the proceedings.he then transmitted the money and the documents to z. the identity card was later produced in the united kingdom and reached z. and then the applicant by the middle of april 2008. on 16 april 2008 the applicant met with t. and gave him the identity card in exchange for the rest of the money.15.  on 17 december 2008 the balti district court found the applicant guilty of participating in the production of a false romanian identity card and of selling it to t. the court sentenced him to a criminal fine of some eur 200. the judgment did not make any mention of the applicant’s assertion concerning incitement.16.  the applicant lodged an appeal in which he submitted inter alia that the first instance court had not paid attention to the fact that the offence had been committed as a result of police incitement and that the court had refused to hear the persons who had entrapped him.the court examined the applicant’s argument concerning entrapment and dismissed it on the sole ground that it was the applicant who had first telephoned the number indicated in the newspaper advertisement.
8.  on 25 december 2008 the applicant was transferred to the liu of‑73/3 medical facility (лечебно-исправительное учреждение) in the kurgan region and was detained in the following wards: (a)  quarantine ward 24 from 25 to 30 december 2008 and from 18 to 30 june 2009; (b)  ward 25 from 30 december 2008 to 28 may 2009 and from 30 june to 21 september 2009; and (c)  ward 26 from 21 september to 3 november 2009.11.  in support of their submissions, the government provided original floor plans and ward population registers containing information about the exact number of inmates in each ward for the whole period the applicant was in the liu of-73/3 facility.the calculation table annexed to the order specified that a fee of 320 russian roubles (approximately 9 euros) per day per person would be payable, covering maintenance charges, prison staff salaries, the depreciation of visiting room equipment, bed linen and cleaning products.13.  on 14 april 2009 the director of the federal service for the execution of sentences sent a letter to the heads of russian penal facilities, reminding them that charging visitors and detainees for family visits was in breach of article 89 of the code on the execution of sentences (see paragraph 17 below) and that facility administrations must bear the costs of providing rooms for long-term visits.16.  on 29 april 2010 the applicant received a letter from the court dated 19 march 2010 in the correspondence department of the of-73/2 correctional facility, to which he had been transferred in february 2010. it was handed over to him in an open envelope and he was told to sign a copy which had been attached to his personal file.
7.  on 5 september 2008 the criminal investigation into the circumstances of the case was completed and the case was referred to a trial court for determination.the offences of which the applicant was found guilty concerned negligence, abuse of power and aiding and abetting in the commission of an offence.a detention warrant was issued every month and the reasons given for prolonging his detention were the same throughout the entire period: the applicant had been accused of a serious criminal offence punishable by more than two years’ imprisonment and there was a risk he might abscond or hinder the investigation.between his arrest and 17 november 2008 he was detained in solitary confinement at the detention facility of the centre for fighting economic crime and corruption (cfecc) and between 17 november 2008 and 21 june 2010 he was held in prison no.the applicant was hospitalised between 7 october and 17 november 2008 in a prison hospital belonging to the ministry of justice but he refused treatment, asking instead to be treated in a military hospital accredited by the ministry of healthcare.
according to the applicant, when he saw their possessions, including food brought to them by their relatives, medication and documents, scattered on the floor and in total disorder, he declared that he would return to the cell only after a prosecutor or a representative of the prison administration had made a report on the search and the disorder caused.), who had been taking his daily exercise during the search, confirmed seeing upon his return great disorder in the cell, with all the food and personal items broken up and thrown to the ground, and the detainees cleaning up the mess and complaining about being hit during the search.during the event, lasting for six minutes and thirty-six seconds and registered on a compact disk, showed the detainees leaving their cell voluntarily; the presence in the cell of masked men; the applicant’s request to be allowed to take his belongings with him and the refusal of that request; it showed various objects in the cell and the presence in it of detainee v.z.the next scene showed the applicant sitting on the ground and asking for a prosecutor to be called, affirming that he would not move until the prosecutor saw what had happened to the food and belongings in the cell and a report was made about the event.29.  the prosecutor found that the video recording did not prove that violence had been used, and that the sound of the cell door being struck, heard at the end of the recording, allowed the supposition that the injury to the applicant’s foot could have been self-inflicted.
7.  on 8 november 2004 the judge issued a decision (auto) ordering the initiation of oral proceedings (apertura de juicio oral) and set the complete file to the asturias audiencia provincial.the asturias audiencia provincial refused the applicants’ request to reduce the sentence in view of the undue delay of proceedings, as prescribed in article 21 of the criminal code.the asturias audiencia provincial acknowledged that the proceedings had been “unusually” long, but this was due to the complexity of the case, namely the difficulties in gathering evidences within different jurisdictions, the great number of parties involved, the difficulty faced when trying to notify some of the defendants, as well as the applicants’ conduct, whose lawyers had lacked celerity in presenting their submissions.the supreme court considered that even though the proceedings might have appeared excessively long, the asturias audiencia provincial had provided a sounded and detailed justification for the duration of the proceedings.12.  by two decisions of 20 may 2011 and 12 september 2011, respectively (served on 25 may 2011 and 23 september 2011), the constitutional court declared both appeals inadmissible on the grounds that they lacked the constitutional relevance provided for in article 50 § 1 b) of the organic law on the constitutional court.

by a judgment of 3 september 2010, the zamoskvoretskiy district court of moscow granted a stay of enforcement of the migration service decision and ordered it to reconsider the matter in the light of the constitutional court’s decision of 12 may 2006 and the convention principles.in a letter of 5 may 2011 addressed to the deputy director of the visas and registration department of the federal migration service, the director of the legal department acknowledged that the decision of 4 june 2008 had not taken fully into account mr khalupa’s family ties in russia.the district court declared that it would not take any humanitarian considerations into account because ms ostrovskaya had missed the three-month time-limit for submitting her claim, and she had a receipt of notification as early as 16 february 2012. the undesirability decision had been issued by the federal consumer protection authority rather than by its samara division; since ms ostrovskaya had designated the latter, but not the former, as the defendant in her claim, the courts refused to review what they described as an “actually non-existent decision”.it found in particular: “the facts which, in the claimant’s view, are of legal significance but which the appeal court failed to take into account, including ... his voluntary compliance with the obligation to inform his former partners about a possible hiv infection, his being in a steady sexual relationship ... cannot be established on the basis of the claimant’s and his representative’s statements alone.a threat to public health ... could result from the fact that the claimant has a registered place of residence and actually lives in a hostel, which is a public place; this fact alone put the health of the other residents of the dormitory at risk because the claimant may use the same public facilities ...” 46.  on 1 april 2014 a judge of the supreme court refused him leave to appeal to the supreme court.
the labour expert (arbeidsdeskundige) mr g. has stated that he discussed this extensively with gillissen, who could agree to that position and who indicated during the conversation that in the coming years more growth was to be expected and that it was his intention to make his own living in self-employment with a corresponding gradual reduction to zero (afbouw) of the wao benefits.” 10.  on 28 january 2004 uwv gave a decision reducing the applicant’s wao benefits with retroactive effect.it found that the applicant could reasonably have been aware that the total of his additional income – the sum of his salary and the profits of the limited liability company – was too high for him to be entitled to the full amount of his social-security benefits.its reasoning included the following: “the agreement relied on by the [applicant], which is denied by uwv, does not appear from the case file and no other credible case for its existence has been made out by the [applicant].” 18.  in response to a question by the court, the applicant acknowledged that he had made no attempt to summon mr g. and mr s. himself or bring them along to the hearing of either the regional court or the central appeals tribunal, as permitted by section 8:60(4) of the general administrative law act (algemene wet bestuursrecht; see paragraph 25 below).prompted by the transformation of the one-man business into one or more limited liability companies the suspect sought confirmation from uwv that it would not matter for the arrangements made whether the provider of the income was the one-man business or the said limited liability companies.in view of the facts outlined above, the court of appeal considers it plausible (aannemelijk) that the suspect made arrangements with mr g. of uszo in one form or another concerning the amount of permitted additional income within the framework of the gradual reduction to zero of his wao benefits.
from the statements of the perpetrators and the two sisters, the prosecutor held as proved the fact that the applicant had gone to the neighbours’ house scantily dressed and had had a sexual relationship with j.v.be convicted of rape and that the amount of compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage be increased to rol 50,000. the applicant’s representative submitted that the decision of the first instance court had not been impartial since it had been based only on the statement of the accused, together with statements by the other perpetrators and two witnesses – all related to the accused.26.  the hunedoara county court decided to allow the applicant’s appeal, holding that: “according to the provisions of article 197 of the criminal code, the crime of rape is ‘sexual intercourse of any kind with a person ... taking advantage of the [person’s] lack of capacity to defend herself or to express her will [original emphasis]...’.based on these testimonies and the fact that the victim had not told her parents about the alleged abuse, the court drew the conclusion that the instances of sexual intercourse had always been initiated by the applicant and dismissed the theory that the victim might have lacked capacity to express her will.... “the presumption of lack of capacity applies only to minors who are under fourteen and have committed a crime, but with respect to the crime provided by article 198 of the criminal code, the minor [the applicant] is the victim and not the perpetrator.”
6.  on various dates the supervisory review courts quashed the judgments delivered in the applicants’ favour after applications by the defendant authorities, considering that the lower courts had misapplied substantive or procedural law (for more details see the appendix).8.  on an unspecified date the applicant lodged an application with the sovetskiy district court, claiming 3,973,578 russian roubles (rub) in compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage on the grounds of wrongful prosecution.9.  on 24 may 1999 the sovetskiy district court allowed the applicant’s claim in part, awarding him rub 43,568 in compensation for unpaid salary, the confiscation of his car, and judicial costs and expenses.11.  on 27 july 2006 the leninskiy district court granted the applicant’s claim in full and awarded him rub 761,815 in compensation for unpaid salary; the confiscation of his car and other property; rent for his flat; travel expenses; and judicial costs and expenses.12.  on 1 february 2007 the presidium of the rostov regional court quashed that judgment by way of supervisory review on the grounds that the same issue had already been decided by the judgment of 24 may 1999 and that there had been no grounds to examine the complaint a second time.
21.  moses lj concluded that the decision of the judge to hear both applications at the same time had placed the applicant in an impossible position, noting that there was no hint at any stage in the transcript of the proceedings of anyone advising the applicant of his rights in respect of the committal proceedings, nor of the judge reminding himself of the different burden and standard of proof in the two applications.there are, of course, many cases in the books in which this court has upheld committal orders even although they have been made in proceedings which were procedurally flawed ... provided the contemnor has had a fair trial and the order has been made on valid grounds, the existence of a defect in the committal application or in the order served will not result in it being set aside except in so far as the interests of justice require that to be done ... 36. the instant case, however, is plainly not in that category, and i am in complete agreement with moses lj that the defects in the process in the instant case are so serious that the interests of justice plainly require both the committal order and the consequential sentence of imprisonment to be set aside.” 25.  specifically on the question of access to legal advice, he added: “52.28.  blake j noted at the outset that the court of appeal had identified three main errors in the applicant’s case: the failure to inquire into why he was not represented and to consider whether to adjourn the committal proceedings to enable him to obtain representation; the joinder of the committal proceedings and the contact order application, which undermined the burden of proof and the applicant’s right not to give evidence in the committal proceedings; and the fact that he was not given the opportunity to mitigate before sentence was passed.again i reject this reworking of the submission for similar reasons to those already given, but more particularly for the principles spelt out in the trio of community charge cases.” 32.  blake j concluded that the applicant’s detention pursuant to the order of judge collins was not so gross or obvious an irregularity, within the meaning of § 115 of the court’s judgment in lloyd and others, cited above, as to be not in accordance with the law.in reaching this conclusion, he noted, inter alia, that the county court was a court of competent jurisdiction; that proper notice of the hearing and of the committal application had been given; that the record of proceedings did not appear to reveal any application by the applicant for an adjournment to seek legal representation; that there was no failure to follow a statutory prerequisite because the general requirement to observe article 6 imposed by the human rights act 1998 was not the same as a precise rule prohibiting committal unless a condition was complied with; that, similarly, the practice direction (see paragraph 41 below), which set out the need to observe the human rights act, was in general terms and did not amount to a condition precedent; that the court of appeal, at the time of the county court’s decision, had not made an unambiguous finding that a lack of representation at a committal hearing would always violate article 6, although its finding in the present case meant that article 6 might be considered a condition precedent in future cases; and that there was no hint of malice or bad faith by the judge.
in the section of the isolation notices entitled “doctor’s conclusion” the note “practically healthy” appeared, followed by the signature of doctor s. the sections of the isolation notices which were to include the signature of the chief of the disciplinary isolation cell and his notes regarding the time and date of the applicants’ admission to and release from the disciplinary isolation cell were left blank.20.  later that day at an unspecified hour the applicants were taken to the stepanakert military police department of nagorno karabakh where from 10.35 p.m. to 00.10 a.m. the second applicant was questioned as a witness by investigator a.h. the interview was videotaped by the cameraman of the media department of the nagorno karabakh defence army, a.g. 21.  the applicants were kept at the stepanakert military police department until 23 april 2004. on that date the military prosecutor of armenia issued a letter addressed to the defence minister of nagorno karabakh, with a copy to the chief of military police of armenia, the chief of the stepanakert military police department and the commander of military unit no.64.  on 26 july 2004 the deputy ombudsman was informed by the general prosecutor’s office that the accused had been kept at the military police arrest facility on the basis of annex 14 to the regulations for the garrison and sentry services and had been transferred to nubarashen pre‑trial detention facility following the entry into force of the amendments to those regulations adopted by the parliament on 28 april 2004 and ratified by the president on 22 may 2004.the court of cassation found that the investigating authority had failed to take all the necessary measures for an objective evaluation of the circumstances of the case and had failed to verify duly the statements of the defence concerning the applicants’ innocence and the existence of exonerating evidence, as well as their allegations of a violation of lawfulness in the course of the proceedings.124.  as regards the question of the applicants’ deprivation of liberty and their allegations of ill-treatment, the court of cassation stated: “it follows from the materials of the case that [the applicants] were detained on 24 april 2004. it was indicated in the appeals on points of law that for five days in a row [the applicants], having the status of a witness, had been subjected to violence, torture and inhuman treatment, as a result of which a confession statement was extorted from [the second applicant].
the third parties lodged a counter-action requesting the annulment of the commission decision of 11 may 1995. on 27 september 2001 the supreme court finally amended the commission decision in respect of the applicant’s share of property, which corresponded to a plot measuring 930 sq.m. since the plot of land was occupied, the supreme court decided that the applicant would be compensated in one of the ways provided by law.12.  on 11 april 2011 the fier district court granted the applicant’s and other heirs’ leave to appeal out of time against the commission decision of 11 may 1995 in respect of the remaining plot of land measuring 47,014 sq.m. since the plot of land was occupied, the applicants would be compensated in one of the ways provided by law.m. since the plot of land was occupied, the applicants would be compensated in one of the ways provided by law.
9.  on 30 october 2001 the chervonodzerzhynskiy district court (“the district court”) granted the prosecutor’s request to put the applicant, a former police officer, on remand as a suspect in the criminal proceedings concerning the robbery on the kharkiv-dnipropetrovsk-simferopol road.19.  on 7 march 2002 the kharkiv regional court of appeal, having heard the investigator and the prosecutor, and referring to “the applicant’s personality”, albeit without assessing it, the seriousness of the charges against him, and the need for additional time to conduct the necessary investigative measures, extended the applicant’s detention to six months.in the part of the judgment which concerns the murder charges, the court referred, in particular, to the “testimonies given by the applicant as a suspect and an accused, including in the presence of a lawyer”.in particular, as far as the applicant was concerned, apart from the evidence which had been found inadmissible on 17 december 2003, the court further excluded from the body of evidence some of the testimonies given by the applicant on 8 and 9 january 2002. it held that, even though the applicant had allegedly confessed to murdering five people shortly after his arrest, he had nevertheless been questioned as a witness, in the absence of a lawyer.37.  the applicant appealed in cassation against the judgment of 6 october 2005. he stated in particular that there had been insufficient evidence to prove his guilt; he had been ill-treated by the police; on a number of occasions during the pre-trial investigation he had been questioned in the absence of a lawyer and that evidence obtained in violation of his rights of defence had nevertheless been used to secure his conviction.
6.  at about 6 a.m. on 11 july 2007 several police officers visited the applicant’s home with a summons for him to report to the police station in the neighbouring town of pomorie “as a witness” in relation to an investigation.the detention order stated that he was being detained on the basis of section 63(1)(1) “in connection with an offence under article 195 of the criminal code”, which refers to theft.the order stated that a theft had been committed by an unknown person in a hotel in pomorie and instructed the police to take the appropriate measures to search for the perpetrator.it found, in particular, that for the lawful application of section 63(1)(1) of the miaa it was not necessary that the police should hold evidence showing “in an unqualified manner” that the detainee had committed an offence; data “justifying a suspicion that there was a probability that the person had committed an offence” was sufficient.the domestic court noted further that the police had operational freedom as to the application of section 63(1)(1) of the miaa.
the court justified the decision as follows: “taking into account the gravity of the criminal offences of which the applicant is accused and the possibility of him disrupting the normal course of the investigation by unlawfully influencing people involved in the proceedings or absconding from the investigation if he remains at liberty, the court considers that the preventive measure of remanding him in custody must be applied in his case.” 18.  on 4 august 2014 the prosecutor general’s office made a public statement which noted that the applicant had been charged under articles 192.2.2, 213.1 and 308.2 of the criminal code because there was a suspicion that he had committed the criminal offences set out in the above‑mentioned articles.33.  all of those statements, addressed “to whom it might concern”, provided details of the relevant grants and donations awarded to the applicant or human rights club, noted that the applicant had regularly provided the relevant donor with necessary accounting information concerning the expenditure of the funds, and specified that the donor organisations and embassies had every confidence that the funds had been used properly for the relevant projects and initiatives for which they had been awarded.36. in january 2012 yeni azerbaijan, the official newspaper of the ruling party, ran a piece entitled “new target of national traitors: eurovision 2012”, which attacked the sing for democracy campaign coordinated by the applicant as a campaign against the interests of the country and stated the following: “the blackmail and slander campaign of the alliance to protect political freedoms, institute for peace and democracy, institute for reporters’ freedom and safety, and human rights club is based on ugly intentions which are evident from the names of these organisations.the remote control of those who would do anything for money, who easily betray their country and state by launching a black smear campaign in exchange for foreign donations (donations obviously granted for meeting certain interests) is in the hands of those who give the money.” 37.  around the time of the applicant’s arrest and thereafter, the same newspaper and online news portals affiliated with the authorities published a number of pejorative articles calling the applicant an “american agent”, with headlines such as “american agent rasul jafarov detained for three months”, “the rights of rasul jafarov, another agent, limited”, and “search of the flat of american agent rasul jafarov”.these people, some of whom are traitors and some weak-minded, will finally answer before the law.” 39.  on 15 august 2014 a.h., the head of the department of social and political issues of the presidential administration, stated the following in an interview with trend news agency: “the most deplorable thing is that such ngos and individuals and some journalists, relying on foreign circles funding them, placed themselves above the national law, evaded registering their grant projects, filing financial statements, paying taxes and the government’s other legal requirements.” 40.  in an interview published on 2 september 2014 y.m., a member of parliament from the ruling party, who was also the director of the institute of history at the academy of sciences, stated the following in respect of the recently arrested ngo activists and human rights defenders: “people who betray their motherland cannot be forgiven.
the ministry ordered the plovdiv regional health inspectorate to carry out an inquiry and, based on its findings, on 23 january 2004 informed the applicant that in view of the inconclusive results of the medical imaging tests, the operating team had chosen to make a wide opening in the thorax, enabling them to inspect the left side of the thoracic wall from the fourth to the ninth ribs.21.  the report drawn up by the three experts described the different methods for detecting bone metastases, including bone scintigraphy, emphasising that their results had to be assessed cumulatively; said that when operating on cancer patients it was mandatory to inspect adjoining organs by palpation; described the extent, in their view limited, to which the removal of parts of the fourth and fifth left ribs had affected the applicant’s body movements; said that rib fractures were almost inevitable and very frequent in thoracotomies; said that the main principle when operating on cancer patients was that all decisions were to be made by the entire team; and opined that it would be possible to operate on the applicant again, should the need arise.26.  in his report the new expert, a thoracic surgeon from sofia, said that the operating team had not breached good medical practice by removing parts of the applicant’s fourth and fifth left ribs based on their visual and tactile inspection in the course of the operation, bearing in mind that histological testing of bone tissue required time and therefore no histological conclusion could be obtained during the operation; that they had correctly inspected the applicant’s lungs by palpation; that rib fractures in the course of such operations were almost inevitable; that the removal of the rib fragments had not unduly affected the applicant because they had later partly regenerated; and that it could not be categorically said that the applicant had a metastasis in her sixth rib, especially bearing in mind that no further metastases had been detected for many years after the operation.31.  the thoracic surgeon’s supplementary report said that the applicant had correctly been subjected to surgery; that the operating team had not erred by acting on the basis of the visual and tactile findings made in the course of the operation, especially bearing in mind the uncertain results of the prior medical imaging tests; that there was no universally reliable method to establish the presence of bone metastases; that it had been impossible to mark the precise spot of the suspected metastasis before the operation; and that dr k.m.39.  the report said that it had been imperative to carry out the operation; that the fracture of the sixth rib had been there before the operation and had been due to the rib’s heightened fragility resulting from previous anti-cancer treatment; that the removal of parts of the fourth and fifth ribs had not been an error in view of the inconclusive prior medical imaging data, which had its limitations, and the visual observation of tissue that could at the time have been suspected to be cancerous; that there was no categorical medical data proving the presence of a metastasis in the sixth rib before or after the operation – the bone scintigraphies had only showed an increased uptake of radioactive tracer there – in spite of the medical treatment undergone by the applicant after the operation; that the applicant could be operated upon again, should the need arise; and that the applicant’s medical condition would have been much worse had she indeed had an untreated metastasis in her sixth, eighth or ninth rib for years after the operation.
10.  when the applicant arrived at the colony the resident doctor noted that he had a first-degree disability: he was totally blind as a result of mature cataracts in both eyes.15.  in september 2014 the inmate who had been assisting the applicant was released from detention and the applicant was left to fend for himself.18.  relying on the conclusion of the medical commission, the applicant lodged an application with the kochubeevskoe district court, stavropol region, for release on health grounds.21 of the supreme court of russia dated 20 december 2011 (see paragraph 26 below), the court noted that the fact that the applicant’s illness was included in the list provided for by government decree no.the court cited the gravity of the crimes committed by the applicant and the length of the prison term he had yet to serve.
: “who is the best portuguese female tv host?” the possible answers to the question included the name of three female television hosts and the applicant’s; the latter being the “correct” one.the [assistente] is a public figure and so must be used to having his characteristics captured by comedians in order to promote humour; it being public knowledge that [the applicant’s characteristics] reflect behaviour that is attributed to the female gender, such as his way of expressing himself, his colourful [feminine] clothes, and the fact that he has always lived in a world of women (see, for example, the programmes he has always presented on television).in its decision, the court cited the above quotation from the investigating judge’s decision of 24 june 2011 and further stated: “it should not be considered offensive to one’s honour anything that the complainant considers as such, but what in the opinion of the majority of reasonable people should be considered an offence to the social and individual values of respect (judgment of the coimbra court of appeal of 16 march 1993).... and as the impugned decision noted, having balanced in a very sensible way the conflict of interests at hand and the context in which it unfolded: ‘it should be taken into account that we have before us a comedy show, and that the moment at which the defendant asked her guest a question, referring to [assistente] manuel luís goucha as ‘one of the best female portuguese hosts’, was considered to be one of the many jokes said throughout the show, typical of such shows.the [assistente] is a public figure and so must be used to having his characteristics captured by comedians in order to promote humour; it being public knowledge that [the applicant’s characteristics] reflect behaviour that is attributed to the female gender, such as his way of expressing himself, his colourful [feminine] clothes, and the fact that he has always lived in a world of women (see, for example, the programmes he has always presented on television).
13.  according to the applicant, in 2005 and in 2006 he complained to the prison doctor about various health problems, including stomach pain, but his complaints remained unnoticed by the authorities.this time the doctors prescribed him medication for his myopia and neurological symptoms resulting from the trauma in 1999. the medical records did not contain any information on the actual intake of drugs by the applicant.22.  the next recurrence of the applicant’s ulcer occurred in autumn 2010. according to the medical records, the applicant did not receive any drugs at that time.the resident doctor prescribed drug treatment in december 2010 and january and march 2011. however, the medical records contain no information concerning the actual provision of the prescribed drugs to the applicant.33.  after the applicant’s return to the prison his treatment continued in line with the recommendations of the prison hospital doctors.
the third applicant is the second applicant’s wife, who was born in 1973 and lives in sopron.8.  according to the act, tobacco retail was to become a state monopoly (exercised through a state-owned company, nd nemzeti dohánykereskedelmi nonprofit zrt), and tobacco retailers would become authorised through a concession tender, advertised on 15 december 2012. the time-limit for applying was 22 february 2013.), which contained the detailed rules for the operations of the future concession-holders, was published on 8 june 2013, that is, after the completion of the tendering process, the results of which had become public on 22 april 2013. the decision about the tenders was taken by nd zrt itself.since, however, it was not entitled to apply for a concession under the new law, the second applicant applied personally for one, on several occasions.13.  the applicants submitted that others in comparable situations – and in the case of those who had never been doing tobacco retail beforehand, in non-comparable situations – were granted concessions, which difference in treatment cannot be explained by any circumstance other than political adherence.
18.  in december 2010, the applicant’s wife, anticipating his discharge from the hospital, complained to the head of the regional department of the federal service for execution of sentences in st petersburg and leningrad region and to the investigative committee of the leningrad region that the applicant’s medical treatment had been inadequate and about his impending transfer from the hospital to a temporary detention facility.33.  on 1 july 2011 the applicant was examined by dr f., who observed that the authorities had failed to give him necessary drugs and that the applicant’s relatives had had to step in and supply the prescribed medication.34.  the applicant’s wife complained to the representative of the russian president in the north-west federal circuit of the applicant’s poor treatment in detention.on 26 july 2011 the ombudsman recommended that the applicant’s wife complain before the courts, apply for the applicant’s early release on medical grounds, or complain to the administration of the detention facility.40.  on 26 april 2012 in the course of the criminal proceedings against the applicant, the trial court ordered his expert examination with a view to updating the information about his state of health, particularly in the light of the results of his coronary angiography examination.
during the proceedings it was established that the taxpayer joško guberina had owned a flat measuring 114,49 square metres, in zagreb ..., which he had sold on 25 november 2008 to ... given that the surface of that real property, and in view of the number of the taxpayer’s immediate family members (five), satisfied the housing needs of the taxpayer and his immediate family, within the meaning of section 11(9.3) of the real property transfer tax act, and given that it satisfied all housing needs in terms of hygiene and technical requirements as well as the basic infrastructure (electricity, water and [access to] other public utilities), under section 11(9.5) of the real property transfer tax act, the taxpayer does not meet the cumulative conditions provided under section 11(9) of the real property transfer tax act.in this connection, one of the conditions laid down under indent 9.5 is that the citizen and the members of his or her immediate family must not have another real property (flat or house) meeting their housing needs; and indent 9.6 also provides that the citizen and the members of his or her immediate family must not own a flat, a holiday house, or property of a significant value (other property of a significant value can include a piece of land where construction is allowed) or a business premises where the citizen or his or her immediate family members do not exercise a registered [business] activity, whereby the value of the real property is similar to that of the real property (flat or house) which the citizen is purchasing.given the rationale of the cited provisions and the facts of the case as established beyond doubt during the proceedings, [the ministry] considers that the first-instance authority was justified in rejecting the appellant’s request for tax exemption ... the right to tax exemption exists if the citizen, or his or her immediate family members, at the time of purchase [of the real property], do not own, or did not own, another real property meeting their housing needs or a flat, a holiday house or other real property of a significant value.as this is not the situation in the present case, given that the appellant, at the time of purchase [of the house], owned a flat in zagreb ... larger than the real property he was buying and in respect of which he sought tax exemption, it cannot be said that by buying the house the appellant was purchasing his first real property in order to meet his housing needs.” 15.  on 7 september 2009 the applicant lodged an administrative action with the high administrative court (visoki upravni sud republike hrvatske), arguing that in their decisions the lower bodies had ignored his specific family situation and, in particular, his child’s disability and therefore the housing needs of his family.the relevant part of the judgment reads: “given that the surface area of the flat [which the applicant owned] satisfied the needs of five members of the plaintiff’s family (provision 9.3) and that the flat at issue was equipped with the basic infrastructure and hygiene and technical requirements, the defendant correctly concluded that the plaintiff, in the given case, did not meet the conditions for a tax exemption set out in section 11(9) of the real property transfer tax act.
had acted correctly by hospitalising the patient and by giving her the treatment he did; (b) if the treatment with duvadilan was appropriate for the patient’s condition and if the treatment had influenced the deterioration of her condition; (c) what were the possible causes of the patient’s death occurring soon afterwards; (d) what would have been the patient’s chances of survival, given her diagnosis, if the surgery had been performed as soon as her condition had deteriorated.it concluded that the actions of the suceava hospital’s staff could be explained from a medical standpoint, in the context of the patient’s anamnesis and given that according to the information available and on the basis of the patient’s symptoms they could have also concluded that the patient’s condition had been caused by mushroom poisoning, and not by hellp syndrome as turned out to be the case.consequently, the court ordered a forensic expert report to be produced which would establish whether: (a) the doctor had been diligent enough to correctly establish the diagnosis; (b) the actual diagnosis had been established on the basis of the symptoms and the investigations made in the case; (c) the correct diagnosis could have been established on the basis of supplementary tests and examinations which should have been performed; (d) the medical treatment had been appropriate; (e) the medical intervention should have been performed at the suceava county hospital; (f) the applicant’s daughter’s health had deteriorated during her transfer to the clinic in iaşi because she was not assisted by a doctor throughout the transportation; (g) any of the aspects above, or others, had any causal link with the death of the applicant’s daughter and her new born granddaughter.54.  on 1 february 2011, the superior prosecutor attached to the suceava prosecutor’s office dismissed the applicant’s challenge and upheld the order of 21 december 2010. it held amongst other things that the proceedings had not been abandoned by the authorities, since they had finished the investigation on 4 may 2004. the length of proceedings had been affected by the forensic expert reports, the last one being produced on 23 april 2004.also, it could not be accepted that the running of the statutory limit had been stopped or suspended, either by the request for a medical expert report to be produced or by the judgment of 20 november 2009. the judgment of a court quashing an order of the prosecutor’s office to discontinue a criminal investigation was not one of the lawfully permissible reasons to suspend the running of the statutory limit.
7. subsequently, the applicant realised that the lump sum paid by the insurance company did not cover all her damages, believing that the calculation method applied by the insurance company was mistaken.consequently, on 7 august 2003 the applicant initiated a civil lawsuit against the insurance company requesting the court to declare the agreement invalid and to oblige the insurance company to pay compensation for damages.8.  the budapest regional court delivered a partial judgment on 18 april 2006 in which dismissed the applicant’s claim on the alleged invalidity of the parties’ agreement.on appeal, the budapest court of appeal upheld the partial judgment on 21 february 2007. the applicant challenged the partial judgment before the supreme court which upheld it on 17 october 2007.on appeal, the budapest court of appeal reversed the judgment and dismissed the applicant’s claim on 23 april 2008. the applicant challenged the judgment before the supreme court but to no avail.
counsel commented that the applicant had not read the certificate from the congregation’s pastor before the interview as it had not been translated and that the applicant intended to submit the formal baptism certificate.after the questioning in 2007 and until the elections in 2009, he had been able to continue working with the web pages that contained the critical material, even though, according to the applicant, already at that time the authorities had been aware of his activities.21.  as to the applicant’s conversion to christianity, the migration board noted that the conversion and baptism had not taken place in the church of sweden and that the applicant had not handed in any proof of his baptism.furthermore, the applicant had stated that the material he had had in his possession when he was questioned in 2007 had not differed from the material he had in 2009. these circumstances, together with the fact that he had not been summoned again to appear before the revolutionary court after november 2009 and that his family had not been targeted, made the migration court doubt that his political activities had been of such a nature and extent as to have resulted in the consequences alleged.the migration board found it noteworthy that the applicant now raised the question of conversion, when he had been given the chance to elaborate on it during the oral hearing before the migration court but had declined to do so.
the prosecutor asked the court to accept the request and to place [the applicant] in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders, taking into account that the documents presented by [the applicant’s] guardian did not confirm that [the applicant] had been at a doctor’s surgery on 27 december 2004 at 1 p.m. or that he had been unable to commit the criminal offence, particularly taking into account the [applicant’s] personality and the fact that he had already committed a number of offences.having heard the parties to the proceedings and having examined the materials submitted by them, the court considers that the request must be allowed for the following reasons: [the applicant] is registered in the database of [the juvenile department of the police]; he was previously placed in the [temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders] for behaviour correction but did not draw the proper conclusions and committed further delinquent acts; the preventive measures put in place by the [juveniles] inspectorate and by the guardian have not produced results, which shows that [the applicant] has not learnt his lesson.having taken these circumstances into account, the court finds unsubstantiated and far-fetched the explanations by the applicant’s guardian that [the applicant] did not commit the offences on 27 december 2004 and 3 january 2005. having regard to the above-mentioned facts and ruling under section 22(2)(4) of the minors act, the court grants the request of the head of the police department and decides to place the applicant in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for thirty days.” 28.  on 21 february 2005 the applicant was placed in the novosibirsk temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders, where he remained until 23 march 2005.he reiterated his complaints to the prosecution authorities in a letter dated 30 november 2005. while the prosecutor’s office of the sovetskiy district of novosibirsk sent a reply to the applicant’s grandfather on 9 november 2005 and the prosecutor’s office of the novosibirsk region sent a reply on 16 december 2005, both of these dealt exclusively with the procedural issues related to the applicant’s case (see paragraph 24 above) and did not contain any answer to the grandfather’s complaints in so far as they related to the applicant’s health and the conditions of detention.50.  on 22 march 2006 the applicant’s grandfather lodged an application for supervisory review of the decision of 11 april 2005. he complained that as a result of the discontinuation of the proceedings the applicant had been deprived of an opportunity to prove his innocence in respect of the offence for which he had already unlawfully served a term of detention in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders.
19.  on 21 december 2012 the chief doctor of the maternity hospital wrote to the governor of the kharkiv sizo, in reply to an enquiry by the latter, to say that during her stay in the maternity hospital the first applicant had been guarded by sizo officers at all times, that the officers in question had not been on the delivery ward, and that the first applicant had not been handcuffed or shackled during the delivery.53.  as submitted by the first applicant and noted in a letter by the chief doctor of the children’s hospital to the first applicant’s lawyer dated 6 september 2012, a paediatrician from that hospital had examined the second applicant on 28 may 2012. the baby was found to be in good health but to have phimosis (a condition of the penis where the foreskin cannot be fully retracted).73.  on 14 march 2013 the judge of the dzerzhynskyy court, who had been in charge of the first applicant’s case, wrote to the agent of the government, in reply to the latter’s request, to say that the first applicant had indeed been held in a metal cage in the courtroom during hearings.78.  on 2 january 2013 the first applicant complained to the kharkiv zhovtnevyy district prosecutor’s office (“the zhovtnevyy prosecutor’s office”) that she had not been provided with adequate medical care during her pregnancy and the delivery; that she had been shackled by her wrists and feet to a gynaecological examination chair or her bed in the maternity hospital at all times, including during the delivery; that the conditions of her detention in the kharkiv sizo had been poor; and that neither she nor her baby had received adequate medical care there.79.  on 18 january 2013 the zhovtnevyy prosecutor’s office ordered a forensic medical examination of the case material with a view to establishing: (i) whether the first applicant had any injuries and, if so, how they had been caused; (ii) whether there was any forensic medical evidence that the first applicant had been handcuffed or shackled between 26 january and 15 november 2012; (iii) whether there was any forensic medical evidence that the applicants had not been provided with adequate or sufficient medical care in the kharkiv sizo; (iv) whether there was any forensic medical evidence that the applicants had not been provided with adequate or sufficient medical care in the maternity hospital; and (v) if the applicants had not received adequate or sufficient medical care, whether this had had any negative impact on their health.
20.  on 14 april 2005 the applicant’s wife applied to the ministry of the interior claiming that notwithstanding her previous letters expressing her wish for the applicant to leave the country their relations had improved and she wished to maintain her family and not to separate the applicant from their children.in the decision, the minister relied on the letter of 27 may 2005 informing him that the circumstances on the basis of which the applicant had been included in the blacklist had not changed.on 14 february 2005 the applicant was informed of the decision and of the fact that he was to leave the country by 26 march 2005. the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with the office of citizenship and migration affairs.references were also made to the court’s case-law on immigration control, to article 8 of the convention under which the interference with the applicant’s family life could be justified, and to the 2004 report of the committee on the elimination of discrimination against women (cedaw) concerning latvia.on the basis of information received from the state police and the security police and section 64, paragraph 1, part 1 of the immigration law the minister decided to remove the applicant from the blacklist.
further, the court takes into consideration the fact that, at the time of the arrest, [the applicant] did not reside in moscow, did not reside at his registered address and, according to him, was staying at his friend’s place in the moscow region; and that he had applied for two years’ leave of absence from his studies at university.regard being had to the circumstances described above, the court concludes that, if at large, [the applicant] may abscond or otherwise interfere with the administration of justice by, inter alia, putting pressure on [witnesses].” 7.  on an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of 10 march 2009. he argued that the district court had failed to justify its decision to remand him in custody and had not considered the possibility of using a less restrictive preventive measure in his case.furthermore, it can be seen from the documents submitted to the court that there is a risk that [the applicant] might engage in unlawful acts as defined in the above-mentioned provision of the law, regard being had to the nature and seriousness of the offence with which he is charged, to the circumstances of the case and of his arrest, and to his character ... accordingly, the court concludes that the circumstances justifying the [applicant’s] remand in custody have not changed.regard being had to the foregoing, the court discerns no grounds on which to change the preventive measure imposed earlier on the defendants and apply a less restrictive measure, including the [applicant’s] release upon a statement of guarantee signed by a surety.” 12.  on 24 june 2009 the applicant asked the district court for release.... the birth of his child has no effect to the contrary and cannot justify the decision to replace [pre-trial detention] with a less restrictive measure, including the [applicant’s] release upon a statement of guarantee signed by a surety.” 13.  on 22 july 2009 the city court upheld the decision of 29 may 2009 on appeal.
he does, on the other hand, submit, under an interpretation of articles 293 and 32 of the criminal code in the light of the principles inferred from article 10 echr by the european court of human rights, that having received that information in good faith without obtaining it unlawfully, he had the duty as a professional journalist, under article 32 of the criminal code, to publish it owing to what he sees as the obvious interest of the so-called ‘lausanne bridge’ case to the general public in french-speaking switzerland.in its stoll v. switzerland judgment of 10 december 2007, the european court of human rights confirmed that this formal conception of secrecy was not contrary to article 10 echr inasmuch as it did not prevent the federal court from determining whether the interference in issue was compatible with article 10 echr, by assessing, in the context of its examination of article 293, paragraph 3, of the criminal code, the justification for classifying a given piece of information as secret, on the one hand, and weighing up the interests at stake, on the other (see stoll v. switzerland, cited above, §§ 138 and 139).while the european court of human rights reiterates that neither it, nor the domestic courts for that matter, should substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists, in weighing up the interests at stake it nevertheless takes account of the content, vocabulary and format of the publication, and of the headings and sub-headings (whether chosen by the journalist or the editors), and the accuracy of the information (see stoll v. switzerland, cited above, §§ 146 et seq., especially 146, 147 and 149).however, the mere possibility that the secrecy of criminal investigations might be lifted during a subsequent phase of proceedings, particularly during the trial, which is generally subject to the publicity principle, does not undermine the justification for keeping judicial investigations confidential, because the primary aim is to protect the opinion-forming and decision-making processes on the part not only of the trial court but also of the investigating authority, until the completion of this secret phase of proceedings.that being the case, it is unclear, in view of the nature of the offence charged (the least serious in the classification set out in the swiss criminal code), the amount of the fine and the time of its imposition, how the sanction imposed on the applicant could be regarded as a form of censorship.
before the chomutovo county court, the czech republic, on 9 june 2009 without the parties’ consent because there were sound reasons for doing so, namely that the victim gave her evidence more than four years ago and this court considers that, owing to the passage of time, it would not learn any new facts or circumstances relevant for assessing the circumstances of the event [at issue], and was also mindful of the fact that the [charges against the accused] will become time-barred in july 2011 and ... summoning the victim would protract the criminal proceedings unnecessarily.the relevant part of the appeal judgment reads as follows: “in the reasoning of its judgment, the [first-instance] court stated the reasons why it had decided ... to read out the statement of the witness-victim e.r., stating that the victim had given her evidence more than four years previously, at which time her recollection of the event [at issue] would have been fresher than later, that the prosecution would become time-barred in july 2011 and since [the victim] was a foreign citizen ... summoning her [to a hearing] would protract the criminal proceedings unnecessarily.... this decision of the first-instance court did not violate the defence rights of the accused ... ... ... it should also be said that the mobile telephone could not have been found in the accused’s possession because nobody looked for it.the documents in the case-file show that the accused’s home was not searched, which was a mistake on the part of the police.however, even without it, the [first-instance] court undoubtedly established that the accused had stolen the mobile telephone from the victim ...” ... ” 14.  on 13 may 2011 the applicant lodged a complaint before the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske), arguing that he had not had a fair trial as he had not been given an opportunity to question e.r.
24.  a letter dated 14 february 2012 issued by the care home to the district court again confirmed that the first applicant regularly visited the second applicant at the children’s home, that he bought clothes for her and that he discussed with the management of the care home the steps he could take on his own to ensure the girl received a good upbringing, financial support, health care and an education.he argued that the transfer could be performed gradually, to enable the girl to get used to the changes in her life, while the competent social care agencies could assist the first applicant in exercising his parental authority and monitor the family and, in particular, the second applicant’s life and upbringing.the court also referred to the report of 8 february 2012 regarding the first applicant’s living conditions and noted, more specifically, that the first applicant had carried out repairs at the flat allocated to him, had equipped a room for a child, and had registered the second applicant at the address.it noted, with reference to the reports by staff members of the children’s home (see paragraph 18 above) and similar statements by the representatives of the children’s home made at the hearing (see paragraph 26 above) that at present the girl felt anxious in the presence of her parents and had difficulties in communicating with them.as for the children’s home’s reference to the girl’s anxiety in her parents’ presence, the first applicant argued that the reports to that end by its staff (see paragraph 18 above) were out of date and could not serve as a basis for the court’s finding, as at the hearing before the first-instance court the children’s home representatives had confirmed that the second applicant was no longer afraid of her parents or of being placed in the first applicant’s care (see paragraph 26 above).
7.  the judge established that the applicant was the webmaster of an internet forum on which defamatory messages against the complainants in the proceedings had been published, and that he had deliberately disregarded the request made to him by a police officer within the framework of the criminal investigation not to alter the messages in question.it was also alleged that he had protected the individuals who had made the defamatory statements; however, the judge considered that he could not be found guilty of concealment as it had not been proved that he had been aware at the time of his police interview that it had been possible for him to have access to the internet protocol (ip) numbers of the participants on the forum.in finding the applicant guilty, the appellate court stated that it had relied on the facts established by the first-instance judge and on the testimony given by the complainants, the applicant and the witnesses in the earlier trial.... it is undisputed that documentary evidence does not require judicial immediacy for its assessment because it is written down and can be read and interpreted in the light of the circumstances of the case, which had been perfectly outlined in the complainants’ brief and proved in the hearing, both with respect to what was written on the forum and the people against whom those expressions were directed.firstly, because it was part of his duties as the administrator of the forum to be aware of what was written on it, to the extent that he was its ‘censor’, so to speak, on account of the fact that he had created it; and secondly, because it is untrue that he was unaware of what was written on it, since he had removed some phrases and messages which were insulting to the complainants, thus proving that he had read what was written on the forum in question and demonstrating that he had regarded what was written there as insulting to a specific individual or individuals, which led him to the decision to remove what he regarded as defamatory or insulting.” 10.  the applicant applied to the audiencia provincial to have the previous proceedings before it declared void.
as a result of the lack of specialised medical assistance the applicant’s state of health worsened to such an extent that he could no longer control the process of urination, wetting himself as a result and thus having to endure additional humiliation.13 of medical personnel who specialised in treating his kind of illness, as well as the lack of equipment required to treat him, and the worsening of his health resulting in severe pain and in his inability to control the urination process, causing him to wet himself.19.  the court refers to the findings made by the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as cited in its previous case-law concerning the republic of moldova (see, for instance, shishanov v. the republic of moldova, no.in this connection, the minister of justice submitted information concerning the expenditure on prisoners’ food in 2010. the cost amounted to mdl 24,500,000, whereas the budgetary need for the same year was, according to the ministry of finance’s draft budget, mdl 29,500,000. the daily cost of feeding a detainee in 2010 was mdl 10.24 [approximately eur 0.6], while the daily budgetary need was mdl 12.35. this statistic was often cited by prison authorities to justify why they were unable to provide detainees with meat and fish ...” 21.  in its report for 2011 (page 71 et seq., “conditions of detention”) the human rights centre found, inter alia, that during 2011 it had addressed a total of seventeen recommendations to the authorities after making 238 visits to various prisons in moldova.... the moldovan minister of justice confirmed that the conditions in prisons are akin to those in medieval times, noting that the conditions in prisons constitute a systemic problem.” the report noted the continuing problem of insufficient access to daylight in the cells, in which the windows are covered with layers of metal bars, the lack of ventilation, increased humidity in the cells, very worn-out bed linen, the separation of the toilet from the rest of the cell by a cellophane sheet, or the lack of any type of separation.
7.  on 29 july 2004 the krestetskiy federal court of the novgorod region authorised the applicant’s pre-trial detention noting as follows: “having heard the parties to the proceedings and examined the materials, [the court] has established that there is reasonable suspicion that [the applicant] has committed the crime.9.  on 27 september 2004 the novgorod town court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention until 8 november 2004 noting as follows: “regard being had to the [applicant’s] character and the seriousness of the charges against him, the court considers that it is not possible to lift or replace the earlier imposed preventive measure because [the applicant] may interfere with the establishment of the truth or abscond.” 10.  on 4 november 2004 the town court extended the applicant’s detention until 8 january 2005. it reiterated verbatim its earlier reasoning.12.  on 30 december 2004 the town court extended the applicant’s pre‑trial detention until 28 january 2005. the court noted as follows: “regard being had to the seriousness of the charges, the [applicant’s] character and the negative references, the court does not discern grounds to change the earlier imposed preventive measure or to release [the applicant].” 13.  on 25 january 2005 the novgorod regional court upheld the decision of 30 december 2004 on appeal noting that, in view of the seriousness of the charges, the applicant might interfere with the establishment of the truth, abscond or re-offend.the court decided to consider the matter in the applicant’s absence noting that the applicant had attended the hearing on 20 july 2005 and had been provided with an opportunity to be heard.the [applicant’s] release into his mother’s care ... would not ensure his due behavior pending trial.” 17.  on 17 october 2005 the regional court extended the applicant’s and two other defendants’ detention until 27 january 2006. the court noted: “the defendants are charged with particularly serious offences; the circumstances of their remand in custody have not changed.
46.  the purpose of the investigation was to advise the cps of any criminal offence that might have been committed; to provide it with the evidence necessary to come to a decision about any prosecution; to enable the “responsible authorities” of the officers concerned (the mps and metropolitan police authority, or “mpa”) to consider what disciplinary or other action they might need to take; to inform the secretary of state for the home department of the circumstances of mr de menezes’ death; and to assist the coroner in relation to any inquest.47.  in particular, the investigation by the ipcc was to examine: a)  the information that led to the surveillance of the apartments at scotia road; b)  the command structure of the operation, including details of the numbers and types of specialist officers deployed and the tactics available to them; c)  the qualification and training of those involved and their suitability to carry out their role; d)  details of the briefing given to the officers involved and any description or photograph of any suspect made available; e)  whether or not the operation was designated as a “kratos” operation (the national strategy for dealing with suspected suicide bombers which permitted the use of lethal force if absolutely necessary) and the policy, operational tactics and authority levels of “kratos”; f)  the details of the mobile surveillance operation from scotia road to stockwell underground station; g)  the details of police action once mr de menezes had reached stockwell underground station; h)  whether or not the policy and operational authorities of “kratos” were followed and were effective; and i)  whether “kratos” was compliant with article 2 of the convention.20.50 while two minutes is a very short time period, the delay in [so19] getting to the scene and the failure to get a positive identification had enabled a person, believed to be a possible suspect for attempting to detonate a bomb on the underground system the day before, to get on the same bus twice and enter an underground station.” 56.  thirdly, the report was critical of the delay in handing the investigation to the ipcc: “17.22 the pressures under which the metropolitan police were operating following the events of 7 july and 21 july are self-evident.the prosecution argued that the ocpm was guilty of the following: a)  commander mcdowall’s strategy had not been communicated adequately to the officers who took over the running of the operations on 22 july 2005, the surveillance officers or the sfos; b)  commander mcdowall’s strategy for controlling the premises was not adequately planned for or carried out; c)  the control room officers, the sfos and the surveillance officers had a confused and inconsistent understanding of the strategy for scotia road; d)  officers had not been deployed to stop and question persons emerging from the scotia road premises, including mr de menezes; e)  the sfos were not in attendance at scotia road when mr de menezes emerged from the common doorway; f)  there was no contingency plan for dealing with persons who emerged from the apartment building before the firearms officers arrived; g)  persons emerging from scotia road had not been stopped and questioned; h)  a safe and appropriate area where those leaving scotia road could be stopped and questioned had not been identified; i)  the briefings given to the sfos were inaccurate, unbalanced, and provided the sfos with inadequate and inaccurate information about the operation, including the operation at scotia road; j)  the information concerning the identification of mr de menezes, his clothing, demeanour and likely level of threat, was not properly or accurately assessed or disseminated to officers and, in particular, to the sfos; k)  doubts about the correctness of the identification of mr de menezes as the suspect were not communicated to the control room; l)  the control room officers failed to satisfy themselves that a positive identification of mr de menezes as the suspect had been made by the surveillance officers; m)  the sfos had not been deployed at relevant locations in time to prevent mr de menezes from getting on the bus and entering stockwell underground station; n)  the sfos failed to satisfy themselves that a positive identification of mr de menezes as the suspect had been made by the surveillance officers; o)  effective steps were not taken to stop underground trains or buses so as to minimise the risk to the travelling public; p)  mr de menezes was permitted to get on a bus twice and to enter stockwell underground station despite being suspected of being a suicide bomber and despite having emerged from an address linked to a suspected suicide bomber; q)  a clear and timely order that mr de menezes be stopped or arrested before he entered stockwell underground station had not been given; r)  accurate information had not been given to the dso about the location of the sfos when she was deciding whether the sfos or officers from the anti-terrorist branch should stop mr de menezes; and s)  the risk inherent in effecting the arrest of mr de menezes by armed officers had not been minimised, whether in relation to the location, timing or manner of his arrest.in answering the questions left to them the jury found as follows: a)  that charlie 12 did not shout “armed police”; b)  that while mr de menezes did stand up before being grabbed in a bear hug by one of the surveillance officers, he did not move towards the sfos; c)  that the general difficulty in identifying the man under surveillance in the time available and the innocent behaviour of mr de menezes (which may have increased suspicion) were not contributory factors to his death; d)  that the following were contributory factors to his death: the failure to obtain and provide to surveillance officers better photographic images of the failed bomber hussain osman; the fact that the views of the surveillance officers regarding the identification of the suspect were not accurately communicated to the command team and the sfos; the failure by police to ensure that mr de menezes was stopped before he reached public transport; the fact that the position of the cars containing the sfos was not accurately known by the command team as the sfo teams were approaching stockwell underground station; the shortcomings in the communications system between various police teams on the ground; and a failure to conclude at the time that surveillance officers could have been used to carry out the stop on mr menezes at stockwell underground station; and e)  it was not clear whether the pressure on police after the suicide attacks in july 2005 was a contributory factor to mr de menezes’ death.
7.  according to the document (uzziņa) prepared by the supreme court on 27 july 2012 and addressed to the government, on 10 march 2005 an operational measure – the interception of the second applicant’s telephone conversations – had been authorised until 12 may 2005. the document was based on “the supreme court’s register of special proceedings (lietvedība) relating to classified state secrets for the year 2005, volume 13, entry no 2‑1264s of 19 march 2005”.10.  on 13 and 14 april 2005 three meetings took place between the second applicant and j. during the second meeting, which was video and audio recorded by j., the second applicant offered j. a bribe in the amount of 50,000 latvian lati (lvl) and monthly payments of lvl 1,000 in return for the cessation of any investigative activities concerning his business and the state officials connected with it.15.  in a letter of 31 may 2005 the knab informed the supervising prosecutor at the prosecutor general’s office that the second applicant’s phone had been tapped in accordance with section 17(3) of the law on operational activities “upon the authorisation of a judge of the supreme court”.18.  on 12 july 2005, having studied the material in the criminal case file, the representative of the first applicant asked the prosecutor to disclose a document attesting to the lawfulness of the interception of the telephone conversations between both applicants.the second applicant submitted, inter alia, that the appellate court had not assessed the lawfulness of the phone tapping and had ignored the fact that the criminal case had contained no reference to any authorisation to carry out the above activity as prescribed by article 176¹ of the code of criminal procedure.
17.  on 24 february 2009 the local branch of the state real estate registry addressed a letter to the mayor’s office stating, in reply to an inquiry by the mayor dated 17 february 2009, that the registration of the applicant’s ownership and lease rights had been performed on 9 april 2002 on the basis of the judgment of the shengavit district court of yerevan of 8 june 2001. this letter was received by the mayor’s office on 18 march 2009 and attached to it was a copy of the judgment of 8 june 2001.the deputy prosecutor general requested the court of appeal to restore the expired time-limit for appeal, arguing that the yerevan mayor’s office had not been aware of the judgment of 8 june 2001 and therefore had been deprived of the possibility of lodging an appeal, while the prosecutor’s office had been informed about that judgment by the mayor’s letter of 24 february 2009.the mayor’s office further claimed that it had become aware of the contested judgment by a letter from the local branch of the state real estate registry dated 24 february 2009, which had been received by the mayor’s office on 18 march 2009. it finally added that the letter of the judicial department of armenia of 6 february 2009 had been accompanied by a copy of another judgment of the shengavit district court, dated 26 june 2001, which was unrelated to the present case.hence, the mayor’s office had been aware of the registration of his property rights on the basis of the court judgment of 8 june 2001 and of the direct sale of the plot of land, and had not – as it claimed – become aware of that judgment from a letter of 24 february 2009.21.  on 12 june 2009 the civil court of appeal decided, with reference to article 207 § 5 of the code of civil procedure (ccp), to admit the appeals, stating: “the yerevan mayor’s office and the general prosecutor have missed the time‑limit for appeal prescribed by law and they submitted motions seeking to find this to be valid, arguing that the mayor’s office found out about the judgment [of 8 june 2001] from a copy of the judgment attached to the letter of the judicial department of armenia of 6 february 2009, while the general prosecutor’s office from the letter of the yerevan mayor’s office of 24 february 2009.
was massaging [the girls] in the sauna, he did not touch [their] intimate body parts, [he] touched [their] bodies only with the bath brush, [he] did not touch [them] with [his] hands.” 28.  the second applicant had told the other girls that the above‑mentioned practice was not normal.29.  from the documents furnished to the court it appears that the applicants gave the police the names of the other girls who had attended the sauna, a.f., a.b.the third applicant had gone to a separate bed to sleep and o.b., while drunk, had entered the room and had pulled at the children’s legs, including those of the third applicant.the psychologist noted her statements to the police of 14 january and 1 april 2010. concerning the sauna sessions, the third applicant had not found it normal that the sauna needed to be attended naked.massaging naked girls with a besom had been unethical and in contravention of general moral principles, as had been the suggestion to a girl under the age of eighteen to sleep with the coach in the same bed.
it held that claimants in proceedings under section 1(1) of the 1988 act bore the burden of making out all elements of the tort, including the existence of damage, and that the only evidence that could be used to prove non-pecuniary damage in the form of mental suffering was medical expert evidence, not witness evidence.the police detention log showed that mr petkov had been brought to the police station at 3.10 a.m. on 20 december 2007, whereas the three witness statements submitted by the police in the judicial review proceedings in support of their contention that mr petkov was suspected of an offence spoke of a robbery of a petrol station committed at 4.50 a.m. this showed that, at the time of mr petkov’s arrest, the police did not have a reasonable suspicion of him committing an offence.), the supreme administrative court declared the appeal inadmissible, finding that the time-limit for the police to lodge an appeal had expired as early as 25 march 2008. the court did not mention mr petkov’s claim in respect of the costs incurred in the appeal proceedings.the evidence of mr dzhabarov and the other person with whom mr petkov had been detained, who had been called by mr petkov to testify, and the expert evidence on the lawfulness of those conditions adduced in the course of the proceedings, gave information about the material conditions in the detention facility but not about mr petkov’s state of mind or subjective perceptions.it held that claimants in proceedings under section 1 of the 1988 act bore the burden of proving all elements of the tort, including the existence of damage, and that the only evidence that could be used to prove non-pecuniary damage in the form of mental suffering was medical expert evidence, not witness evidence.
27.  mobile telephone cell site evidence was led by the prosecution with the intention of showing that the applicant’s mobile telephone was in the vicinity of the murder at the relevant time, although it was switched off between 7.28 p.m. and 7.50 p.m. cell site evidence also demonstrated that the applicant and his co-accused were in the vicinity of the road where the vectra was found between 8.01 p.m. and 8.17 p.m. 28.  residents of the streets near the shooting gave evidence.29.  cctv footage from a petrol station showed the applicant arriving in the white ava van, wearing a baseball cap and making telephone calls to an associate at 1.47 a.m. the number dialled by the applicant was in the vicinity of the cell site covering the road where the vectra was found and the inference sought by the prosecution was that the applicant was in discussions about the destruction of the car.33.  on mr pearman’s telephone calls, the trial judge directed the jury as follows: “it is for you to decide what weight, if any, you attach to this evidence; but it does have certain limitations which i must draw to your attention: (a) you had not had the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses in the witness box and sometimes when you do see and hear a witness you get a much clearer idea of whether his evidence is honest and accurate; (b) their evidence has not been tested under cross‑examination and you have not had the opportunity of seeing how their evidence survived this form of challenge; (c) in the case of pearman these were self-serving statements, that is he was saying he was not involved in the murder of jon bartlett.in addition calls made by high risk category a prisoners, such as pearman, from prison would be known by him to be recorded and he was speaking in those calls to members of his own family.” 34.  on mr pearman’s previous convictions, the trial judge directed the jury: “you have heard this evidence because it may help you to resolve two issues in the case, namely: (a) whether the convictions show that on 31st may 2006 he had a tendency to be a drug dealer, carry a firearm and commit murder, and whether this makes it more likely that he was the gunman in this case; and (b) whether he was being truthful and reliable in denying his involvement in the present case in his telephone calls to his son and wife.(xi) the cell phone evidence showed seton to be in the vicinity of the murder when it was committed; the timing of his last telephone connection with bartlett, just before the murder, and the switching off of his telephone at the time of the murder, and his call to a telephone in the vicinity of the location where the vectra was set on fire, all powerfully supported his guilt.
the court went on to state that, as evidenced by the heirs certificate issued in 1994 and presented during the proceedings, the applicant and his brother were the two heirs of the owner of the confiscated property.he also pointed out that it was clear from the judicial decision that the heirs in question were two – himself and a sibling of his; pursuant to section 5(1) of the inheritance act 1949 he was eligible to receive half of the inheritance and, therefore, half of the compensation awarded by the court.14.  in the meantime, on 19 january 2007, the applicant requested to be issued with a writ of execution on the basis of the 19 july 2005 judgment and, more specifically, in respect of its part concerning the amount of compensation and his consequent share of it.21.  as no further action by the regional governor followed, in march 2009 the applicant once again asked the bailiff to enforce the court decision of 19 july 2005. the bailiff wrote to the governor on 31 march 2009, requesting enforcement and with a reminder that failure to enforce could result in weekly fines of bgn 1,200 and in prosecution.22.  the deputy regional governor replied on 27 april 2009 that the compensation proceedings had not been completed because of the applicant’s failure to submit the requested declaration about his share of the inheritance in accordance with the inheritance act 1949. two days later the regional governor himself fined the applicant bgn 1,000, to be applied weekly.
7.  venyige street is of a width of five metres in the government’s submissions and of eight in the applicant’s.iii of 1989. it was of the view that there was no alternative route for the traffic in the neighbourhood, and consequently the demonstration would impede traffic inordinately.the applicant was reproached with the fact that the notification did not contain the agenda for the gathering.it observed that the question of previous notification of the agenda was immaterial, since the only valid reason in the case was the disproportionate difficulties which would be caused to traffic by the demonstration.13.  the court relied on the expert opinion provided by the traffic division of budapest police department, in whose view the demonstration would have significantly impeded the traffic heading to the shops located in venyige street, a dead end, to the local waste disposal site and to the suppliers’ entrance of budapest prison; and the disruption caused by the crowd might have extended to maglódi road, a major thoroughfare in the vicinity with lines of city transport involved.
5.  on 28 april 2009 the applicant lodged a request to be granted permanent disability with respect to work before the state’s attorney’s office of the porto labour court as a consequence of a labour accident that she had suffered and with regard to which she was claiming damages and compensation.10.  on an unknown date the state’s attorney’s office was informed that the applicant was no longer being treated in the same clinic and on 7 october 2010 requested the applicant to inform whether she was still being treated and in which clinic.the state’s attorney’s office was informed that the applicant had changed her address and on 25 october 2010 requested the police to provide information on the applicant’s new address.12.  on 5 january 2011 the court requested the forensic institute (instituto de medicina legal) to make a medical examination of the applicant, which was made on 27 february 2011. the medical report was submitted by the forensic institute on 3 march 2011 in which it referred that further clinical data and an additional examination were still needed.16.  on 2 april 2012 the applicant requested the porto labour court to continue with the judicial stage of the proceedings against her employer and the insurance company.

5.  on 24 march 2009 the military court of novorossiysk garrison (новороссийский гарнизонный военный суд) convicted the applicant of laundering of the proceeds of crime and sentenced him to a fine.6.  on 21 may 2009 the military court of the north-caucasian command (северо-кавказский окружной военный суд) acquitted the applicant on appeal.7.  on 21 july 2009 the presidium of the military court of the north‑caucasian command, on a public prosecutor’s initiative, annulled the judgment of 21 may 2009 by way of supervisory review and remitted the case for fresh consideration to the appeal court.the annulment was reasoned by two main arguments: (1) unresolved contradictions between witnesses’ statements pertaining to the applicant’s criminal intent, and (2) absence in the appeal judgment of a summary of the arguments presented by the prosecution during the appeal proceedings.8.  on 6 august 2009 the military court of the north-caucasian command, acting on appeal, reversed the judgment of 24 march 2009 and remitted the case for fresh consideration to the trial court.
6.  in the applications trapeznikov v. russia and bychkov and others v. russia, the applicants were former participants of the chernobyl clean-up operation who sued the relevant authorities for an inflation adjustment to their social benefits.7.  in the application markova v. russia, the applicant sought the eviction of her late son’s wife and her granddaughter from the flat she was living in, alleging that she was the sole owner because her son had renounced his share in the flat in her favour.the applicant sought to recover the property of these two plots of land alleging that the transfer had not been duly formalised and that consequently the land formed part of his inheritance.in the applications trapeznikov and bychkov and others, the presidia found that the lower courts failed to take into account the specific method of calculation of indexation established by the government for this particular category of social benefits.in the applications markova and ryabchikov, they concluded that the findings of the lower courts favorable to the applicants were based on the retrospective application of the law (see appendix).
the court also held that the adjustment of the amounts granted was indeed prescribed by article 8 § 3 of the law, but any adjustment was to be made at the time payment was actually made, once the central commission had ratified or otherwise the county commission decision.7.  on 23 june 2003 the bucharest court of appeal allowed the applicant’s claim, and ordered that the central commission issue a decision ratifying or otherwise the proposal made by the county commission on 15 december 2000. the court held that the claim concerning the adjustment of the amounts granted as compensation was to be dealt with during the enforcement stage.10.  dissatisfied with the decision of the central commission, on 13 december 2003 the applicant lodged a court action aimed at obtaining an adjustment of the initial amount to take into account inflation from the date on which it was established by the county commission to the date of actual payment.13.  the appellate court concluded that the county court had interpreted the applicable law incorrectly, as the entitlement to adjustment for inflation had to be determined on the basis of the date when the central commission had ratified the decision of the county commission.14.  it also concluded that the failure of the central commission to ratify the decision of the county commission within sixty days could not represent a legal basis for the adjustment of the amount in question.
on 29 april 2004 the county commission issued a decision whereby the applicant was entitled to compensation of rol 4,991,284,506 (approximately eur 123,500 at the time).7.  between 2005 and 2008 the applicant lodged several applications with the national authority for property restitution (hereinafter “the national authority”) and the president of romania for payment of the compensation.on each occasion, the applicant was informed that her file was subject to ratification by the responsible authority for implementing law no.8.  on 20 february 2009 the national authority issued the ratification decision, confirming the applicant’s entitlement to ron 499,128.43 (approximately eur 117,000 at the time).the decision mentioned that the payment would be made in two annual instalments, as provided for by the methodological rules for the implementation of the law, in force since 30 november 1998 and amended on 26 october 2007.

as a ground for admitting their appeal, the respondents submitted, pursuant to article 231.2 § 1 (1) and (3) of the code of civil procedure (the ccp), that the judicial act to be adopted by the court of cassation might have a significant impact on the uniform application of the law and that the violation of the substantive law might cause grave consequences.the reasons provided were as follows: “the civil chamber of the court of cassation ... having examined the question of admitting [the respondents’ appeal lodged against the judgment of the civil court of appeal of 19 january 2007], found that it must be returned for the following reasons: pursuant to article 230 § 1 (4.1) of [the ccp] an appeal on points of law must contain a ground [required by] article 231.2 § 1 of [the ccp].in particular, the court of cassation considers the arguments raised in the appeal on points of law concerning a possible judicial error and its consequences, in the circumstances of the case, to be unfounded.” 14.  this decision became final from the moment of its pronouncement and was not subject to appeal.15.  on 19 july 2007 the respondents lodged another appeal on points of law with the court of cassation against the judgment of the court of appeal of 19 january 2007, alleging violations of substantive and procedural law.17.  on 10 october 2007 the court of cassation examined the appeal on the merits and decided to grant it by quashing the judgment of the civil court of appeal of 19 january 2007 and validating the judgment of the shengavit district court of 14 september 2006.

7.  in 1990, following the overthrow of the communist regime, the military prosecutor’s office opened a criminal investigation into the december 1989 armed crackdown on the anti-communist demonstrations in bucharest and the other cities.10.  on 18 october 2010, the military prosecutor’s office at the high court of cassation and justice decided not to institute criminal proceedings with regard to the acts committed by the military, finding that the applicants’ complaints were partly statute-barred and partly ill-founded.11.  on 15 april 2011 the chief prosecutor at the military prosecutor’s office set aside the decision of 18 october 2010 on the grounds that the investigation had not yet been finalised and that not all the victims and perpetrators had been identified.12.  on 18 april 2011 the military prosecutor’s office relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the prosecutor’s office at the high court of cassation and justice on the grounds that the investigation concerned both civilians and military personnel.13.  on 9 march 2012 - following the opening of the classified information in the criminal investigation file to the public in 2010 - the case was re-registered with a view to an investigation in the light of the newly available data.

[have decreased], leaving the investigation into the identity of the culprits without an outcome.33.  on 9 august 2012 the district court dismissed the complaint lodged by the applicants against the prosecutor’s decision of 4 october 2011. the court made the following observation: “it is true that the authorities were apparently not sufficiently diligent in carrying out within a reasonable time an effective investigation capable of identifying and punishing those responsible for the criminal acts (the long periods of police inactivity, the transfer of files, the lack of cooperation from some authorities are all duly noted).on the other hand, this situation – although not imputable to the [applicants] – cannot prevent the application of the statute of limitation of criminal responsibility.” 34.  on 12 november 2012 the district court dismissed the complaint lodged against the prosecutor’s decision of 18 june 2012 as a mere reiteration of that already dealt with by the court in its decision of 9 august 2012.
the mayor reported on the same events to the police, explaining that earlier that day some fifty members of the roma minority had confronted approximately fifteen members of the civil guard association, who were joined by four or five unknown persons, one of whom had an axe and another a whip.15.  at the request of her lawyer, the gyöngyös police department informed the applicant that criminal proceedings had been instituted on charges of harassment on the basis of the criminal complaint lodged by mr j.f.mr j.f., questioned as a witness, maintained that two of the persons subject to the proceedings had been wielding an axe and a whip and had threatened the inhabitants of the roma settlement that they would kill them and paint the houses with their blood.21.  on 7 october 2011, following a complaint that procedural errors had been committed by the heves county regional police department in the investigation of mr j.f.’s complaint, the gyöngyös district public prosecutor’s office informed the applicant that it had opened a separate investigation into the allegations of harassment on the basis of the applicant’s complaint.23.  on 3 november 2011 the prosecutor’s office refused the request, finding that the use of force, the objective element of the criminal offence of “violence against a member of a group” under article 174/b (1) of the criminal code as in force at the material time could not be established at that stage of the proceedings.
7.  in 2004, the applicant discovered by chance that an album named “călăraşi county” had been published by a company run by f.g. in 1999. he noticed that of the 143 photographs of landscapes from călăraşi county contained in the album, 135 were photographs taken by him and left in the possession of f.g. in 1984. however, f.g. was credited as the photographer, and not the applicant.8.  the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against f.g. with the romanian copyright office (“the rco”) on 25 february 2004, claiming that f.g. had committed one of the offences provided for by articles 140‑142 of law 8/1996 on copyright and neighbouring rights (“law 8/1996”).14.  a complaint lodged by the applicant with the călăraşi county court was allowed on 24 november 2005. the court held that the period between 27 april 1999 (the date of publication of the album) and 25 february 2004 (the date on which the applicant lodged his complaint with the rco) was less than five years – the term of limitation provided by law.therefore, the court held that in the light of the special provisions applicable to the file, the date from which the term of limitation of five years should have been calculated was not the date on which the rco forwarded the file to the police (5 november 2004) but the date on which the applicant lodged his complaint with the rco (25 february 2004).16.  on 17 february 2006, the bucharest court of appeal allowed an appeal by the prosecutor against the judgment of 24 november 2005 and held that the case had become time-barred, given that the police had received the criminal complaint only on 5 november 2004 – more than five years after the offence had been committed.

6.  in march 2003 the prosecutor referred the criminal case to the industrialnyy district court of barnaul (“the district court”) for trial.7.  on 19 september 2003 the district court ordered the applicant’s detention pending trial following the complaints by one of the victims and a witness about threats expressed by the applicant in their respect.8.  on 22 september 2003 the applicant’s representatives lodged a cassation appeal against the detention order of 19 september 2003 with the regional court via the district court.10.  on 8 october 2003 the district court forwarded a copy of the applicant’s appeal to other participants of the criminal proceedings and informed them that they had until 22 october 2003 to submit their comments, if any.12.  on 19 november 2003 the regional court received all materials related to the applicant’s appeal against the detention order of 19 september 2003.
the adjustment method suggested by the applicant was approved by the domestic courts, which in addition increased the social benefits to which he was entitled to in 2002 in accordance with this same method (judgment of 25 february 2003).7.  in june 2003 the applicant brought a similar set of proceedings in respect of social benefits to which he was entitled to during the first six months of 2003. relying on their previous judgment by which they approved the adjustment method suggested by the applicant, the domestic courts increased his social benefits for the new period accordingly (judgment of 18 june 2003).8.  in october 2003 the judgment of 25 february 2003 approving the adjustment method suggested by the applicant was quashed by a supervisory review court.9.  in march 2004 the domestic courts quashed on the basis of newly discovered circumstances the judgment delivered on 18 june 2003 on the ground that it was based on the judgment delivered in february 2003 but quashed since then by way of supervisory review.the zernogradskiy district court of the rostov region granted the applicant’s claims (judgment of 19 june 2006, upheld on 18 july 2006).
4.  the municipal unitary enterprise sysolskoye proizvodstvennoye obyedineniye “zhilkomkhoz” (муп сысольское производственное объединение «жилкомхоз», hereinafter “the company”) was set up by a decision of the administration of the sysolskiy district.6.  on 3 march 2006 the commercial court of the komi republic commenced insolvency proceedings and appointed an external administrator to oversee the company’s administration.7.  on 29 september 2006 the commercial court of the komi republic ordered the insolvency proceedings in respect of the company.8.  on 28 august 2008 the commercial court of the komi republic discontinued the insolvency proceedings and ordered the respondent company’s liquidation.11.  on 9 august 2006 and 30 october 2006 the justice of the peace of the sysolskiy court circuit of the komi republic awarded the applicants salary arrears (the amounts are specified in the appendix, column no.
13.  it transpires from the wording of the decisions that the city court relied solely on the seriousness of the charges as grounds for the continuing detention and rejected a complaint made by the applicants concerning the composition of the bench.16.  the first hearing was scheduled for 1 october 2001, but the city court adjourned it at least eighty-eight times between that date and 27 september 2004 for the reasons summarised as follows: (i) some lawyers failed to appear for no reason; (ii) some of the lawyers excused their absence for health, professional or personal reasons; (iii) the applicants were not escorted to the court on the days they were ill; or (iv) the applicants and/or their lawyers were removed from the courtroom for interrupting the presiding judge and court clerk, addressing the city court using obscene language and engaging in other unruly behaviour.in particular, they submitted that ms i. had never been selected as a lay judge, and that ms m.’s term of office had expired in 1996. they further alleged that subsequent extensions of ms m.’s term of office by presidential decree had been unlawful, and that in any event she could no longer serve in her office following the adoption in january 2000 of a law governing the selection and service of lay judges and the entry into force in july 2002 of the new code of criminal procedure, which had abolished lay judges in the russian judicial system.25.  on 27 september 2004 the other four applicants were removed from the courtroom prior to the start of examination of the case on the merits until the end of the submissions, on the same grounds as mr denisov.34.  on 6 september 2000 the head of the criminal investigation unit reported that because mr denisov had intentionally delayed the review of the case documents and had refused to review them on several occasions, he and his lawyer had been given eighty days to finish the review, and by 15 january 2001 at the latest.
the decision stated as follows: “the commission hereby decides that [the applicant] is to be placed in a designated wing or cell in a remand centre in conditions which provide increased protection for society and for the security of the remand centre.the detainee has been informed of his right to appeal against the commission’s decision within seven days to the warsaw regional court, xi penitentiary division.” the last sentence of the decision contained information about who was to be informed about the applicant’s placement in a cell for dangerous detainees.in total, there were over thirty decisions to extend the period of imposition of the regime in respect of the applicant.all the decisions were based on the same pattern of wording, which read as follows: “the commission has decided to extend [the applicant’s categorisation as a dangerous detainee] as the reasons for his placement in a cell in conditions which provide increased protection for society and for the security of the remand centre have not ceased to exist.” 11.  in particular, a decision of 3 january 2013 to extend the imposition of the dangerous detainee regime on the applicant referred to the seriousness of the charges against him and his highly deficient moral character.12.  an appeal by the applicant against the latter decision was the only one he made against the series of decisions to impose and extend the dangerous detainee regime on him.
9.  in the meantime, on the assumption that the landowners’ properties would be restored in natura by the commission on property restitution and compensation, in january and february 1996, the applicant concluded two agreements with one of the landowners, who was acting on his own and the remaining heirs’ behalf, whereby the applicant would assist the landowners in the process of the privatisation of installations and fuel tanks on the land (see paragraphs 21-22 below).17.  in the first set of rehearing proceedings, the case was heard by the district court, the tirana court of appeal (“the court of appeal”) and the supreme court, which on 18 march 2003 decided to remit the case to the court of appeal for a further rehearing.2.  second set of proceeding concerning the nullity of the contract and agreements concluded in 1996 (a)  proceedings before the district court 27.  on 17 april 2005 the landowners instituted a fresh set of proceedings against the applicant seeking the annulment of the agreements and contract concluded between february and may 1996. the claim was signed by only their lawyer.the applicant further submitted that the claim had been brought outside the statutory time-limit, and had been signed by only the lawyer and not the landowners, the power of attorney dating back to 2002 and being limited in time and scope, and that the facts of the claim were unrelated.he further objected to the lower courts’ application and interpretation of the domestic law since, in his view, he had been authorised by the landowners to act as their representative, had lodged various appeals and other procedural requests and followed the judicial proceedings with the landowners, had requested the enforcement of final decisions on his and the landowners’ behalf and had sought the criminal prosecution of third parties.
combining the shares that she obtained as a result of this transfer and the one sixteenth of the plot that she had inherited from her father, the first applicant became the owner of 484.43 shares, or 77.5%, of the plot.9.  in 2006 the other ten heirs of the first applicant’s father and mother brought a claim against the first applicant, seeking a judicial declaration that they were the owners of 140.57 of the 625 shares of the plot and of the house built on it.on an appeal by the claimants, on 7 june 2009 the burgas regional court quashed that judgment and made a declaration in the terms sought by the claimants, finding that they were the owners of 140.57 out of the total of 625 shares of the plot and the house built in the place of the old cabin.12.  on 30 september 2013 the head of the regional office of the directorate noted that the house had been constructed in 2004-05 without a building permit, in breach of section 148(1) of the territorial organisation act 2001, and was as such subject to demolition under section 225(2)(2) of that act (see paragraphs 25 and 26 below).the house could not be exempted from demolition under paragraph 16 of the transitional provisions of the 2001 act or paragraph 127 of the transitional and concluding provisions of a 2012 act for the amendment of the 2001 act (see paragraphs 28 and 29 below).
8.  after the adoption of the restitution of property expropriated under building planning legislation act (“the restitution act”) in 1992 (see paragraph 15 below), some of the applicants and other heirs of the original owners (from whom the remaining applicants succeeded in the course of the domestic proceedings) applied for the revocation of the expropriation.10.  following the above judgment, in order to make the restitution effective (see paragraph 16 below), on 21 may 1999 the applicants paid back to the municipality the monetary compensation received by their ancestors at the time of the expropriation.12.  despite the events described above, the applicants could not take possession of the property, because it was being held and used by the plovdiv municipality, which in 1997 had declared it a public municipal property and had rented a room in the building to an organisation called “13 centuries bulgaria” national endowment fund (“the fund”, see paragraphs 19-20 below).according to the supreme court of cassation, the defendants to the rei vindicatio action, namely the plovdiv municipality and the fund, had not participated in the earlier judicial proceedings and therefore were not bound by the judgment of 2 october 1998.14.  next, the domestic courts found that the reparation work carried out on the building which the applicants were claiming had been so substantial (the building’s appearance had been preserved, but the internal construction had been largely modified – the roof, some windows and other elements had also been replaced) that, within the meaning of the restitution act, it could not be said that the building still existed.
8.  the harju county court (“the county court”) heard evidence from the applicant and nine witnesses and examined certain other evidence such as a written forensic expert opinion on l.’s injuries, a telephone activity report concerning the time and location of the applicant’s communications, identification reports based on photographs and a video-recording from a closed circuit television camera near the scene.the witnesses had given different accounts of the events, regarding the number of persons who had been at the scene and attacked l., as well as the attackers’ actions during the scuffle and after l. had fallen to the ground.it also pointed to the lack of credibility of some of the witness statements, such as k.m.’s statement, which said that she had recognised the applicant’s eye colour and the look in his eyes, but that she had not seen the colour of his jacket.the court also referred in that connection to the words heard by witnesses from a person whose appearance corresponded to that of the applicant: “why then did he come to start a quarrel?” if the applicant had arrived at the scene after l. had been knocked down, he would have known nothing about the reasons and initial stages of the conflict and would have had no reason to express himself in such a way.he pointed out that the court of appeal had not directly verified the evidence; he referred in that respect to the conduct of the witnesses, which was of paramount importance in assessing their credibility but which was not reflected in the record of the court hearing.
it is strongly advised that, where possible in the prison setting, an attempt should be made to attain a stronger personality structure in the defendant in order to avoid recidivism in the future.” 13.  the first instance court considered that a life sentence, the imposition of which had been sought by the public prosecutor, would only be condign punishment if it was established from the outset that the applicant’s condition was not amenable to improvement.in this connection it cited part of the psychiatrist’s report as summarised in the judgment of the first instance court (see paragraph 12 above) and furthermore held, inter alia, as follows: “considering that in view of the findings of the psychiatrist, which the court accepts and adopts as its own, and in particular the fact that the risk of recidivism is very significant, the interest of society in being protected against any such recidivism should, in the opinion of the court, carry the most weight, having regard to the personality of the accused; considering that − however regrettable − there is no possibility in the netherlands antilles for the imposition of a tbs order (terbeschikkingstelling met bevel tot verpleging van overheidswege) for confinement in a custodial clinic, which would be the most appropriate measure in this case; that placement in a custodial clinic in the netherlands in similar cases has in the past proved impracticable – as is known to the court ex officio – and is in the present case moreover considered impossible by the psychiatrist due to the accused’s limited intelligence and insufficient ability to express himself verbally; considering that in the present case there is no way in which the aforementioned preponderant interest can adequately be protected in these lands other than through the imposition of a penalty which will prevent the accused’s return to society, and thus that only a sentence of life imprisonment qualifies as suitable; considering that the court is aware that this sentence does not – in principle – provide the accused with any prospect of one day returning to society as a free man, a fact which will presumably make this sentence heavier to bear for the accused than a temporary sentence of imprisonment, but which in the court’s opinion should not lead to the aforementioned interests, which, as set out above, should carry the most weight, being sacrificed; ... ... sentences the accused to imprisonment for life; ...” 16.  on 25 november 1980 the supreme court (hoge raad) dismissed the applicant’s appeal in cassation against the judgment of the joint court of justice.27.  the procurator general, in a letter to the joint court of justice of 5 august 2004, recommended that that court issue negative advice on the application for a pardon lodged by the applicant on 17 june 2004. he wrote, in so far as relevant, as follows: “... having regard to the content of his request for a pardon together with the interview with him that was recently broadcast on television, the petitioner obviously still does not, in my opinion, realise the gravity of the diabolical act committed by him on 23 may 1979.the foundation for probation and social rehabilitation concludes that a possible conditional release of the convicted person would at this stage have far-reaching psychological consequences for the relatives.” the decision goes on to observe that, in the acting procurator general’s submission, there was not a single objective indication from which it could be inferred that the risk of the applicant’s committing an offence had disappeared or diminished, that an early release would seriously shock the surviving relatives, and that it would also shock society to such an extent that this would hinder the applicant’s possible reintegration.the court further considers that the nature of the offence committed by the convicted person – the killing of a six-year-old girl for the sole purpose of hurting her aunt, his former girlfriend – is bizarre and, as was concluded at the time, must be attributed to the psychopathically disturbed personality of the convicted person.
under section 70 of the political parties act, ‘all expenses of a political party shall be incurred on behalf of the legal personality of that political party’ and pursuant to section 75 of the same act, ‘at the end of its inspection, the constitutional court shall determine the accuracy and the lawfulness of the political party’s income and expenses, and shall order the registration of unlawful income and expenses as revenue with the state treasury’.6111 ..., which was published in the official gazette dated 25 february 2011 [and which introduced some amendments to section 74 of the political parties act], came into force on the date of its publication and it does not envisage ... the [retroactive] application of the amended provisions ...; therefore, the unamended provisions are to be applied to inspections and proceedings predating the amendments.” 12.  on the basis of the principles outlined above, the constitutional court found that certain expenses incurred in the respective periods under review had been in violation of the political parties act.the violations in question fell under two heads: the first head consisted of expenses that could not be considered to have been made “in pursuance of the objectives of the political party” and “in the name of the party’s legal personality” on the basis of a decision of the competent party organ, in accordance with section 70 of the political parties act; and the second head concerned the expenses that had not been substantiated with the necessary documents as required under section 76, regardless of whether they were otherwise lawful.in the decision of 11 july 2012 concerning the review of the 2009 accounts (see paragraph 10 above), one of the judges dissented from the majority’s approach to this matter, and argued that demanding that such costs be met by the individual members of the party involved directly in the litigation, regardless of the effects of that litigation on the political party, would unduly curtail the scope of the party’s political activities in an unconstitutional manner.35.  on 11 may 2012 the applicant party received a letter from the ankara governor’s office ordering it to pay the amounts indicated in the constitutional court decision concerning the review of the 2007 final accounts, which totalled try 3,372,446 (approximately eur 1,435,000 on 7 march 2012, the date of the delivery of the decision), within thirty days of the receipt of the letter.
37.  it appears from the kemah prosecutor’s file that on 9 june 2005 the security forces had obtained authorisation from a judge to intercept the applicants’ relatives’ mobile telephones, and telephone conversations some of the applicants’ relatives had had with a number of local people, including the men who were subsequently arrested for providing them with logistical support, were intercepted by the authorities between 9 and 17 june 2005. according to the transcripts of the intercepted telephone conversations drawn up on 11 june 2005, the applicants’ relatives had discussed over the telephone issues such as renting vehicles and facilitating their movements in the area.38.  on 21 june 2005 the ovacık prosecutor also asked the ovacık district gendarmerie command to send the weapons and the ammunition recovered together with the bodies of the applicants’ relatives to the regional forensic laboratories with a view to establishing whether the rifles had been used in any other previous incident and whether the 23 g3 spent cartridges and the 45 kalashnikov spent cartridges had been discharged from the g3 and the kalashnikov rifles found together with the bodies and whether they had thus been used in the armed clash.thus, no offence was committed by the members of the security forces who killed the deceased or by members of the security forces and the administrative officials who planned the operation and ordered it ... the decision is hereby taken not to continue with the investigation...” 62.  the applicants lodged objections to the prosecutor’s decision on 14 and 22 july 2006. in their submissions the applicants also referred to the kemah report and drew attention to the discrepancies between that report and the ovacık report.70.  in addition to the above, in their complaint the applicants also criticised the prosecutor’s failure to identify the names of the soldiers who had killed their relatives, to establish the exact locations and movements of both their relatives and the soldiers, to visit the scene, to identify the weapons used by members of the security forces, and to safeguard the clothes removed from the bodies of their relatives.76.  according to a document which was made available to the court by the respondent government and which was prepared by the ministry of justice on 12 may 2009 and sent to the ministry of foreign affairs apparently in order to advise the latter when preparing its observations to be submitted to the court, the applicants’ relatives’ clothes and a number of other items found on their persons were destroyed on the orders of the ovacık prosecutor, on the ground that they had no evidential value.
the investigating judge found, on the basis of the available material, that there was a reasonable suspicion that in the period between october and december 1991, in his capacity as commander of a police unit, the applicant had ordered arbitrary arrests, ill-treatment and the killing of a number of civilians, and that, by not taking the necessary measures to prevent and punish those responsible, he had consented to a number of other arbitrary arrests, the unlawful confiscation of property, ill-treatment and the killing of civilians by his subordinates.the relevant part of the indictment concerning the applicant’s participation in those acts reads: “in the period between 8 october and mid-december 1991, in zagreb and pakračka poljana, during an international armed conflict between the forces of the republic of croatia and the former [yugoslav people’s army] and the paramilitary serb forces, assisted by volunteer fighters from other parts of the former yugoslavia, contrary to articles 2, 3 § 1 (a) and (c), 13 and 32 of the geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war of 12 august 1949 and articles 4 §§ 4 and 2 (a), 51 §§ 2 and 6, 86 and 87 of the protocol additional to the geneva conventions of 12 august 1949, and relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts (protocol i), as an official in the ministry of the interior of the republic of croatia and the commander of the reserve unit of the ministry of the interior stationed in pakračka poljana and partially in zagreb, where it had its compound, and thereby authorised to command his subordinates and responsible for the application of rules of international humanitarian law concerning the protection of civilians, ordered the unlawful deprivation of liberty, torture and killing of certain civilians, and when he was not present in the field, although aware that his subordinates were acting unlawfully by arbitrarily depriving civilians of their liberty, robbing, ill-treatment, torture, causing physical harm and killing civilians, did not take the necessary measures to prevent or suppress such unlawful actions, thereby accepting that his subordinates continue with such acts and condoning their consequences ...” 13.  on 28 june 2011 the applicant lodged an objection against the indictment, arguing that it was not supported by any relevant evidence.these particularly grave circumstances of the offences concern, in the view of this panel, the manner in which the civilians ... were unlawfully and arbitrarily deprived of their liberty, how their property was confiscated without any legal basis, how they were physically and mentally ill-treated (often by the use of electric shocks) and eventually killed; and the fact that some of these unlawful acts were committed on the basis of the defendant’s orders, while the others he did not prevent although he was aware of them ...” 26.  on 5 january 2011 the investigating judge extended the applicant’s detention for a further two months under article 102 § 1 (2) and (4) of the code of criminal procedure (risk of collusion and gravity of charges).the relevant part of the decision reads: “when assessing whether further extension of the detention is needed under article 102 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure, the panel looked into the facts of the indictment and found that there was a reasonable suspicion that the accused tomislav merčep, in the period between 8 october 1991 and mid-december 1991, as an official and the commander of the reserve unit of the ministry of the interior of the republic of croatia, authorised to command his subordinates, ordered the unlawful deprivation of liberty, torture and killing of certain civilians.the relevant part of the decision reads: “in view of the competence of the supreme court as the highest court ensuring the coherent application of the law and the equality of everyone in its application (article 116 § 1 of the constitution), the likelihood of a prison sentence within the given term and the particularly grave circumstances of the offence, the constitutional court finds that the supreme court and the zagreb county court satisfied the relevant opinions and requirements when extending the pre-trial detention under article 102 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure ...” 37.  on 6 september 2011 a three-judge panel of the zagreb county court extended the applicant’s detention under article 102 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure (gravity of charges), reiterating its previous arguments.
they complained, in particular, about the failure of the public prosecutor to take statements from their son’s wife, the psychiatrist who had been treating mr hüseyin başbilen, and other possible witnesses, to have the deceased’s computer, his emails and the transcripts of his telephone conversations examined and to determine the date the suicide note file had been created on his computer.taking into account the circumstances of the case, in particular the fact that the deceased had not been in a suicidal state of mind, the position of the deceased’s body in the car and the nature of his injuries, they considered that mr hüseyin başbilen had not committed suicide.28.   on 5 january 2011 the ankara public prosecutor asked the altındağ gendarmerie command to submit the usb flash drive found in the deceased’s workplace and confiscated on 6 august 2006, and the report concerning the date of creation of the suicide note document found on the deceased’s computer on the same date, if such a report had been drawn up.the expert opined that the cuts had been inflicted when the deceased had been in the driver’s seat; that he had touched the left door handle at least once; that later on he had crawled to reach the door on the passenger side for an unknown reason; that he had lost consciousness and his head had fallen under the glove department on the passenger side; and that he had then died.54.  on 29 september 2014 the ankara public prosecutor asked the gendarmerie command to instruct the officers in the task force to conduct a thorough investigation, to be in constant contact with the public prosecutor’s office and to provide information on the outcome, especially in view of the public interest in the investigation.
defendant vladimir milanković in the period between july 1991 and june 1992, while defending the wider area of sisak and banovina from armed attacks carried out by paramilitary formations of a part of the local serbian population and the yugoslav people’s army in the conflict on the constitutional and territorial integrity of the republic of croatia, ... as a commander of the police units in the wider area of sisak and banovina ... authorised thereby to give orders to all police units and responsible for [securing] compliance with and application of the laws of war and international humanitarian law relative to the protection of civilian persons on that territory and for the humane treatment of prisoners of war, aware that, due to the conflict and occupation of an important part of banovina and the terrorising and expulsion of the non-serbian population from the occupied territories, intolerance towards the serbian citizens of sisak was growing, that the security situation in the city was ... extremely complex, that inter-ethnic relations were very tense, that there was a perception amongst the croatian and other non-serbian citizens of sisak that all serbs were collectively responsible for the war, ... at the same time aware that the police units under his command were mostly composed of members of the local population affected by the suffering, that amongst the members of his subordinate police units there were some individuals who had been previously in conflict with the law, while the members of the reserve police units had not been instructed about or trained on all the obligations arising from the norms of international laws of war and humanitarian law, aware that in the sisak area members of his subordinate units frequently and without any legal basis carried out searches [and seizures] in the houses and flats of persons of serbian origin, ... who were, in the course of these unlawful actions, often arrested ... although aware that the arrested persons were subjected to unlawful actions, that during questioning they were accused of collaboration with the enemy, offended, humiliated and coerced, that some of them were physically and psychologically ill-treated and that grave bodily injuries were inflicted on them, and that already on 4 august 1991, during one such intervention ... v.b.[was arrested and subsequently] brutally beaten by a number of unknown members of the reserve police unit ..., and that the numerous injuries he had sustained led to his death the same evening in the sisak hospital, although aware that in the above-noted circumstances, if he failed to take timely and adequate measures, the members of his subordinate units would continue their unlawful actions against the citizens of sisak of serbian origin and their inhumane treatment of prisoners of war, although under the commonly recognised rules of international laws of war and humanitarian customary law relative to the protection of civilian persons, and the command responsibility for the acts of subordinates in times of armed conflict, contrary to articles 3 § 1 (a) and (c), 13, 27, 31 and 32 of the fourth geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war of 12 august 1949, article 4 §§ 1 and 2 (a) and article 13 of the protocol additional to the geneva conventions of 12 august 1949, and relating to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts of 8 june 1977 (protocol ii), articles 75, 86 and 87 of the protocol additional to the geneva conventions of 12 august 1949, and relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts (protocol i) and article 3 § 1 (a) and (c) and article 13 of the third geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war of 12 august 1949, he was required to take measures to prevent, supress and punish such unlawful actions, he failed to do so.... since article 102 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure does not explicitly provide for a legitimate aim of detention, as provided for in the other relevant provisions on detention, it is particularly important that the competent criminal justice authorities correctly establish the necessity of applying article 102 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure ... in view of the findings of the osijek county court, and taking into account the sentence of imprisonment which can be imposed in this specific case, as well as the gravity of the charges, the constitutional court finds that the decisions of the investigating judge and the three-judge panel of the osijek county court comply with the relevant opinions and requirements when extending the pre-trial detention under article 102 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure ...” 28.  following the filing of the indictment against the applicants in the osijek county court (see paragraph 11 above), on 19 december 2011 a three-judge panel of that court extended the first applicant’s detention pending trial under article 102 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure (gravity of charges).... ... accordingly, the extension of detention under article 102 § 2 (4) of the code of criminal procedure cannot be grounded on a simple repetition of the description of the offence imputed [to a defendant] ... but requires an analysis and a detailed reasoning of all the facts and circumstances, particularly those related to the personality of the defendant, the public interest in his or her remand in custody, as well as the conduct and the results of the proceedings.” 53.  on 2 september 2013 a three-judge panel of the osijek county court examined the specific circumstances of the case and extended the first applicant’s detention under article 102 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure (gravity of charges).however, the constitutional court stressed: “in view of the findings [with regard to the possibility of ordering detention on the grounds of the gravity of the charges] and the length of the appellant’s continued detention, as well as the length of the criminal proceedings and the expected termination of the main hearing, and in view of the fact that the detention was ordered twenty years after the alleged commission of the offences with which the appellant has been charged, the constitutional court finds that the validity of the findings of the supreme court [with regard to the avoidance of public disturbance] has reached its temporal limits.
the toilets were separated from the rest of the cells by a wall which was not very high and were located at a distance of some 1.5 metres from the table where the inmates served their meals.there was no ventilation system and the air was impregnated with a sewage smell and with cigarette smoke; there was no sufficient natural light because the windows were very small; the daily walks lasted for only one hour and the food served was of a very bad quality.whereas the special rapporteur notes that the minimum norms regarding nutrition of detainees (government decision n. 609 of 29 may 2006) are checked on a daily basis and that, according to the financial plan of the penitentiary department, the food budget for 2008 had almost doubled in comparison to 2004 and is set to rise further, he also received consistent allegations regarding the poor quality and quantity of food.“conditions of detention”) the human rights centre found, inter alia, that: “failure to adhere to the statutory cell size (4 square metres per person) in the living blocks of the institution has become an unpleasant problem which now affects the prison system across the entire country.in this connection, the minister of justice provided information to the ombudsman about the expenditure on prisoners’ food in 2010. the cost amounted to mdl 24.05 million, whereas the budgetary need for the same year was, according to the ministry of finance’s draft budget, mdl 29.05 million.
7.  the association’s goal, as declared in its memorandum of association (act constitutiv) and in article 2 of its articles of association (statutul asociației), was that of promoting the principles of sustainable development at the public policy level in romania (promovarea principiilor dezvoltării durabile la nivelul politicilor publice din românia).the association’s objectives, as declared in article 7 of its articles of association, were: to increase expertise in the development of sustainable public policies in romania (creşterea expertizei ȋn elaborarea politicilor publice durabile din românia); to improve the process of the development of sustainable public policies by facilitating public participation in and access to relevant information about the environment; to increase the accountability of the relevant official bodies by scrutinising the implementation of public policies with an impact on the environment; to facilitate the access of official bodies to best practices by examining the government’s environmental initiatives in a european context; to ensure transparency in the work of public institutions and increase their responsibility for their actions in relation to other citizens; to review whether public institutions worked on the basis of principles of sustainability; and to defend the right to a clean environment, as provided by international treaties.the activities envisaged by the association in order to achieve its objectives, as declared in article 8 of its articles of association, were: research and analysis; public debates and conferences; monitoring the implementation of european union directives; public communication campaigns; opinion polls; reviewing the development and implementation of public policies in the environmental field; training; raising citizens’ awareness; informing people of matters of public concern; raising the awareness of the community and of public authorities about the need to protect the environment; organising meetings between citizens and representatives of public authorities; organising debates and opinion polls on issues impacting the environment; developing programmes in partnership with public authorities; active involvement of citizens in the development of public policies and the decision-making process; improving the legal framework; setting up annual prizes for environmental activities; awarding scholarships for promoting sustainable development; networking with similar national and international organisations; supporting and defending the association’s members and volunteers; and other lawful activities.9.  the bucharest public prosecutor’s office lodged an appeal on points of law (recurs) against the interlocutory judgment of 24 october 2009. it argued that it interpreted the association’s declared goal as belonging to the field of activities of a political party.it held that the goal of the association, as declared in its memorandum and articles of association, was that of promoting the principles of sustainable development at the public policy level in romania.
7.  on 2 and 23 march 2006 building inspectors of the inspectorate of the ministry of the environment, spatial development and construction (ministarstvo zaštite okoliša, prostornog uređenja i graditeljstva, uprava za inspekcijske poslove) carried out an on-site inspection of the block of flats in question.9.  the applicant lodged an appeal against the demolition order, submitting that the time-limit for compliance was too short and that the block of flats was not within the protected coastal area.10.  on 15 may 2006 the appeal section of the legal department at the inspectorate (odsjek za postupak u drugom stupnju – “the second-instance body”) dismissed the appeal, finding that the block of flats had been built without a building permit.18.  on 13 july 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint, alleging, inter alia, a violation of her right of access to court, on the ground that the administrative court had erroneously decided a matter which had not been the subject of her administrative complaint.19.  on 13 december 2010 the constitutional court declared the constitutional complaint inadmissible, on the grounds that the contested decision had not concerned the merits of the case and as such was not amenable to constitutional review.
11.  according to the government, on 14 november 2006 the case against the applicant was received by the justice of the peace of the tverskoy district, who on the same day scheduled a hearing for 15 november 2006. according to the applicant, she was not informed of the hearing date until it was too late.the court takes into account that the applicant’s presence next to the object being picketed, together with other people, directly discloses the expression of opinions and attitudes, and thus takes the form of a group public event, namely a static demonstration.” 14.  the applicant sought re-examination of the case on appeal by the tverskoy district court of moscow.on 5 december 2006 the court heard the applicant and upheld the judgment of the justice of the peace, concluding that the applicant had taken part in a public event held without prior notification to the competent authority; on 10 november 2006 she had been apprised of the hearing to be held before the justice of the peace but had failed to sign the summons.the court held as follows: “following the escorting of [the applicant] to the police station no administrative offence case was opened ... [mr s.] testified that the defendant had shown his identity document and had not expressed his consent to go with the police to the police station ... the police officers acted unlawfully when escorting the applicant to the police station ...” the court awarded the applicant rub 6,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage (approximately eur 149 at the time).the police decided to apply the escort procedure (доставление) to the applicant because it was necessary to put an end to the administrative offence and because an administrative offence record could not be compiled on the spot since the applicant had no identity document on him.
the applicant was charged with a number of offences: (a) circulating forged documents contrary to sections 331, 332, 333, 335 and 339 of the criminal code; (b) unlawful entry into the republic contrary to section 12 (1, (2) (5) of the aliens and immigration law; (c) unlawful residence in the republic contrary to sections 6(1)(k) and 19 (l) of the aliens and immigration law; (d) resisting lawful arrest contrary to section 244(a) of the criminal code; (e) assaulting a police officer and deliberately obstructing a police officer during the performance of his duties contrary to section 244(b) of the criminal code; and lastly, (f) threatening violence (section 91(c) of the criminal code).43.  on the same day, the director of the department of civil registry and immigration issued deportation and detention orders against the applicant pursuant to section 14 of the aliens and immigration law on the ground that he was an illegal immigrant under section 6(1)(d) of that law.44.  a letter was also prepared by the ministry of interior informing him of the decision to detain and deport him following his conviction and imprisonment pursuant to section 6(1) of the aliens and immigration law and article 35 of the right of union citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the republic of cyprus (see paragraphs 90 and 94 below).the head guard stated that he had been in the office of the particular wing at the time of the incident and two of the prisoners and one of the guards had intervened and pushed the applicant back.the government also submitted a copy of a letter dated 16 october 2014 sent by the prison administrator to the ministry of justice concerning the present case describing the incident, in which it was stated that following the applicant’s attempt to hit the escorting guard, two of the prisoners and the other guard on duty pushed him aside and immobilised him.
the court considered that the conditions for confiscation of the lorry under article 68 (2) of the criminal code 1996 (see paragraph 21 below) had not been fulfilled: specifically it had not been established that the lorry could be used again to commit an offence; that the confiscation had been necessary for the protection of safety or for reasons of ethics; and that the lorry had been specially adjusted for the commission of specific type of offences.it established that mr i.a., who knew that the lorry could have been confiscated, had sold it to the company m. at the relevant time, neither the manager of m. nor the applicant had known that the lorry had been used in the commission of the offence and that it had been subject to a confiscation order.the court considers that it is mandatory to confiscate the [lorry] under the afore-mentioned provisions, because this safety measure has a wider influence [in the sense of] general deterrence of all future offenders of this type of offences, and otherwise the offenders would be encouraged, after the offence has been committed, to dispose of the means with which they committed the offence and, thus, to even acquire pecuniary benefit; furthermore that would have a negative influence on the ethics of the wider public, [that is to say] on general deterrence ... ... given that from the evidence and the above-mentioned statutory provisions it has been established that the [lorry] in question was confiscated in favour of [the respondent state] in lawful proceedings, the court finds that the [respondent state] has therein obtained ownership of the [lorry] in question on the basis of a final and enforceable judgment ... in accordance with sections 112(2) and 154 of the [property act.]the court also considers groundless the [applicant’s] representative’s arguments that under section 129(5) of the criminal proceedings act the final decision for confiscation of the [lorry] could be amended with a decision in civil proceedings if there were a dispute concerning the ownership of the confiscated items, given that this provision would have been applied if the [lorry] had been sold to the [applicant] before the offence was committed and had, under any legal basis, remained in the factual possession of the convicted [mr i.a.]and he, after having sold it, committed the crime; but in the present case it is vice versa; firstly the offence was committed and then the [lorry] was sold.” 18.  the court also established that the applicant had upgraded the lorry to the value of 69,150 macedonian denars (mkd).
25.  on 14 and 29 december 2011 the applicants lodged complaints with the prosecution service regarding the events of 16 to 18 november 2011. they alleged that the officers had breached article 5 of the convention and had also restricted their freedom of movement.he had meanwhile contacted a lawyer, i.b., who had arrived at the site at about 9.30 p.m. the second applicant had been allowed to leave the site at about 4.30 a.m. the following morning, when the inspection had been completed.47.  referring to section 12 of the criminal procedure law, the vid stated that the restrictions on the first and second applicants’ freedom of movement between 17 and 18 november 2011 had been proportionate to the public interest in crime prevention.in view of the information received from the vid, the first applicant had been handcuffed under section 161(1)3) and 4) of that legislation on the grounds that he had failed to comply with lawful requests made by the vid officers and to protect an object under guard from unlawful threat.the first applicant had not been detained under article 253 of the code of administrative violations, and in the criminal proceedings he had only been detained at 10.10 a.m. on 18 november 2011. a record of his arrest had not been drawn up with regard to the restriction on his right to liberty during the inspection on 17 november 2011. this had therefore not been in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law.
15.  the court of appeal obtained further written submissions from dr b., who, with regard to the development, was now of the opinion that a suspension of the applicant’s contact was, at the moment, the less damaging approach and therefore in the child’s best interest.in her written submission to the court of appeal, the child’s guardian expressed her view according to which, to prevent long‑time damages of the child, a minimum contact with the applicant should be guaranteed in any event by allowing him to send letters and presents to the child.16.  on 19 october 2012 the court of appeal heard from the parents, the child’s guardian, the child and dr b., it rejected the applicant’s request and suspended all contact between him and his daughter indefinitely, pursuant to articles 1696 and 1684 § 4 of the civil code (see paragraphs 23 and 24 below).20.  the court of appeal continued: “against the background of the parents’ previous conduct both in and outside the courtroom, the [court of appeal’s] chamber rules out the possibility that the parents will be able successfully to have recourse to mediation in the foreseeable future.22.  after the applicant lodged his application with the court and the application had been communicated to the government, the family case file was sent to the ministry of justice and then back to the family court.
at some point, one of the officers had entered the holding cell and had kicked him in the chest, as a result of which the applicant had fallen to the floor.22.  she found that at approximately 1.30 p.m. on 8 may 2006 the applicant had been swearing and banging on the door of the holding cell while asking the escort officers to call an ambulance for the second time.24.  while the expert report of 19 september 2006 indicated that the applicant had been diagnosed with a moderately severe injury in the form of a fracture of a lumbar vertebra, the possibility could not be excluded that this injury had been caused by the applicant’s falling against a hard object, which corresponded to the escort officers’ account of the incident.33.  she noted that the ambulance had arrived for the second time at 2.06 p.m. on 8 may 2006. the applicant had complained of a pain in the area of his left kidney, alleging that the officers had kicked him there.55.  on 30 june 2006 the state police found that without carrying out procedural acts it was impossible to establish the circumstances in which the applicant had sustained the injuries and whether the force used against him by m.p.
in accordance with section 102(3) of the criminal proceedings act (see paragraph 18 below), the court further advised the applicant, who had claimed compensation in the criminal proceedings, to pursue the claim by means of a separate civil action before the civil courts.relying on article 100-a (2) of the code, the appellate court found that the vehicle’s chassis had been forged and that the vehicle, in the interest of public safety, could not be declared roadworthy.14.  on 11 march 2011 the applicant appealed arguing that the first-instance court had wrongly applied article 100-a (2) and (3) of the code and that he had not known that the vehicle had been used to commit a crime.the relevant part of the decision states as follows: “[the arguments] raised in the appeals, [namely] that the first-instance court had not established the decisive facts concerning [the certitude] that the [applicant] had not known that the vehicle’s chassis had been forged, which was decisive, are groundless.however, [what is] primary under article 100-a (2) of the [criminal code] is that the objects which were intended to [commit] an offence or were used to commit an offence shall be confiscated notwithstanding that they are not in the ownership of the offender or that they are in the ownership of a third person, if general safety, public health or ethics require so ... the fact that [the applicant] did not know that the vehicle’s chassis had been forged does not signify that the conditions of article 100-a(3) are met, but the first-instance court correctly found that the use of the vehicle with thus forged identification numbers would affect the safety of the road users in the state [безбедноста на јавниот сообраќај], and therefore also the general safety [интересите на општата безбедност].” 16.  it appears that the latter decision was served on the applicant on 2 june 2011.
8.  on 10 march 2005 an investigator with the pivdenno-zakhidna railway police department, who was dealing with the criminal case against b., applied to the shevchenkivskyy district court in kyiv for search warrants for two flats, including the one belonging to the applicant, where, according to the investigator, b. permanently resided.with regard to the applicant’s flat, the court found that it was necessary to carry out a search of the flat where b. permanently resided and where the forged documents, as well as the means of and instruments for forging the documents, might be kept.16.  on 1 october 2005 the kyiv city prosecutor’s office reversed the decision of 5 july 2005 as regards the suspension of the proceedings, finding that the investigation had not been carried out comprehensively: the people participating in the search of the applicant’s flat had not been questioned properly, the mobile phones and the top-up cards had not been found, and the investigative measures implemented had not been properly documented.in his decision, the prosecutor referred to the statement of a police officer that the applicant had been contacted on her mobile phone and informed that the search would be carried out, and the door to the flat had only been broken down after her refusal to appear.the court stated that the prosecutor had adopted the decision after interviewing the police officers, two attesting witnesses, and a representative of the building maintenance organisation who had been involved in the search, in addition to the applicant and her former husband.
the prosecutor replied and informed the applicant in his letter that the investigation in question not only concerned the killing of her husband and r.ç., but the killings of seven other persons in 1994 and 1995. the prosecutor informed the applicant in his letter of 11 february 2005 that on account of the confidential nature of the investigation he could not give her a copy of the entire investigation file.the prosecutor did, however, give the applicant copies of certain documents from the file and informed her that five persons had been identified as possible suspects in the killing of her husband and that criminal proceedings had been initiated against one of those individuals before the diyarbakır state security court.the prosecutor also secured the evidence such as the bullets, spent cartridges and the clothes worn by the applicant’s husband on the day in question, and sent them for forensic examination.his conviction was quashed by the court of cassation on 1 april 2010 on the ground that at the time the offences were committed he had been under the age of 18 and that fact had not been taken into account by the first-instance court.49.  while the above-mentioned criminal proceedings were pending, on 11 february 2005 the adana prosecutor communicated to the applicant, in response to a request made by her, copies of the documents concerning the investigation into the killing of her husband.
9.  following several procedural decisions of the zagreb municipality office with responsibility for war veterans’ affairs (hereinafter: the “zagreb office”) and the ministry in charge of war veterans’ affairs (ministarstvo branitelja i međugeneracijske solidarnosti; hereinafter: the “ministry”), on 3 june 2004 the administrative court (upravni sud republike hrvatske) ordered the zagreb office and the ministry to examine the applicant’s request for family disability benefit on the merits, which the applicant should have a possibility to challenge if he was not be satisfied with the outcome.12.  on the basis of the ministry’s instructions, the zagreb office commissioned an expert report concerning the question whether the suicide of the applicant’s father was related to his participation in the war from the psychiatric clinic of the clinical hospital dubrava, reference centre of the ministry of health and social care for stress-induced disorders, regional centre for psychotrauma in zagreb (klinička bolnica dubrava, klinika za psihijatriju, referentni centar ministarstva zdravstva i socijalne skrbi za poremećaje uzrokovane stresom, regionalni centar za psihotraumu zagreb; hereinafter: the “centre”), a public health care institution authorised by law to give expert opinions on matters related to war veterans’ psychiatric disorders (see paragraph 28 below).13.  in an expert report dated 10 june 2007 addressed to the zagreb office, the centre concluded, on the basis of the available medical reports and the statements of witnesses, that the applicant’s father had not developed any symptoms resulting in a psychiatric diagnosis linked to his participation in the war and that his suicide could not be attributed to his wartime service.had developed any symptoms resulting in a psychiatric diagnosis linked to his participation in the war ... having these facts in mind, this court is of the opinion that the defendant acted lawfully when dismissing the appellant’s appeal against the first-instance decision ... it should also be noted that this court already held that the formation of an expert team [competent to determine] a possible link [between death and participation in the war], which [provides for] a decisive evidence within the meaning of section 123 § 1 (8) of the [veterans act], is a precondition for any further proceedings concerning the status of the family member of a deceased war veteran.he contended in particular that the administrative bodies and the administrative court had ignored his request for an expert report to be commissioned from the permanent court experts and that he had been offered neither the possibility of participating in the choice of experts nor the opportunity to take cognisance of and comment on the expert opinion before the adoption of a decision during the proceedings.
7.  the return decision stated that she was a prohibited immigrant by virtue of article 5 of the immigration act (chapter 217 of the laws of malta) because she was in malta “without means of subsistence and liable to become a charge on public funds”.her appeal was also rejected by the refugee appeals board (the “rab”) on 18 december 2012. the appeal decision reads as follows: “the refugee appeals board refers to a fill-in-the-blanks form received in its office on 18 july 2012 and to a legal submission on your behalf received in its office on 8 october 2012. the board notes that you travelled to libya in december 2011, first via kenya and then via sudan.your appeal for the grant of refugee status by malta cannot be upheld according to law.” 10.  up to the date of the lodging of her application with the court on 19 august 2013 the applicant had heard no news about any steps being taken in connection with her removal.in june 2012 following claims by the applicant that she had been falling repeatedly, and that she was having episodes of jerking and tongue biting (which had left evident marks), the doctor requested her referral to a specified department to run the relevant tests to exclude epilepsy – the result of these tests, if undertaken, are unknown to the court.22.  she complained about the lack of constructive activities to occupy detainees, overcrowding (particularly during the summer months), lack of privacy, limited access to open air, difficulties in communication with staff, other detainees and with the outside world, lack of information about their own situations, and the lack of proper arrangements for heating and cooling, leading to extreme cold in winter and extreme heat in summer.
at the top of the document, it was explained that the list had been compiled on the basis of the “bulletin on the search for criminals” prepared by the criminal investigation and counter-terrorism department of the ministry of the interior of uzbekistan and published in tashkent in may 2003.21.  on 26 november 2008 the head of the human rights commission of the parliament of turkey replied to the applicant’s representative that the ministry of the interior had informed the parliament, in a letter dated 11 november 2008, that the applicant had been deported to iran, a safe third country, in compliance with the legislation in force.22.  in his reply dated 22 april 2009, in his capacity as head of the human rights commission of the van governor’s office, the deputy governor of van informed the applicant’s representative that the applicant and the other deportees had been removed to iran in compliance with the legislation in force and that iran was a safe third country where the applicant had lived before he had arrived in turkey in 2007.the unhcr also informed the applicant’s representative that on 26 september 2008 they had sent a letter to the turkish authorities requesting the latter to take the necessary measures to grant the applicant and other uzbek nationals who had been deported on 12 september 2008 residence permits with a view to legalizing their status in turkey pending the completion of the procedures with regard to their cases.the applicant cannot approach the turkish authorities to apply for asylum or to obtain a temporary residence permit for fear of being deported to iran, like the other uzbek asylum seekers who were deported once again to iran in october 2008. moreover, he cannot appoint a lawyer to undertake the necessary legal and procedural actions on his behalf before the domestic authorities as he does not possess the necessary identity documents required to issue a power of attorney before a notary public.
the next day the tverskoy district court of moscow (“the district court”) authorised his pre-trial detention until 16 september 2013, having regard to the seriousness of the charges against him and the risk of his absconding, reoffending and interfering with justice.12.  on 13 september 2013 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 16 november 2013, citing the risk of his absconding given his previous attempt to evade prosecution and the seriousness of the charges against him.lastly, the court noted the complexity of the case and several steps in the investigation which had yet to be performed, including some which required the applicant’s presence and participation.16.  on 14 november 2013 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 30 march 2014. it again cited his unemployment status and ability to abscond, in view of the seriousness of the charges and his having been on the run from january to july 2013. noting that his state of health was compatible with the detention conditions, the court concluded that the extension of his detention was justified.it reiterated the arguments contained in the preceding detention orders and noted the discovery of the forged passport in his flat during the police search, which for the court was a clear sign of his intention to flee.
40.  in addition to the facts indicated above (see paragraph 6 above), the trial court also established that the second applicant had arrived in bar on 3 january 2007; that he had called n.v. regarding the shipment; that on 4 january 2007 the cans had been loaded onto his truck and he had left for kosovo; that he had spent the night of 4 january in the truck at pec customs terminal; that on 5 january 2007 the truck had been searched (using police dogs) at that terminal; that on the night of 5 january the truck had remained at the terminal and the second applicant had spent the night in a hotel; that he had returned to the terminal on 6 january; and that at 2 pm.the court did not accept the defence of the accused since it was contrary to his actions and the admitted evidence in support of the indictment ... [the second applicant] does not deny that by having transported the paint, he also transported the cocaine ... the court cannot accept [his] defence that he did not know that there was cocaine in the cans because it is not supported by any evidence and it is contrary to his actions ‒ he transported the drugs from bar to the macedonian border and (contrary) to admitted evidence – cocaine found in the cans, which was noted in the certificate of temporary seized objects ... signed by [the second applicant] who did not contest the signature and the confiscation of the cocaine at any stage of the proceedings ...” 44.  the applicants appealed against the trial court’s judgment.in the present case ... it is clear that the trial court did not violate the accused’s right of defence ... ... regarding the alleged violation of section 126 of the criminal proceedings act ... it is evident that after the investigating judge had questioned [the first applicant] ... [she] gave a detailed statement which was duly noted in the court record and which she had read and signed ... ... the lawyer requested and was given access to the file before he objected to the indictment ... moreover, the trial court established all the relevant facts at the trial ... ” 46.  as regards the expert evidence, the court established that all the expert reports admitted as evidence had confirmed that the substance found in the cans had been cocaine; in the statement of 15 november 2007, s.k.48.  as to the second applicant’s complaint that he had not known that he was transporting drugs, the court stated: “... such an allegation is contrary to the established facts based on admitted evidence concerning the actions taken by [the second applicant] and his criminal liability ... the court does not accept [his] allegations because on the basis of all evidence admitted at the trial, [the trial] court correctly established the relevant facts concerning the actions taken by [the second applicant] ... (these) allegations were assessed by [the trial] court ... (which) gave reasonable grounds why it did not give credence to them ... it was established beyond any doubt that drugs ‒ cocaine ‒ had been found in some paint-cans transported by the vehicle driven by [the second applicant].” 49.  the court further noted that: “... the large quantity of drugs, the way they were procured and transported, and the actions taken by the accused, suggest that the cocaine was transported for the purpose of selling it and not for any other purpose ... on the basis of the admitted evidence, the analysis and assessment thereof, (and) the accused’s behaviour before they reached agreement concerning the shipment, the fact that they communicated between themselves, during the shipment, that is to say before, during and after the crime ... it can be concluded that the accused knew and were aware of their actions, including the crime that they had committed ... in this connection, according to this court, there is no logical economic reason to import acrylic paint from venezuela, given the fact that transport costs from venezuela to the (final) destination ... would be higher than its value.and n.v., the accused’s behaviour before they reached agreement concerning the shipment, the intensive and multiple contacts between themselves during the shipment, when the crime had been committed and after it had been discovered, the trial court correctly concluded that the accused knew and were aware of their actions regarding the unlawful transport of drugs.” 52.  the supreme court further added: “... as to the allegations raised in the requests that the expression “for the purpose of selling (заради продажба)” is missing from the operative part of the trial court’s judgment, the court considers that (this omission) does not render it defective, since that can be presumed (произлегува) in view of the actions undertaken by [the applicants] when committing the criminal offence ... from the description of [the applicants’] actions there is no doubt that drugs were transported for the purpose of selling and that such a large quantity of drugs, namely pure cocaine, cannot be for [the applicants’] personal use.
at 6.15 p.m. on 31 october 2009 the [mvd] front desk was informed ... that at 3.30 p.m. on 31 october 2009 in a deserted half-ruined house at 7 second darvina lane, grozny ... officers from the argun [ovd], leninskiy [rovd], 8th company of the 2nd regiment of the [mvd] traffic police and the head of the argun town administration’s security service had blocked a member of illegal armed groups, who had offered armed resistance during his apprehension and had been liquidated ... present [during the operation were]: minister of the interior mr r. alkhanov and deputy minister of the interior mr r.l.e, chief of grozny criminal police mr sh., chief of the department of the interior mr ir., chief of criminal police at the department of the interior mr is., chief of public security police at the department of the interior mr ba.you are also requested to forward me documents confirming the lawfulness of the special operation ... the order to conduct the operation and a copy of the results of the internal inquiry carried out into the matter ...” 55.  on 2 february 2010 the acting chief of the argun ovd replied to the investigators that they had no information concerning ms zarema gaysanova’s abduction and that the officers mentioned in the request of 28 january 2010 had been instructed to give statements to the investigators.60.  on 22 april 2010 the applicant’s lawyer reiterated his request for the investigators to take a number of steps such as obtaining copies of the video footage of the special operation, identifying and questioning all of the participants, asking the drivers of the uaz vehicles whether they had seen ms zarema gaysanova being forced into one of them, and questioning the chechen minister of the interior mr alkhanov concerning the law-enforcement agencies who had participated in the operation and the firemen who had put out the house fire afterwards.had lived with his wife, zarema gaysanova, whose whereabouts after the special operation remain unknown ...” 62.  on 9 july 2010 the chechen deputy prosecutor criticised the investigation into ms zarema gaysanova’s disappearance and ordered the investigators to take a number of remedial measures: “... on 16 june 2010 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators ... an examination of the case file has demonstrated that this decision was unfounded and premature; it was taken prior to all the investigative steps being taken... ... the criminal case has been investigated by several investigators for seven months, however, an effective investigation has not been carried out, the whereabouts of the abducted ms z. gaysanova have not been established, and sufficiently effective steps to identify the culprits have not been taken ... up to the present date the servicemen of the law-enforcement agencies who took part in the special operation ... have not all been identified and questioned.the investigation established that the following servicemen had participated in the special operation (according to the operational information note of 31 october 2009, volume 2, page 49 of the case file):  the argun department of the interior (ovd)  the leninskiy district department of the interior in grozny (rovd)  the 8th regiment of the 2nd regiment of the chechen traffic police  the head of the argun town administration security service also, from the same document it follows that the crime scene had been visited by senior officials of the chechen law-enforcement agencies and operational investigation groups:  chechen minister of the interior, mr a.;  chechen deputy minister of the interior, mr e;  chief of the grozny department of the interior (the grozny ovd), mr t.;  chief of the criminal search division of the grozny ovd, mr sh.
by relying on the relevant domestic legislation (see paragraph 24, below) he argued that the proceedings had concerned the refusal by the public authorities to issue an act or to carry out the administrative formalities needed for the removal of the fence built on v. street and for the reopening of access to the street.because the applicant had referred only in general terms to the person whose fence had closed off part of the street, the bucharest general council had merely replied to him in general terms about the future development plans for the area in question and the size of the street in question.13.  the court also dismissed – on the grounds that they were unnecessary and would not further the resolution of the case – the applicant’s request for additional testimonial evidence, an onsite investigation and an expert report that would (according to the applicant) have demonstrated that the road had been obstructed by the construction of the fence.the authorities had not asked him to provide the name of the owner of the fence; indeed, it was the duty of the public servants – not the applicant – to inform the mayor of bucharest of the impugned person’s identity.the applicant had argued before the judicial authorities that the administrative authorities had been mistaken as to the identity of the owner of the fence; however, he had failed to inform them of the alleged mistake in order that they might clarify the situation.
however, according to the information submitted by the government, the assessment of the value of several items of the real property, which were the subject matter of the proceedings, had been made on the basis of the material available from the investigation case file and their estimated value at the moment of purchase in 1997 (in total estimated at approximately eur 440,000), whereas the assessment of the value of the remainder of the real property had been made by the vukovar county state attorney’s office with regard to the information available in the land registry, although the records in the land registry did not contain information on the value of the property itself.22.  the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on 27 december 2012. with regard to the applicant’s specific complaint concerning the lack of proportionality of the measure imposed, the supreme court noted: “the supreme court finds that the principle of proportionality has not been breached since antun džinić is charged with having obtained a pecuniary gain in the amount of hrk 1,800,857.74, and the value of the restrained property does not justify [his] argument that the value of the restrained property listed in the operative part of the impugned decision significantly surpasses the [possible confiscation] claim.” 23.  on 18 february 2013 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) challenging the decisions of the lower courts on the seizure of his property.it follows from the final indictment of the vukovar county state attorney’s office ... that there is a reasonable suspicion that the accused antun džinić, by the offences listed in count 4 (a), (b) and (c) [of the indictment], obtained pecuniary gain in the total amount of hrk 1,800,857. since the [seizure order] is based, under section 12 § 1 of the confiscation of the proceeds of crime act, on the presumption that there is a danger that the confiscation of the proceeds from crime would not be enforceable or that its enforcement would be difficult without ordering of a restraint measure, it was decided as noted in the operative part of this decision.” 27.  on 12 july 2013 the applicant challenged this decision by lodging an appeal before the supreme court.1. the applicant further stressed that it was unclear for which amount of the alleged pecuniary gain the seizure order had been made given that the vukovar county court had only referred to one count of the indictment, alleging that he had obtained pecuniary gain in the amount of hrk 1,800,857, whereas it had ignored the other count of the indictment according to which he had obtained a pecuniary gain in the amount of hrk 6,169,977.35. the applicant, therefore, assuming that the overall amount of the pecuniary gain for which the seizure order had been made corresponded to the sum of the two amounts noted (approximately eur 1,060,000), submitted a detailed estimate value of each item of the restrained property based on the information from a publicly available internet portal on the market values of real properties in croatia.28.  on 17 october 2013 the supreme court, acting as the appeal court, dismissed the applicant’s appeal by noting the following: “the same complaints had been made against the decision of 30 october 2012 ... and then it was answered to the appellant that the principle of proportionality had not been breached ... by a speculative assessment of the value of the real properties listed in the appeal, the appellant did not manage to put into doubt the findings of the first-instance court.
(b)  facts in dispute (i)  the government’s submissions 18.  the government submitted that the applicant had failed to inform the court that from 17 july 2008 to 13 august 2009 he had been detained in łódź prison, not in łódź remand centre, and that from 13 august 2009 to 8 january 2010 he had been at liberty.(ii)  the applicant’s submissions 19.  the applicant submitted that he had been detained in łódź remand centre from 17 august 2005 to 26 april 2010. he argued that that was confirmed by the łódź court of appeal (sąd apelacyjny) in the written grounds of its judgment of 17 september 2010 (see paragraph 24 below).20.  official statistics published by the prison service show that during the applicant’s second period of detention, overcrowding at łódź prison had ranged from highs of 18.5% in july 2008 and 19.4% in august 2008 to a low of 2.5% in june and august 2009. the overall capacity of łódź prison from 17 july 2008 to 13 august 2009 was exceeded on average by 10.4%.26.  the government submitted that the applicant had been served with the opinion by his legal aid lawyer on 15 february 2011 and again by the łódź court of appeal on 27 september 2012. the government attached to their observations a postal slip confirming the february date for the posting of the opinion to the applicant at łódź remand centre.(b)  the applicant’s submissions 27.  the applicant submitted that the legal opinion dated 15 february 2011 had not been served on him as he had been on a temporary release between 8 february 2011 and 22 february 2012. the applicant submitted a certificate to the court issued by łódź remand centre confirming the above dates.
mr zoltán cséfalvay, the secretary of state for the national economy, was replying on behalf of the government when the applicants mr karácsony and mr szilágyi carried into the centre of the chamber a large placard displaying the words “fidesz [the party in government] you steal, you cheat, and you lie.” subsequently, they placed it next to the secretary of state’s seat.13.  the minutes of the session read as follows: “dr zoltán cséfalvay, the secretary of state for the national economy: ... tell them that the increase of commodity wages particularly affects those with a minimum income, since the minimum income has been increased by 5.4 %, which is impossible to keep up with inflation lower than 3.5%.in protest during the final vote on the bill, ms lengyel placed a small, golden wheelbarrow filled with soil on the table in front of the prime minister, while ms szél and ms osztolykán unfurled a banner displaying the words “land distribution instead of land robbery!” in front of the speaker’s pulpit; meanwhile, ms lengyel used a megaphone to speak.21.  the minutes of the session read as follows: “speaker: the next point on the agenda is the vote on the amendments submitted prior to the final vote on the transfer of agricultural and forestry land bill and the final vote.because members of jobbik are not allowing the left-wing, opposition party member and notary to sit at [the speaker’s pulpit] during the vote by roll call and conduct the vote and proclaim the results (continuous noise).
9.  on 26 september 2001 the prosecutor general’s office of russia decided that in view of the seriousness of the charges faced by the applicant, the risk of his absconding, as well as the necessity to “secure the enforcement of the conviction” the applicant should be placed in pre-trial detention.13.  on 24 october 2001 the moscow babushkinskiy district court examined the applicant’s arguments with references to his medical documents, documents attesting to his family situation, his positive references from work, and the arguments by the investigator to the effect that the applicant had ignored the investigator’s summonses to appear on 22 and 25 july, 13 and 14 august and 24 september 2001 without giving reasons, that he had often been several hours late to appear before the investigator, that he could appear for fifteen minutes and then leave saying that nobody could tell him when to come and when to leave, and that throughout the summer, in the eyes of the investigator, the applicant had been out of contact.such extensions were granted upon the prosecutor’s request on 16 december 2002, 19 march, 23 june, 24 september, 23 december 2003 and 24 march 2004. on each occasion the district court referred to the seriousness of the charges against the applicant and the risk of his absconding or otherwise obstructing justice, and the absence of grounds for changing the preventive measure imposed.in reply to the applicant’s argument regarding the alleged unlawfulness of the composition of the trial court, the city court held that the composition of the court had remained unchanged throughout the trial in accordance with article 242 of the code of criminal procedure, and that the participation of lay judges, who had also been involved in the examination of another case, had had no legal consequences and had not amounted to a violation of the law.the city court further held that the reading out of the testimonies of certain witnesses had been carried out by the trial court on the request of the prosecutor and in compliance with the requirements of article 281 of the code of criminal procedure.
17.  on 28 january 2005 the forensic medical expert reported that the abrasions on the bridge of the applicant’s nose, in the region of his left elbow, left forearm, right shin and left thigh would not cause harm to the applicant’s health and had been inflicted by the impact of blunt objects, which had not left traces suitable for identification, between eight to thirteen days prior to the applicant’s examination (apparently, the report referred to the applicant’s examinations on 23 november and 25 november 2004) (report no.691 (see paragraph 17 above); -  the report of a service inquiry by the iz-72/2 remand prison in connection with the delayed recording of yam.’s physical injuries; -  an expert report on yam.’s physical injuries; -  explanations by yam.’s ex-wife; -  explanations by the applicant’s wife to the effect that on 17 november 2004 the applicant had not come home, and that on 20 november 2004 the police had carried out a search of their flat and seized the applicant’s personal belongings, video and audio equipment, and the applicant’s hunting rifles.24.  having regard to the above evidence, the decisions refusing the institution of the criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment concluded that: -  the abrasions on the bridge of the applicant’s nose, in the region of his left elbow, left forearm, right shin and left thigh had not caused harm to the applicant’s health; -  the presence of abrasions on the applicant’s body, which had not caused harm to the applicant’s health and could have appeared in the course of everyday life, had not been indicative of alleged torture; -  the applicant was inclined to lie and deceive; -  between 17 november and 23 november 2004 measures had been taken by the domestic authorities to identify and arrest those involved in the commission of crimes with which the applicant and his co-defendants had been charged, however the applicant could not be located; -  the applicant had often gone away from home hunting, therefore his allegation of abduction should be regarded with a critical eye as being a means to avoid criminal responsibility; the applicant’s allegations had contradicted the statements by the police officers, and the bor.the supreme court found as follows: “... [p]ursuant to article 109 § 8 of the code of criminal procedure, the court correctly extended the [applicant’s] detention until such time as [he] and [his] lawyer have finished studying the case file materials ... the statement in the appeal to the effect that the court was required to indicate a specific date when extending [the applicant’s] detention in such circumstances was not based on [domestic] law.the court found no reasons to alter the custodial measure in respect of the defendants and, in so far as the applicant’s health was concerned, mentioned that the forensic medical report contained in the case file indicated that the applicant was simulating the symptoms of neurological conditions and that there was nothing to prevent him from participating in the proceedings.
three years later, the applicant was introduced to the “expert community” at the wiener neustadt regional court, and her integrity was beyond reproach for a decade – until now.” 9.  the passage was followed by comments by a member of the green party, who had made a criminal complaint against the applicant with the public prosecutor’s office, the youth advocate at the regional government of lower austria, and the vice-president of the wiener neustadt regional court, who was responsible for managing the list of experts at the court.furthermore, the court did not find the article to be incomplete or manipulative, but sufficiently well-balanced and faithful to the different sides of the story in that it also referred to the fact that the applicant’s integrity had never been questioned in ten years; the court also asked for statements from the vice-president of the wiener neustadt regional court, a member of the green party, and the youth advocate of the regional government of lower austria.17.  in the meantime the applicant lodged an action with the innsbruck regional court on 7 april 2009. she sought damages under section 8a of the media act (mediengesetz) and publication of the judgment claiming that the article, and in particular the passages dealing with the psychological expert report on her, violated her intimate personal sphere and compromised her publicly.the court found that the average reader would understand the article as stating that the applicant was incapable of being an expert in custody proceedings because of her own mental health impairments in 1993 and that this placed in question the quality of the applicant’s work so far.the article, while focusing on the applicant’s work in custody proceedings, gave space to comments from the youth advocate of the regional government of lower austria, a member of the green party, and the vice-president of the wiener neustadt regional court.
7.  on 2 july 2008 the presidium of the supreme court of the republic of tatarstan in supervisory review proceedings annulled the judgment on the applicant’s request, because she was formally indicted outside the prescribed statutory time-limits.8.  on 15 october 2008 the novo-savinovskiy district court of kazan acquitted the applicant on the same grounds after re-calculation of the applicable time-limits for investigative actions.9.  on 18 november 2008 the supreme court of the republic of tatarstan upheld the judgment on appeal.10.  on 18 february 2009 the presidium of the supreme court of the republic of tatarstan in supervisory review proceedings annulled the judgments on the prosecutor’s request.the annulment was reasoned by three main arguments: 1) in the opinion of the supervisory court all of the evidence was collected within the statutory time-limits, 2) the lower courts having examining all the evidence during the hearings did not mention them in the judgments and only gave reasons for dismissing them, and 3) formal indictment of the applicant outside of the statutory time-limits should not have led to acquittal in any event.
in his written observations submitted to the court on 23 february 2012 in reply to those of the government, the applicant’s lawyer stated that police officers had “wrung the [applicant’s] hands and feet and hit him on the body, including the areas of his liver and kidneys, and on [his] arms and legs”.19.  during one of the hearings the trial court questioned the victim, p., who stated, without indicating the exact dates, that the applicant had raped him several times between september 2004 and april 2005. p. provided very detailed information about the circumstances of the rapes and about the events which had taken place before and after them.the applicant also argued, without providing further details, that the police had beaten him on 21 april 2005. he stated that he could not rape p. on 10 april 2005 because on that day he had sawn wood with m. he also stated that a. had given false statements during the trial because he himself had raped p. the statements of p.’s mother were also false, the applicant had refused to give her money and she had wanted to take revenge.on the basis of the findings made by the trial court, the court of appeal held that the arguments raised in the appeal by the applicant and his lawyer’s arguments were ill-founded because they had been refuted by evidential material in the applicant’s criminal case file.38.  on 2 april 2007 the court requested the applicant to provide: (i) documentary evidence supporting his allegations of ill-treatment; (ii) copies of the complaints of ill-treatment lodged with the domestic authorities; (iii) copies of the applicant’s and his lawyer’s appeals in cassation, stamped by the supreme court to prove their receipt; and (iv) a copy of the supreme court’s decision as soon as it would be available.
13.  on 11 december 2007 the administrative court ordered the applicant’s release from detention subject to a number of conditions, including that he be subject to a curfew; that he remain at a fixed address; that he report on a weekly basis to the nearest border and immigration agency office; and that he take the steps necessary to obtain travel documents.14.  the applicant refused to sign a “disclaimer” on 14 december 2007. although he was released on 17 december 2007, four days later the matter was brought back to the administrative court and a different judge discharged the previous order on account of his failure to comply with the conditions for release (namely, that he take the steps necessary to obtain travel documents).21.  in or around september 2008 the immigration authorities discussed the possibility of prosecuting the applicant under section 35 of the asylum and immigration (treatment of claimants, etc) act 2004 for failing without reasonable excuse to comply with the secretary of state’s requirement to take specified action to enable a travel document to be obtained.29.  the judge then had regard to the relevant principles of domestic law set out in r v. the governor of durham prison, ex parte hardial singh [1984] 1 wlr 704 and in the guidance given by the court of appeal in both r (a) v. secretary of state for the home department [2007] ewca civ 804 and wl (congo) v. secretary of state for the home department [2010] ewca civ 111 (see paragraphs 35-36 below).30.  with regard to the question of whether there should be guidance on how long it might be appropriate to detain an individual, the judge made the following observations: “it cannot be right for the secretary of state to be led to believe, by looking at a digest of the range of decisions that have been taken, that it is safe to detain for x months or x years.
in its reasoning the court held that despite the judicial decision of 1 april 2013 in which a compromise solution had been adopted for the applicant, namely the confirmation and extension of her placement in the children’s crisis centre, she was still failing to abide by the institution’s internal rules, was not returning to the centre by the designated time after school, was in contact with individuals identified as “delinquents” and was still behaving rudely and aggressively towards the social workers at the centre.in the four years prior to her application, only six pupils had obtained the secondary-school leaving certificate, and none at all in 2011 or 2012. three pupils had been awarded the certificate in 2013 with an overall average mark of 3.67 out of 6, the minimum pass mark being 3. the applicant added that in 2012 and 2013 the pedagogical council had not given any positive assessments of pupils’ behaviour or school results, meaning that no proposals for the end of a placement had been submitted to the district court.32.  the reports also note that there is a high pupil turnover rate during the school year because of the admission of juveniles on the basis of a placement order and because of their departure, in most cases on reaching the age of majority (18 years of age) or on the expiry of the statutory maximum duration of the placement.38.  lastly, the 2009 report recommends in particular: (a) a general reform of the status of the institutions in question and of their operation, through the inclusion of alternative educational and preventive methods; (b) the introduction and development of units for preventing deviant behaviour, and their involvement as soon as children display the first signs of such behaviour; (c) shorter placements, with more emphasis on social rehabilitation and psychological support for children than on teaching; (d) returning the children in question to the ordinary school system, including in schools in their home area, rather than keeping them apart in specialist institutions, through an intensive individual integration scheme managed by teams of educational experts; (e) the introduction of programmes allowing young people to acquire vocational skills; (f) instilling an atmosphere of cooperation with families; (g) a reform whereby local committees for combating juvenile antisocial behaviour would no longer have a decisive role in taking educational measures and such decisions would be taken by a specialist judge alone; (h) abolition of punishments for juvenile antisocial behaviour; (i) abolition of criminal penalties for children under 14 years of age and their replacement by exclusively social and protective measures, applicable only in exceptional cases; (j) admitting children under 14 years of age to specialist institutions only where there is a social need or a need for protection; and (k) closure of the institutions in question, subject to the introduction of alternative protective and judicial measures in legislation and practice.measures were subsequently put forward in an action plan for the implementation of the national policy strategy on juvenile justice for 2013-2020. among the measures envisaged were: the repeal of the juvenile antisocial behaviour act and the introduction of a new juvenile justice act for children in conflict with the law, with the aim of offering a wide range of social, educational and learning services to children in difficulty.
8.  on 27 december 2003, after a number of forensic medical examinations and on the basis of witnesses’ testimonies, the investigative officer terminated the criminal proceedings on the ground that it was impossible to establish who was responsible for the accident.all of them were subsequently quashed and the criminal proceedings have accordingly been reopened by decisions of the police officer of the shostka district police department (on 3 march and 1 april, 11 june, 6 october, 10 november 2004, 1 march 2005) with reference to the incompleteness of the investigation.the latter authority referred, in particular, to the failure of the inquiring officers to question additional witnesses and to reconcile factual discrepancies between the experts’ conclusions and the accounts of some witnesses, the completion of technical examinations, including reconstruction of the events.on 29 august 2005 the shostka local court allowed the prosecutor’s request and decided that the case should be remitted for additional investigation to shostka district prosecutor’s office on account of the incompleteness of the investigation.17.  on 29 august 2011 the applicant instituted separate civil proceedings against mr v. 18.  on 29 march 2012 the higher specialised civil and criminal court upheld the decision of the appellate court in the criminal case against mr v. 19.  on 8 january 2013 the higher specialised civil and criminal court of ukraine upheld the decision of the sumy court of appeal of 15 august 2012 allowing the applicant’s civil claim and ordering payment of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages relating to his wife’s death in the amount of uah 10,774.32. it appears that the decision of the court of appeal has not been fully enforced due to lack of funds of mr v. and the impossibility of selling his property.
64.  in the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the third question is that article 53 of the charter must be interpreted as not allowing a member state to make the surrender of a person convicted in absentia conditional upon the conviction being open to review in the issuing member state, in order to avoid an adverse effect on the right to a fair trial and the rights of the defence guaranteed by its constitution.” 48.  in the case of alpha bank cyprus ltd v dau si senh and others (case c-519/13, judgment of 16 september 2015), concerning the application of regulation (ec) no 1393/2007 of the european parliament and of the council of 13 november 2007 on the service in the member states of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters, the cjeu held: “30.194.  in so far as the echr would, in requiring the eu and the member states to be considered contracting parties not only in their relations with contracting parties which are not member states of the eu but also in their relations with each other, including where such relations are governed by eu law, require a member state to check that another member state has observed fundamental rights, even though eu law imposes an obligation of mutual trust between those member states, accession is liable to upset the underlying balance of the eu and undermine the autonomy of eu law.” 50.  article 234 of the treaty establishing the european community (applicable at the relevant time and replaced by article 267 of the tfeu) read as follows: “the court of justice shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning: ... (b)  the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions of the community and of the ecb; ... where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a member state, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the court of justice to give a ruling thereon.45.  accordingly, the answer to the second question is that, in circumstances such as those of the case in the main proceedings, which are characterised both by the fact that there are conflicting decisions of lower courts or tribunals regarding the interpretation of the concept of a ‘transfer of a business’ within the meaning of article 1(1) of directive 2001/23 and by the fact that that concept frequently gives rise to difficulties of interpretation in the various member states, the third paragraph of article 267 tfeu must be construed as meaning that a court or tribunal against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law is obliged to make a reference to the court for a preliminary ruling concerning the interpretation of that concept.” 53.  council regulation (ec) no 44/2001 of 22 december 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (“the brussels i regulation”) entered into force on 1 march 2002. it replaced the brussels convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters of 27 september 1968 and was binding on all the european union member states with the exception of denmark.2.  under no circumstances may the foreign judgment be reviewed as to its substance.” article 46(1) “the court with which an appeal is lodged under article 43 ... may, on the application of the party against whom enforcement is sought, stay the proceedings if an ordinary appeal has been lodged against the judgment in the member state of origin or if the time for such an appeal has not yet expired; in the latter case, the court may specify the time within which such an appeal is to be lodged.” article 54 “the court or competent authority of a member state where a judgment was given shall issue, at the request of any interested party, a certificate using the standard form in annex v to this regulation.” (b)  explanatory memorandum concerning the proposal for a regulation 56.  in so far as relevant to the present case, the explanatory memorandum concerning the proposal for a council regulation (ec) on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters presented by the commission (document com/99/0348 final, published in the official journal of the european communities c 376 e of 28 december 1999, pp.it provides as follows: “a judgment given in a member state which is enforceable in that member state shall be enforceable in the other member states without any declaration of enforceability being required.” 64.  however, article 45(1) of the new version reiterates the terms of article 34(2) of the brussels i regulation: “on the application of any interested party, the recognition of a judgment shall be refused: (a)  if such recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy (ordre public) in the member state addressed; (b)  where the judgment was given in default of appearance, if the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence, unless the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for him to do so; ...” 65.  prior to 1 may 2004, the date of accession of cyprus and latvia to the european union, the service of judicial documents between the two countries was governed by the hague convention of 15 november 1965 on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters, which was ratified both by cyprus (where it entered into force on 1 june 1983) and by latvia (where it entered into force on 1 november 1995).

accordingly, and in view of the specific information on [the first applicant’s] situation, the high court finds no sufficient basis for holding that the refusal by the ministry to grant a residence permit to [the second applicant] with reference to the attachment requirement of the aliens act implies a disproportionate infringement of [the first applicant’s] rights as a danish national and his right to family life.for the reasons given by the high court, the supreme court upholds the decision made by the ministry of integration that it is not contrary to article 8 to refuse [the second applicant’s] application for a residence permit.” 29.  moreover, the majority in the supreme court (four judges) found that the 28-year rule was in compliance with article 8 of the convention read in conjunction with article 14 of the convention.she was born in egypt in 1946 or 1948. she first went to the united kingdom in 1973 and obtained nationality of the united kingdom and colonies in 1979. she married a turkish national bekir balkandali in 1981, and their application for spousal reunion in the united kingdom for the husband of a british national was refused later in 1981. a comparison of the two cases reveals that both [the first applicant] and mrs balkandali only came to denmark and the united kingdom, respectively, as adults.1204 of 27 december 2003, the application of the attachment requirement to danish nationals was restricted through the 28-year rule, and the preparatory work in respect of the act stated that the purpose was, inter alia, ‘to ensure that danish expatriates with strong and lasting ties to denmark in the form of at least 28 years of danish nationality will be able to obtain spousal reunion in denmark’.the memorandum of 14 january 2005 made by the ministry of integration and the memorandum of november 2006 made by the working group composed of representatives of the ministry of justice, the ministry of foreign affairs and the ministry of integration state that the provision solely concerns issues on the revocation and loss of nationality.
it stated that the applicant presented a psychological disorder caused by a physical and psychological trauma to which she had been exposed on 13 january 2007. the doctor held that, according to the documents presented by the oradea psychiatric hospital, the applicant’s condition had required fourteen days of medical care.the prosecutor based the decision on the following facts: the two men declared that they had not forced the applicant in any way; the forensic medical certificate attested to no signs of violence on the applicant’s body; and after returning to the wake she had not told her girlfriends what had happened to her.he concluded his testimony before the court with the remark: “... i was asked by someone in the village whether it was true what happened and whether i was not ashamed of what i had done, but i replied that it was not safe to leave girls alone on the streets.” 31.  on 31 august and 28 september 2007 the court heard statements from the applicant’s two girlfriends, as well as from m.i.c.the decision of the beiuş district court concerning the classification of the crime and the suspension of the execution of the sentences was upheld.in reply to the applicant’s reasons for appeal, the court reasoned: “it must be mentioned that the victim tried to convince the court that, in fact, she had not agreed to have sexual intercourse with the two defendants and that she had been the victim of a rape, but these allegations had not been proved in any way.
two days later the basmannyy district court, moscow, (“the district court”) authorised his detention during the investigation, having assessed the gravity of the charges and the risk of the applicant absconding, reoffending and interference with witness.9.  on 21 july 2005 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 9 october 2005, citing the gravity of the charges and the particular complexity of the case, and having looked into the state of the applicant’s health and not considering it to be serious enough to justify his release.15.  after the preliminary hearing the city court authorised a trial by jury, fixed the first trial hearing for 29 december 2005 and once more collectively extended the detention of the defendants, including the applicant, for an unspecified period of time, again citing exclusively the gravity of the charges.17.  the applicant appealed against the decision of 15 february 2006. his statement of appeal bears the stamp of the city court and indicates that it was lodged on 21 february 2006. seventeen days later his lawyer received a letter from the presiding judge, stating that the appeal could not be accepted because russian procedural law did not provide for the possibility to appeal against intermediate decisions issued by a trial court.40.  in the meantime, on 24 october 2005, in view of the deterioration of the applicant’s health, his lawyer requested the head of the remand prison and the prosecutor general’s office to authorise a complex medical examination of the applicant by doctors from the s.p.
7.  between april 2002 and october 2010 the prosecution authorities delivered at least ten decisions refusing to institute or discontinuing criminal proceedings in respect of p. owing to a lack of corpus delicti in his actions.on 21 december 2010 and 20 november 2012 the odessa regional court of appeal (“the court of appeal”) and the higher specialised court for civil and criminal matters (“the higher specialised court”), respectively, upheld that decision.10.  on 20 november 2012 the higher specialised court also issued a separate ruling, by which it brought to the attention of the court of appeal and the odessa regional prosecutor’s office a number of shortcomings in the proceedings.the numerous refusals by the investigating authorities to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the accident had been unfounded and had eventually been quashed.in summary, the higher specialised court held that the criminal investigation in question had not complied with domestic legislation or the convention.
13.  on the same day, sisak ironworks holding and the fortis company concluded an agreement to sell the flat at issue to the applicant, under the sale to occupier act.16.  on 12 december 1996 the office for reconstruction and development of sisak-moslavina county accepted the applicant’s request and granted him and his family the sum of 29,900 croatian kunas (hrk) to repair their house in petrinja.the claim was dismissed by the sisak municipal court on the grounds that the contract of sale had been concluded in accordance with the law, since at that time the applicant had had a specially protected tenancy of the flat in question.it also held that the applicant had known the circumstances in which the former holders of the specially protected tenancy had left the flat at issue as well as that they had lodged a request for the re-opening of the proceedings in which their specially protected tenancy had been terminated.in particular, in his constitutional complaint he wrote, inter alia: “the complainant’s right to inviolability of ownership guaranteed by article 3 of the croatian constitution was violated by the decisions of the sisak county court and the sisak municipal court because the unconstitutional decision of the sisak county court interferes with the complainant’s ownership ...” 21.  the constitutional court declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible on 9 june 2011 holding that the case did not raise any constitutional issues.
psychiatrists took into account the letters by his mother to the akmenė district psychiatric health centre and the prosecutor to the effect that the applicant did not take care of his daily needs, and had social and health issues and suicidal thoughts.16.  at a public hearing on 31 january 2007 the akmenė district court, relying on articles 465-468 of the code of civil procedure, granted the prosecutor’s request for the applicant to be declared incapacitated, on the grounds that he could not understand or control his actions.17.  the government submitted that, given the fact that it had not actually been possible to serve the summons on the applicant, the decision of 31 january 2007 had only been sent to the interested parties in the case, that is to say the applicant’s mother, the prosecutor and social services.22.  the government submitted to the court an extract from the applicant’s medical records, which indicated that he had been at the šiauliai psychiatric hospital from 9 march until 22 june 2007. the doctor indicated in that record that a copy of the court ruling of 13 march 2007 had been given to the applicant.30.  in their observations on the admissibility and merits of the case, sent to the court on 2 may 2012, the government noted that at that time the applicant had lived separately in his own apartment.
10.  on 9 november 2007 limarko provided the investigators with the following documents: the captain’s service report; an extract from the ship’s logbook of 24 october 2007; a report on the circumstances of v.b.’s death, signed by the captain and two assistant captains; two reports (one by the captain and one by the chief engineer) to the brazilian authorities; statements by twelve members of the crew; the death certificate issued on 5 november 2007 in brazil; documents about the work instructions given to v.b.when examining the applicant’s complaint, the sli had obtained internal correspondence between limarko and the vega, which showed that the working conditions on the ship had been hard – the ship’s machinery, including the main engine, would often break down, and the engine emitted combustion gases into the ship; there had also been frequent fires.the court observed that on 10 september 2008 the applicant had asked the prosecutor to order an expert examination to establish whether the constant breathing of combustion gases could cause a heart attack, and to ask the brazilian authorities to provide the report on her husband’s autopsy and the results of blood tests, as those documents had not been present among those brought back with v.b.’s body.in the opinion of the klaipėda regional court, it was therefore vital to continue the pre-trial investigation and to eliminate the doubts raised by the applicant as to the reliability of the results of the medical examination of v.b.’s body, and to establish whether v.b.24.  on 24 march 2009 the prosecutor ordered the klaipėda seaport police to establish the whereabouts of the vega and whether it was possible to inspect the ship; to question everyone who worked on it, including about working conditions, as noted in the applicant’s complaint; to obtain documents from limarko related to safety at work; and to ask the sli whether they had examined the actual working conditions on the ship.
10.  on 12 august 2011, at the request of the koper higher court (“the higher court”), the competent judge of the local court enquired about the faxes received by the registry of that court on 28 june 2011 from 6 to 7 p.m. the confirmation page showed that the local court had received a document of six pages from the applicant’s lawyer at 6.59 p.m. on 24 august 2011 the competent judge was informed that the fax from the applicant’s lawyer had been saved in the fax machine’s memory, but had not been printed out.11.  on 14 november 2011 the higher court dismissed the appeal, noting that the local court had received the documentation that had been lodged by mail only on 29 june 2011. it held that the appeal allegedly lodged on 28 june 2011 by fax would have been regarded as within the prescribed time-limit only if it had been delivered to the court before its expiry.she pointed out that section 112 of the civil procedure act allowed the submission of an application by fax and that according to the existing case-law of the supreme court an application was deemed to be submitted in due time if delivered to the competent court before the expiry of the time-limit regardless of how it was subsequently handled by the court, which was a matter of the court’s internal organisation.hence, she argued that the date when the fax had been sent should be considered as the date the appeal had been lodged and that she should not be made to bear the burden of proof in a case where the document had not been printed out by the court.furthermore, as regards her failure to prove the content of the fax that had been sent to the local court on 28 june 2011, the applicant submitted: firstly, that the confirmation page from her lawyer’s fax machine had showed the date of the transmission, the number of pages sent and the time it had taken to deliver the document to the receiving machine; secondly, on the following day, 29 june 2011, the applicant had lodged the relevant document by registered mail which, according to her, proved that the document in question was in fact the appeal against the judgment of 24 may 2011. the applicant added that, according to information given to her by a telecommunications company and a fax-machine manufacturer, it was not possible to prove the content of a document sent by fax as those transmissions were encrypted.
6.  on 29 november 2007 the volgograd regional court upheld the judgment of the town court in the applicant’s absence, without addressing the issue of whether he had been notified.on 19 may 2009 the neyskiy district court of the kostroma region examined the case in the applicant’s presence and satisfied his claim in part.the government stated that on 10 august 2009 the kostroma regional court had sent a judicial summons to the applicant by regular mail and had also called the telephone number listed in his statement of claim.12.  on 19 august 2009 the kostroma regional court quashed the district court’s judgment and dismissed the applicant’s claim in his absence, without examining the issue of whether he had been notified.three postal notices were then sent to the applicant inviting him to pick up the letter from the post office: on 18 and 24 october and 7 november 2011. according to the applicant he received the postal notice only on 11 november 2011.
commissioned an expert report, to be prepared by the forensic bureau (биро за судски вештачења) (“the bureau”), regarding the reasons for the accident, the speed at which the applicant had been driving at the relevant time, whether the accident could have been avoided, and other relevant matters.finally, he stated that he hoped that the president of the trial court would ask the president of the štip court of appeal (“the appellate court”) to assign the case to another first-instance court.19.  the trial continued, and on the same day the applicant lodged a fresh application for exclusion of judge t.d., given that he had presided over the three-judge panel which had dismissed the applicant’s objection to the indictment (see paragraph 15 above).the third expert report was identical to the first and contradictory to the second, as regards the speed at which the applicant had been driving at the time of the accident.according to the statements given by the judges, the president of the court of first instance took a decision ... by which he dismissed the application for exclusion, for reasons stated in the decision.” 29.  the appellate court further held that the second expert report had not been ordered by the court, that the experts had not been warned of their duties and had not taken an oath, that the court had not established which matters should have been addressed by the report, and that it was for the trial court to decide whether it would accept the report.
on the same day police examined the scene of the accident, questioned s. and several other witnesses.7.  on 9 june 2006 the komsomolsk prosecutor’s office refused to institute criminal proceedings against s. this refusal was quashed on 14 june 2006 by the same office and instructions were given as to further investigative actions.in particular, the police were instructed to find and examine the direct witness of the accident who was an employee of the komsomolsk department of state postal service (later it turned out to be b.).11.  from april 2007 until october 2009 the investigation was terminated on numerous occasions for lack of corpus delicti in the actions of s. subsequently it was resumed by the investigator (in november 2007) or the above decisions were quashed by higher prosecutor’s office, due to various omissions in the investigation and with instructions to carry out further actions with a view to collecting evidence.18.  on 25 june and 31 october 2013 the poltava regional court of appeal and the higher specialised civil and criminal court upheld the judgment of 4 april 2013.
she sought a retraction – in the form of the publication of a court judgment in her favour – of the allegedly false statements made in the article concerning her alleged acquisition of a flat,.we don’t have many stars, like ganna german, [whose worth is] that of a flat in kyiv.” 12.  the court found that the plaintiff had not requested or received a flat in her capacity as a member of parliament; she had bought her own flat in 2001, before she had been elected.13.  relying in particular on the provisions of the civil code and of the information act and referring to the constitutional provision guaranteeing respect for private life (see paragraphs 20 and 21 below), the court ordered the applicant company to retract this information by publishing the operative part of its judgment and to pay the plaintiff 1,700 ukrainian hryvnias (uah, approximately 300 euros (eur) at the time) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.for the applicant company, the lack of coherence in the plaintiff’s demand that a subjective opinion be retracted was illustrated by the fact that the plaintiff and the first-instance court had been unable to formulate a specific statement of retraction and had resorted to the requirement to publish the text of the judgment itself.72713/01, 29 march 2005), and de haes and gijsels v. belgium (24 february 1997, reports of judgments and decisions 1997‑i), arguing that according to the court’s case-law the limits of acceptable criticism were wider with regard to a politician than in relation to a private individual and that such criticism could include recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation.
7.  in 1981 the göttingen regional court quashed the judgment of the hildesheim regional court of 1977. it convicted the applicant of intentionally committing offences while in a drunken state and sentenced him to one year and eight months’ imprisonment, without ordering his detention in a psychiatric hospital.the court, having regard to the findings of a psychiatric expert and the results of a re-examination of the applicant’s brain by new technical means, found that he did not suffer and had never suffered from a pathological mental disorder.following its own critical review, it endorsed the conclusions about the applicant’s mental condition which s., an experienced and reliable expert in the field of forensic psychiatry, had drawn in his report dated 26 may 2010 and supplemented on 24 april 2011. the expert had completed his report on the basis of case files, as the applicant had refused an examination.s. had stated that, just as at the time of his offences, the applicant still suffered from a dissocial personality disorder with marked psychopathic elements, as defined by the relevant tool for the classification of diseases, the icd-10 (international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems in its current, revised version).having regard to the fact that his offences – committed under the influence of alcohol – dated back twenty-seven years, that he had not drunk alcohol since then, and that the conditions of his detention had been extensively relaxed, the experts and the courts had not convincingly shown that there was a risk that he would commit a serious violent offence again if released.
the next delivery of medication, comprising 20 spasmalgon tablets, took place on 29 august 2014. the first applicant’s need for medication during this period was fully covered by the medication delivered on 2 august 2014. as to the provision of diabetic food from 5 to 23 august 2014, upon her arrival at the detention facility, the first applicant was registered on a list of diabetic detainees and was consequently provided with diabetic food during this period.on the same day she also underwent a blood test to determine her sugar level and the state of the hepatitis c. the government provided the court with copies of the results of the medical tests and examinations conducted that day.56.  on the same day she refused to undergo various medical examinations by a virologist, endocrinologist and physician from the ministry of health in the presence of the members of the joint working group on human rights and members of the public committee under the ministry of justice.79.  following the indication of the interim measure under rule 39 of the rules of court by the acting president of the section on 30 september 2014, the government responded by a letter dated 3 november 2014 submitting that the relevant domestic authorities had been immediately informed of the interim measure indicated by the court under rule 39. they further submitted that the applicants’ state of health was stable and did not require their transfer to an appropriate medical facility.81.  the reports sent by the government from november 2014 to june 2015 contained the same information in respect of the first applicant’s state of health and medical treatment as they submitted in their observations of 27 may 2015. as regards the second applicant’s state of health and medical treatment, all the reports contained the two following sentences: “over the past month, the second applicant’s state of health was under constant medical supervision, and it was assessed as satisfactory; no deterioration in his health has been noted.
furthermore, the police discovered the burnt remains of a calendar, some tampons, a student id with a stamp containing the word “law” (m. was a student at the kharkiv law academy), and a lighter.14.  on 14 april 1999 the investigator in the case instructed the police to verify whether b. and his two passengers of 18 june 1998 could have been involved in the murder and to identify the girl who had been seen with them.as regards an inspection of the car and the covers of the seats, it appears that none was carried out at the time as the investigator had to order one again on 22 february 2010. that belated inspection produced no tangible results.overall, throughout the period in question, the investigator’s instructions to the police remained the same: to identify all the possible witnesses to the murder and to verify whether any of m.’s acquaintances, or any people with a criminal record living nearby, could have been involved in it.as regards the applicant’s requests for access to the case file, they were rejected on the grounds that under the applicable procedural legislation, an aggrieved party could only have such access after the pre-trial investigation had been completed.
the vtv contained rules about contributions and entitlements in relation to both the zvk and the holiday and wage equalisation fund of the construction industry (urlaubs- und lohnausgleichskasse der bauwirtschaft, “ulak”), which jointly comprised the social welfare fund in the building industry which went by the common name “soka-bau”.8.  as the federal ministry for labour and social affairs declared the vtv generally binding (allgemeinverbindlich) pursuant to section 5 § 1 of the law on collective agreements (tarifvertragsgesetz), it was binding on all employers in the building industry, even if they did not belong to the employers’ association (section 5 § 4 of the law on collective agreements, see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 20).the applicant company was further ordered to submit copies of the wage slips issued to its employees between january 2006 and june 2007. the labour court considered that the applicant company was bound by the vtv, which was binding on all employers in the building industry even if they did not belong to one of the employers’ associations.referring to the case-law of the federal constitutional court (decision of 15 july 1980, 1 bvr 24/74, see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 27), the labour court of appeal conceded that the applicant company, which was not a member of one of the employers’ associations, had the disadvantage of not being able to assert its interests by exercising control over the activities of the social welfare fund via these associations.17.  the court of appeal finally considered that the obligatory contribution to the social welfare fund took account of the high fluctuation of employees in the building industry and served the public interest of allowing for management of the employee’s claims by the social welfare fund, thus preventing a distortion of competition.
8.  on 2 february 2001, the main shareholder of demirbank, namely cıngıllı holding a.ş., brought administrative proceedings against the banking regulation and supervision agency (bankalar düzenleme ve denetleme kurumu – hereinafter “the agency”) before the ankara administrative court, seeking a ruling setting aside the decision of 6 december 2000 to transfer demirbank to the fund.lastly, the company stated that following the transfer of the bank to the fund, a general assembly composed of the fund’s officials had exonerated the former managers of demirbank, holding that they had not been at fault in the incident leading to the bank’s transfer.12.  on 18 december 2003 the joint administrative chambers of the supreme administrative court decided to quash the decision of 3 june 2003. in its judgment, the court held that prior to ordering the transfer of demirbank to the fund, the board should have carried out an objective evaluation of the bank’s financial situation.16.  given that the transfer of demirbank to the fund had been found to be illegal by the joint administrative chambers of the supreme administrative court, on 21 april 2004 the ankara administrative court annulled the agreement entered into by the fund and hsbc on 20 september 2001. an appeal and a request for rectification lodged by the fund were rejected on 3 june 2005 and 24 february 2006 respectively.on the basis of a previous judgment it had rendered on 3 june 2003 (see paragraph 11 above), the court found that the takeover of the bank by the fund had been in accordance with section 14(3) of the banking act.
in the light of various contradictions in the statements given by the first and second applicants, their inability to answer basic questions about the respective tribes they claimed to belong to, and the second applicant’s inability to provide simple topographic details of the city and the surroundings of the place where he claimed he had grown up and/or to provide any details about the m. opposition movement (goal, members, structure, leader) for which he claimed to have been active, the deputy minister concluded that no credence could be attached to the applicants’ asylum statement.18.  on 25 august 2005, the administrative jurisdiction division granted the minister’s further appeal, quashed the judgment of the regional court and rejected the first and second applicants’ appeal against the minister’s decision of 20 june 2005. it considered that, pursuant to section 31 § 1 of the aliens act 2000 (vreemdelingenwet 2000), it was for the applicants to demonstrate as plausible those facts and circumstances which could lead to the conclusion that they were eligible for admission pursuant to the policy in force, and not for the minister to demonstrate the opposite.the same interagency statement described fgm as a violation of the right to freedom from torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, meaning that protection from fgm was provided for by various international treaties (the convention on the rights of the child and the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women), by regional treaties (the protocol to the african charter on human and people’s rights relating to the rights of women in africa, the “maputo protocol”) as well as by consensus documents published by several international organisations.the report stated that the government took its decision in accordance with an islamic fatwa on the issue: ‘the council of ministers on february 5 dropped the article (13) of the draft children’s act of 2009, which provides for the ban of female genital mutilation as part of other customs and traditions harmful to the health of the child, and after approval of the draft children’s act 2009. the cabinet decided to drop the article, which deals with female circumcision, taking into account the advisory opinion of the islamic fiqh academy, which distinguish between harmful circumcision or infibulation (pharaonic circumcision) and the circumcision of sunna, a less extensive procedure.it is, however, not possible to say that such a background will automatically lead to a finding that she is not at real risk.’ ... ‘the risk of fgm from extended family members will depend on a variety of factors, including the age and vulnerability of the woman concerned, the attitude and whereabouts of her parents and the location and “reach” of the extended family.’ ... ‘if a woman’s parents are opposed to fgm, they will normally be in a position to ensure that she does not marry a man who (or whose family) is in favour of it, regardless of the attitude of other relatives of the woman concerned.’” 31.  the “joint evaluation of the unfpa-unicef joint programme on fgm/c: accelerating change 2008–2012” in respect of sudan, published in july 2013, includes the following: “in 1983, when sharia law was introduced, the article prohibiting fgm/c was removed from the penal code.
this fact in itself, in the supreme court’s view, substantiated the risk of the applicant absconding, given that article 151 § 3 of the code of criminal procedure (“the ccp”), as in force at the material time, provided that the seriousness of an offence could constitute grounds for the imposition of pre-trial detention.10. on 25 march 2005 amendments were introduced to article 151 §§ 1 and 4 of the ccp; those amendments, inter alia, provided that, subject to assessment by the national courts, pre-trial detention should in principle only be the last resort in cases where it is demonstrated that a more lenient measure of restraint would not suffice in view of the profile of the accused and the concrete circumstances of the case in question.11.  on 18 may 2005 the investigative panel of the tbilisi district court, having heard the prosecutor’s argument that more time was needed to finalise the investigation, extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention for another two months, until 22 july 2005. the court did not address the question of whether the required investigative actions could be conducted without the applicant’s continued detention.the court also refused an offer made by the georgian labour union to post bail for the applicant in the form of bonds with an approximate value of 680,000 georgian laris (gel, approximately 248,300 euros (eur)), reasoning that, under article 168 § 3 of the ccp, persons being charged with serious offences were not subject to release on bail.12.  on 23 may 2005 the appeals chamber of the tbilisi district court upheld the order of 18 may 2005. like the lower-instance court, the appellate court did not address the possibility of imposing a more lenient measure of restraint in order to ensure the aims of the investigation.
according to the trial record, the trial unfolded as follows: (a)  only the applicant and b. were present at the opening of the trial, the prosecutor, p. and the witnesses being absent.he stated that the evidence of his guilt was “admissible and sufficient,” asked the court not to call the absent witnesses since he was ashamed of his actions, and asked the court to dispense with the examination of evidence, pursuant to article 299 of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 30 below).23.  on the same date the court of appeal quashed the sentence of the pavlograd court as unduly lenient, taking into account the seriousness of the offence and the applicant’s personality.25.  on 30 august 2005 the supreme court rejected the applicant’s appeal and found that, taking due account of the adequacy of the written evidence collected by the prosecution, the applicant’s conviction had a sufficient factual and evidentiary basis.26.  on 10 march 2009, at the request of the prosecutors’ office, the court of appeal ordered that the term of the applicant’s imprisonment be calculated from 1 june 2004 (the date of the decision to remand him in custody pending consideration of the extradition request).
the flat, purchased from the state by the applicant’s parents in 1968, had become state property after having been nationalised in the period following 1947, and denationalisation legislation adopted in the beginning of the 1990s provided that under certain circumstances even properties which had in the meantime been sold to private parties could be subject to restitution.their claim was allowed at first instance by the plovdiv district court on 24 october 2002. even though the rei vindicatio proceedings after that remained the subject of appeals, the applicant vacated the property on 10 january 2003. she moved to a house she owned in the village of hrabrino, where she registered her address on 4 february 2003.11.  without making any further attempts to find the applicant, on 26 august 2005 the plovdiv district court, after concluding that the applicant was of “unknown address”, published a notification concerning the unjust enrichment proceedings in the state gazette (article 50 § 1 of the 1952 code of civil procedure, see paragraph 18 below in fine).according to the applicant, the lawyer did not adequately defend her interests in the proceedings, because she failed to seek to contact the applicant, to appeal against the plovdiv district court’s judgment, which would have been standard practice, to make any evidentiary requests, or to contest in any meaningful manner the claimants’ arguments, including by raising what the applicant considered a valid objection that the claims against her were partially time-barred.13.  on 6 april 2006 the plovdiv district court gave judgment, allowing the claim against the applicant and ordering her to pay 3,573 bulgarian levs (bgn), plus interest, to mr and mrs p. 14.  upon an appeal by mr and mrs p., in a judgment of 10 july 2006 which was final, the plovdiv regional court ordered the applicant to pay the claimants an additional bgn 1,006.21.
the relevant part of the majority opinion reads as follows (the translation has been provided by the constitutional court): “...therefore, the provision of article 8 of the election law of bosnia and herzegovina, including article v of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina, should be viewed in the light of the discretionary right of the state to impose certain restrictions when it comes to the exercise of individual rights.there is no dispute that the provision of article v of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina, as well as the provision of article 8 of the election act 2001, have a restrictive character in that they restrict the rights of citizens, namely the candidacy of bosniacs and croats from the territory of the republika srpska and the serbs from the territory of the federation of bosnia and herzegovina to stand for election as members of the presidency of bosnia and herzegovina.it means that they serve a legitimate aim, that they are reasonably justified and that they do not place an excessive burden on the appellants given that the restrictions imposed on the appellants’ rights are proportionate to the objectives of the general community in terms of preservation of the established peace, continuation of dialogue, and consequently the creation of conditions for amending the above-mentioned provisions of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina and election act 2001.” the relevant part of the concurring opinion of judge feldman reads as follows: “i agree that the special circumstances in which the dayton agreement was drafted and the needs of the time are capable of providing a rational and objective justification for treatment which would otherwise be discriminatory...like judge grewe in her separate dissenting opinions....i regard the justification as being temporary rather than permanent, but i respectfully differ from judge grewe in thinking that the time has not yet arrived when the state will have completed its transition away from the special needs which dictated the unusual architecture of the state under the dayton agreement and the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina.the constitutional court has an express constitutional obligation to uphold the constitution, and in my opinion has no power to set aside parts of it, or make them ineffective, by relying on rights arising in an international instrument in preference to the express and unambiguous terms of the constitution itself.” the relevant part of the dissenting opinion of judge grewe, joined by judge palavrić, reads as follows: “...i respectfully differ from the conclusion that there is no violation of the appellant’s rights guaranteed by the european convention, its protocols and additional human rights agreements because of an ‘objective and reasonable justification for differential treatment’.contrary to the statements of the majority (§ 22), it seems to me that the current situation in bosnia and herzegovina does not justify at this moment the differential treatment of the appellant’s candidacy in relation to the candidacy of other candidates who are the serbs and are directly elected from the territory of the republika srpska, nor it serves a legitimate aim, such as preservation of peace, continuation of dialogue or creation of conditions for amending the provisions of the constitution of bih and election law.
the applicant requested, inter alia, that the 1946 decisions to find his father guilty of being a nazi and the subsequent decisions to expropriate him and confiscate his personal property and the property belonging to his company be declared contrary to the rule of law and hence void.for the first time the dresden regional court discusses a criminal rehabilitation application at an oral hearing.” in the press release the lawyers explained, in particular, that until that time the domestic courts had seen the objective of the measures in question as motivated by economic policy, that is, having the purpose of modifying the prevailing ownership structure.the date for a hearing, according to section 11 § 3, second sentence, of the criminal rehabilitation act (see paragraph 13 below) had been set to give the applicant the opportunity to illustrate (erläutern) his legal opinion, which conflicted with that of the regional court and the dresden court of appeal and was supported by particularly extensive factual submissions.in fact, the scheduling of the hearing had been used to create the impression in a press release, also published on the internet, that by calling a hearing the regional court had indicated that it was abandoning its settled case-law.contrary to the applicant’s submission, nothing indicated that an arrest warrant had been issued in 1947. the applicant’s father’s loss of his electoral rights, his business licence and his personal assets had been a necessary consequence of the expropriation.
the court noted as follows: “[the applicant] is charged with a serious offence representing an increased danger to society; the material submitted contains sufficient data about [his] involvement in the crime, including the testimony of the victim ... [the applicant] is an acting police officer, and under such circumstances the court finds that the prosecutor has made a well-founded argument about the necessity to isolate [the applicant] in view of the risk of [his] absconding and obstructing the establishment of the truth in the early stage of the investigation by putting pressure on witnesses using his [status].” 9.  on 25 june 2004 the astrakhan regional court (“the regional court”) upheld the above decision on appeal.the sanction for the offence with which [the applicant] is charged varies from 5 to 10 years’ imprisonment; therefore the arguments of the prosecution that [the applicant] may abscond from justice and render the examination of the case on the merits impossible are well-founded.” 16.  on 7 april 2005 the district court dismissed the application for release and extended the applicant’s detention pending trial for another two months, until 16 june 2005. the decision mentioned that an appeal could be lodged within three days to the regional court and the applicant appealed.20.  on 15 december 2005 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 15 march 2006. the court again relied on the gravity of the charges against the applicant, his position and the risk of his putting pressure on the victim and witnesses, and of absconding and obstructing justice.35.  a medical certificate issued by the applicant’s dentist (who had provided dental care to the applicant since 2001, up to his detention) confirmed in january 2009 that there were no traces of dental care having been provided to the applicant in the period between june 2004 and january 2009 and noted a serious worsening of the state of the latter’s teeth.42.  the applicant brought the issue of inadequate medical assistance before various domestic authorities, including the head of the remand prison, the astrakhan regional prosecutor’s office, the ombudsman and a judge of the district court, but all to no avail.
the translation into lithuanian of this judgment had been received by the applicant on 7 july 2012. as regards the arguments put forward in the cassation appeal, the court stated that the applicant had been detained on remand and had therefore had to be accompanied by guards during the meetings with the lawyer which had taken place during recesses in the trial court hearing.the court further noted that the requirements of article 6 of the convention had been fulfilled as the applicant had had translations of the most important documents necessary for his comprehension of the case, even if not the entire file.they further indicated that the security of all transfers of the applicant be strengthen “given the character and the manner in which the offences had been committed and the fact that [the applicant] had previously practiced box and combat techniques”.in the requests for extension of the regime issued prior to each decision of the commission, the director of the remand centre emphasised the violent nature of the crimes which the applicant had allegedly committed.in addition to that, the applicant submitted that he had appealed against the decision of 4 august 2011 which was dismissed on 11 october 2011. on 26 march 2012 the białystok regional court dismissed his appeal against the decision of the commission issued on 27 january 2012. the domestic courts examined the legality of the impugned decisions and found that they had been given in accordance with the law and after a thorough analysis of the case.
14.  on 29 march 2004 the expert examined the scene of the accident in the presence of the driver and the applicant.the expert appointed by the driver agreed with the report, while the expert appointed by the applicant drafted a dissenting opinion concluding that the fault lay entirely with the driver, who had turned his car without paying attention.17.  on 31 january 2005 the prosecutor’s office attached to the bucharest district court decided not to prosecute the driver, since the fault of the accident lay entirely with the applicant.26.  the applicant’s complaint against the prosecutors’ decisions was allowed by the bucharest district court on 8 may 2007. the court held that the investigative authorities had failed to follow the instructions given in the previous judgment of 4 august 2005. the judgment became final on 26 september 2007 when an appeal on points of law by the prosecutor was dismissed by the bucharest county court.she considered that the prosecutor was liable for the excessive delays in the investigation which had triggered the expiry of the limitation period for the crime committed against her.
11.  on 5 july 2005 the applicant filed an administrative complaint against the decision of 22 september 2003. this complaint was dismissed by the inss on 11 august 2005. the inss noted that there was no provision in the legislation in force that allowed, for the purposes of social security rights, the person who had been cohabiting with the deceased to gain the status of a widower.the social tribunal then reiterated that, according to the well-established domestic case-law, surviving partners of unmarried couples were not entitled to a survivor’s pension under section 174 of the general social security act, marriage being a constitutive element to access any such social-security benefit; that the applicant had been prevented from marrying his partner because same-sex marriage had not been recognised in domestic law at the time his partner died; that the social security administration had relied on the fact that the couple had not married to refuse the applicant a survivor’s pension; and that it was evident that after the entry into force of law no.30/1981 of 7 july 1981 amending the provisions of the civil code pertaining to marriage and the procedure to be followed for cases of annulment, judicial separation and divorce, recognised the right to obtain a survivor’s pension for individuals who had been prevented from marrying a person who later died by the legislation in force until then, provided that he or she had cohabited in a relationship similar to marriage with the deceased person and that the deceased had died before law no.30/1981, the right thereby recognised shall currently be interpreted as providing a solution to factual situations such as the one in the instant case in which the impediment to access to a survivor’s pension is no other than the sexual orientation [of the claimant].” 19.  as regards the administration’s submission that in the area of social security benefits the governing principle was that of non-retroactivity of laws and that according to the law in force at the time the applicant’s partner died the former did not qualify for a survivor’s pension because they were not married, the social tribunal was of the view that this general principle was not absolute and that it did not apply where there was a specific rule giving retroactive effect to laws more favourable to the citizens, as is true of the instant case.in a decision of 27 june 2007, the supreme court (social chamber) declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that the decision produced for purposes of comparison, specifically a judgment of the high court of justice of the canary islands of 7 november 2003, was not relevant.
9.  the table shown was based on the competition and consumer rights office report and consisted of four columns listing the town, the name of the company running the station and information on the quality of the diesel and petrol sold there.the facts of the case which the court had established on the basis of the case file of the civil proceedings were not in dispute between the parties.he argued, inter alia, that his conviction had been incompatible with article 10 of the convention in so far as the court had failed to address substantive issues arising under this provision in the case, including the case-law of the court; that the issues raised by him had been the subject of an ongoing public debate, a fact which had not been sufficiently taken into consideration by the court; that the information contained in the article had consisted merely of data relayed from an official document prepared by the state; that it had not been for the applicant to assess the veracity of this information; that he had therefore had a right to assume that it had been true and had therefore not been obliged to contact the owner of the station prior to the article’s publication.26.  in so far as the applicant relied on the case-law of the court, the regional court observed that the polish courts, as in any other continental jurisdiction, were not bound by the judgments of the court as the polish legal system was not based on precedent.according to the appellate court, although it shared the applicant’s views based on the court’s case law on the freedom of expression presented in his appeal, those views were not relevant for the adjudication of the case (nie mają one znaczenia dla rozstrzygnięcia niniejszej sprawy) the applicant’s point in this matter had therefore been wholly erroneous (całkowicie chybiony).
71256/11) against hungary lodged with the court under article 34 of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms (“the convention”) by six hungarian nationals, mr lászló haraszthy, mr györgy lászló márton, mr gábor horn, ms nóra siska, mr zoltán pintér and ms  mária  terézia  oszter (“the applicants”), on 11 november 2011.1 to the convention concerning the imposition of 98% tax on their severance payment were communicated to the government.4.  on 9 november 2015 and 4 january 2016 the court received friendly settlement declarations signed by the government and by five applicants under which these five applicants agreed to waive any further claims against hungary in respect of the facts giving rise to their complaints against an undertaking by the government to pay mr lászló haraszthy eur 12,800 (twelve thousand eight hundred euros), mr görgy lászló márton eur 3,200 (three thousand two hundred euros), mr gábor horn eur 1,000 (one thousand euros), ms nóra siska eur 5,300 (five thousand three hundred euros) and mr zoltán pintér eur 7,100 (seven thousand one hundred euros) to cover any pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage as well as costs and expenses, which will be converted into hungarian forints at the rate applicable on the date of payment, and will be free of any taxes that may be applicable.in the event of failure to pay this sum within the said three-month period, the government undertook to pay simple interest on it, from the expiry of that period until settlement, at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage points.the payment will constitute the final resolution of the case in respect of these five applicants.
moreover, there was also the fact that the applicant had to a great extent returned the money he had embezzled, a fact which, although the psc had said that it had taken it into account, did not appear to have affected its decision, since the punishment imposed on the applicant was, of the ten forms provided for, the extreme one of dismissal instead of choosing the second most serious form of punishment, that of compulsory retirement, which would not have entailed the loss of retirement rights.28.  in the end, however, the supreme court considered that the fact that the case in question arose and was heard on the basis of a different statutory regime from that in azinas as regards the consequences of dismissal entailing the loss of pension rights, tilted the scales, albeit slightly, in favour of the republic.29.  finally, the supreme court stressed that the competent bodies should seriously study the possibility of amending the statutory framework on the basis of the law in force in england, so that deprivation of retirement rights was not automatic but could be looked at with the help of enacted procedures and with the exercise of discretion in order that the psc might determine, by means of a reasoned decision, the extent to which it was just to forfeit, if at all, in any particular case, according to the individual’s special circumstances and needs.81/2007) challenging the first-instance findings (a) that in the present case the retirement benefits could be considered a “possession”; (b) that in the disciplinary dismissal of a public servant there was no enacted framework providing for the exercise of discretion as to whether the retirement benefits would be granted; and (c) that the payment of the pension to the applicant’s wife was the only essential factor which tilted the scales in favour of the republic.finally, it pointed out that the first-instance court had set out in its decision all the facts which it had taken into account in deciding on the proportionality of the forfeiture, and had rightly concluded that the payment of the pension to the wife meant that the deprivation was not disproportionate.
it further referred to the risk that the first applicant might continue his criminal activities on the grounds that, having been released on parole on 17 june 2005, he had been apprehended three days later on suspicion of an offence similar to that for which he already had a conviction.the government further claimed that the second applicant was interviewed as a witness between 3.10 p.m. and 4.20 p.m., and that the identification parade during which he was identified by the victim took place between 10.25 p.m. and 10.33 p.m. at 11.25 p.m. he was arrested as a criminal suspect and ten minutes later an arrest record was drawn up.19.  at 6.25 p.m. on 13 april 2005 the gus-khrustalnyy town court of the vladimir region (hereinafter “the town court”) remanded the second applicant in custody on the basis of article 108 of the russian code of criminal procedure (hereinafter “the ccrp”) (see paragraph 34 below).it found that he was suspected of having committed a serious criminal offence, had been identified by the victim, had escaped from the scene of the crime, did not work and had a recent criminal record, and that for those reasons he might abscond, reoffend, influence the victim and the other parties to the proceedings, destroy evidence, or otherwise obstruct the proper administration of justice.21.  on 16 may 2005 the vladimir regional court (“the regional court”) upheld the order of 13 april 2005. it considered that the second applicant had been apprehended as indicated in the arrest record.
the subsequent medical report stated that no traces of irritation had been found on the applicant’s skin and that, according to the applicant himself, the main reason why he wanted to grow a beard was that his electric razor was almost broken and he could not afford to buy a new one.on 23 october 2007 the prison department denied the applicant’s request, based on the results of the examination.9.  the applicant later submitted another request to grow a beard to the prison department, and on 19 november 2007 it was denied on the same grounds.however, it dismissed the prison department’s argument that the prohibition on beards was necessary for the purpose of the swift identification of prisoners, and held that such a restriction was contrary to the requirement to reintegrate prisoners into society.accordingly, the court concluded that the prohibition on the applicant having a beard was against the law and was neither necessary nor proportionate.
5.  on 30 june 2004 the darnytskyy district court of kyiv found that the applicant had committed the following crimes: appropriation of private property by means of fraud or abuse of trust, theft of property and theft of official documents.6.  on 23 december 2004 the applicant’s conviction was upheld by the kyiv court of appeal.7.  on 31 may 2005 a three-judge panel of the supreme court considered the applicant’s appeal on points of law in accordance with article 394 § 2 of the code of criminal procedure (by virtue of which it could either dismiss the appeal or assign the case for further consideration with the participation of all the parties).having regard to his opinion and the material in the case file, the panel dismissed the appeal as unsubstantiated.8.  in a letter dated 12 september 2005 the supreme court notified the applicant, enclosing a copy of its decision.
prior to the assemblies, on 18 march 2011 and 15 october 2012 respectively the organisers, members of the opposition, gave notice to the relevant authority, the baku city executive authority (“the bcea”).6.  the bcea refused to authorise the demonstrations at the places indicated by the organisers and proposed a different location on the outskirts of baku – the yard of a driving school situated in the 20th habitable area of the sabail district.the reports stated that by deliberately failing to comply with a lawful order of the police, the applicant had committed an administrative offence under article 310.1 of the code of administrative offences (“the cao”).13.  on the day of his arrest, namely 2 april 2011 in the first case and 20 october 2012 in the second case, the applicant was brought before a first-instance court, the nasimi district court and the binagadi district court respectively.18.  according to the transcript of the court hearing in the second case, in his oral submissions the state-funded lawyer briefly asked the court to impose on the applicant a light punishment in view of his young age.
once the applicants left the ussr, the payments were discontinued in accordance with the ussr pension law in force at the material time.7.  on 4 august 2006 the applicants brought civil proceedings against the competent regional department of the pension fund of the russian federation (пенсионный фонд российской федерации) (hereinafter “the pension fund”) seeking reinstatement of their right to the pension payments.11.  on 27 july 2007 a judge of the supreme court requested the case file from the district court and subsequently suspended enforcement of the judgment of 4 december 2006.15.  on 24 june 2008 a judge of the supreme court sent the case for supervisory review by the civil chamber of the supreme court.16.  on 1 august 2008 the civil chamber of supreme court quashed the judgment of 4 december 2006, as upheld on 12 january 2007, and rejected the applicants’ claims.
5.  avtokolonna 1126 was set up in accordance with a decision of the administration of the town of petrozavodsk (“the town administration”), and provided public transport services in the town on a commercial basis.in accordance with several agreements between the company and the town administration, the company undertook to provide certain sections of the population with transport services free of charge, and the town administration was to reimburse it for the expenses incurred out of the budget allocated for that purpose by the ministry of finance of the republic of kareliya or the federal budget.in 2004 the town administration asked the legislative body of the republic of kareliya to consider allocating additional funds to cover the company’s debt, but to no avail.6.  on an unspecified date the town administration ordered the restructuring of the company in the form of a spin-off as a new entity, and transferred the assets mentioned in paragraph 5 above to the newly created municipal unitary enterprise “avtokolonna 1126 plus”.8.  on 10 april 2006 a justice of the peace of the 11th court circuit of petrozavodsk ordered the company to pay the applicant rub 614 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.
paragraph 23 of resolution 1483 (2003) reads as follows: “the security council ... decides that all member states in which there are: (a)  funds or other financial assets or economic resources of the previous government of iraq or its state bodies, corporations, or agencies, located outside iraq as of the date of this resolution, or (b)  funds or other financial assets or economic resources that have been removed from iraq, or acquired, by saddam hussein or other senior officials of the former iraqi regime and their immediate family members, including entities owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by them or by persons acting on their behalf or at their direction, shall freeze without delay those funds or other financial assets or economic resources and, unless these funds or other financial assets or economic resources are themselves the subject of a prior judicial, administrative, or arbitral lien or judgement, immediately shall cause their transfer to the development fund for iraq, it being understood that, unless otherwise addressed, claims made by private individuals or non-government entities on those transferred funds or other financial assets may be presented to the internationally recognized, representative government of iraq; and decides further that all such funds or other financial assets or economic resources shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities, and protections as provided under paragraph 22.”[1] 15.  the iraq ordinance of 7 august 1990 underwent numerous amendments, in particular on 30 october 2002, following the entry into force of the federal law of 22 march 2002 on the application of international sanctions (the embargo act, in force since 1 january 2003), and on 28 may 2003, to take account of resolution 1483 (2003).in support of their submissions, they argued that the confiscation of their assets breached the property right guaranteed by article 26 of the federal constitution and that the procedure leading to the addition of their names to the lists provided for by resolution 1483 (2003) and annexed to the iraq ordinance had breached the basic procedural safeguards enshrined in article 14 of the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr) of 16 december 1966, in articles 6 and 13 of the convention and in articles 29 to 32 of the federal constitution.5.4  company s. sa and [the first applicant] appear on the lists of entities and individuals drawn up by the 1518 sanctions committee under number ... for the company and ... for the latter, on the ground that its managing director is [the first applicant], the head of finance, at the time, of the iraqi secret services, who also controls the companies h., k. sa and m. [the second applicant], three entities entrusted with the management of the assets of the former regime and its high-ranking members.9.2  in those circumstances, contrary to what the appellant has claimed, the implementation of resolution 1483 (2003) requires switzerland to adhere strictly to the measures introduced and to the decisions of the 1518 sanctions committee, which, unless found by the security council to be in breach of jus cogens norms, does not leave any room, even on the grounds of ensuring the procedural safeguards provided for in the european convention on human rights, the international covenant on civil and political rights or the swiss constitution, for an examination of the procedure by which the appellant’s name was added to the list issued by the 1518 sanctions committee, or for verification of the justification for such addition.the federal court finds, however, that, in the context of switzerland’s power and freedom of implementation (see point 10.2), the authority below should grant the appellant a brief and final period of time, before implementing the decision of 16 november 2006 – which enters into force with the dismissal of the present appeal – to allow him to apply, should he so wish, to the 1518 sanctions committee for a new delisting procedure in accordance with the improved arrangements of resolution 1730 (2006) of 19 december 2006, the appellant not having had the opportunity to make use of the latter because he wrongly placed all his hopes in the present administrative-law appeal.
notably, given that [the applicant] is indicted for an aggravated murder pursuant to article 144 § 1 (a) and (4) of the criminal code, and in view of the seriousness of the criminal offence for which he could be sentenced to between 10 and 40 years of imprisonment, and especially in view of the fact that the accused committed the said criminal offence on 17 february 2011 at around 21.30, after which he fled the crime scene, and that the authorised police officers of the police directorate – podgorica unit deprived him of liberty on 19 february 2011 at 13.00, these are the reasons, in view of the panel, justifying the extension of detention pursuant to article 175 § 1 (1) of the criminal procedure code.in the opinion of this panel [the applicant’s] detention should be extended also pursuant to the detention basis as provided in article 175 § 1 (4) of the criminal procedure code, given that [the applicant] is charged with aggravated murder under article 144 § 1 (1) and (4) of the criminal code, and having in mind that the provided sentence is between 10 and 40 years of imprisonment, the first condition for the extension of detention under article 175 § 1 (4) of the criminal procedure code is fulfilled, that is that the provided sentence for the criminal offence is 10 years or more.furthermore, in this particular case there are particularly qualifying circumstances of the criminal offence at issue due to the manner in which it was committed or its consequences, which are reflected in the fact that [the applicant], as it transpires from the case-file, [...] in an insidious manner and for material gain, deprived x of his life [...] by shooting him at close range in the chest and in the back with an automatic gun several times, inflicting on him numerous injuries and causing his immediate death, after which he fled, and according to this panel the aforementioned established facts and circumstances, in their entirety, represent extraordinary circumstances indicating that the [applicant’s] release would threaten public order and peace, which reasons justify the extension of detention.” 11.  on 26 september 2011 the applicant appealed, complaining about the manner in which the decision had been served on him and claiming that his detention had ended on 17 september 2011, that is two months as of the last extension of detention.from the subsequent decision of the constitutional court (see paragraph 18 below), however, it transpires that the court of appeals held, in particular, that: (a) the applicant’s detention had not ended on 17 september 2011, as the previous detention order had not specified how long the detention would last and the statutory time-limit of two months was not mandatory (see paragraphs 33 and 34 below); and (b) the absence of the stamp and signature on the detention order did not make it unlawful.the court also held that the high court and the court of appeals had not stated that the applicant was guilty but that it transpired from the case-file and the disputed decisions that the applicant had been charged with the relevant criminal offence.
14. the applicant submitted that after his admission to the detention facility the police officers who had allegedly beaten him up after the arrest had again driven him to the police station for questioning, had handcuffed him to a heating unit and had left him in that position until late evening.16.  in january 2006 the investigating authorities charged the applicant with a robbery committed on 25 november 2005. they also asked the district court to extend the applicant’s detention pending investigation, claiming that the case was complex and that more time was necessary to complete the investigation.24.  having heard the parties, the court ordered the applicant’s detention pending trial and stated that the trial was to be held in his absence, as the personal participation of persons suffering from a mental disorder was not provided for by the russian code of criminal procedure for cases such as the one to be decided.33.  in 2012 the belgorod regional prosecutor’s office applied to the presidium of the belgorod regional court for supervisory review of the case referring to the breach of the applicant’s right to defence.35.  on 11 october 2012 the presidium of the belgorod regional court acknowledged a violation of the applicant’s right to defence, quashed the judgment of 3 may 2006 and remitted the case to the oktyabrskiy regional court for a fresh examination on the merits.
13.  on 27 december 2006 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 14 march 2007. despite arguments by the defence that his health was fragile and that he was unable to receive the necessary care in the detention facility, which did not employ a proctologist, the court, after examining medical evidence submitted by the prosecution, found that his health condition did not call for his release.17.  on 14 march 2007 the regional court upheld the detention order, stressing that the accused’s health was not the decisive factor in the assessment of the need for detention.six days later, at the request of the applicant’s lawyer, the head of the colorectal department of the state regional civilian hospital, dr n., examined the applicant in the remand prison and found his condition to be moderately serious.37.  on 2 february 2007, again at the initiative of the applicant’s lawyer, a senior doctor from the state regional civilian hospital, dr z., visited him and recorded a further deterioration of his health in the form of an inflammation of the prolapsed part of his bowels.53.  on 23 november 2007, following receipt from the government of information on the applicant’s state of health, the court decided to apply rule 39 and to draw the russian government’s attention to the urgent necessity of the applicant having the following medical procedures: colorectal surgery in a specialist hospital, an x-ray computed tomography, as well as a surgical puncture of the space-occupying lesion of the liver.
11.  the applicant stated that, even though he was a non-smoker and had been assigned to a non-smoking cell, the prison authorities had also detained inmates who smoked all the time in that cell.12. the applicant also stated that some of the detainees who had occasionally shared the cell with him had had contagious diseases, such as hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), or had been drug addicts.also, during the summer, running water had only been available six hours a day and not at all during the night, even if the detainees had needed to use the toilet.the applicant had had his own bed and at no time during his detention had the number of detainees exceeded the number of beds available in the cells.26.  the national prisons agency informed the government that, during his detention in rahova prison, the applicant had been provided with a diet appropriate for muslims, and any pork had been replaced with beef.
6.  on 16 february 2009 the applicant’s statement was taken by the istanbul assize court and she was released on the same day.on 19 february 2009 the public prosecutor lodged an objection to this decision and on 23 february 2009 the istanbul assize court issued an arrest warrant against the applicant.8.  on 4 april 2009 the public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment, charging the applicant with using drugs and providing drugs to third persons under articles 188 § 3, 188 § 4 and 191 § 1 of the criminal code.9.  on 15 may 2009 and 24 june 2009 respectively the istanbul assize court on the basis of the case file dismissed release requests lodged by the applicant.on 9 june 2009 and 21 july 2009 respectively the istanbul assize court further dismissed the objections lodged by the applicant against the above-mentioned decisions, without holding oral hearings.
he asked the general inspectorate to investigate the alleged facts, stating as follows: “in the month of december 2008 the coimbra [national republican guard] territorial group distributed money to the territorial posts of its area of command ... for the christmas dinner ... the only members of the military [in arganil] who attended the dinner were the commander of the post and corporal m.; the total amount of money that had been given to the military from the [territorial] post [to pay for the dinner] was paid to the restaurant’s manager in exchange for a receipt ... it seems that the commander has since then been going with his family to the mentioned restaurant, where the cost of his meals is deducted from the money that was not spent [on the above dinner] ... note: i have just become aware of this matter through rumours within the military of the mentioned post, who claim that they have not reported the situation for fear of reprisals, and because of that [fear of reprisals] i ask you for secrecy during the investigation because i am also a member of the military ...” 8.  on an unknown date the general inspectorate of internal administration forwarded the email to the general command of the national republican guard (comando geral da guarda nacional republicana) and to the lousã public prosecutor’s office (ministério público).at the request of the official in charge of the inquiry on the grounds that the management of the cafeteria of the arganil territorial post showed signs of lack of transparency which required further investigation.the court described its findings of fact and the manner in which it had assessed the evidence, and held as follows: “... since the existence of such a rumor has not been proved in any way, the court is fully convinced that the defendant’s intention was to undermine the honour of the offended party, once he knew that this was just a rumour and that therefore he was making an allegation that was not true.indeed, by submitting that the offended party and his family were using the existing credit to have dinner at the mentioned restaurant, the defendant knew that he was accusing the offended party of a dishonorable deed, all the more because he knew that the offended party was in charge of the national republican guard’s arganil territorial post.the relevant passage of the report reads as follows: “... the defendant breached the duty of loyalty... as being on duty and being part of the góis territorial post in the quality of deputy commander of the post, he did not inform his hierarchical superiors, in clear disregard of the functional hierarchy principles, of the acts allegedly committed ...” 21.  in the report it was also taken into account that the applicant’s allegations had been investigated by different authorities, all of which had discontinued their investigations.
5. on 23 july 2007 the i̇zmir assize court decided to restrict access to the investigation file, under article 153 § 2 of the code of criminal procedure (the “ccp”), law no.they did not deny that they had had telephone conversations that had been intercepted, or that they had accepted the transfer of parcels and had possessed firearms, all of which were deemed to be evidence of making threats, of fraud and of smuggling, the offences that they were suspected of having committed.8.  on 1 august 2007 the applicants’ representative objected to the order for the pre‑trial detention in respect of the first four applicants.those applications were dismissed by the i̇zmir assize court on 4 february 2008, 11 february 2008 and 14 february 2008 respectively based the nature of the criminal charges and the state of the evidence.9.  on 13 march 2008 the public prosecutor at the i̇zmir assize court filed an indictment, charging the first applicant with establishing a criminal organisation and the other applicants with being members of a criminal organisation.
following adversarial proceedings where both parties were represented by a lawyer, the applicant’s marriage was annulled by a judgment of 19 january 1998. the court delivering the judgment was satisfied (to the degree necessary in civil proceedings, namely on a balance of probabilities) that the applicant’s only reason for marrying had been to remain in malta and acquire citizenship; thus he was positively excluding marriage itself, and there had been a simulation of marriage.24.  by a letter dated 2 august 2007 from the director of the department of citizenship and expatriate affairs, the applicant was informed that the minister of justice and internal affairs had concluded that the applicant had obtained citizenship by fraudulent means and that therefore on 31 july 2007, in accordance with article 14(1) of the act, the minister had ordered that he be immediately divested of his citizenship.in that connection, it rejected the applicant’s contention that the revocation of citizenship affected his right to a family life and therefore was civil in nature, as citizenship was a matter of public law and fell under the prerogatives of the state.it also reversed the part of the judgment in respect of article 8, commenting that it had not been established that the applicant had a family life in malta, and, even if this were so, the revocation of his citizenship would not necessarily result in his having to leave malta.28.  following the lodging of the application with the court, on 16 november 2012 the applicant’s lawyer wrote to the relevant authorities informing them that the case was pending before the court and that therefore no action should be taken on the basis of the order of 31 july 2007. no feedback, apart from an acknowledgment of receipt, was received concerning that letter.
7.  by a judgment of 25 january 2007 the iaşi district court, acting as a court of first instance, allowed the applicant’s action on the merits and declared the two contracts null and void.8.  by a decision of 21 november 2007 the iaşi county court, sitting as a bench of two judges, allowed the third party’s appeal on the merits, quashed the judgment of 25 january 2007 and dismissed the applicant’s action.9.  by a final decision of 2 june 2008 the iaşi court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as inadmissible, without commenting on the merits of the case.the applicant had estimated the value of the disputed property to be ron 9,000. therefore, the judgment delivered by the district court could only be challenged by way of an appeal on points of law.moreover, the decision of the iaşi county court was final, even if the county court had erred and examined the applicant’s case in a composition of two rather than three judges.
(b)  the abduction of the applicants’ relative 7.  at about 1 p.m. on 2 may 2012 mr kamil mutayev and his twelve‑year old son muradis were driving in their vaz-21099 car in shamil street in the centre of the town of kizilyurt, dagestan, when they were blocked by two silver-coloured vaz priora cars with heavily tinted windows, one of which had an official registration number containing the digits “78”.10.  in reply to the court’s first request for a copy of the contents of the investigation file, the government provided documents from the file, amounting to 43 pages, which showed the steps taken by the investigators from 14 may to 27 june 2012.11.  in reply to the court’s second and third requests for a copy of the contents of the investigation file, the government submitted copies of its contents, some 688 pages long, which showed the steps taken by the investigators from the beginning of the proceedings to 15 august 2015. from the documents submitted, the investigation can be summarised as follows.13.  on 2 may 2012 the police questioned the second applicant who provided a detailed account of the events similar to the one submitted to the court and stated that she had learnt of mr kamil mutayev’s abduction from her nephew muradis.15.  on 2 and then on 10 may 2012 the police questioned mr kamil mutayev’s son muradis, whose account of the events was similar to that submitted by the applicants to the court.
the court reasoned as follows: “it can be seen in [the judgment of the supreme court] that the verdict was quashed in view of breaches of the rules of criminal procedure by both defendants, which influenced the opinion of the jury.therefore, the court considers that, if released, [the applicants] might interfere with the establishment of the truth and the administration of justice by putting pressure on witnesses.regard being had to the above, to the gravity of the charges and in order to ensure compliance with the objectives of the criminal proceedings, the court grants the prosecutor’s request to remand [the applicants] in custody.” 12.  on 20 september 2005 the supreme court upheld the decision of 29 july 2005 on appeal.in the operative part of the judgment, the court noted that the applicants had a right to rehabilitation and could apply for compensation in respect of pecuniary damage by bringing a claim to the court which delivered the judgment in their criminal case.16.  on an unspecified date a criminal case was opened against the first applicant on multiple charges, including the use of violence against a law‑enforcement officer and the destruction of official documents.
11.  in reply to the court’s requests for a copy of the contents of the investigation file, the government submitted partial copies of its contents, some 639 pages in total, which showed the steps taken by the investigators from march 2012 to october 2015. from the documents submitted, the investigation can be summarised as follows.20.  on 6 april 2012 the sunzhenskiy district court granted the investigators permission to obtain the phone records for the period between 1st and 30 march 2012 of the mobile telephones of the four employees of the water-pumping station, mr abubakar tsechoyev, mr a.a., mr k.kh and mr i.g.the decision stated that the investigation had four theories concerning the reasons for the abduction: the abduction had been perpetrated due to the hostile relationship between the perpetrators and mr abubakar tsechoyev; he had been arrested by state agents; he had become a member of an illegal armed group; his alleged abduction had been staged by his accomplices in that illegal armed group.38.  on unspecified dates in 2012 (the pages with the dates and the names of the persons questioned were not furnished to the court) the investigators questioned twelve police officers who had been manning checkpoint assa situated between the settlement of nesterovskaya in ingushetia and the settlement of assinovskaya in chechnya between 11 p.m. on 22 march and 11 p.m. on 23 march 2012. all of the officers stated that they had checked each vehicle passing through and that on the night of the abduction they had not seen any vehicles of state agencies going through and had no information pertaining to the incident.the investigators also ignored the statement of the guard of the husbandry team who had seen that car at 5 p.m. on the day of the abduction ... i personally inspected the area and found the place where the car had pulled over leaving clear tyre tracks.
9.  the county court’s ruling contained a detailed description of the charges against the applicant and p. it further noted that the prosecutor had requested the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant and p. on the basis of article 202 of the code of criminal procedure since the offence in question had been an offence in the second degree, both the applicant and p. had been involved in it at the instigation of other persons, and neither of them had had a previous criminal record.the prosecutor requested ... the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings on the basis of article 202 of the [code of criminal procedure] since it was an offence in the second degree, the guilt of the accused was negligible, and there was no public interest in the continuation of the proceedings.article 202 § 1 [of the code of criminal procedure] provides that if the object of criminal proceedings is a criminal offence in the second degree and the guilt of the person suspected or accused of the offence is negligible, and he or she has remedied or has begun to remedy the damage caused by the criminal offence or has paid the expenses relating to the criminal proceedings, or has assumed the obligation to pay such expenses, and there is no public interest in the continuation of the criminal proceedings, the public prosecutor’s office may request discontinuance of the criminal proceedings by a court with the consent of the suspect or accused.the premise of the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings according to the provision referred to is that the object of the criminal proceedings is a criminal offence in the second degree and the guilt of the person suspected or accused of the offence is negligible, and that he or she has remedied or has begun to remedy the damage caused by the criminal offence or has paid the expenses relating to the criminal proceedings, or has assumed the obligation to pay such expenses, and that there is no public interest in the continuation of the criminal proceedings, but that the act as such was nevertheless committed.the court of appeal finds that the fact that the applicant committed the act consisting of causing the insured event to happen and creating the illusion of the occurrence of an insured event with the intention of obtaining compensation from the insurer was established by the tartu county court’s ruling of 3 december 2008. if the [applicant’s] position was that she did not commit the act, she would have submitted evidence to prove her argument, but she has not done so.
on 17 october 2001 the administrative court set aside the appeal decision of 3 september 1996 due to lack of jurisdiction of the personnel office of the vienna municipality.however, on 7 august 2002, the appeal panel set aside the decision of 18 march 1996 and at the same time decided on the merits of the subject matter and stated that the applicant was not eligible for severance pay.on 30 november 2004 the constitutional court set aside the appeal panel’s decision on the merits due to lack of jurisdiction of the panel with regard to the subject matter.11.  the applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with the constitutional court on 17 may 2005. on 12 october 2005 the constitutional court declared that the applicant’s constitutionally guaranteed right to have proceedings determining her civil rights conducted within a reasonable time had been violated.however, setting aside the decision (preliminarily) concluding those overly long proceedings would not be capable of remedying the violation of the applicant’s rights; on the contrary, it would again delay the termination of the proceedings.
by a final decision of 12 april 2005, the arad county court allowed one of the applicant’s complaints and ordered the placement of the applicant in a non-smoking cell.the prison authorities took into account the fact that the applicant had been convicted of the rape of a minor and for most of his stay he had therefore been placed alone in an individual cell of 10.40 square metres.according to the information provided by the national prison administration and forwarded to the court by the government, the applicant was held in the following cells: - cell no.12.  the government did not provide any information concerning either the number of the detainees who had occupied the cells or the time spent by the applicant in each of the above-mentioned cells.15.  concerning the hygiene in the cell, the government submitted that prisoners had been responsible for cleaning the cells and were provided with cleaning products by the prison administration.
he then distinguished three periods of activity: (i) the period between 1 january 2002 and 1 april 2003, corresponding to the imposition of “the annual regulation fee for transport activities” by the caa on the civil aviation companies concerned; (ii) the period between 1 april and 1 october 2003, corresponding to the regulation by the caa of the activities of the companies in question in accordance with conditions negotiated as part of the contracts it entered into; and (iii) the period between 1 october 2003 and 13 march 2004, when the caa had collected regulation fees on the basis of order no.23.  the expert noted that the adoption of the constitutional court’s judgment of 10 january 2003 had led to “the suppression of the imposition by the caa, in the form of an order, of the ‘annual regulation fee for transport activities’ on companies operating within civil aviation and the removal of the compulsory nature of the payment of that fee”.in particular, the investigation authorities had not explained how, within the meaning of article 332 of the criminal code, the acts committed had damaged the “interests of the civil service”; what unlawful “personal profit” he had derived; what unlawful personal profit had been derived by third parties and who those people actually were; which of the rights of the companies concerned had been breached by his action; what legal interests of the state had been disregarded; and in what way that “disregard” had been “substantial” (see article 332 of the criminal code, at paragraph 58 below).46.  as for the other two episodes, the tbilisi city court considered that the applicant had unlawfully entered into the contracts of 28 march and 13 august 2003 with sakaeronavigatsia, tbilisi international airport and air‑bp‑georgia, in breach of the constitutional court’s judgment of 10 january 2003. thus, between 1 april and 1 october 2003, the caa had unlawfully received the sums of gel 425,000 (some eur 208,000), 180,000 (around eur 83,000) and 25,000 (some eur 11,000) respectively, from which the applicant had unlawfully paid his own salary and the salaries of his employees, and had financed the caa’s business trip and management expenses.53.  on 14 september 2006 the supreme court of georgia dismissed the appeal on points of law by the applicant, stating that by continuing to charge the fees to the various private companies after 1 april 2003 the applicant had misapplied the judgment of the constitutional court of 10 january 2003 and had thus committed an abuse of power, infringing the rights of various legal entities and the general legal interests of the state.
police officer i. brought the applicant to the taxi stand and asked the taxi drivers whether they had seen him on 28 june 2006. the taxi drivers did not recognise the applicant and the applicant could not indicate the car and the driver who had allegedly driven him on 28 june 2006. he also could not provide any details about the appearances of the car or the driver.the material in the case file (namely, a copy of the applicant’s indictment) contains reference to the statements of police officers i. and f. saying that on 8 or 9 july 2006, while the applicant was in the cell at the novy sanzhary police station, they questioned him without a lawyer in connection with k’.s disappearance.16.  in his application form the applicant stated that for the first time he had been allowed to see a lawyer on 22 august 2006. however, from the material in the case file, the authenticity of which the applicant did not dispute before the court, it follows that on 11 july 2006 the investigator g. appointed lawyer v. to represent the applicant under the legal aid scheme and questioned the applicant in his presence.the court referred to the statement which the applicant had made in the presence of his lawyer, the minutes of the inspection of the crime scene on 10 july 2006, the results of the forensic examination of k.’s body and other material evidence found on the crime scene, forensic expert’s statements made before the court, and statements of witnesses who on 28 june 2006 had first seen the applicant with r. and k. and then later with k. alone walking down the road.37.  on 27 march 2008 the supreme court upheld the judgment of 20 november 2007. it noted, in particular, that when convicting the applicant the trial court had mainly relied on the statements which he had made in the presence of the lawyer s. on 9 september 2006.
8.  according to case-file materials, on 18 march 2000 the principal of the severodonetsk territorial medical association (северодонецьке територіальне медичне об’єднання, hereinafter the “severodonetsk hospital”) received a letter from the severodonetsk town prosecutor’s office asking for an opinion on the state of the applicant’s mental health.the severodonetskyy district court issued a note on the progress of the applicant’s case stating that the applicant had instituted the proceedings on 2 october 2001. in october 2001 the applicant lodged a similar complaint against the lugansk hospital.31.  the court found that the visit to the applicant’s home on 19 march 2000 when the applicant had been examined and later taken to the severodonetsk hospital had been performed in compliance with paragraphs 1, 2, and 10 to 13 of instruction no.17. however, the applicant’s transfer to the svatove hospital on 7 september 2000 had been in breach of section 16 of the psychiatric medical assistance act, which was in force as of 4 april 2000. the applicant’s requests for access to information had been rejected as a result of a decision to limit his access to his medical file, which he had not challenged.33.  on 29 november 2007 the lugansk regional court of appeal upheld the decision of 13 august 2007. the court held that the first-instance court had correctly applied the law in force at the material time.
it held that the relevant articles of the criminal code were to be interpreted in the light of article 15 of the constitution, which only protected communications of a confidential nature.16.  the confidential nature of the communications was also obvious from the fact that the carabinieri used coded language for communications concerning the location and the type of intervention, clearly seeking to ensure that no third parties had knowledge of the information being exchanged.reiterating all the arguments put forward by the milan and lecco public prosecutors, particularly regarding the aims of ensuring public safety and protecting public order, the court of appeal held that article 329 of the code of criminal procedure was also at issue in the present case.23.  in a judgment of 28 october 2008 the court of cassation found against the applicants, upholding the court of appeal’s position as to the confidential nature of the communications and reiterating that this interpretation was consistent with its own approach in similar cases, particularly in judgments no.24.  addressing the applicants’ argument concerning freedom of the press, the court of cassation stated that the right to impart information, which they had relied on, might have prevailed over the public interests protected by criminal law in a case of alleged defamation.
21.  on 25 july 2002 the dnipropetrovsk regional court of appeal (hereafter “the court of appeal”) upheld the conviction of 11 february 2002 with respect to the applicant’s co-defendants, quashed the conviction with respect to the applicant and remitted his case to the district court for retrial.on the same date, without being released, the applicant was re-arrested on suspicion of the premeditated murder of a.g. 29.  on 26 september 2003 the prosecutor’s office asked the district court to remand the applicant in custody in connection with the murder proceedings.47.  on 21 may 2004 the court of appeal found the applicant guilty of causing the traffic accident which resulted in l.g.’s death and of the aggravated murder of a.g. the conviction for murder was based on the testimony of v.z., which the trial court found to be corroborated by the statements made by the applicant’s wife, the results of the crime-scene inspection and the forensic expert’s examination of the victim’s body.51.  on numerous occasions the applicant complained to the court of appeal and other state authorities that his term of imprisonment had been calculated incorrectly in the judgment of 21 may 2004, and that the starting point should have been the date of his first arrest in connection with the theft charges, i.e. 15 august 2001, rather than 10 october 2003. in reply, the applicant was informed that the term of imprisonment had been properly calculated, because prior to october 2003 the applicant had been detained in relation to charges that were not linked to the murder charge for which he was convicted.the district court included the length of the applicant’s pre-trial detention in the overall term of imprisonment and ruled that the latter had started running on 15 august 2001, when the applicant had been detained for the first time in the context of the theft proceedings.
the deputy prosecutor noted that the applicant had stated that he had not intended to steal aluminium but had entered the factory premises out of curiosity and had run away out of fear of being accused of theft, that l. and p. had denied using physical force on the applicant and that the factory employees said that they had not seen l. beat the applicant.26.  between 15 june 2003 and 27 october 2004 the following investigative steps were taken:  on 30 august 2004 the applicant’s mother-in-law testified that she had seen l. kicking the applicant whilst he was lying on the ground;  on 30 august-1 september 2004 the applicant, his wife and the factory employees were questioned;  on 30 august 2004 a forensic expert concluded that the applicant had sustained bodily injuries of medium seriousness and that those injuries could have been inflicted by blunt objects or by several falls from different heights;  on 6-8 september 2004 police officers p. and l. were questioned;  on 27 september 2004 the factory premises were examined;  according to a forensic medical report dated 6 october 2004, the applicant could have sustained his injuries between 30 december 2002 and 2 january 2003 by being beaten or by falling from a height.28.  on 30 november 2004 the applicant was questioned and he reiterated his version of events (see paragraphs 6-10 above), submitting, in particular, that in the police station ‒ in the presence of two police officers ‒ l. had struck him on the chest; p. had hit him several times on the head; p. and l. had kicked him on various parts of his body and p. had struck him on the chest and on the abdomen and had then beaten him in the presence of a police officer.34.  on 26 may 2005 the vinnytsya regional prosecutor’s office asked the head of the internal security department of the vinnytsya region, which is part of the ministry of the internal affairs of ukraine (начальник увб у вінницькій області двб губоз мвс україни), to identify and question witnesses who had seen or talked to the applicant at the time of the events in question.44.  between 13 april 2006 and 19 october 2008 the proceedings were terminated three times for absence of corpus delicti and re-opened, in particular, in the light of the failure to obtain the applicant’s medical file from the hospital or to conduct a reconstruction of events with the participation of l., witnesses and a forensic medical expert in order to establish where the applicant had fallen and the circumstances in which the applicant had suffered his injuries.
18.  on 24 march 2011, in a speech delivered to parliament in the course of the debate on the bill on the fundamental law of hungary (the new constitution), the applicant expressed his opinion on certain aspects of the proposed constitutional reform which concerned the judiciary, notably the new name given to the supreme court – kúria –, the new powers attributed to the kúria in the field of ensuring consistency in the case-law, the management of the judiciary and the functioning of the national council of justice, as well as the introduction of a constitutional appeal against judicial decisions.in this regard, he stated: “this unrestricted, non-transparent and uncontrollable power is unparalleled in contemporary europe ... the extent and uncontrollability of such centralised authority is without precedent, even in countries where the administration of the judiciary lies with the ministry of justice and even if we think of the socialist dictatorship, in the last years of which kálmán kulcsár, member of the hungarian academy of sciences and minister of justice responsible for the administration of the judiciary, declared that he would appoint only persons recommended by the professional organs of the judiciary.” finally, the applicant again raised in his speech the issue of the new retirement age for judges, saying that it would have a severe effect on the supreme court and that the need to have enough judges at the kúria had not yet been addressed.26.  on 6 july 2011, in the “position of the government of hungary on the opinion on the fundamental law of hungary adopted by the venice commission at its 87th plenary session (venice, 17-18 june 2011, cdl‑ad(2011)016)”, transmitted by the minister for foreign affairs of hungary, the government assured the venice commission that the drafting of the transitional provisions of the fundamental law would not be used to unduly put an end to the terms of office of persons elected under the previous legal regime.the reasoning of the bill reads as follows: “in view of the fundamental law of hungary and of the modifications to the court system resulting from that law, in compliance with the bill on the transitional provisions of the fundamental law of hungary, and with a view to ensuring a smooth transition and continuity in the fulfilment of the tasks of the kúria as from 1 january 2012, this bill provides that parliament must elect, by 31 december 2011 and according to the rules laid down in the fundamental law, the president of the kúria who is to take office on 1 january 2012.” 29.  on 20 november 2011 two members of the parliamentary majority submitted a bill (no.having regard to the modifications to the court system, the bill provides that the term of office of the president of the supreme court currently in office, and that of the president and the members of the national council of justice, shall be terminated upon the entry into force of the fundamental law.” 30.  on 23 november 2011 another member of parliament submitted a proposal for an amendment to sections 185 and 187 of the organisation and administration of the courts bill.
20/10-33 of 9 january 2000 issued by the kherson regional department of the ministry of the interior (управління міністерства внутрішніх справ в херсонській області) (“the kherson regional department”) and pursuant to an order from a senior traffic police officer, kos., drafted a training exercise for traffic police officers in the city of kherson and the village of antonivka in the context of operation sirena.the scenario was approved on 13 january 2000 by a deputy head of the kherson regional department, s. 10.  senior traffic police officer kos., who on 14 january 2000 was the acting head of the traffic police department, later stated in the course of the criminal investigation that traffic police officers had been given prior notice of the training exercise on the day that it was held.17.  on 15 january 2000 the kherson regional board of the ministry of the interior adopted a decision by which it was concluded that the “extraordinary event” («надзвичайна подія») of 14 january 2000 had taken place because of low professional standards on the part of the police; k.’s failure to assess properly the “extraordinary circumstances” («екстремальні умови»), ignorance of the steps to be taken when arresting a suspect and failure to properly handle his weapon; and the irresponsible attitude of senior police officers towards the organisation of the training exercise.the procedure for the conduct of the training was not comprehensively set out; [failures included]: - the failure to stipulate an itinerary for the car containing the “criminals”; - the failure to provide for the necessary number of observers ... in their turn, the senior officers of the kherson regional traffic police ... acted in a perfunctory and irresponsible manner ..., did not properly study the scenario and did not correct its shortcomings... moreover, no training instructor was appointed and the heads of services and subdivisions involved in the training were not informed of the details of the scenario.26.  the testimony of different police officers involved in the organisation and conduct of the training exercise included, inter alia, the following: - p. testified that the “orders in force” had not required that information about the training be circulated; - the head of the police unit on duty at the kherson regional department (начальник чергової частини штабу управління мвс), g., testified that he had instructed p. to “comply with the sirena plan, in accordance with the existing instructions”.
7.  on the same day, the investigator arrested the applicant and drew up an arrest report, the relevant parts of which read as follows: “on 22 january 2004 at 1.40 p.m., investigator ya., in accordance with article 115 of the criminal procedure code of ukraine detained kleutin denis vasyliyovych ... on suspicion of commission of the crime provided for by article 186 of the criminal code of ukraine.10.  on 18 march 2004, in the presence of the prosecutor and in the absence of the applicant, the district court allowed the investigator’s request and extended the applicant’s detention for one month in view of the need to carry out certain investigative steps to complete the investigation.it noted that no applications had been lodged by the parties to the proceedings and found “no violations of the requirements of article 237 of the code of criminal procedure of ukraine (“the ccp”) in the course of the preliminary investigation of the case”.27.  by the aforementioned ruling of 29 march 2005, the district court ordered the prosecutor’s office to identify, by 11 april 2005, the persons who had apprehended the applicant and to question them and the applicant’s sister in relation to the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment.33.  on the same day, on the basis of the above-mentioned statements by the police officer, the prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officer, having found that no physical force had been applied to the applicant and that he had voluntarily agreed to go to the police station.
on 14 september 1998 the police sought authorisation for the release of the applicants from hmp peterhead into their custody so that they could be interviewed with regard to the disappearance and suspected murder of a.m. 10.  on 17 september 1998, while serving their sentence at hmp peterhead, the applicants were detained by the police under section 14 of the criminal procedure (scotland) act 1995 and removed to queen street police office in aberdeen.15.  between 1 and 4 april 2005 a decision was made by the procurator fiscal, following consultation with crown counsel, to place both applicants on petition in relation to the murder of a.m. the crown’s position was that a.m. had threatened to report the applicants to the police after discovering that they were sexually abusing her son.the high court found that the crown had acted properly in investigating and reviewing the evidence between 1997 and 2008; that the expiry of the section 65 time-limit had come about through a positive decision rather than through inadvertence; and that new evidence had since come to light so as to allow the crown to proceed against both applicants.33.  both appeals were dismissed on 26 november 2009. in dismissing the first applicant’s appeal, the appeal court accepted that the police had interrogated him “robustly” in 1998, but agreed with the high court that he was not “charged” until 5 april 2005. the court considered that the crown had acted without fault since that time, and, in the particular circumstances of the case, it could not be said that the matter would not be determined within a reasonable time.45.  a hearing took place on 29 and 30 april 2013 before the supreme court, which gave judgment on 13 june 2013. the main issue before the supreme court was whether the applicants could be said to have been “charged” on 17 september 1998 or whether the appropriate “starting point” for the purposes of article 6 § 1 was 5 april 2005. the court assessed the evidence in light of the relevant case-law of the domestic courts and of this court.
7.  on 30 march 2005 the belgrade second municipal court (drugi opštinski sud u beogradu) ordered the debtor to pay the applicant specified sums in respect of salary arrears, social security contributions and procedural costs.8.  on 22 june 2005 the belgrade fourth municipal court (četvrti opštinski sud u beogradu) issued an enforcement order with regard to the said judgement.9.  on 29 march 2012, acting upon the applicant’s constitutional appeal, the constitutional court held that the applicant had suffered a breach of the “right to a trial within a reasonable time” with regard to the enforcement proceedings.the court ordered the acceleration of the proceedings and declared that the applicant was entitled to compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered in the amount of eur 700, converted into the national currency at the rate applicable at the date of settlement.10.  the enforcement proceedings instituted on the basis of the judgment rendered by the belgrade second municipal court on 30 march 2005 continued and are still pending.
as established by the domestic courts in the set of proceedings against the police officers, when one of the police officers had told the applicant that he would be arrested, the applicant pushed the police officer and started to run away.11.  as established by the domestic courts in the set of proceedings against the applicant, on the basis of the testimony of the policemen, after the comment made by the applicant the police officers tried to apprehend him, however he resisted arrest and moved a few steps back.the court also considered that at the moment of the arrest there were grounds to suspect the applicant of having committed the offence referred to in article 226 § 1 of the criminal code and there were grounds to bring proceedings against him in an expedited manner.22.  on 8 september 2009 the nowy sącz regional court quashed the first-instance judgment and discontinued the proceedings, finding that the prohibited acts committed by the applicant had not constituted offences because the resulting harm to the public was insignificant (znikoma szkodliwość społeczna czynu).referring to the relevant provisions of domestic law, in particular the 1990 police act, the prosecutor found that the police had had the right to use force because “the applicant had not obeyed their orders, had behaved nervously and had tried to run away”.
it was also established that the first symptoms of that disorder had appeared prior to the applicant’s detention, in 2004. an expert in dermatology, appointed by the domestic court, excluded the possibility that the applicant had developed the illness because of contact with an allegedly dirty and mouldy mattress.21.  in 2007 and 2009 the applicant lodged a number of complaints with the ombudsman, the ministry of justice and the relevant penitentiary court, informing them of the allegedly deplorable conditions of his detention, his inadequate medical care and of unreasonable restrictions on the practice of his religion during his detention in koszalin remand centre.27.  the evidence which was obtained by the civil court, inter alia, the applicant’s medical history, witness testimony and the report of an expert in dermatology, had disproved the applicant’s allegations that he had contracted his skin condition in the remand centre because his mattress had been dirty and damp and that his illness had been inadequately treated.28.  the domestic court considered that in view of the fact that the applicant had been authorised to attend sunday mass a total of four times in september and november 2008 and in the light of the testimony of the prison chaplain that the applicant had been free to request attendance in sunday mass, it could not be said that his access to religious services had been unreasonably restricted.31.  the applicant submitted a hand-written appeal against the above-mentioned judgment, dated 24 january 2011. the document does not bear any stamps but is accompanied by an official note, confirming that on 24 january 2011 the applicant wished to send his appeal to the koszalin district court from żytkowice prison.
prior to the hearing before the court of appeal, counsel for the applicant requested in a letter of 18 november 2011 that, for the benefit of the applicant, an interpreter be present who spoke aramaic or assyrian, and he gave the name of an interpreter who spoke the correct language.14.  on 16 may 2012 the court of appeal delivered its decision, holding, amongst other things, the following: “no violation of article 6 echr the court of appeal considers that in the present case it cannot be said that the appeal was dealt with speedily within the meaning of article 6 of the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.unlike counsel [for the applicant], the court is of the opinion that the decision to accept that a violation of the convention has occurred in itself constitutes sufficient satisfaction for the outrage to his sense of justice.the court of appeal deems that the difficult progress of the measure cannot only be attributed to [the applicant] and finds that fpa de cederborg could have signalled the difficult progress of the measure earlier.having regard to the fact that [the applicant] currently has accommodation where he can stay as well as a prospect of placement in appropriate sheltered accommodation where he can also stay if the measure is terminated, and the fact that partly due to this the risk that the termination of the measure will lead to endangerment, nuisance and degradation of society is small, the court of appeal considers that continuation of the measure is no longer necessary.”
13.  in the applicants’ case, with the exception mentioned below, no such separate agreement had been reached between the parties, and the annual rent payable by the gardeners to the applicants was thus determined under the statutory rules at the lowest limit of the applicable scale, that is to say at a rate of eur 0.01 per square metre.such proceedings are also provided for under the act, their aim being to have the ownership and use of the land in the allotment area consolidated, principally by transferring title to the land to the gardeners and having the former owners compensated by means regulated under the act, the details of such consolidation being defined in what is known as a “land consolidation project”.16.  in the applicants’ case, the gardeners initiated the requisite land consolidation proceedings on 7 december 1998. within the framework thereof, the order had been given for implementation of a “land consolidation project”, but the proceedings changed course on 7 august 2013 when the constitutional court held that the applicants’ inability to have that order reviewed by the courts violated their right of access to a court and their property rights.20.  the government for their part submitted the following documents: ‒ a letter from the forensic engineering institute in žilina dated 17 december 2012, in which the institute pointed out what they considered to be methodological flaws in the calculations of expert a. on the basis of their pro forma recalculation of the available data, the value of the annual general rent would be eur 0.239 per square metre.in these cases, the institute assessed the general value of the annual rent for previous years ‒ on the basis of the results for the year 2014, but taking into account the general development of real estate prices in the given region and other economic criteria during those years ‒ as follows: in 2013 eur 0.716, in 2012 eur 0.746, in 2011 eur 0.732, in 2010 eur 0.745, in 2009 eur 0.790, in 2008 eur 1.084, and in 2007 eur 0.804. lastly, the institute reiterated the objections concerning the methodology used in the valuation produced by expert a and expressed the view that he had lacked the requisite qualifications for conducting the particular type of valuation obtaining in the present case, since his qualifications pertained only to agricultural land, and did not extend to include the type of land concerned in the present case.
no material evidence was introduced during the trial and, apart from the statement by the alleged victim ‒ who maintained that the press worked and had been kept in a locked yard ‒ the statements of two witnesses supported the applicants’ defence.8.  on 8 april 2008 the prosecution lodged an appeal against this judgment, emphasising, in particular, that the first-instance court had failed to take into account a statement given to the police by s.k.had subsequently revoked this confession claiming that it had been given under the influence of alcohol and then refused to answer any further questions, and all of these circumstances needed to be reconsidered by the municipal court, even though the prosecution itself had initially failed to request that s.k.’s statement of 26 january 2006 be admitted as evidence.12.  on 29 july 2009 the district court upheld this judgment on appeal, and on 7 october 2010 the supreme court rejected the applicants’ further appeal on points of law (zahtev za ispitivanje zakonitosti pravosnažne presude).13.  in the meantime, on 11 september 2009, the applicants lodged a constitutional appeal with the constitutional court, alleging that their conviction had been based on the testimony of a person whom they had never had a chance to cross-examine and who had, in any event, revoked it subsequently.
the relevant part of that decision reads: “... the advocate in the appeal ... first admitted not having attended the hearing scheduled for 17 december 2009 ... owing to a vehicle malfunction ... instead of asking for the proceedings to be restored to the status quo ante [restitutio in integrum ob terminem elapsum, povrat u prijašnje stanje] as a result of objective reasons and force majeure, the advocate in question, for no reason whatsoever, states on the second page of the appeal, ‘such conduct from the judge is absolutely unacceptable.in behaving in this way, he seeks to give the impression that he is proceeding with the case [i.e. that the case is being dealt with], whereas, essentially, hearings are being held which are devoid of substance.’ [t]hat statement is certainly offensive to the court and the judge [concerned], and as such constitutes unacceptable communication between the court and the advocate representing one of the parties.in particular, in his appeal, the applicant wrote, inter alia, the following: “the operative provisions [of the contested decision] indicate that the fine was imposed for offending the court in the appeal of 31 december 2009 by stating, ‘such conduct from the judge is absolutely unacceptable.... in addition to the plaintiff’s representative, the defendant and [her] representative attended the hearing scheduled for 16 november 2009. the record [of that hearing] states that [the plaintiff] reaffirmed his action and the submissions of 30 march 2009, and that the defendant maintained the arguments expressed in [her] response ... of 11 march 2009. beside this, nothing else happened at that hearing.the relevant part of that decision, which was served on the applicant on 16 july 2010, reads: “when deciding to fine the representative for contempt of court ... the first-instance court correctly held – and gave valid reasons for its view – that such statements constituted unacceptable communication between the court and an advocate ..., the assessment of which is within the discretion of the court before which the proceedings are pending.
12.  the bone of contention in the present case is whether or not the existing road network comprised a three-metre-wide makeshift field track (nespevnená poľná cesta), running parallel to the railway, across the land assigned to the applicant’s father, connecting the plots assigned to the other individuals with the road passing around the applicant’s property.the exact formulation of the relief sought evolved in the course of the proceedings; the action ultimately sought to obtain an injunction ordering the applicant to (i) remove the fence, gate, vegetation and anything else obstructing passage over the property in question; (ii) re-establish the original track; and (iii) allow and not hinder the claimants’ passage by that track.20.  together with the above rulings, the applicant was ordered to pay the claimant the amount that the latter had previously paid to the court as an advance on the fees of the court-appointed expert.in the constitutional court’s decision, those observations were reflected as follows: the president of the district court observed that the claimant and others involved had long been using the disputed track and that the state of affairs had been accepted by the applicant and his father until the applicant had arbitrarily barred the track in 2000, apparently guided by the mistaken belief that his title to the property concerned was absolute.the president of the regional court (i) recapitulated the course of the proceedings, (ii) summarised the applicant’s complaint, and (iii) submitted that no position could be taken as regards some of the applicant’s claims relating to the first-instance court, that there had been no undue delays in the proceedings before the court of appeal, and that one of the applicant’s submissions before that court could not have been taken into account because it had been belated.
the guardian concluded that the access arrangements should be speedily determined by the court in order to minimise the negative consequences of the divorce on n. the child should stay with the mother and the father should be allowed frequent visits.the court ordered that in the period up to 30 june 2012 the applicant could see his daughter every thursday between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m.; every second saturday and sunday between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m.; as well as on easter sunday between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. from 1 july 2012, the applicant could see his daughter every second weekend from 3 p.m. on friday until 5 p.m. on sunday; every wednesday from 3 p.m. until thursday 3 p.m.; for the whole of the period between 1 and 21 july; the first week of the winter holidays; the first day of easter; and on christmas day.as of the date of the submission of the government’s observations to the court, the remainder of the applicant’s request (proceedings for the mother to give an undertaking) was still pending.the court ruled that the applicant could meet his daughter every other sunday between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. the court held that the modification of the access arrangements was in the best interests of the child at that moment and that it was essential to rebuild the emotional ties between n. and the applicant.those were, in particular, the applicant’s arrest in n.’s presence and his subsequent detention on remand; the applicant’s new relationship and new child; the applicant’s attempt to enforce the contact order, without any regard to n.’s needs; and the escalation in the conflict between e. and the applicant.
286 of 1998 ... had to be interpreted in conformity with the principles established by the constitution, which meant that a same-sex cohabiting partner should be regarded as a “member of the family” of the italian national and thus entitled to obtain a residence permit.14.  the court found that the right asserted by the second applicant also derived from articles 3 and 10 of directive 2004/38/ec of 29 may 2004 of the european parliament and of the council ..., which recognised the right of the partner of a citizen of the european union (eu) to obtain a residence permit where the existence of a durable relationship was duly attested.18.  the court of appeal found that new zealand law was not compatible with italian public policy on the grounds, firstly, that it regarded persons of the same sex as “cohabiting partners” and, furthermore, that it could be construed as conferring the status of “family members” on them for the purposes of granting them a residence permit.in its view, those provisions left a wide margin of appreciation to the states regarding the choice of means of exercising the rights they guaranteed, particularly in the area of immigration control.24.  after being notified of the court of cassation’s judgment, the applicants left italy in july 2009. they moved to the netherlands, where the second applicant was issued with a five-year residence permit on 25 august 2009 as a de facto partner in a long-term relationship with an eu national.
5.  the applicant worked as the executive director at the “mingachevir technical rubber” joint stock company, which was an enterprise under the control of the department for privatization and management of state property (“the dpmsp”) of the ministry of the economic development.the court also ordered the dpmsp to pay the applicant his unpaid salary for the period from 15 march 2005 (date of dismissal) until the date of his reinstatement, without specifying the due amount.9.  on 12 april 2006 the supreme court upheld the court of appeal’s judgment and dismissed the cassation appeal lodged by the state committee for management of state property (“the scmsp”), which was the legal successor of the former dpmsp.10.  it appears from the documents in the case file that in spite of the issuance of the writ of execution and numerous letters of the enforcement officers requesting the execution of the judgment, the scmsp took no action to comply with the judgment in question.11.  following the scmsp’s continuous failure to comply with the judgment, on 14 july 2006 the sabayil district court decided to refer the case to the sabayil district prosecutor’s office for institution of criminal proceedings against the scmsp’s responsible official for non-execution of an enforceable judgment.
9.  overall, the proceedings lasted for over seven years and eight months, the final decision being taken by the supreme court on 29 december 2010. that court upheld decisions of the district court of 30 june 2010 and of the dnipro regional court of appeal (“the court of appeal”) of 16 september 2010 rejecting the applicant’s claims as unsubstantiated.12.  on 7 june 2006 the applicant lodged a statement of intent with the court of appeal to appeal against the decision of 2 june 2006. on 16 june 2006 he lodged an appeal, stating, inter alia, that that decision had been incorrect, as his administrative claim had concerned only a part of the issues raised in the civil claim.13.  on 25 july 2006 the court of appeal left the applicant’s appeal without examination, finding that the statement of intent to appeal had been lodged outside the five-day time-limit envisaged by article 294 § 2 of the code of civil procedure of 2004 (see paragraph 20 below).15.  in november 2005 the applicant brought an administrative claim in the district court against the head of the local council, seeking the annulment of the decision striking l. out of the list of legal entities.the court further noted that the applicant had made allegations of the unlawfulness of the shareholders’ decision to liquidate the company, which could not be examined in the framework of administrative proceedings.
prior to the assemblies, on 15 october and 12 november 2012 respectively the organisers, members of the opposition, gave notice to the relevant authority, the baku city executive authority (“the bcea”).6.  the bcea refused to authorise the demonstration of 20 october 2012 at the place indicated by the organisers and proposed another location on the outskirts of baku  the yard of a driving school situated in the 20th habitable area of the sabail district.12.  on the day of each applicant’s arrest administrative offence reports (inzibati xəta haqqında protokol) were issued on them, which stated that by deliberately failing to comply with a lawful order of the police, the applicants had committed an administrative offence under article 310.1 of the code of administrative offences (“the cao”).18.  the applicants stated in the respective courts that they had participated or attempted to participate in the demonstrations of 20 october 2012 or 17 october 2012, exercising their right to freedom of assembly and/or that they were not guilty of failing to comply with a lawful order of the police.19.  according to the transcripts of the hearings, in their oral submissions the state-funded lawyers stated in general terms that the applicants were not guilty or briefly asked the respective courts to adopt a fair decision.
8.  the necessity of continuing the applicant’s compulsory treatment was reviewed on several occasions, and on 8 april 2013 the vidzeme district court, having examined the medical panel’s conclusion of 25 february 2013 in relation to his state of health, decided to continue the treatment.10.  on 20 august 2008, in the course of a second set of criminal proceedings against the applicant for social benefit fraud, the riga regional court decided to relieve him of criminal liability, and imposed on him a compulsory measure: inpatient psychiatric treatment in a psychiatric hospital, which on 13 april 2010 was changed to compulsory outpatient medical treatment.12.  on 10 may 2013 the riga regional court, relying on section 607(4) of the criminal procedure law (see paragraph 22 below), asked the psychiatric hospital to send a report on the applicant’s state of health, so that the court could decide whether it was necessary to continue the compulsory medical treatment.observing that the applicant had not attended a doctor’s appointment, and considering that a longer period without treatment could cause his health to deteriorate, on 10 june 2013 the head of unit at the psychiatric hospital asked the police to bring the applicant to the outpatient section of the hospital, relying on section 11 of the law on police.20.  the applicant appealed that decision to the office of the prosecutor general, which on 16 august 2013 upheld it, stating that on 28 may 2012 the riga regional court had decided to continue the applicant’s compulsory medical treatment.
18.  the court of appeal pointed out that it was constant case-law of the domestic courts that the term “shortly after” was to be interpreted in such a way that the risk of a delayed notification was distributed fairly between both parties to the dispute and, therefore, the litigant concerned must have acted with the necessary diligence to effect the immediate notification.it underlined that the applicant would have had to alert the regional court about the imminent expiry of the limitation period and to ask to arrange for the immediate notification of the defendant in order to suspend the running of time for the purposes of limitation.nonetheless, it considered that the decision of the court of appeal was in conformity with the case-law of the federal court of justice, according to which a notification could only be “shortly after” the submission of a request for legal aid if the applicant concerned acted with the necessary diligence to effect the immediate notification, and if there were no legitimate interests of the defendant that conflicted with such retroactive effect (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 26 below).referring to the case-law of the federal court of justice (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 28 below), it considered that a litigant with sufficient financial means must not limit himself to submitting a lawsuit, but rather had to remind the court to ask him to pay the necessary court fees or even to pay the fees on his own initiative, if the court had failed to ask him, in order to effect the service of the legal action.the federal constitutional court found that such obligations on the part of a litigant with sufficient financial means were comparable to those of the applicant, namely his obligation to ask the court concerned to notify immediately the defendant of the request for legal aid, and to remind the court to arrange for notice to be given.
this is [about] financing mass propaganda against law and justice through an agreement which has been threatened by law and justice, so that such dubious deals (geszefty) ... the point is that law and justice has interfered with extremely serious connections, which have been draining ... just one sentence ... but the jokes are over, and this structure (układ) understood that there will be no early elections, there will be no minority government, this is a chance for an institutional construction ...” 9.  during the applicant’s statement one of the journalists interrupted him by saying: “but this would be more appropriate if someone from gazeta wyborcza was here.” however, the applicant continued with his statement.on the contrary, it was in the public interest that public figures such as the applicant, a member of parliament, should base the opinions they expressed in the media on verified facts and did not breach the rights of others.22.  the court of appeal considered that the first-instance judgment had not related to the part of the applicant’s statement concerning articles about himself and law and justice, even though he had called them “frenzied attacks”, because it was well known that gazeta wyborcza was critical of law and justice and that was not something which needed to be proved.however, the applicant’s allegations that j&s s.a. had conducted unclear or even suspicious dealings under the cover of placing advertisements in gazeta wyborcza, and had in fact financed them only to destroy law and justice, which, for its part, had been fighting against the “agreement” between the company in question and gazeta wyborcza, had been statements of fact.since the applicant failed to comply with that order, on 26 february 2010 the warsaw district court allowed agora s.a. to publish the apology in gazeta wyborcza in the applicant’s name and ordered him to cover the costs of publication of pln 34,897.36 (about eur 8,700).
according to the report on the applicant’s arrest, he had been apprehended after the police had moved against a group of 50-60 people who had been chanting slogans in favour of the pkk and its leader in the cemetery of the biçer neighbourhood.according to the applicant’s submissions, his lawyer was only provided with the medical reports of 12 and 13 december 2009; the public prosecutor’s office failed to provide him with the report of 14 december 2009, which had been issued at the end of the applicant’s detention in police custody.2559 on the duties and powers of the police, the police officers had the authority to use force against pkk supporters, the public prosecutor considered that the police had used proportionate force against the applicant.24.  on 31 march 2010 the applicant’s legal representative lodged an appeal against the decision of 17 march 2010. he noted, in particular, that the hakkari public prosecutor’s assessment had been based on incorrect facts such as the “minor nature” of the applicant’s injuries and his involvement in violent acts during the events of 12 december 2009. the lawyer also noted that the public prosecutor had failed to take a statement from the applicant, to collect evidence in relation to his allegations or to identify and question the arresting police officers and potential witnesses.the lawyer also noted that the medical reports had complied with neither domestic legislation nor the “istanbul protocol” since they lacked details such as the applicant’s medical history, the applicant’s own account of how the injuries had been caused and an assessment regarding the cause of the injuries.
the third and fourth applicants each acquired a 2/12 share of the ownership of the house on 25 january 1995 and 29 march 1999 respectively.8.  at the time the applicants acquired the ownership of the house five flats were inhabited by tenants with regulated rent.under the relevant legislation this meant that (i) the applicants had to accept that their flats were occupied by these tenants, (ii) they could charge them no more than the maximum amount of rent fixed by the state, (iii) they could not unilaterally terminate the leases, and (iv) they could not sell the flats other than to the tenants (“the rent-control scheme”).10.  the monthly rent chargeable for the flats under the applicable legislation was equivalent to some 10 to 17.5 euros (eur) between 1992 and 1999. after several increases in the regulated rent, in june 2007 the applicants were able to charge some eur 73.5 monthly in respect of the two-room flat and approximately eur 125 monthly in respect of the four‑room flats.the applicants relied on data from the national association of real estate agencies (“the narea”) and claimed that the monthly market rent for comparable two‑room flats in the area reached around eur 662 and for comparable four‑room flats some eur 1,296 between 2004 and 2007. the government submitted an expert valuation according to which the monthly market rent for the applicants’ flats in 2010 amounted to eur 561 and eur 772 to eur 797 respectively.
6.  on 23 december 2013 the applicant was arrested and charged with embezzlement and organising the attempted murder of two businessmen.the squat toilet was not separated from the rest of the cell and gave off a foul odour.9.  the applicant complained of inhuman conditions of detention to the chișinău prosecutor’s office and court of appeal.11.  the court refers to the relevant material cited in its previous case‑law concerning the republic of moldova (see, for instance, shishanov v. the republic of moldova, no.13, the centre for human rights in moldova (“the human rights centre”, which also acts as the moldovan ombudsman) found serious problems, notably concerning overcrowding, food quality, ventilation and access to daylight.
after recapitulating the parties’ positions and citing the applicable provisions of the law, the court found that: “... the grounds relied on when applying the preventive measure [of detention] remain valid, the majority of the investigative actions have been carried out, but a number of additional measures requiring [the applicant’s] participation are still necessary in order to send the case to the trial court.the court considers that the application on the part of the defence to replace the preventive measure is premature, taking into account the seriousness and complexity of the case and the need to protect public order and the public interest, as well as to ensure the smooth and objective course of the investigation.” 21.  the applicant appealed, relying on essentially the same arguments as he had done previously.22.  on 22 may 2007 the chişinău court of appeal upheld the decision of 16 may 2007. the court gave essentially the same reasons as it had done in its decision of 8 may 2007, namely the gravity and the complexity of the case, the risk of absconding or influencing witnesses and the risk of destroying documentary evidence which have not yet been collected by the prosecutors.the court found that: “... the applicant has been detained for fifty-five days and has participated in all the necessary investigative actions; ... article 5 § 3 of the convention imposes a presumption that an accused be freed while he awaits his trial; ... certain evidence, which may have been sufficient earlier to justify [detention] or to render alternative preventive measures inadequate, could become less convincing with the passage of time; ... it is for the prosecutor to prove the existence of a risk of absconding, and such a risk cannot be proved only by reference to the severity of the potential punishment; [the court referred to the applicant’s medical problems and his age, the lack of a criminal record, his permanent residence and married status]; the [european court’s] case-law provides that detention pending trial should be exceptional, always objectively reasoned and must correspond to the public interest; the court finds that it is implausible that [the applicant] will abscond, influence witnesses or destroy evidence, and that the normal course of the criminal investigation is possible while the accused is under house arrest.” the court set the following conditions for the applicant’s house arrest: prohibition from leaving his house; prohibition of using the telephone; prohibition from discussing his case with any other person.the court found that: “... the lower court did not take into account the complexity of the case and the seriousness of the offence with which [the applicant] is charged; the court considers that while under house arrest [the applicant] could communicate with the other accomplices, who are not under arrest and who are, moreover, his sons; he could abscond by fleeing to the [self-proclaimed and unrecognised “moldovan republic of transdniestria”], which is not under the control of the moldovan authorities; he could influence witnesses, in order to make them change their statements; the applicant has received visits from doctors and can obtain medical assistance in prison.” 33.  on 11 july 2007 the prosecutor in charge of the case applied again to the court for an extension of the applicant’s detention on remand.
15.  the nature of the applicant’s work, and the contents of an official report (ambtsbericht), drawn up on 29 february 2000 by the netherlands ministry of foreign affairs, entitled “security services in communist afghanistan (1978-1992), agsa, kam, khad and wad” (“veiligheidsdiensten in communistisch afghanistan (1978-1992), agsa, kam, khad en wad”; dpc/am 663896) and an official report, drawn up on 23 june 2000 by the ministry of foreign affairs, on hezb-e wahdat (dpc/am-681499), had given cause to consider whether article 1f of the 1951 convention was applicable to the applicant’s asylum claim.16.  in her notice of intention, the minister analysed, on the basis of elaborate argumentation based on various international materials and on the prescribed and so-called “knowing and personal participation” test, the nature of the acts imputed to the applicant in the framework of article 1f of the 1951 refugee convention, as well as his individual responsibility under that convention.the minister noted, inter alia, that the applicant had worked for a part of the pdpa government, the revolutionary guard, which had collaborated with the khad and found that it was justified to conclude that the applicant had known or should have known about the criminal character of the khad and that its crimes had formed part of a widespread or targeted attack aimed against the civilian population.relying on the official report of 23 june 2000 (see paragraph 15 above), the minister underlined that hezb-e wahdat had been considered during the afghan civil war to be one of the most violent groups, not only because of its militia’s actions on the battle field and merciless liquidation of its political opponents, but in particular because of its militia’s crimes against the civil population of afghanistan and for having instilled a true climate of terror in the country.in reaching this finding, the minister took into account, inter alia, that the applicant had stayed for about three months in pakistan and about eight months in iran without having sought assistance in these countries from, for instance, the united nations high commissioner for refugees (“unhcr”), that he had not applied for asylum when he had been apprehended by the police in germany, and that he had not reported immediately to the immigration authorities after his arrival in the netherlands.
19.  on 30 april 2008 the government submitted the following unilateral declaration: “the government of the republic of latvia (hereinafter – the government) represented by [their] agent inga reine admit that the physical treatment of viktors jeronovičs (hereinafter – the applicant) by the police officers, as well as the effectiveness of the investigation of the respective applicant’s complaints, the access to legal aid and effective remedies to apply for the compensation of damages, the length of criminal proceedings [against the applicant], as well as the lack of effective remedy did not meet the standards enshrined in article 3, article [5 § 5], article [6 § 1], article 13 and article 14 of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms (hereinafter – the convention).in accordance with article 38 § 2 of the convention and rule 62 § 2 of the rules of court, the court will proceed on the basis of the government’s unilateral declaration and the parties’ observations submitted outside the framework of the friendly-settlement negotiations, and will disregard the parties’ statements made in the context of exploring the possibilities for a friendly settlement of the case and the reasons why the parties were unable to agree on the terms of a friendly settlement (see tahsin acar v. turkey (preliminary objection) [gc], no.53.  in their declaration in the present case the government have recognised that the treatment to which the applicant was subjected by the police officers while in police custody, the manner in which the investigations were carried out in that regard, the handling of the applicant’s claims for compensation and in particular the refusal of his applications for legal aid in order to gain access to the compensation procedure, as well as the length of the criminal proceedings against him, infringed articles 3, 5 § 5, 6 § 1, 13 and 14 of the convention.it cannot be concluded from the judgment of 1 december 2009 adopted by the european court of human rights that the court examined and assessed any activities carried out by the law-enforcement officers during the pre-trial investigation in the criminal proceedings ... accordingly, the conclusions reached in [the court’s] judgment of 1 december 2009 and the government’s unilateral declaration of 30 april 2008 cannot be applied or connected to the criminal proceedings...” 25.  in an appeal lodged on 9 december 2010 the applicant reiterated that there was a legal basis for reopening the criminal proceedings concerning his ill-treatment, on account of the fact that the government’s unilateral declaration had expressly recognised the violation of article 3 of the convention, a circumstance which had led the court to strike out that complaint.06725198 and 50207598 should be reopened in connection with the unilateral declaration of the government of the republic of latvia mentioned by the latvian republic government agent on 30 april 2008, in which the government of the republic of latvia recognised that the physical treatment of viktors jeronovičs by police officers, the effectiveness of the investigation into the applicant’s complaints, his access to legal aid and to effective remedies by which to apply for compensation for damage, the length of the criminal proceedings, and the lack of an effective remedy, did not meet the standards enshrined in articles 3, 5 § 5, 6 § 1, 13 and 14 of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
on the basis of section 31/c (3) of the asylum act and section 36/c (1) of the relevant government decree (see in paragraph 22 below), the applicant could have submitted an objection to the ordering of his asylum detention.without referring to other individual circumstances or the applicant’s sexual orientation, the court held that less stringent measures – such as an obligation to check in regularly with the authorities, to stay at a designated place of residence, or to pay asylum bail (menekültügyi óvadék) – were not suitable in the case to secure the applicant’s availability to the authorities.17.  in her submission of 12 august 2014 to the asylum authority, the applicant’s legal-aid lawyer requested the termination of the asylum detention and the designation of a place of residence for the applicant with measures securing his availability during the proceedings.in her submission of the same day to the debrecen district court, the lawyer asked the court to hear the applicant and not to extend the asylum detention.relying on section 31/a (1) a) of the asylum act, the district court stated that the delay caused by the acts of the authority for which the asylum seeker could not be held responsible did not provide grounds for the extension of the detention.
on 12 october 2005 the constitutional court refused to deal with the complaint and, upon the applicant’s request, referred the case to the administrative court.while the complaints against the minister’s decision of 24 march 2005 and concerning the re-opening decision of 10 may 2005 were still pending before the administrative court, the minister granted the applicant a licence to run a pharmacy on 5 december 2005.12.  on 16 july 2009 the administrative court, dealing with the complaints of the first and the second sets of proceedings at the same time, decided that neither of the minister’s decisions of 24 march and 10 may 2005 had been lawful, and quashed them.13.  on 19 march 2010 the minister granted the applicant’s appeal against the decision of the regional governor of upper austria of 25 september 2002. the applicant was granted a licence to establish and run a new public pharmacy in leonding.14.  the complaint against that decision raised by the owners of an existing pharmacy was dismissed by the administrative court on 28 may 2013 and the applicant was awarded compensation for costs in the amount of 1,106.40 euros (eur).
10.  under the relevant legislation, the applicant had to accept that his flats were occupied by those tenants and that he could charge them no more than the maximum amount of rent fixed by the state (“the rent-control scheme”).11.  under the applicable legislation, the maximum monthly rent chargeable for the flats in 1999 was the equivalent of some 13 to 33 euros (eur).after several increases in the regulated rent, in 2004 the applicant was able to charge eur 115 monthly in respect of each of the smaller flats and eur 124 monthly in respect of the larger ones.12.  the applicant contended that he, in fact, received from the tenants less than the maximum amount of rent set by the applicable legislation.the applicant relied on data from the national association of real estate agencies (“the narea”) and claimed that the monthly market rent for similar flats reached eur 600 to 800 between 2004 and 2007. the government submitted an expert valuation according to which the monthly market rent for the applicant’s flats in 2010 amounted to eur 265.50 and eur 325 respectively.
7.  the applicant’s parents built a house in bratislava-ružinov in 1937. in the second half of the 1950s they were compelled to donate the house to the state.under the relevant legislation (i) the applicant had to accept that his flats were occupied by the tenants, (ii) he could charge them no more than the maximum amount of rent fixed by the state, (iii) he could not unilaterally terminate the leases, and (iv) he could not sell the flats to anyone other than the tenants (“the rent-control scheme”).after several increases in the regulated rent, in 2007 the applicant could charge some eur 35 for the smaller flat and eur 65 for each of the larger ones.11.  the parties provided differing figures as to the market rent: the applicant relied on data from the national association of real estate agencies (“narea”) and claimed that in 2007 the monthly market rent for similar flats with a surface area of 70 sq.m some eur 375. the government submitted an expert valuation according to which the monthly market rent for the applicant’s flats in 2010 amounted to eur 330 and eur 160.50 respectively.
the court also noted that the site investigation report and the sketch map had not been drawn up immediately after the incident, that the police had gone to the scene several hours later and had been joined only by d., that the applicant’s objections had not been reflected in the documents, and that the sketch map did not correspond to the statements given by all the witnesses shortly after the incident.it noted that the first-instance court had correctly scrutinised all the evidence and had provided reasons supporting the findings about the unreliability of the witness statements, referring to the testimony of the two passengers.the court upheld the prosecutor’s appeal on points of law, quashed the appellate judgment and ordered a rehearing of the case in accordance with the provisions of article 436 of the code of criminal procedure, namely that any examination had to be in accordance with the rules applicable in proceedings before the first-instance court.19.  pursuant to the verbatim record of the appellate hearing of 25 october 2007 the applicant and his lawyer did not object to the court continuing to examine the case without recalling the victim and did not request the recalling of witnesses.on the same day, the chișinău court of appeal upheld the prosecutor’s appeal, quashed the judgment of the botanica district court of 27 march 2006, found the applicant guilty and ordered him to pay an administrative fine of 3,000 moldovan lei (mdl – approximately 194 euros (eur)) and damages to c. in the amount of mdl 2,500 (approximately eur 162).
8.  on 1 june 2012 the tatabánya police department issued a warrant for the arrest of the applicant in connection with the ongoing criminal proceedings, since the applicant was unreachable at his permanent address.he also stated that he had steady employment and a permanent address, that the alleged offence of which he was suspected was of a minor nature, that he had voluntarily appeared before the investigation authorities, and that he had given a detailed account of events.it argued that the applicant was suspected of committing aggravated fraud as he had been the driver of the truck containing the missing goods and had used false information to identify himself when the goods in question had been handed over to him.the application of the prosecutor’s office for a prolongation of the applicant’s pre-trial detention, dated 2 july 2012, was served on the applicant following the first-instance decision.on appeal, on 9 august 2012, the tatabánya high court partly upheld the applicant’s appeal, finding that there was no risk of his absconding owing to his personal circumstances, namely his mother’s fragile health and his brother’s illness, and the fact that he had voluntarily appeared before the police following the issuing of the arrest warrant.
and he actually sells it.” 9.  on 8 march 2005 m.d., the mayor of the radomsko district (starosta), g.d., the head and spokesperson of the district’s marketing department, and k.h., an employee of that department, lodged a private bill of indictment against the applicant with the radomsko district court.it held that the use of the words “numbskull”, “poser” and “dim‑witted official” in respect of k.h., and the use of the words “dull bosses” in respect of m.d.it is difficult not to agree with the position that the word “numbskull” (“palant”) in the analysed context, although its literal meaning is legally irrelevant, fulfils all the criteria of insult within the meaning of article 216 of the criminal code.however, the court found no grounds to hold that the impugned words had the effect of lowering the private prosecutors in public esteem, or undermining the public confidence necessary for the discharge of their duties as local government officials.by doing so in a newspaper, he fell within the scope of article 216 § 2 of the criminal code, acting unlawfully, reprehensibly, and, in the absence of circumstances capable of precluding or mitigating his guilt, also culpably.” 17.  the trial court noted that the present case involved a conflict between constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech and the right of each citizen to have his reputation protected.
...” 9.  it appears from the forms that the inspection of the office started at 7.30 p.m. and ended at 7.30 a.m. the following morning, 21 august 2002. other sites were inspected at the same time – the car from 7.30 p.m. until 1.34 a.m. and the garage between10.25 and 11.45 p.m. 10.  according to the applicant, for the whole night the police officers questioned him, his wife and the members of their extended family who were on the premises.in his decision, he referred to the search of the office of the applicant and his wife and the seizure of their belongings on 20 august 2002. he further noted that they had been found not to have a license agreement with the law firm s., the official representative of the microsoft corporation, whose software they had used in their business, thereby causing damage to the software copyright owner.on various dates (in particular 24 february 2003, 11 august 2003 and 13 may 2005) the respective authorities rejected his requests, notifying him that his seized property constituted physical evidence in a criminal case, that keeping it in the possession of the authorities was justified by the need to carry out expert assessments and that, more generally, in accordance with article 81 of the code of criminal procedure 1960 (“the ccp”), the fate of the items had to be determined upon the final resolution of the case.the applicant argued that there was no reason to suspect that a crime had been committed justifying the search and seizure of his belongings; that, in breach of the applicable law, the measures had been taken at night-time; that the same people had been appointed as lay witnesses for all three sites, which had been inspected all at the same time; and that following the institution of the criminal proceedings he had not been summoned to participate in any investigative activities.like the lower court, it considered that the applicant had no standing to bring the proceedings at issue and, more generally, that the actions of the police authority complained of could only be challenged before the court examining the criminal case, after the relevant investigation had been completed and the case transferred to the court for examination.
having examined the findings of the child protection agency and the prosecuting authorities in relation to mrs marinova’s complaints, the court concluded that her allegations, the first of which had become known to the school’s headmaster and a pedagogical counsellor in the school, had been false and therefore defamatory.it found that mrs marinova’s allegations that the teacher had ill-treated her son were not supported by the findings of the child protection agency or her son’s or the headmaster’s testimony, and held that information was “disseminated” within the meaning of article 147 § 1 of the criminal code even if only one person had become privy to it.the court examined in detail the results of the internal inquiry carried out pursuant to mr zlatanov’s allegations, tests carried out several hours after the incident on 28 july 2008 and showing that the officer had not consumed alcohol, and the oral evidence of the other officer present at the scene and the officers’ superior.23.  on 23 july and 3 and 14 august 2009 mr findulov made complaints to the inspectorate of the ministry of internal affairs, the ombudsman of the republic and the minister of internal affairs, alleging that one of the officers who had stopped him, whose identity was not known to him, had requested a bribe and had withheld his documents.26.  in a decision of 12 august 2009, the road traffic police department of the burgas regional directorate of the ministry of internal affairs found, on the basis of a report by the two traffic police officers issued in mr findulov’s absence, that he had not used a seatbelt, that one of the tyres of his lorry had been worn out, that he had refused a breathalyser test, and that he had driven away in an unknown direction.
12.  on 21 february 2012 the president of the toulouse administrative court dismissed the urgent application without a hearing, finding as follows: “under the [domestic statutory] provisions, the legality of decisions ordering administrative detention in connection with removal measures can be challenged fully through a specific procedure, which itself has the nature of an urgent procedure, separately from the remit of the urgent applications judge ...; it follows therefrom that the applicants’ request for that judge to order ... the stay of execution of the detention orders made for the purpose of enforcing the removal directions, a stay which would in fact have an equivalent effect to that of the annulment of the same decision on the merits, is inadmissible.” 13.  on the same day, the toulouse administrative court dismissed the application lodged by the first two applicants for the annulment of the administrative detention order, on the following grounds: “it is not in dispute that [the applicants] cannot present any valid identity or travel document; although [they claim] that [they] have a fixed address in an asylum-seekers’ reception centre, it can be seen from the evidence in the file that this centre asked [them] to vacate the premises, where [they have] unduly remained since june 2011; nor [have] the [applicants] adduced evidence of lawful income; lastly, since the notification of the judgment of the orléans administrative court of 18 october 2011 dismissing [their] application against the order of the prefect of loiret of 2 may 2011, [the applicants] [have] avoided the said removal measure; under those circumstances, the choice of the administrative authority to place [them] in administrative detention instead of ordering a measure of restricted residence ... is not vitiated by a manifest error of judgment.” responding more specifically to the argument raised by the applicants concerning the child’s best interests, the administrative court found it to be inapplicable, as the decisions appealed against pertained only to the parents’ personal situation.on 22 february 2012 that judge authorised the extension of the applicants’ detention for a period of twenty days, after finding inadmissible the request for voluntary intervention on behalf of the child, and having dismissed the argument that the conditions of detention were incompatible with the presence of a minor child, on the following grounds: “it is not for the judicial authority to interfere in the running of an administrative detention centre”.as regards aliens who are the parents of minor children and who do not have sufficient guarantees of compliance, such aliens being provided for by article l. 562-1 of the said code, and in accordance with the aims of article 17 of directive 2008/115/ec, recourse to placement in detention can only constitute an exceptional measure in cases where the alien does not have a stable place of abode at the time when the prefectoral authority takes the necessary measures to prepare for the removal.2011‑672 of 16 june 2011, provides: ‘in the cases provided for in article l. 551‑1, where the alien is the parent of a minor child residing in france and has effectively contributed to the raising and education of that child in the conditions prescribed in article 371-2 of the civil code since the birth of the child or at least for the past two years, and where the conditions for a restricted residence measure under article l. 561-2 of the present code are not fulfilled, the administrative authority can decide on a measure of curfew with electronic tagging, with the agreement of the alien concerned.the measure may be extended by the liberties and detention judge under the same conditions as the extension of the administrative detention provided for in chapter ii of title v of the present book.’ 6.  it can be seen from the evidence in the file that on the date of the decision appealed against, mr [a.b.
the record of the provisional arrest, drawn up at the time of the arrest, stated that the applicant had been explained her rights, including the right to a lawyer, and that she had refused to sign the record.the applicant noted that the investigation against her son had been instituted on 17 february 2010, and there had been no indication from that day until her arrest that the police suspected that she had committed any crimes or attempted to interfere with the investigation ‑ on the contrary, she had voluntarily come to the police station to see her son.22.  the applicant further submitted that she had suffered pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage because of the provisional arrest: her blood pressure had risen and as a result she had had to seek medical help and take medication; she had become irritable, had started having nightmares and was scared of police officers; she felt humiliated in front of her son who had been detained in a nearby cell, as well as other inhabitants of her village, who subsequently thought of her as a criminal.the court noted that the termination of the pre-trial investigation against the applicant did not make the investigation unlawful ab initio, and found that there had been sufficient grounds for suspicions against her: plastic bags had been found in the apartment where she lived together with her son v.ž., and remnants of drugs had been found in the applicant’s daughter v.b.’s apartment.it upheld the findings of the first-instance court that at the time of the arrest there had been sufficient evidence to suspect the applicant of having committed a crime, and that the subsequent discontinuation of the pre-trial investigation did not make the arrest unlawful.
it also provided, in article 20, that any administrative proceedings which had not been concluded by the date on which the new law came into force were to be finalised in accordance with the new law (article 17 of the 2001 law provided that article 20 was applicable as of 1 september 2001).8.  the applicant was receiving the full amount of the benefits he was entitled to until october 2001. from that date the benefits were decreased to 70-80% of the amount he had initially been awarded, although the decision of 30 may 2001 had not been amended or superseded by a new decision.9.  consequently, on 12 november 2007 the applicant brought a civil claim against the employment office in the užice municipal court (opštinski sud u užicu), seeking payment of the difference between the benefits he had received and those he had been granted by the employment office and which had been due from 1 november 2004 (a claim for any earlier sum was statute-barred), plus statutory interest and legal costs.17.  acting upon the decisions of the constitutional court, the kragujevac court of appeal (which became the competent court of second instance for the applicant’s case after a reorganisation of courts in serbia in 2010, instead of the užice district court) and the belgrade court of appeal reopened proceedings in cases in which the constitutional court had made such an order and ruled in favour of the plaintiffs.the plan contained a series of measures to be taken at various levels of jurisdiction, and, inter alia, included the following: (i) the adoption of guiding legal opinions based on the principles developed in the case-law of the european court of human rights; (ii) the dissemination of such opinions; (iii) regular information sharing between the courts; (iv) an increased number of thematic discussions and training programmes; (v) the adoption of specific action plans by the courts at various levels; and (vi) the development of various it tools and related intranet databases.
29.  on 1 august 2002 a forensic expert drew up a report examining the nature of the applicant’s injuries and making conclusions as to the speed and direction p.’s car had been travelling, the position of the applicant’s body at the time of the accident, and other relevant factors.34.  on 9 september 2002 the investigator organised a reconstruction of the accident in the presence of the applicant, p. and g. 35.  on 17 september 2002 the investigator questioned m. she denied falsifying the results of the blood test.38.  on 27 september 2002 the investigator questioned an expert, who explained the difference between the results of the two tests of the blood samples taken from the applicant and p. 39.  on 2 october 2002 the investigator questioned the applicant’s father.60.  in the course of the second round of the trial the court examined documentary evidence in the case file and heard over twenty witnesses, including the applicant, p., m., the applicant’s parents, several people who had seen the accident, police officers who had been involved in the initial inquiry, two expert witnesses, attesting witnesses and a number of hearsay witnesses.73.  on an unspecified date the court obtained (through the applicant or otherwise) a letter from an employment assistance agency, panigo, dated 28 march 2003. it said that the agency had an opening for the applicant on an overseas voyage on a six-month contract basis, with a salary of usd 2,500. a letter from another shipping company, valmars ltd, which had the applicant’s name on a waiting list for an offer of employment at the time of the accident, said that he could have earned usd 550 working as an operator mechanic on a ship in 2003. it also indicated that on overseas voyages on foreign ships, the pay of operator mechanics varied between usd 700 and 2,300.
it was stipulated that unless the applicants and their company paid their outstanding debts by 1 may 2009, the creditors were entitled to institute enforcement proceedings for payment of the debt through the sale of the applicants’ house.17.  a further set of enforcement proceedings against the applicants was joined to the proceedings at issue on 13 may 2011. in those proceedings, an enforcement order had been issued against the applicants at the request of bank p. on 24 january 2011, in respect of an unpaid loan of 14 february 2006 in the amount of 159,688.87 swiss francs.27.  on 22 february 2013 the poreč municipal court declared the applicants’ appeal on points of law inadmissible on the grounds that such an appeal was allowed in enforcement proceedings only if based on section 382(2) of the civil procedure act, which was not the case.36.  on 20 january 2014 the pula county court dismissed the applicants’ appeal against the decision of 17 september 2013 (see paragraph 32 above), finding that the municipal court had acted in accordance with the law, namely the provisions of the enforcement act.37.  on 23 january 2014 the pula county court accepted the applicants’ appeal against the decision of 22 february 2013 (see paragraph 27 above) and remitted the applicants’ appeal on points of law to the municipal court.
9.  during the first-instance court’s hearing, the applicant organisation admitted that the parties had a dispute over the royalty rate in the draft licence agreement negotiated by the parties, but that the court was precluded under section 41 of the copyright law from setting the rate as long as there was no licence agreement concluded between the parties (see paragraph 26 below).14.  on the issue of ordering the conclusion of a licence agreement, the appellate court observed that both parties had expressed their intention to enter into a such an agreement, as attested by a draft licence agreement of 7 october 2003 in which the parties had agreed on certain terms and conditions such as the duration of the licence and the income from which royalties should be calculated.the appellate court accordingly recognised that the licence agreement was to be considered concluded in the wording as agreed by the parties on 7 october 2003. on the question of remuneration, the appellate court established that in the negotiation process the applicant organisation had changed the royalty rate from 6% to 4% and then to 3.5%, whereas the defendant had insisted on 1.6% of the income from which royalties should be calculated.15.  on 11 february 2004, following an appeal on points of law, the senate of the supreme court upheld the appellate court’s findings that after the expiry of the earlier licence agreement on 31 december 1998 the de facto contractual relationship between the parties had continued mainly owing to the fact that the applicant organisation had failed to reach an agreement with the defendant on the terms of the licence agreement.as the parties had not asked the court to decide on the exact terms and conditions of a licence agreement, the appellate court decided to impose on the parties a general obligation to conclude a licence agreement by 1 march 2004. given that the parties had been unable to agree on a royalty rate, the appellate court set the rate at 3% of the defendant’s net turnover.
everything is being decided on the basis of power and connections, not on the basis of laws.” 8.  the judge‑rapporteur at the kazanlak district court became aware of that statement when processing the appeal, which, in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure, had been filed with that court with a view to being sent to the higher court for examination.concerning the grounds for recusal of the judge‑rapporteur, the court noted as follows: “in relation to the arguments that there existed grounds for the [judge‑rapporteur] to recuse himself, it is well-established case-law that the refusal of the court to accede to a recusal request is reviewable on appeal.bearing in mind the effective sentence – which corresponds neither to the gravity of the offence nor to the dangerousness of the offender –, the reasons given for its imposition – to protect other members of society and the judicial authorities from future civil claims brought by the [applicant] –, and the unwarranted emotionality of the [lower court’s] reasoning, this court finds that the judgment under appeal does not demonstrate the requisite subjective or objective impartiality.the bias displayed by the judge‑rapporteur constituted grounds for him to recuse himself.” 11.  on 4 june 2007 the judge-rapporteur in the criminal case against the applicant brought a private criminal prosecution against him in relation to the written and the oral statements made by the applicant in the appeal proceedings (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above).in an additional brief, the applicant’s counsel submitted, inter alia, that the lower court had failed to explain why it had found that the applicant’s statements had been “disseminated”, given that the appellate judges to whom they had been addressed had been under the duty not to disclose professional secrets and that no third parties had access to the file containing the statements.
it was identified as belonging to [the applicant] who, it emerged later, was a security guard at the garage complex ... he refused to give any statements and refused to go to the police station, so the officers asked him to identify himself, which he also refused to do, and therefore the officers tried to take him into custody and put him into the police car ... [the applicant] resisted the officers, punched one of them in the face, pushed and jostled them to try to avoid being apprehended, used various russian swear words ... and threatened the officers ... he mentioned that he had friends in high-level positions.the court held that the investigation had not been thorough because it had not determined whether the use of force by the police officers had been within the limits provided by the police activity act (see paragraph 49 below), and it had not established the circumstances surrounding the injury to the applicant’s abdomen.he stated: “[w]hen i was on my way to the garage complex, fifteen to twenty metres from the guard booth, i saw a police car and stopped by the corner of the garage wall ... next to [the applicant’s] car there were two officers in police uniforms and [the applicant] ... i heard one of the officers ask [the applicant] to whom the car belonged ... [the applicant] said that the car was his and that he would get the keys so that the officers could examine the car ... i saw [the applicant] turn round to go to the guard booth and then the larger police officer with a moustache grabbed him by the shoulder ... twisted his arm ... and the other officer twisted his other arm.during the first questioning i said that he had punched an officer, but i may have been wrong because i didn’t consider this an important circumstance; also, during that questioning i wasn’t asked exactly whether there had been a punch or just an attempt to punch – as i said before, [the applicant] was jostling the officers, so it seemed to me that he had punched an officer.” 42.  on 7 june 2010 the prosecutor discontinued the pre‑trial investigation, relying on essentially the same grounds as in the previous decisions (see paragraphs 23, 35 and 39 above), and a senior prosecutor dismissed the applicant’s appeal.the prosecutor relied on essentially the same grounds as the jonava district prosecutor in its earlier decisions (see paragraphs 23, 35, 39 and 42 above), and concluded that the applicant’s statements had been inconsistent, whereas the consistent statements of all the police officers had shown that the use of force had been a lawful and proportionate response to the applicant’s resistance and his refusal to comply with the officers’ lawful orders.
5.  on 2 september 2004 the applicant was arrested on the charges of fraud and forgery of official documents.on 4 september 2004 the tsentralnyy district court of chita authorised the applicant’s pre-trial detention.the court reasoned as follows: “the evidence collected ... incriminated [the applicant] ... in a serious crime which entails a custodial sentence exceeding ten years.however, ... it considers that, if at large, [the applicant] might put pressure on victims and witnesses or otherwise interfere with administration of justice or continue criminal activities, accordingly, ... the court considers it necessary to remand [the applicant] in custody.” 6.  on 11 november 2004 the chita regional court upheld the decision of 2 september 2004 on appeal.the court extended his pre-trial detention on several occasions reiterating, in substance, the reasoning employed by the district court on 2 september 2004.
the investigating judge instructed (a) the belgrade police’s expert team and the factory experts to continue looking for those involved who had died or survived; (b) the crime-scene technician to collect and register all traces, objects and details which might help to elucidate the account of the events and to make an appropriate file in that respect; (c) the removal of all the corpses to the institute for forensic medicine for post-mortem examinations to determine the cause of death; and (d) the transfer of all the survivors to the appropriate medical centres.and p.p., submitted their report to the ddpo on 9 august 1995. as regards the cause and origin of the accident, the experts stated (a) that the explosion appeared to have been initially caused by the heat generated by the mill’s rollers during the production of composite fuel; (b) that static electricity could not have ignited the composite fuel, premix or fuel sheet; (c) that the primary blast of the premix or the composite fuel sheet on the mill’s two counter-rotating rollers had most probably been caused by the presence of a mechanical object in the premix, which had ended up between the rollers; and (d) that the initial blast had led to two secondary explosions of the premix, which was stored in two aluminum bins next to the mill.in their reply of 15 april 1997, the experts clarified that (a) on 23 june 1995 at the scene of the incident, where they had gone ex officio, the investigating judge had instructed them orally to establish the cause of the explosion; (b) they had not made any plan or programme for the expert report; (c) they had not had sufficient information (for example, on the original premix or the final product) to examine and determine the cause of the blast, but they had found traces of ap at the accident scene and had been provided with the formulae of the premix by jpl; (d) they could not say whether the fire had started on the rollers, the fuel or the rocket-fuel sheet; (e) they had not found any documentation about the planning or technology programme of the production of rocket fuel which had led to the blast; and that (f) their task had been to establish the cause of, and not the responsibility for, the explosion.while not excluding the possibility that the cause of the explosion might have been the one suggested by the police experts, the expert observed that the possible exposure of ap to humidity could have made it sensitive to an organic compound and the explosion could have been caused by a piece of paper, wood or engine oil, especially in the presence of unwanted metal or soot particles.31.  the expert also noted the following issues as relevant: (a) although explosive, carcinogenic and other dangerous substances were used during the production process, no technical-technological documentation and certificates for them had been found; (b) the purity of the components, especially of ap, was questionable (it was described as light pink powder, whereas it was a white, crystalline substance); (c) the samples revealed, unusually, included the presence of phosphates, which were not components of composite fuel, or equipment for the maintenance of the mill or the building itself; (d) the production process and technology did not seem to have been accurately specified and followed, as certain components had been added and mixed on the mill in the course of the production process; and (e) an unacceptably high number of individuals present had indicated that they did not know what had been produced and that other safety measures had probably not been taken.
6.  on 13 august 1996 the voznesensk local prosecutor’s office in the mykolayiv region started an investigation into the murder of four persons on 12 august 1996.the same day the investigation in respect of the applicant was suspended until he was apprehended; the criminal proceedings continued in respect of the other suspects.the applicant was accused of strangling a., of killing four persons together with g. in 1996 and inflicting grievous bodily harm on r. in a murder attempt, the latter crime in the context of the extortion of r’s brother.15.  on 22 may 2008 the investigation was completed and on 26 june 2008 the case was transferred to the donetsk regional court of appeal.18.  on 15 july 2010 the supreme court of ukraine upheld the judgment of 10 july 2009. on that day the applicant’s lawyer submitted an additional appeal claiming that the court of appeal had to apply the most favourable wording of the relevant provisions of the criminal code, which was that between 29 december 1999 and 29 march 2000 when the death penalty had already been abolished and life imprisonment had not yet been introduced.
16.  the childcare authority and v. instituted court proceedings seeking to deprive the applicant of his parental responsibility over n. the applicant brought a counterclaim, challenging the childcare authority’s refusal to return the child to him and seeking the termination of v.’s guardianship over n. 17.  on 16 august 2012 the dzerzhinskiy district court dismissed the application by the childcare authority and v. to deprive the applicant of his parental responsibility over n. it also dismissed the applicant’s counterclaim to end v.’s guardianship over n. and to return n. to him.the district court took the following factual elements into consideration: -  the applicant was the father of n., a minor, aged seven years old at the time; -  the child’s mother had died on 15 february 2009 from multiple stab and cut wounds inflicted on her by the child’s father, the applicant; -  pursuant to the decision of 25 may 2010 the applicant had been exempted from criminal responsibility for the murder of his wife and ordered to have compulsory psychiatric treatment in a psychiatric hospital; -  the murder had been committed in the presence of the child; -  on 25 february 2011 the compulsory psychiatric measures in respect of the applicant had been lifted; -  on 3 april 2009 the child’s maternal grandmother v. had been appointed the child’s guardian; -  the child resided with v., his housing conditions were adequate and he had been provided with the necessary clothing, a place for play and rest, as well as toys and books; -  the applicant wished to see the child on a weekly basis, on saturdays or sundays, by taking him out to the cinema, theatre and other places for children and by being afforded an opportunity to stay with the child at his paternal grandparents’ house; -  on 16 august 2012 the dzerzhinskiy district court had dismissed the claims of the childcare authority and v. to deprive the applicant of his parental responsibility over n. and had dismissed the applicant’s counterclaim to end v.’s guardianship over n. and to return n. to him; -  the applicant’s housing conditions were adequate; -  the childcare authority had expressed a view that the applicant’s claim should be dismissed as being contrary to the child’s interests; -  that according to the report of 2 may 2009 issued by the municipal centre for children’s psychological, medical and social adaptation, presented by v.: “during the examination n. behaved restlessly, he wandered from room to room and performed chaotic movements with the keys.[the psychologist] therefore came to the conclusion that n. needed timely psychological or psychotherapeutic assistance to overcome the consequences of a psychological trauma.” -  reports from n.’s nursery school, dated november 2008, and from his current kindergarten; -  the carrying out of a psychological examination of the child, as ordered by the court on 5 september 2012, had been impossible owing to v.’s refusal to allow the experts to have access to the boy, meaning the case material was returned to the court by the expert without enforcement.he also complained that neither he nor his counsel had been informed of the date of the hearing of 14 may 2013. lastly, he enclosed an expert opinion of 17 may 2013, which read as follows: “conclusions: 1.  in view of the incompleteness of the data [failure to examine n. in view of v.’s refusal to give the experts access to n.], the experts consider that at the present time only short meetings between [the applicant] and the child are possible (not more than two hours 2-3 times per month) in public places on condition that the child has a positive or neutral attitude towards the father.2.  an assessment of whether contact between the child and his father could damage the child’s health or psychological development is impossible given the absence of any data on the child’s psychological stability, his attitude to his father at the present time, or the influence of relatives on the child’s attitude to his father.” 31.  on 26 june 2013 the applicant complained to the perm regional judicial department that the judge had included a false statement in the case file that he had been informed of the date of the hearing by mobile telephone.
on 28 january 2012 she had gone to the parents of her husband and discovered that at least six law-enforcement officers had been conducting a search of their house and that the head of the group had been a certain mr a.g. the latter had then told the second applicant that she had to go with them to the police station to provide a statement concerning someone who had allegedly been hiding in her flat, as he was wanted by the authorities for the murder of an fss officer.explaining the decision to overrule the suspension of the investigation the deputy head of the dagestan investigations department stated, inter alia, the following: “... the decision to suspend the investigation was taken in violation of article 208 § 5 of the criminal procedure code – that is to say prematurely, – given that all possible steps had not been taken ... in connection with the above, the decision should be overruled as unlawful and the investigation should be resumed.34.  on 1 october 2012 the investigation was resumed again after criticism from the deputy head of the dagestan investigations department, who stated, inter alia, the following: “... in violation of part 5 of article 208 of the criminal procedure code the investigation failed to take all the investigative steps possible to establish the [identity of the perpetrators]; therefore, the decision to suspend the proceedings should be overruled as unlawful.however, the investigation [in the present case] failed to question close relatives of sirazhudin aliyev and gazimagomed abdullayev ... the list of mobile telephone calls [made by the abducted men] has not been examined; replies to ten requests for information forwarded to the law-enforcement agencies and state bodies have not been received ...” 37.  on 4 february 2013 the investigators were ordered to comply with the above instructions within one month and the investigation of the criminal case was forwarded to the investigations department of the leninskiy district prosecutor’s office in makhachkala.the decision stated, amongst other things, the following: “... the decision to suspend the investigation is premature and unsubstantiated for the following reasons: the investigators failed to carry out in full the [supervisory authorities’] orders of 12 august 2013 ... [they] failed to question ms z.a., who organised the [first applicant’s] meeting with the persons who had pointed out that the abduction had been perpetrated by officers of law-enforcement agencies ... the witness statement of ms m.a.
as it has been established that during investigation [the applicant] stated that he intended to leave russia and talked on the phone with a person living in geneva ..., if released, [the applicant] might abscond, commit another offence, and threaten witnesses or other parties to criminal proceedings, destroy evidence or in any other way interfere with the investigation...”.9.  on 19 april 2011 the district court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention on the following grounds: “[the applicant] is accused of an extremely serious offence entailing 10 years’ imprisonment.the courts referred also to the applicant’s family status, personality, state of health, possibility to put pressure on witnesses and interfere with the investigation, absence of job.in particular, on 25 january 2012 the court held as follows: “... taking into account the personality of the accused, his family status, state of health and other circumstances, the court shall grant the investigator’s request and extend [the applicant’s] detention”.15.  on 19 june 2013 the krasnodar regional court acquitted the applicant of all charges and held that the applicant be informed of the right to rehabilitation.
6.  the company was set up in 2003 in accordance with a decision of head of the troitsko-pechorskiy district (“the district administration”) as a commercial organisation performing the following activities, among others: renovation and maintenance of the municipal housing stock; heating and water supply to the district population and enterprises; maintenance of the sewage systems; maintenance services in respect of municipal housing and adjacent territories; and providing real estate registration services in the troitsko-pechorskiy district.8.  on the dates tabulated in the appendix below the justice of the peace of the troitsko‑pechorskiy court circuit of the komi republic by separate judgments and court writs ordered the company to pay the applicants salary arrears.15.  on 3 march 2010 the federal commercial court of the volgo‑vyatskiy circuit rejected the claim in the cassation instance, and on 12 july 2010 the supreme commercial court refused to accept for examination a request for supervisory review of that judgment.the housing and objects of the engineering infrastructure on 30 january 2006 had been withdrawn “in order to apply the housing policy” and to “reduce the company’s expenses for the maintenance of the infrastructure objects”.finally, even though at the insolvency stage the company proved unable to meet the creditors’ claims, the claimant had failed to demonstrate that the owner “knew or ought to have known that [the transfer of the assets] would have led to the company’s insolvency”.
it ordered the debtor company to pay the applicant, within a grace period of eight days (a) the sums it had been ordered to pay under the judgment of 1 june 2006 (that is to say the main debt, together with accrued statutory default interest, and the costs of the civil proceedings, see paragraph 6 above), (b) the statutory default interest accrued on the costs of the civil proceedings from the date of delivery of that judgment, and (c) the costs of enforcement proceedings, together with the statutory default interest accrued on those costs from the date of issuance of the writ of execution.14.  upon receiving, on 27 february 2009, the final judgment of the criminal court of 17 january 2008 (see paragraph 7 above), the debtor company on 9 march 2009 sent a letter containing a set-off statement to the applicant’s legal representative whereby it set off (prijeboj) its claim for compensation against the applicant stemming from that judgment with his claim for payment of overtime work against the debtor company stemming from the judgment he was seeking to enforce.15.  on the same day, 9 march 2009, the debtor company informed the court that it had received the above-mentioned final judgment of the criminal court and that it had executed the set-off described above (see the preceding paragraph).18.  following an appeal lodged by the applicant, on 21 january 2010 the osijek county court quashed the first-instance decision of 27 march 2009 (see paragraph 16 above) in so far as it allowed the postponement of the enforcement and in this respect remitted the case.21.  on 24 may 2011 the applicant informed the đakovo municipal court that the judgment declaring the enforcement inadmissible in part had become final (see paragraph 17 above) and asked it to continue with the enforcement in the remaining part.
this included the assessment of several reports from the appointed guardian ad litem, an opinion from a psychology expert seeking to establish the circumstances of the relationship between the applicant and the child, personal and financial circumstances of the applicant, his medical condition as well as the medical reports of the child.it also stayed the proceedings in respect of the applicant’s right to contact with his child because the child had reached the age of majority in the meantime.11.  on 6 october 2011 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s constitutional complaint in respect of the length of the proceedings on the ground that the matter at stake was complicated due to the three aforesaid interrelated claims.the constitutional court took into account the sensitive nature of the case and the district court’s repeated requests for an expert opinion in order to assess the best interest of the child.12.  subsequently, on 21 march 2012, the žilina regional court dealt with the applicant’s second appeal and delivered the judgment on the merits of the case, which became final on 2 april 2012. it partly upheld the district court’s judgment and partly amended it.
the detention orders were essentially based on the gravity of the charges, the primary grounds being the risk of the applicants’ absconding and interfering with the course of justice.6.  the first applicant was born in 1982 and was detained in irkutsk.7.  on 23 december 2008 the first applicant, a police officer at the material time, was arrested and placed in pre-trial detention.on 7 november 2011 the irkutsk regional court convicted him of abuse of power, and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment and disqualification from holding public office for one year.8.  the second applicant was born in 1967 and was detained in penza.
11.  on 30 january 2009 the district court awarded custody of the child to the applicant, on the basis of the evidence in the case file, including the witness evidence and a report made by the child protection agency following a visit in the applicant’s home.after the applicant’s visit to bulgaria, the child was brought before the court on 17 october 2011. the child told the court in a private hearing, with the help of a bulgarian translator, that she would prefer to stay with her father and paternal grandparents in bulgaria; that she spoke on the phone with her mother occasionally; that she could not remember her maternal grandmother; and that she did not like being in romania.25.  following the suspension of the enforcement proceedings brought by the applicant in bulgaria (see the preceding paragraph), on 12 january 2012, within the context of the reopening of the proceedings for recognition of the romanian judgment, the supreme court of cassation quashed the decision of the sofia court appeal of 16 april 2010 (see paragraph 20 above).they advised the applicant to apply directly to the bulgarian courts (under article 29 of the hague convention) or to the bulgarian ministry of justice (either directly or through the romanian ministry of justice, under the provisions of the european convention on recognition and enforcement of decisions concerning custody of children and on restoration of custody of children – “the luxembourg convention” – see paragraph 45 below).his request for interim measures, namely for the child to live with his parents in bulgaria and for him to have custody of her, as well as for the suspension of the enforcement proceedings brought in 2010 in bulgaria by the applicant, was refused by the same court in april 2011. the court suspended the proceedings on 2 december 2011 as it had determined that another set of proceedings – between the same parties concerning the same issue – was pending in romania (see paragraphs 9 to 17 above).
5.  in the morning of 14 june 2007 policemen came to the applicant’s flat and took him to the police station in pospelikha village in the altay region (“the police station”) for an interview.the court noted that the applicant had been informed about the date and place of the hearing but, as he was serving a term of imprisonment, his presence in person could not be ensured.on 5 july 2007 the justice of the peace of the pospelikhinskiy district of the altay region examined the case in the applicant’s absence.the judgment indicated that the applicant was serving a term of imprisonment and that he had been informed in a timely way about the date and place of the hearing.on 10 october 2007 the pospelikhinskiy district court upheld the judgment on appeal, endorsing the findings of the justice of the peace.
6.  on 28 april 2010 the applicant brought an enforcement action before the smederevo court of first instance (osnovni sud u smederevu) against a socially/state-owned company “fžv želvoz a.d. smederevo” (the debtor).12.  on 21 march 2013 the applicant urged the court to continue the enforcement proceedings.13.  on 7 june 2013 the court informed the applicant that the debtor was still undergoing restructuring and that therefore the enforcement proceedings could not be continued.20.  on 20 march 2013 the applicant urged the court to continue the enforcement proceedings.21.  on 22 march 2013 the court informed the applicant that the debtor was still undergoing restructuring and that therefore the enforcement proceedings could not be continued.
in view of the above, moving the child to his father’s care [posed] a grave risk to his emotional [and] social development, [and] could cause a situation [which] for a two-year-old child [would be] difficult to bear.” 13.  apart from the rodk report, the domestic court obtained the following evidence: testimony from the applicant, e.n.20.  the appellate court observed that international and domestic practice required that article 13 (b) be given a restrictive reading to the effect that, in principle, any unfavourable consequences of the child’s separation stemming from the order to surrender the child by the abducting parent did not give rise to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm within the meaning of that provision.it also protected (under article 12) very young children from possible harmful effects of the return if it was shown that the parent seeking the return had not taken care of the child before the abduction or that the child had already adapted to the new environment.the domestic court relied on the following elements of the case: the applicant’s son had arrived in poland with both parents at the age of six and a half months, in april 2011; since then the child had been taken care of solely by his mother; the most important element in his life was his contact with the mother; he did not have any memories of his life in canada; and the applicant had not considered the child’s remaining in poland illegal prior to october 2011. the appellate court also observed that by not appearing at the rodk interview, the applicant had waived his right to demonstrate that he could establish adequate contact with his young child and that the applicant had only seen his child once since the latter’s departure from canada.34.  on 27 october 2011 the ontario superior court of justice in canada held that the child’s retention in poland was wrongful and issued an interim order granting full custody of the child to the applicant, authorising him and the law-enforcement authorities to apprehend the child and ordering e.n.
5.  while in detention, the applicants mr baban, mr barkov and mr bogatyrev sought compensation for inadequate conditions of their detention and substandard medical care; the applicants mr davydov, mr pflyaum and mr yakovlev were involved in contract disputes; mr fedchenko was the respondent in a divorce claim; mr starodubtsev challenged the decision by which he had lost the status of a disabled person; and mr shavayev was the defendant in an action for damages brought by the federal customs service.6.  none of the applicants, apart from mr yakovlev, were able to attend the hearings before the courts of first instance.the domestic courts refused the applicants leave to be present at the hearings, on the ground that there was no domestic legal provision for bringing detainees to courts.in some of the cases they quoted article 77.1 of the code on the execution of sentences (see paragraph 10 below) and the relevant provisions of the code of civil procedure.the appeal courts either dismissed their arguments and endorsed the findings of the first-instance courts or concluded that their absence from court was in line with the legislation and did not contravene the principle of fairness.
under the classified information protection act, permits granting access to classified information that had been issued under the legal provisions existing before the entry into force of the act were to remain valid until their replacement by security clearance allowing access to classified information.the heads of organisational units employing persons who possessed an access permit and whose positions required that they have access to classified information were to request the issuance of security clearance, in accordance with the requirements of the act.she contested the objectivity and the lawfulness of the dismissal procedure, arguing that she had fulfilled all conditions for the issuance of security clearance and that she had been dismissed on account of the negative personal relationship between her and her direct supervisor.12.  by its judgment of 11 may 2005 the sofia district court rejected the applicant’s claims, reasoning that the refusal of the director of the national security service to grant security clearance to the applicant was a final and valid administrative act, and it rendered the applicant’s dismissal inevitable because she was no longer able to perform her duties.the court added that the refusal was not amenable to any judicial review; therefore, the court was not competent to examine, within the framework of the dismissal proceedings, any substantial or procedural questions related to its lawfulness.
the applicants discovered then that the land had been collectivised after 1945 and that in 1991 the heirs of the pre-collectivisation owner, mr k., had instituted restitution proceedings under the relevant provisions of the agricultural land act (“the ala”, see paragraph 13 below).their restitution request had been allowed in a court judgment of 7 december 1995 and in a decision issued by the competent administrative body ‒ the local agricultural land commission ‒ on 4 april 1996. thereafter, the heirs of mr k. had transferred the land to the persons who had later taken possession of the plot.it relied on the provision of section 10(13) of the ala (see paragraph 15 below), holding on its basis that of the two rival claims to the same land the law gave priority to the one based on restitution.it considered in particular that section 10(13) of the ala was not applicable to the case as it had only been introduced in 1997, that is to say after the restitution decision in favour of mr k.’s heirs and after the applicants had bought the plot of land.as to the exception contained in section 18z(3) of the regulations for the ala’s implementation, also introduced in 1997 (see paragraph 16 below), the supreme court considered it inapplicable to the case; in its view, section 18z(3) only precluded the restitution of properties which had been the subject of transactions prior to the ala’s entry into force in 1991, whereas the applicants had bought their plot in 1993.
10.  in a letter of 28 november 2011, the head of the chief directorate for the execution of sentences informed the governor of plovdiv prison that the inquiry had not found familial relationships or improper contacts between x and any of the prison officers, or a risk for mr shahanov.it held that it was lawful and that, in view of the results of the inquiry carried out pursuant to mr shahanov’s complaints and the evidence gathered in the proceedings before it, the prison governor had been correct to find that mr shahanov had made defamatory statements and false allegations against prison officers.for their part, the government submitted a letter from the administration of plovdiv prison according to which mr shahanov’s correspondence was being controlled in the manner envisaged in the applicable regulations, which meant that the prison authorities only checked the physical content of the letters, not their text.16.  the next day, 24 may 2012, with the help of another inmate who knew bulgarian, mr palfreeman wrote the following complaint to the governor of sofia prison: “on 23 may 2012, during the midday visit, personal items of visitors were stolen from the visitors’ lockers, which are only accessible to the guards.he argued, inter alia, that his disciplinary punishment was in breach of section 90(5) of the 2009 act (see paragraph 25 below) and this court’s case-law, that deprivation of the right to receive food parcels was a serious sanction in view of the insufficient quantity of food provided by the prison, and that it was an attempt to cow him into not making complaints against the prison administration.
9.  after three remittal orders, on 29 november 2005 the first-instance court dismissed the applicant’s claim, finding that she had been dismissed on 28 february 2001 on the basis of the regulations, which had been adopted by the employer and approved by the government on 27 february 2001. it further found that the government’s approval had been received by the employer on 2 march 2001, but that had been irrelevant given that it was only the date when approval had been given by the government that was important for the entry into force of the regulations.10.  on 14 december 2005 the applicant appealed, arguing inter alia that the regulations could not have applied to her case, as it could only be adopted after the employer had received the government’s approval.the applicant relied on another final judgment of the skopje court of appeal (“the appellate court”) in a similar case concerning a former colleague of the applicant, in which it had been established that the regulations had not entered into force at the time of the dismissal (see paragraph 17 below).it found that the government had approved the regulations on 27 february 2001, that they had entered into force the same day, and that the applicant’s dismissal of 28 february 2001 was therefore lawful.in it she argued, inter alia, that the regulations could only be adopted after the government’s approval had been obtained, and that they had thus not entered into force at the time of her dismissal.
12.  the public prosecution service (“the pps”) was informed of the arrest and, at 11.10 p.m. the case file, along with the responsibility for the detention of the young men, was passed on to an investigator from the local district police.28.  the interlocutory appeal and the requests for review were eventually dismissed by the office of the prosecutor general (“the opg”), which communicated its decision to the applicant in a letter of 29 september 2011. the pps fully endorsed the findings of cis, considering as crucial the fact that before the doctor on 19 december 2010 the applicant had only alleged slapping, that the doctor’s observations on the applicant’s injury did not correspond to the applicant’s subsequent allegation of sustained beating, and that the applicant had not raised any ill-treatment allegation with the investigator on 19 december 2010. without any explanation, the pps also concluded that there was no indication of any racial motive behind the treatment complained of by the applicant.29.  as to the part of the applicant’s criminal complaint concerning the alleged failure to notify his legal guardians of his arrest and detention, to provide him with food and water during his detention, and to hear him immediately after his arrest (see paragraph 24 above), the district police informed the applicant in a letter of 8 june 2011, without any explanation at all, that “in the investigation of the given matter, no error had been committed by the investigative organs”.allegedly, in the course of the actual apprehension and subsequent detention, several individuals were ill-treated by the police.... 17.  in its report on the 2009 visit, the cpt referred to the incident of 21 march 2009, concerning the case of six roma juveniles who had allegedly been forced, under threat of physical assault by police officers, to strip naked in a police station in košice and to slap each other.the committee is concerned to note that, according to the information provided by the slovak authorities during the 2013 visit, i.e. four-and‑a-half years after the alleged incident, the criminal case was still pending before the first instance court.... ...” 3.  un committee against torture (cat): concluding observations on the third periodic report of slovakia (2007-2013) of 8 september 2015 (cat/c/svk/co/3) 35.  in paragraph 11 of its report, the committee expressed its concern: “... (d) that no charges were brought against police officers who participated in the raid on 19 june 2013 on the roma settlement of moldava nad bodvou in eastern slovakia, which resulted in the apprehension of 15 persons, a number of whom reportedly were seriously ill-treated by the police during their apprehension and subsequent detention; (e) that all 10 policemen who physically abused and inflicted degrading treatment on six roma juveniles in the city of košice on 21 march 2009 were acquitted in the first instance judgement by the košice ii district court on 27 february 2015, since the court refused to admit the video recording of the incriminating act as a legally obtained piece of evidence.
16.  on 16 january 2015 a judge of the primorsk regional court extended the applicant’s detention until 23 july 2015. the applicant’s lawyer appealed, arguing that the applicant would be deprived of judicial review of his detention for a long period of time.22.  on 12 december 2014 the primorsk regional court rejected his appeal in the light of the diplomatic assurances given by the kyrgyz authorities and the improvement of the situation in kyrgyzstan.it noted in particular that in addition to the diplomatic assurances provided in writing by the kyrgyz authorities, the representatives of the general consulate of the russian federation in this country were able to monitor the situation of persons already extradited to kyrgyzstan, including those held in relation to the mass disorders.in the supreme court’s view, such a monitoring mechanism was effective in observing compliance by the kyrgyz authorities with their obligations to ensure the rights of the extradited persons, including the right not to be subjected to torture and inhuman treatment.28.  on 18 july 2014 the fms dismissed his appeal on account of his prolonged failure to apply for refugee status and in view of the opportunity offered to the russian diplomats to monitor the compliance by the kyrgyz authorities with international standards as regards persons extradited from russia.
8.  on 10 october 2003 the prosecutor’s office instituted criminal proceedings to investigate the allegations of medical negligence and failure to ensure the right of the applicant’s daughter to free medical aid.the experts considered that the principal cause of death was the nature and seriousness of the illnesses, which had caused the patient’s brain to swell.15.  on 5 november 2008 the turiysk district court returned the case to the prosecutor’s office stating that the prosecutor had not complied with procedural requirements when submitting the case file to the court.23.  on 7 march 2012 the starovyzhivskyy district court found that the applicant had sustained non-pecuniary damage on account of the professional misconduct of dr g. the court awarded the applicant 20,000[1] ukrainian hryvnias in respect of non-pecuniary damage.in its reasons the court referred to the findings of the domestic court dealing with the criminal case against dr g. the court further found that, in accordance with the statutory documents of the kovel inter-district territorial medical association, that legal entity was obliged to pay the amount awarded.
...” regarding the assessment of the applicants’ refugee status, as well as their need for alternative protection, the agency held as follows: “... the migration agency notes that [the first applicant] had a contract with the americans until 2008. for this reason [the first applicant] has been exposed to two murder attempts, his brother has been kidnapped and [the first and second applicant]’s daughter has been killed.in accordance with the principle that it is for an asylum-seeker to justify his or her need for protection and that it is primarily for the applicant to provide relevant information for the assessment in the case, the onus must be on the applicant to plead that he or she cannot or, owing to a severe fear of the consequences, for example, will not avail himself or herself of the protection of the authorities available in iraq.against the background of the fact that [the first and second applicants] have not even tried to seek the protection of the iraqi authorities, the migration agency considers that they have not made a plausible case that they would not have access to protection by the authorities in the event of potential threats from al-qaeda upon returning to iraq.against this background, the migration agency finds that [the first and second applicants] have not made a plausible case that the iraqi authorities lack the capacity and the will to protect the family from being exposed to persecution within the meaning of chapter 4, section 1, of the aliens act or to abuses within the meaning of chapter 4, section 2, first subsection, first point, first line, of the aliens act.the applicants have alleged that they are in need of protection upon returning to iraq as they risk being exposed to ill-treatment by al-qaeda because [the first applicant]’s company did contract-based work for the americans in iraq until 2008. the migration court considers that the alleged events took place in the distant past, that it is difficult to see why there would still be a threat as [the first applicant] no longer performs such work, and that, in the event that some threats should still exist, it appears likely [framstår som troligt] that the iraqi law-enforcement authorities are both willing and able to offer the applicants the necessary protection.
37.  that day, 8 june 2009, the police investigator ordered a forensic medical assessment of the injuries on the basis of the available documentary evidence (the ambulance cards, patient registration card and the statements of the applicant, the suspects in the case and two other police officers as witnesses).he stated that the police had not taken the investigative measures he had requested on 15 may 2009 (including the presentation of the police officers for identification; a formal confrontation between the applicant and m.z., who had allegedly witnessed him committing a breach of the peace; a comparison of the applicant’s statements with the circumstances at the scene of the alleged offence; a forensic medical examination of the applicant’s injuries; and interviews with the children that the applicant’s representative had identified and about whom he had informed the police investigator on 27 may 2009).he submitted among other things that the investigation had not been objective, that the statements of witnesses had been selectively cited and distorted, that some of the witnesses (such as y.b., who had seen the applicant’s arrest, and a.d., who had been detained in the police station at the same time as the applicant) had not been questioned, that he himself had not had a forensic medical examination; and that formal confrontations to eliminate any contradictions in statements in the case had not been arranged.58.  the court, pointing to the fact that it was unlawfully obtained evidence, set aside the applicant’s statements given on 30 april 2009 at 2.15 a.m. in the hospital, and which had been contained in the misdemeanour report drafted the same night at 2.40 a.m. it noted that the evidence had been gathered more than eight hours after the offence had allegedly been committed and after the person had in the meantime been taken to sober up, at 7.45 p.m. 59.  the court considered that the witness m.z.61.  the court further stated that there had been a material violation of the provisions governing misdemeanour proceedings because the applicant had been arrested at 5.40 p.m. and transported immediately to the police station, but had not been taken to sober up until 7.45 p.m.; also, his statement had only been taken at the hospital at 2.15 a.m. and the misdemeanour report not drafted at the hospital until 2.40 a.m. 62.  the east police prefecture did not appeal against that judgment.
7.  at 2.30 a.m. on 15 october 2008 two gendarme officers from the crime scene investigation unit of the menemen provincial gendarmerie command arrived at the site of the incident, which was located by a farm by the name of “dürüs” (“the dürüs farm”), to carry out a preliminary investigation and to prepare a scene-of-incident report (on the instructions of the foça public prosecutor).when the gendarme officers asked the applicant whether he had been in ongoing conflict with anyone and whether he had heard any gunshots at the time of the incident, he replied that he had not been in any conflict and that the only shots he had heard had been those coming from the military compound, which he had been hearing for the past week.nevertheless, having regard to all the information in the case file and to the fact that a military firing practice had been underway a few kilometres away at the time of the incident, the public prosecutor found that the applicant had probably been hit by a stray bullet that had ricocheted during the firing practice.the applicant’s lawyer stated that the decision to close the investigation had been taken prematurely, before the investigation process had been completed and the gun from which the bullet had been fired and the identity of the shooter had been identified.the officers stated, in virtually identical words, that a firing practice had been held on 14 october 2008 between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. with g3 rifles, that all necessary security measures had been taken at the shooting range prior to the commencement of the practice, in line with the applicable laws and instructions, that all rifles had been fired under the supervision of senior officers, that no firing had been permitted outside the designated shooting areas, and that, in view of the security measures in place and the distance of the applicant from the shooting range, the applicant should not have been affected by bullets fired during the practice.
according to the findings of the police, the driver of the other vehicle involved in the accident, p.c., had changed lanes without paying attention to the applicant’s bus, which had been overtaking it in the other lane.9.  on 19 november 2009, the bender court of appeal reversed the decision of the first-instance court, finding the applicant guilty of causing the accident.the court found that the applicant had not kept a safe distance between his bus and the vehicle in front of him and stated as follows: “... according to article 49 of the route code, the driver of a vehicle shall keep a safe distance between his vehicle and the vehicle in front of him, in such a manner as to avoid collision in case of sudden braking by the foregoing vehicle.these rules were not observed by the driver of the vehicle which was behind, namely by the driver of the bus [...], mr igor pascani, and by no means by mr p.c.” the applicant was again not involved in the proceedings and only found out about them at a later date.10.  as a result of the above judgment and based on its conclusions, on 22 january 2010 the chief inspector of the traffic police issued a new decision by which he found the applicant guilty of the breach of article 49 of the traffic code causing the accident of 14 august 2009. the operative part of the decision stated as follows: “...pascari igor is declared guilty of having committed the offence provided by article 242 § 1 of the code of administrative offences (cao), however, according to article 30 § 3 of the cao no sanction shall be applied in view of the statutory limitation period.” 11.  it appears from the documents submitted by the parties that following the accident the owner of the bus recovered the cost of its repairs from p.c.’s insurance company.
9.  the applicant’s request was dismissed on 8 may 2001. the supreme court as second-instance court upheld the decision on 8 november 2001. the applicant’s subsequent requests to have the money released, in exchange for other securities offered, were also turned down.10.  after remittals on 27 november 2002 and 8 june 2007, on 16 october 2008 the regional court adopted a judgment, partly found for the plaintiff and ordered the applicant to pay huf 137,280,000 (eur 514,000 at the actual rate) plus interest accrued as of 6 january 2000. on 16 october 2009 and 29 april 2010, respectively, the budapest court of appeal and the kúria upheld this judgment.11.  although the plaintiff succeeded only partly in the litigation, the amount actually payable by the applicant exceeded the amount of the entire deposit.this outcome was the consequence of the fact that whilst the applicant was ordered to pay accrued interest on the money due to the plaintiff in the amount of approximately huf 189,500,000 (eur 700,000 at the actual rate), its own money deposited on the bailiff’s trust account had yielded no interest.liii of 1994 on court execution before the constitutional court; but its constitutional complaint was dismissed on 7 june 2011. this court held that ‘interest’ as such was consideration for the ‘use’ of another person’s money; however, the authorities had not in any way ‘used’ the deposited amount.
it held that although the measure was lawful and pursued a legitimate aim, the applicant had suffered a breach of his property rights on account of the lack of proportionality of the measure, in so far as it made the applicant bear a disproportionate burden, given the low amount of rent applicable compared to the market rental value of the property.referring to domestic case-law, it held: “... while this [constitutional] court has a wide latitude in giving any order it may consider relevant in order for it to safeguard articles 33 to 45 of the constitution and human rights and fundamental freedoms as defined in the convention, such latitude was not unlimited and was circumscribed by the judicial system of the country, which did not allow this court [of constitutional jurisdiction] to amend national laws, nor could it make mandatory an action which according to domestic law was discretionary, nor could it order the housing authority to pay rent or compensation of a higher value than that provided for by the relevant law.compensation, if any, which may be paid by this court [of constitutional jurisdiction] is that for the violation found.” 17.  the court awarded the applicant eur 21,000. it considered the compensation fair and just in the circumstances of the case and on the basis of the evidence produced, having taken account in particular of the following factors: that the property had been subject to a requisition order since 1976 but it had affected the applicant since 1988 when he had inherited the property (sic.that the rent had been increased to mtl 80; that the applicant had only received payment up until 2003; that the rental value of the property on the market in 1987 was mtl 249 (approximately eur 580), and in 2010 it was mtl 1,223.50 (approximately eur 2,850); and lastly, that the requisition order had been issued in the public interest to procure accommodation for those in need, and thus the compensation payable could be less than the full market value.22.  the constitutional court further confirmed that the proper defendant was solely the housing authority, and not the attorney general, as the applicant was not contesting the constitutional validity of the law itself, but solely the requisition order issued in respect of his property.
the court considered that it had the power and the duty to take such action under article 4 (2) of the european convention act (see relevant domestic law), in order to bring an end to the consequences of the violation suffered by the applicants.22.  according to the applicants, before the constitutional court they orally invited the president of the constitutional court to withdraw from hearing the case (on the basis of article 734 of the code of organisation and civil procedure).he had also been the legal officer advising the government on the drafting and introduction of act x of 2009. however, according to the applicants, the president of the constitutional court refused to withdraw.referring to domestic case-law, it held as follows: “... while this [constitutional] court has a wide latitude in giving any order it may consider relevant in order for it to safeguard articles 33 to 45 of the constitution and human rights and fundamental freedoms as defined in the convention, such latitude was not unlimited and was circumscribed by the judicial system of the country which did not allow this court [of constitutional jurisdiction] to amend national laws, nor could it make mandatory an action which according to domestic law was discretionary, nor could it order the housing authority to pay rent or compensation of a higher value than that provided for by the relevant law.in the present case the court bore in mind the sums usually awarded by the european court of human rights, the low amount of rent due, the relevant period from 1988 to date, the unavailability of an expert valuation of the rental value of the property, the fact that the applicants had brought proceedings in 2008 and that the more favourable order of the first-instance court was being revoked.
the court found the fact that the applicant had paid the debt in full on 2 may 2011 irrelevant, since the decision on the sale of the applicant’s share in the property to i.m.had made the best bid and had offered [to pay] hrk 43,734, and thereby met the conditions to be awarded the property, the court adopted [the present] award decision ... regardless of the fact that the enforcement debtor on 2 may 2011 settled the debt in respect of the principal amount and the interest.when settling the enforcement creditor’s claim, the court will deliver a distribution decision whereby it will take into account the fact that the enforcement debtor had settled the debt in respect of the principal amount and the interest.” 26.  on 5 december 2011 the applicant appealed against that decision.in particular, that court held as follows: “having regard to the fact that on 17 march 2011 the second public auction was held at which the enforcement creditor appeared as a bidder and made the best (the only) bid, and given that after the auction the court established that the enforcement creditor had offered the highest price and had met the conditions to be awarded the property in accordance with section 98(3) of the enforcement act, the first-instance court was, pursuant to section 98(4) of [that] act, entitled (and obliged to) adopt the contested [award] decision ... the fact that the enforcement debtor after the [second public] auction, on 2 may 2011 settled the creditor’s claim in full is of no relevance for the validity of the contested decision, regardless of the unjustified (time) gap between the auction and the adoption of the impugned decision.[therefore] the events that occurred subsequently cannot call into question the award of the property, nor can the said event constitute grounds for discontinuation of enforcement under the enforcement act.” 28.  on 27 february 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the county court’s decision, alleging a violation of his constitutional right to fair procedure.
... in the course of the preparation and staging of the demonstration flights ... the military establishments, the specialised central state aviation facilities and departments, the municipal authorities and their particular officers failed to comply with a number of provisions of the current law, governing the procedure of preparation and staging the events of such a scale, which failures, to various extents, resulted in the catastrophe and such a major loss of human life ...” 23.  the commission concluded that the local authorities had played an ancillary role in the organisation of the air show.24.  the commission next concluded that the negligence of the city authority had not been a direct cause of the accident, and attributed the primary responsibility for it to the military authorities, having provided the following overall political assessment of the accident: “[the accident is] ... a consequence of the generally irresponsible policy of the national government, which has neglected reformation of the army and the navy, leading to a loss unprecedented for a civilised country... of military efficiency and patriotic spirit, criminally negligent performance of their official duties by the military command at all levels, loss of pride in the military service and marginalisation of the material and technical procurement of the armed forces and military servicemen ... “... [the accident] ... demonstrated the inadequacy of the current legal framework, the inadequacy of the state control system in respect of flight safety; irresponsible and negligent performance by officers at all levels of their duties under the law in force; the need to establish civilian control over the activities of the army; and the need to modernise and effectively reform the armed forces of ukraine ...” 25.  on 1 october 2003 the sknyliv tragedy lviv-based ngo founded by the relatives of the accident victims and its survivors published its own investigation report based on interviews and other information collected from public and private sources.in addition to the shortcomings pointed in the earlier special commission’s report, they concluded that the aerobatics zone was too small; the boundaries of the zone were not clearly marked on site so as to be visible from the aircraft, which factor impaired the pilots’ ability to orient themselves; the location of the aerobatics zone was potentially dangerous in case of any unforeseen situation; the airfield’s preparation for the show was carried out without any account being taken of the possibility of pilot error or any other emergency; the crew did not receive a single mission order defining its mission according to all applicable standards; various documents defining its flight parameters were not comprehensive and not fully consistent with each other; the officers of the flight safety service failed to reveal the above shortcomings; the pilots were allowed to take off without g-suits and their preparedness being checked by any competent authority; the position of “air show flights director” assigned to major-general a.t., which did not feature in any military training documents, appeared to be redundant; it paralleled that of the ordinary aerodrome flights director, with a lack of clarity as to the distribution of authority between the two officers; neither major-general a.t. nor colonel y.ya., who directed the flight, had the proper clearance, experience, and qualifications; and there was no assessment of the quality of the first pilot’s piloting technique during the training flight in ozerne on 24 july 2002. in practice, the pilots’ training was coordinated and supervised only by colonel o.d., stationed at the ozerne aerodrome, who had neither the authority nor the qualifications to assess their preparedness.similarly to the findings contained in other reports, the experts concluded, in particular, as follows: “... one of the reasons for the emergence of the ... incident ... was the existence of significant shortcomings in the ... preparation and staging of the ... air show and lack of clear distribution of duties between the officers ... which, in turn, led to lack of coordination between ... the persons engaged in the preparation, as well as to the absence of effective control over their activity.” if the foregoing normative acts had been unconditionally complied with, the breaches in the organisation of the demonstration flight could have been detected and remedied, and the grave consequences avoided ...” 39.  the investigation ended on 10 august 2004. ten officers, including both pilots and their ground support crew; the air force commander-in-chief (o.s.all other circumstances connected to the organisation of the show in the court’s view did not in any way affect the wrongdoings by [the first pilot] and, moreover, they could not have been foreseen or taken into account by the organisers of the show ... ... as far as the size of the aerobatics zone was concerned, which, according to the experts, was insufficient for the performance of the mission ... this breach was not the cause of the catastrophic situation, since the su-27 aircraft was practically never within its boundaries ... reports on the crew’s readiness for the flight were produced properly, and it was following their receipt that [v.s.]
the working group was tasked with carrying out an assessment of whether “the judges of the supreme court who were purportedly involved in the telephone tapping scandal, which raises doubts about the independence of the judiciary and the honesty of judges” had violated the code of ethics of judges.... ... i think that the information about the alleged conversations between judges and the lawyer [...] should be treated as a signal or a call to look at the problems in the judiciary in a wider context ... ... in relation to this particular situation, i think it was caused by the attitude to the rule of law and the code of ethics which regulate judges’ behaviour.the superficial, irresponsible and perhaps even the unlawful behaviour of certain judges has fundamentally affected trust in the judiciary ... therefore [we] should also talk about the responsibility of judges, [we] should be conscious of the fact that a lack of self-criticism and an inability to apply ethical standards properly pose a threat to the independence of the judiciary ....” 9.  on an unknown date the inquiry carried out by the prosecutor general’s office concluded that the alleged telephone conversations had taken place between november 1998 and april 2000. as there were no audio records of the conversations, the authenticity of the content of the transcripts could not be established.10.  with regard to judge o.d.j., a judge of the senate of the supreme court, the prosecutor general’s office observed that the book had referred to a brief telephone conversation of 24 november 1999 in which the lawyer a.g. had arranged a meeting in the judge o.d.j.’s office.on the same day the senate of the supreme court upheld the appellate court’s judgment on the merits by which the applicant’s claim was dismissed and it became final in that part, but referred the case back for reconsideration in part on the implementation of the judgment.
for the sake of completeness we refer to article 345 of the ccp which prescribes that the specific grounds of the appeal shall be submitted to the court whose judgment is being contested no later than one month after expiry of the time‑limit for seeking the appellate remedy.in your case this may only be done in the form of a notice signed by defence counsel or by an attorney, or to be recorded by the court registry.” 10.  still, on 21 december 2012 the applicant typed and signed an appeal letter to the rheine district court and asked the clinic’s staff to post it.14.  on 11 march 2013 the federal prosecutor general observed, inter alia, that: “he [defence counsel] referred to article 299 of the code of criminal procedure by using wording which was not per se wrong but potentially misleading because it could be understood that the appeal on points of law might be lodged either (by the applicant himself) with the record of the rheine district court’s registry or in writing with the same court.” however, according to the federal prosecutor general, the oral instruction on the day of the hearing was sufficient.in such a situation, taking into account the applicant’s psychiatric illness, it must be assumed that he had not understood the oral instructions on the right to appeal which were given immediately after the delivery of the judgment.” 16.  on 24 april 2013 the federal court of justice rejected the applicant’s request for reinstatement and consequently dismissed his appeal on points of law as inadmissible because it had been lodged out of time.it held that it was not necessary to examine whether, with regard to the christmas holidays, the applicant should have expected his letter to be delivered only on 28 december 2012. rather, it found decisive that the applicant had been expressly instructed on the day of the judgment’s delivery that an appeal could only be lodged with the rheine district court to the record of the registry, but not in writing.
18.  on 5 december 2008 the asylum and immigration tribunal dismissed her appeal but found that it would be proportionate to allow her to remain in the united kingdom for the short period that it would take to complete the care proceedings in respect of m. 19.  the applicant was refused bail on 12 january 2009 and again on 17 march 2009 on the grounds that she could not be relied on to comply with bail conditions, she offered no sureties and she represented a danger to herself and to others.23.  on 25 june 2009 a judge in the family court made a care and placement order in respect of m. in concluding that the threshold criteria were met, he stated that: “i am satisfied the evidence supports a finding of likelihood, that is to say a real possibility, of harm to [m], founded on [s’s] grave injuries; the previous court’s findings in respect of those; the mother’s mental history; her plea to a seriously abusive offence against [s]; her absenting herself from the care and the criminal processes; the social and practical vulnerability produced by the parties’ lack of immigration status; and their criminal offending, with its practical consequences for their availability to [m].38.  on 13 august 2010 the judicial review application was dismissed by a high court judge, who found that while the secretary of state had failed to take into account paragraph 55.10 of her own policy, enforcement instructions and guidance (see paragraphs 58-63 below), when considering the justification for the applicant’s detention between 8 august 2008 and 28 april 2010 (“the first period of detention”), that failure had not caused any damage since the decision to detain would have been the same even had the policy been correctly considered and applied.in this regard, he noted that, taking an analytical approach to each of the periods of detention following 8 august 2008, the applicant’s detention was explicable by steps she had taken, or failed to take (for example, cooperation in relation to emergency travel documents, and the conflicting advice in the hands of the authorities as to the effect of detention on her mental condition and the possibility of treating it while in detention).41.  the applicant appealed to the court of appeal against the dismissal of her judicial review claim on 13 august 2010. permission was granted in light of the recent judgment of 23 march 2011 by the supreme court in r (walumba lumba and kadian mighty) v. secretary of state for the home department [2011] uksc 12 (“lumba and mighty”) (see paragraphs 64-65 below), in which the application by the secretary of state of a “secret policy” in respect of immigration detention was held to be unlawful in violation of public law principles.
under the relevant guidelines of the federal medical association for the substitution treatment of opiate addicts, drug substitution treatment, which he had received prior to his detention, was the required standard treatment for his condition and had to be continued during his detention.with regard to the medical necessity of drug substitution therapy, the prison authorities, relying on prison doctor s.’s statement, considered that drug substitution therapy was not a necessary treatment for the purposes of section 60 of the bavarian execution of sentences act (see paragraph 27 below).he further submitted that the authorities of kaisheim prison, where no substitution treatment had ever been provided, had omitted to examine the medical necessity of drug substitution therapy under the relevant criteria laid down, in particular, in the federal medical association’s guidelines for the substitution treatment of opiate addicts, which were clearly met in his case.he further argued that under the applicable administrative rules for substitution treatment in prison in the land of baden-württemberg, he would be provided with drug substitution therapy, which is carried out in the prisons of the majority of the german länder.he submitted that the regional court’s failure to investigate sufficiently whether drug substitution treatment was necessary, under the applicable federal medical association’s guidelines and with the help of an independent doctor specialised in drug addiction treatment, had breached section 60 of the bavarian execution of sentences act and article 3 of the convention.
... in the course of the preparation and staging of the demonstration flights ... the military establishments, the specialised central state aviation facilities and departments, the municipal authorities and their particular officers failed to comply with a number of provisions of the current law, governing the procedure of preparation and staging the events of such a scale, which failures, to various extents, resulted in the catastrophe and such a major loss of human life ...” 29.  the commission concluded that the local authorities had played an ancillary role in the organisation of the air show.30.  the commission next concluded that the negligence of the city authority had not been a direct cause of the accident, and attributed the primary responsibility for it to the military authorities, having provided the following overall political assessment of the accident: “[the accident is] ... a consequence of the generally irresponsible policy of the national government, which has neglected reformation of the army and the navy, leading to a loss unprecedented for a civilised country... of military efficiency and patriotic spirit, criminally negligent performance of their official duties by the military command at all levels, loss of pride in the military service and marginalisation of the material and technical procurement of the armed forces and military servicemen ... “...

the relevant part of that judgment reads as follows: “the plaintiffs in the first-instance proceedings based their claim for damages on the provisions of the 2003 liability act .... it is necessary to point to the content of section 3 of that act, which provides that the obligation to compensate for damage exists irrespective of whether the person responsible has been identified, criminally prosecuted or found guilty.however, having regard to the correct establishment of the facts by the first-instance court, which found that the events at issue had occurred on 7 january 1992 in the village of j, in the then occupied territory of the republic of croatia which at that time was under the control of illegal formations of the “serbian republic of krajina” and outside the control of the republic of croatia and its lawful bodies, the appellant’s submission that [the killing of the plaintiffs’ parents] ... amounted to war-related damage is well-founded.therefore, given the nature, place and time of the events at issue (the killing of innocent civilians in the occupied territory of the republic of croatia during the homeland war), it is to be concluded that the events at issue are to be legally classified as war-related damage and that the appellant is not responsible for them or for the damage thus caused....” 38.  this judgment was upheld by the supreme court on 19 june 2012. the court endorsed the county court’s finding that the killing of the applicants’ parents amounted to war-related damage and added, in so far as relevant, the following: “even though the act giving rise to the plaintiffs’ claim for damages presents certain similarities with a terrorist act since [both] imply [an act of] violence, the act of damage [in the present case] differs significantly from terrorist acts in its features since it contains additional elements and amounts to war-related damage for which the defendant is not liable.furthermore, the act of damage in the present case was not carried out with the sole aim of seriously disturbing public order (this being the aim characteristic of an act of terror) but also involved the use of force, killing and expulsion of the civilian population on that territory with the aim of destroying the internal security and stability of the republic of croatia and preventing its lawful bodies from functioning.
10.  on 13 may 2012 the ministry of the interior (“the ministry”) requested the offices of the istanbul and gaziantep governors to notify the applicant that he would be accommodated at the airport detention facility pending a decision on his asylum request.the applicant was notified of this decision on 31 may 2012. he was also informed on that date that he could lodge an objection to the ministry’s decision within seventy-two hours, that he would be deported in the event of the dismissal of his objection and that he would continue to be accommodated in the airport detention facility in the meantime.16.  the applicant claimed that the detention facility at sabiha gökçen airport where he had been kept for sixty-eight days between 4 may and 10 july 2012 had been a room of about 20 square metres and that, while the numbers had fluctuated, the room had accommodated up to fifteen people at times.(b)  kumkapı removal centre 19.  the government stated that the kumkapı removal centre’s capacity had been reduced from 560 to 300, in line with recommendations made by the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (“the cpt”), following its visit in june 2009. accordingly, the number of detainees during the period of the applicant’s detention had never exceeded 300. they did not, however, submit the registers recording the occupation rates during the period in question.while the government claimed in their observations that there had been five dormitory rooms on each floor, measuring 50, 69, 76 and 84 square metres respectively, the information note prepared by the ministry and appended to their observations indicated that there had been only four rooms on the first floor, measuring 50, 58, 76 and 84 square metres, and five rooms on both the second and third floors, measuring 50, 58, 69, 76 and 84 square metres.
5.  the applicant was born in 1972. he was detained at the gaziantep foreigners’ removal centre (“the gaziantep removal centre”) at the time of the events giving rise to this application.7.  subsequent to his departure from russia, criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant by the russian authorities before the cerkessk city court on the following charges: (i) participation in an armed insurrection and membership of an armed organisation with the purpose of overthrowing the constitutional order and violating the territorial integrity of the russian federation and (ii) possessing firearms and ammunition.11.  following his release from prison on 28 january 2009, the applicant was placed in detention at the gaziantep removal centre, which is attached to the gaziantep security directorate.14.  in the meantime, on 8 april 2010 the applicant submitted a petition to the ministry of the interior (“the ministry”), where he requested to be released and to be granted a residence permit.16.  according to the information in the case file, the applicant met with his lawyer a total of nine times between 3 march 2009 and 27 july 2010 during his detention at the gaziantep removal centre.

7.  according to the record of service, a form containing several options as to the way in which court mail was served, which was issued by a courier and returned to the district court, the courier had attempted to hand over the penal order to the applicant at her residence on 7 november 2008 at 2.10 p.m. as this had not been possible, the courier had served the penal order on the applicant by placing it in the mailbox appurtenant to her residence (article 180 of the code of civil procedure, see paragraph 29 below).he claimed that he, the applicant, the applicant’s mother who was living in the same house as the applicant and the applicant’s husband who lived in london had all been at the applicant’s house at the time the penal order had allegedly been served.15.  the district court was also of the view that there was no reason to grant the applicant reinstatement of the proceedings, as it was not apparent why the applicant had been prevented, through no fault of her own, from submitting her objection against the penal order within the two-week time‑limit after the delivery of 7 november 2008.as it had been proved by the record of service that the penal order had been put into the applicant’s mailbox, potential shortcomings by the courier’s failure to ring the doorbell first – which according to the applicant would have resulted in her dogs barking, which they allegedly had not done at the relevant time – would, in any event, have been remedied by the actual service.the court, essentially endorsing the reasons given by the district court, confirmed the district court’s finding that the penal order had effectively been served on the applicant on 7 november when placed in the applicant’s mailbox (article 37 of the code of criminal procedure, read in conjunction with article 180 of the code of civil procedure, see paragraphs 28-29 below).
he was charged, inter alia, with assisting in the commission outside the united kingdom of an offence punishable under the law of guyana (the export of drugs from that country), contrary to section 20 of the misuse of drugs act 1971, and with the attempted importation of drugs to the united kingdom.therefore, before the trial the prosecution applied to the court for the following security measures:  the assignment of a security team to chaperone the jury at all times;  the identification of the jury by number and not by name;  the verification by police of the identity of anyone wishing to enter the courtroom’s public gallery;  the search of members of the public entering the building;  the retention of all visitors’ mobile telephones during the trial;  the erection of protective screens to shield the jury and the applicant from the public gallery; and  the covering of the glass panels in the doors to the court room to prevent people seeing into the room.38.  after this, and having reviewed the efforts made to oblige vo to attend court, the trial judge stated: “what i seek to emphasise, in fairness to the defendant is that when you assess the evidence of [vo], you look at all the circumstances, throw it all into the melting pot, all the warnings that i have given you, take it all into account and then decide the weight you can properly attach to it; it is a matter for you.” 39.  whilst they were considering their verdict, the jury asked for – but was refused – copies of the transcripts of vo’s statements.while the statement by him that the container was intended for the united kingdom was damaging to the applicant’s case, the applicant had the evidence that was available before the jury to the effect that he had identified particular pallets that were to come out of the container at antwerp [the evidence of the guyana shipping agent aa].it was of assistance to the applicant to have the evidence of [vo] about the instructions that the cargo had been sold to a dutch company.” 50.  the court was therefore not satisfied that there would have been any positive advantage to the defence in calling vo and thus concluded that there was no arguable basis for criticising the admission of his statements.
14.  on 24 june 2010 the town court, acting under the amended provisions of the code of criminal procedure concerning extradition, issued an order for the applicant’s provisional arrest for forty days, pending the receipt of an extradition request from the uzbek authorities.4.  extradition inquiry in respect of the first three applicants and applications for asylum in sweden and the united states of america 37.  on 9 july 2010 the gpo received formal requests from the uzbek authorities for the first and third applicant’s extradition and on 27 july 2010 received a similar request concerning the second applicant.43.  on 14 october 2010 the ambassador of the united states of america (“the us”) to ukraine asked the gpo to facilitate a visit to the detained uzbek nationals on 15 and 21 october 2010 by representatives of the us department of homeland security for interviews as part of the process of examining their requests for asylum in the us.the reports recommended that the applicants’ extradition be refused, pursuant to paragraph 4 of article 466 of the code of criminal procedure which provides that extradition can be refused where “the competent authority of the foreign state has not provided, at the request of the central authority, additional materials or data, without which a decision on the extradition request may not be taken”.it referred to the visit of the us officials to the first and third applicant and to information provided to the gpo by the second applicant’s lawyer that his application for asylum was pending before the us authorities.
15.  secondly, the applicant argued that the minister’s decision had not contained sufficient reasons, seeing that (a) it had incorrectly mentioned that he had cited religious grounds without being an adherent of a religion; and (b) the members of the committee had displayed prejudice by asserting that conscientious objectors had to be activists and anti-authority or to publicise their views, whereas the law did not lay down any such conditions.18.  in response to his first argument, it noted that the members of the committee sat on an equal basis and that the absence of two of the members therefore had no effect on the quorum and did not distort the nature of the committee.19.  with regard to his second argument, the supreme administrative court explained that, after examining whether the applicant was a follower of a religion that prohibited the use of force, whether he had taken part in non-violent movements and whether his philosophy of life prevented him from handling weapons, the committee had concluded that his conscientious objection was not accompanied by corresponding behaviour.it also dismissed his argument that opponents to the use of violence who did not publicly identify themselves as such were victims of discrimination, holding that the law required clear proof of their beliefs and that, moreover, the fact of not falling within the exceptions provided for by law was insufficient.21.  on 19 may 2014 the applicant was ordered to pay a fine of 6,000 euros (eur) for insubordination; with interest for late payment, the amount was increased to eur 7,940.85. on 11 july 2014 the applicant applied to the mytilene administrative court to have the fine set aside.
8.  pursuant to a memorandum of understanding of 9 november 1947 (“the tripartite agreement”), the governments of the united kingdom, india and nepal agreed that the salary of gurkhas serving in the british army would be set by reference to rates applied by india in respect of indian soldiers so as to avoid competition between the indian and british armies for gurkha recruits.(a)  the 2004 amendments to the immigration rules 13.  on 25 october 2004 the immigration rules (hc 394) were changed to permit gurkha soldiers with at least four years’ service who retired on or after 1 july 1997 (the date that the gurkha’s home base relocated to the united kingdom) to apply for settlement in the united kingdom.23.  with regard to pensions, the review concluded that on balance the gps was more suitable than the afps to support the life-cycle of the great majority of gurkhas up until july 1997. however, moving the brigade’s base to the united kingdom and the subsequent change to the immigration rules had altered the previously valid assumption that gurkhas would retire in nepal.33.  on 7 march 2008 the applicants issued an application for judicial review in the high court challenging the legality of both (a) the decision that gurkhas who retired prior to 1 july 1997 were not entitled to transfer their pension rights under the gps into the afps and (b) the decision that, for those gurkhas who retired after 1 july 1997, service before that date did not rank on a year-for-year basis.although the high court accepted that the 2004 change in the immigration rules (see paragraph 13 above) undermined some of the assumptions supporting the decision in purja, it held that the changes did not affect the reasoning of the court of appeal as that reasoning applied to the calculation of pension entitlements which accrued before 1 july 1997. for all the reasons advanced by the high court judge in gurung, the high court considered that the choice of 1 july 1997 to mark the boundary for different treatment of accrued pension was a rational and reasonable one.
21.  on 24 march 2005 the court found the applicant guilty of the aggravated murder of two persons ‒ one of whom was a minor ‒ and of the attempted murder of another person, with the aim of stealing the victims’ property.the court based its judgment on statements made by the applicant during the investigation and at the trial, the testimonies of one of the victims and six witnesses – one of whom had caught the applicant at the scene of the crime − and the conclusions of several forensic examinations, including a psychiatric examination which found that the applicant had been aware and in control of his actions at the time of the offences.24.  in his appeal, the applicant’s lawyer contested the first-instance court’s finding that the applicant had committed the murders with the aim of stealing the victims’ property.26.  in december 2005 the applicant requested that the kyiv regional court of appeal provide him with copies of certain documents from his case file, including the verbatim records of his questioning during the investigation, the decisions concerning his detention, and various procedural decisions taken in the course of the investigation and trial, which he intended to submit to the court in support of his application.in a letter dated 19 january 2006, a court of appeal judge informed the applicant that his request had been refused, pointing out that the procedure governing applications to the european court of human rights did not require the submission of the documents of which the applicant had sought copies.
on the same day the investigator from the krasnoyarsk prosecutor’s office initiated a request for extension of the applicant’s detention.the matter was heard in the presence of the investigator, the prosecutor ‒ who supported the application for extension ‒ and counsel mr v., who left the issue of the applicant’s detention for determination by the court.he submitted in particular that his detention had been contrary to the requirements of the russian constitution and the new code of criminal procedure, that the arrest warrants of 16 march 2001 and 3 june 2002 had never been served on him or his counsel, and that the detention hearing had been held in his absence.13.  on 17 august 2005 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld this detention order on appeal, in the presence of only the prosecutor.16.  on 20 december 2006 he complained to the zheleznodorozhny district court of krasnoyarsk, which had territorial jurisdiction over the place of his detention, about unjustified delays in the criminal proceedings and a violation of the right to respect for his family life.
10.  on an unspecified date the district court appointed counsel to the applicant, mr k. 11.  on 28 march 2006 the district court ordered another outpatient psychiatric expert examination of the applicant upon the prosecutor’s request and ordered that the measure of restraint remain unvaried.17.  on 25 september 2006 a report of the inpatient psychiatric expert examination was drawn up stating that the applicant had been fully capable of understanding the consequences of his actions at the moment of the crime.19.  on 8 december 2006 the sverldovsk regional court (“the regional court”) examined in the absence of the applicant or any counsel on his behalf the statement of appeal of 30 june 2006 against the detention order of 2 june 2006 and dismissed it.25.  on 30 march 2007 the regional court examined the applicant’s statement of appeal of 23 january 2007 against the detention order of 24 august 2006 in the absence of the applicant or any counsel on his behalf and dismissed it.according to the government, the applicant was served with it on 7 june 2007. to support their claim, they enclosed a copy of acknowledgement of receipt dated 7 july 2006 stating that the applicant had been served on that date with a copy of a ruling of 7 july 2006. according to the applicant, he was served with the copy after the introduction of the present application before the court, that is, after 14 june 2007.
15.  at the hearing the doctor who was treating the applicant testified that his condition had significantly deteriorated since the beginning of 2014. he received painkillers in hospital, but effective medical treatment was unavailable, owing to a lack of the required medication.21.  on 27 march 2015 the court decided to apply rule 39, indicating to the government that it was desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicant should be immediately examined by medical experts who were independent of the prison system, with a view to determining: (1) whether the treatment he was receiving in the prison hospital was adequate with regard to his condition; (2) whether his state of health was compatible with detention in prison hospital conditions; and (3) whether his condition required his placement in a specialist, possibly civilian, hospital.22.  on 9 april 2015 the government responded to the court’s letter of 27 march 2015, asserting that the scope and quality of the applicant’s medical treatment in the prison hospital corresponded to his needs.they submitted the following documents: a typed copy of the applicant’s medical file; certificates from detention facilities summarising the applicant’s treatment and describing his state of health; a report by a medical panel of 30 october 2014 confirming his eligibility for early release; a copy of the district court’s decision of 26 january 2015; a statement by the acting head of the hospital in which he noted that the district court had misinterpreted his testimony given on 26 january 2015, as he had never discussed the possibility of the applicant being treated in another hospital; and a statement by the head of the prison hospital in which he confirmed that the cancer treatment was only possible in a special oncological centre, and that he had never argued that it was accessible within the prison system.however, two independent doctors summoned by the applicant’s lawyer had assessed the quality of his medical treatment in detention and the compatibility of further detention in the prison hospital with his state of health.
the applicant remained in custody during the investigation and pending the trial.6.  on 24 november 2003 the volgograd regional court scheduled the trial of the applicant and seven other defendants for 24 december 2003. the court also ruled that the trial was to be held in camera.8.  on 22 february 2006 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the applicant’s conviction on appeal.10.  on 8 december 2010 the presidium of the supreme court quashed the judgment of 22 february 2006 by way of supervisory review and remitted the matter for fresh consideration.the court found that the case had become time-barred under the statute of limitations and discharged the applicant from serving a prison sentence.
10.  on 12 july 2012 the st petersburg city court quashed the detention order of 31 may 2012 on appeal and referred the matter back to the first-instance court.11.  on 19 july 2012 the district court, relying on the same grounds, ordered the applicant’s detention between 28 may and 28 july 2012. in doing so, the district court considered that neither the applicant’s refugee status nor his permanent place of residence and dependent family members (wife and child) justified the application of an alternative preventive measure.14.  on 20 july 2012, the district court, relying on the same grounds, extended the applicant’s detention.17.  on 12 september 2012, the district court, relying on the same grounds, extended the applicant’s detention until 14 october 2012.26.  on 26 september 2013 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 28 december 2013. the applicant was in detention pending trial at least until 2 january 2014.
the fact of the offence has been confirmed by: witness k. [the applicant] has been informed of his rights and obligations under articles 48 and 51 of the constitution, and articles 1.5, 24.2 and 25.1 of the cao: that the person who is being prosecuted for an administrative offence has the right, inter alia, to have access to all the material in the file, to testify, to adduce evidence, to lodge interlocutory applications and challenges, and to have legal assistance.the judgment read as follows: “the court holds that, while drunk, the defendant used foul language in the presence of other people and thus breached public order ... the defendant’s guilt is confirmed by z.’s report and n.’s testimony ... the use of foul language in a public place is unacceptable and discloses a form of disorderly behaviour ... in the court’s view, the use of aberrant language in a public place in the presence of at least one person constitutes an offence under article 20.1 of the cao.he argued, inter alia, that although the offence record referred to his using foul language “against passers-by”, the justice of the peace had phrased the charge as using foul language “in the presence of other people”; the judge had not retained the phrase from the offence record, which stated that the applicant “[had not rectified] his behaviour despite remarks from passers‑by”.the appeal court held as follows: “the justice of the peace convicted [the applicant] of using foul language in the presence of others, thus breaching public order ... the appeal court dismisses the argument that the mere use of aberrant language in respect of one person does not disclose an offence.such actions include using foul language in a public place, insulting people, destruction of or damage to others’ property ... each of these actions may amount to disorderly behaviour if it breaches public order and discloses a manifest disregard to society ... certain factual contradictions between the information in the administrative offence record, z.’s report and n.’s testimony (as regards use of foul language on account of low culture rather than in respect of passers-by) were dispelled during the trial following the interview of the witnesses ...” 20.  the applicant applied to the deputy president of the supreme court of the tatarstan republic for judicial review under article 30.12 of the cao.
during the visit, the bailiff informed the enforcement judge that the respondent had brought the child to the front gate of the house, but the child had refused to leave with the applicant, even after the respondent tried to persuade him, and had gone back inside.18.  the parental therapy, which at that time had already lasted for six months, included 23 sessions in which the social care centre’s professionals continuously and intensively worked with the applicant, the respondent, the child and the paternal grandparents to reach mutually acceptable arrangements and enforce the interim measures in line with the best interest of the child.23.  the first attempt to reunite the applicant with the child took place on 22 december 2008. the enforcement judge, a bailiff, several representatives of the social care centre, two uniformed policemen, three plain clothes policemen, the applicant and her lawyer all entered the courtyard of the respondent’s house, expecting that the child would be surrendered.it appears that the applicant was also against the use of force (according to a report to the enforcement judge by the social care centre of 31 march 2010, the applicant refused the possibility of the use of force throughout the proceedings).41.  despite this agreement, on 25 march 2011 the enforcement court imposed a fine on the respondent in the amount of rsd 100,000 because of his failure to comply with the judgment of 24 november 2009. it also ruled that the respondent was to be given three days from the date of receipt of that order to surrender the child voluntarily to the applicant and with the added condition that, should he fail to do so, he would have to pay a further fine of rsd 150,000. the respondent did not comply with the order and it seems that the fine in the amount of 100.000 rsd was subsequently imposed and paid.
7.  in january 2006 the applicant lodged complaints with the state duma and the prosecutor general of the russian federation against the judges who had dealt with his civil case.in particular, the applicant, using abusive language, accused them of having taken bribes from the defendant in the amount of usd 30,000, falsification of evidence, terrorism, abuse of power as well as inciting racial and ethnic hatred.15.  on 7 february 2007 the new report confirmed the findings of the previous report of 21 november 2006. in addition, the experts found that the applicant was a danger to society, stating as follows: “[t]aking into account that [the applicant] shows, in subjectively significant situations, a tendency towards rapid formation of overvalued ideas which sometimes reach a delusional level, broadening of the circle of persons brought into the focus of these emotions, grave emotional disturbances with non-corrective behavior, rejection of regime requirements, lack of critical attitude to his [emotional] state, dissimulation, [he] is a danger to the society and needs compulsory treatment in a specialised psychiatric hospital”.16.  on 20 february 2007 the city court having established the principal facts in respect of the abovementioned offences discontinued criminal proceedings against the applicant due to his insanity.the court referring to the findings and recommendations of the psychiatrists ordered the applicant’s involuntary treatment in a psychiatric hospital.
lodged an action with the chişinău economic court seeking the applicant’s exclusion from the list of shareholders on the grounds, inter alia, that he had not paid for his part of the shares, that is to say he had only paid mdl 1,080 instead of mdl 2,700. the applicant objected, claiming that the action was time-barred: under the relevant law, it had to be introduced within three years of the creation of the company.9.  the hearings before the economic court of appeal took place on five different dates: 30 april, 27 may, 2 june, 4 june and 9 june 2009. on 2 june 2009 a.n.’s representative submitted that the applicant had not paid his contribution and that he had been asked to do so every year since the creation of the company in 2002. when asked whether there were any minutes to confirm the contention that the applicant had been summoned to pay his contribution, he answered that he was not aware of any such minutes.15.  the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the supreme court of justice claiming, inter alia, that the proceedings had been unfair because the economic court of appeal had used as the main and sole piece of evidence in the ruling against him a forged document, namely the minutes of a shareholders’ meeting dated 20 february 2007. the economic court of appeal had given decisive weight to that document in spite of his express statement that the signature on the document was not his.nor did the supreme court respond to the applicant’s argument that the economic court of appeal had rejected without any reasons his request for an expert authentication of the minutes of 20 february 2007. instead, relying on the minutes of 20 february 2007, the supreme court concluded that the applicant had not paid the totality of his shares in the company.18.  on an unspecified date the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against a.n., alleging that he had forged the company shareholders’ minutes dated 20 february 2007. in the course of the criminal proceedings, an expert from the national forensic centre presented his report dated 7 august 2010, in which he concluded that the signature on the minutes of the company shareholders’ meeting dated 20 february 2007 did not belong to the applicant.
the detention orders were essentially based on the gravity of the charges, the primary grounds being the risk of the applicants’ absconding and interfering with the course of justice.on 9 february 2007 the poronayskiy town court of the sakhalin region convicted him of sexual assault and sentenced him to six years and nine months’ imprisonment.he was released on 12 september 2007. on 20 may 2008 he was convicted of bribery and sentenced to one year and six months’ imprisonment.on 3 february 2011 the novosibirsk regional court convicted him of drug dealing and abuse of power, and sentenced him to eight years and six months’ imprisonment.the government were asked to inform the court of their position regarding a friendly settlement of the cases and any proposals they wished to make.
referring in particular to the act which had led to her committal to the psychiatric hospital and her general state of mental health, the authority concluded that she posed a danger to public safety which outweighed her personal interest in not being expelled, despite her long stay in germany and her residence status.it found that although members of the applicant’s family in pakistan had indicated to the german embassy that they were not prepared to take her in, it was conceivable that they might help her to arrange for the required treatment in return for payment of a few euros.on 2 august 2011 it dismissed a complaint by the applicant of a breach of the right to be heard, in which she had, in particular, argued that the court had not given proper consideration to her submissions on her improved state of health, the death of her sister in pakistan and the living conditions she would face in the event of her return there.24.  in their observations of 7 january 2016 on the merits of the case, the government, in their own name and on behalf of the land of hesse, which is responsible for deciding on the applicant’s residence rights, gave an assurance that before taking any measures for the applicant’s removal, the german administrative authorities would issue a new expulsion order taking account of the time which had passed.25.  subsequently, in reply to several questions put by the court, the government declared that the administrative authorities would not expel the applicant on the basis of the original expulsion order, that the assurance they had given could be relied on to prevent any attempt to remove the applicant on the basis of the original expulsion order and that the german authorities considered themselves bound by that undertaking at all levels, since it had been made in consultation with and with the agreement of the hesse land government.
the following injuries were detected: four painful swellings (two of which were coupled with sores) of up to 4 cm in diameter on the back part of the head and on both temples, two oval bruises on the forehead of 8 x 5 cm and 5 x 4 cm, bruises on both eyelids, a slightly swollen bridge of the nose, bruises on the sides of the nose extending to the eyelids, and linear sores on both wrists.13.  as further submitted by the applicant, on 29 september 2001 the police tried to transfer him from the kherson temporary detention facility (“the itt”, part of the police system) to the kherson pre-trial detention centre (“the sizo”), but the sizo’s administration refused to admit him because of his many injuries.16.  with his observations to the court of 16 july 2014 the applicant submitted a handwritten copy of a complaint to the kherson regional prosecutor’s office (“the kherson prosecutor’s office”) dated 5 october 2001 (with a handwritten confirmation by two inmates that the applicant had handed the complaint to the guard on duty for dispatching).17.  according to another, similar handwritten note submitted to the court on 16 july 2014, the applicant had on 7 october 2001 complained to the governor of the kherson sizo that the guards had torn up his complaints to the prosecution authorities on 5 and 6 october 2001. he also complained that although he had been taken to the sizo on 5 october 2001 with injuries all over his body, the sizo official on duty had rejected his request for a medical examination.34.  on 24 september 2001 the investigator in charge of the case issued a decision to extend the term of the applicant’s detention in the itt to ten days (instead of the legally allowed maximum of three days, after which the applicant had to be transferred to the local sizo – see paragraph 77 below).
7.  on 3 february 2006, the first belgrade municipal court ordered the debtor to pay the applicant specified amounts on account of salary arrears and social insurance contributions, plus the costs of the civil proceedings.8.  on 23 october 2006, upon the applicant’s request to that effect, the fourth belgrade municipal court accepted the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor to pay the applicant the enforcement costs.9.  on 24 december 2010 the belgrade commercial court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor (st. 4372/2010).13.  on 23 april 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal.14.  the constitutional court dismissed his appeal on 14 july 2011.
in particular, the supreme court noted: “it follows from the materials in the case-file that [the court] took into account the gravity of the charges against [the applicant]..., and it is reasonable to assume that, if at large, he may abscond..., or continue his criminal activities, or threaten the witnesses, the victims and other parties to the proceedings, or destroy the evidence... that may be found in foreign companies or interfere with investigation in any other way.furthermore, the grounds for the applicant’s detention have not ceased to exist and there are no exclusive circumstances rendering the lifting or replacement of the restrictive measure... possible.” 16.  on 20 november 2008 the city court extended the pre-trial detention in respect of the applicant, e. and s., his co-defendants, noting as follows: “according to the materials submitted, e., s. and [the applicant] are charged with a number of offences, including especially serious ones for which a custodial sentence exceeding two years can be applied in the event of conviction.on the basis of the aforesaid, and in view of the circumstances of the case, the court finds that the investigator’s arguments that the defendants’ detention should be extended are convincing and justified and that the grounds for extension of their detention are exceptional regard being had to the nature of the charges and pending investigative activities aimed at the completion of the investigation.it noted in respect of the applicant as follows: “even though...

9.  subsequently the applicant’s detention was extended on a number of occasions in the course of the investigation and trial in view of the gravity of the charges against him and the risks of his absconding, seeking to influence witnesses and reoffending.19.  on 2 september 2013 the applicant asked the head of the detention facility to authorise a medical examination and treatment outside the facility owing to a serious spine and leg condition that had worried him since may 2013. he stated that over the previous three months he had received pain relief medication provided by his relatives, but that his condition had not got better.21.  on the next day the applicant complained about the quality of his treatment to the federal service for the execution of services in krasnoyarsk.22.  on 14 february 2014 the applicant was taken to the regional cancer hospital in krasnoyarsk, where he was diagnosed with prostate cancer with metastasis to the pelvic bone.ten days later the sosnovborsk town court of the krasnoyarsk region dismissed an application for early release, finding that the applicant was receiving the required treatment in detention.
7.  as regards the conditions of his detention between 1999 and 2009, the first applicant submitted that the toilet was located in the corner of the cell, behind a one-metre-high partition.in 2009 the federal penitentiary service had prepared an engineering and design blueprint for connecting all the cells to the mains and sewers but funding for the project had not been allocated.the prosecutor asked the court to require the facility’s management and the regional branch of the federal penitentiary service to connect all the cells to the water supply and sewers, to install ventilation and to improve the quality of the water.13.  by a judgment of 24 august 2011, the belozerskiy district court of the vologda region granted the prosecutor’s claim and directed the management of the prison to connect all the cells to the mains, sewers and a ventilation system within one year and to improve the water quality within six months.it found that the cell was ventilated through a small opening in the window and that the temperature was normal, that there was a toilet consisting of a bucket with a lid, and a tank for drinking water, and that sanitary regulations did not require the installation of a sewage system “in territories where sewers were not available”.
12.  in addition to taking statements from the witnesses, the czech authorities examined and recorded the scene of the crime, and performed a forensic examination of h.c.z.’s body and a ballistic examination of the bullets and cases found at the scene of the shooting.and other foreign witnesses was found to be well grounded, and the case was remitted to the district court for re-examination with the instruction that the applicant be given the opportunity to cross-examine e.m.l., who was considered the key witness in the case against him.and a certain a.b., who had also been involved in the internet services featuring interactive sexual content, to testify at the hearing scheduled for 15 november 2005. however, on that date none of the witnesses appeared before the court, so the district court requested legal assistance from the czech and dutch judicial authorities, asking its foreign counterparts to hear the three witnesses in the applicant’s presence.the court decided to request the dutch authorities to give the applicant the opportunity to cross-examine those witnesses; however, the investigating judge of the regional court of the hague refused to allow the applicant to attend the examination in person, finding that the witnesses’ safety could be at risk and that they might not be willing to give a statement.in the netherlands because of the decision of the dutch investigating judge, which fell beyond the jurisdiction of the slovenian courts, the district court nonetheless concluded that since the applicant’s counsel was present and moreover had submitted questions written by the applicant to both witnesses, the applicant’s defence rights were not violated.
5.  on 6 january 2000 the applicant brought an action against his parents before the siófok district court for dissolution of joint ownership of a real property.6.  on 21 march 2000 the court suspended the proceedings pending the adjudication of a preliminary question in other proceedings.upon termination of the other proceedings on 17 november 2005, the siófok district court continued hearing the case.7.  on 25 august 2006 the court again suspended the proceedings pending the adjudication of a preliminary question in another related procedure.upon termination of these proceedings on 30 august 2007, the siófok district court ordered continuation of the case on 17 november 2008.
in addition, in merely a few lines, they stressed that: (a) the applicant was undergoing treatment in the prison hospital; (b) his health was satisfactory and “nothing was life-threatening”; (c) the medical care was afforded to him “in full”, was “appropriate” to his condition and complied both with the requirements of russian law and the guarantees of article 3 of the convention; and (d) his illnesses were not included in the list of illnesses precluding the serving of sentences in correctional institutions.26.  following receipt of the government’s submissions and the applicant’s comments on them, on 12 november 2014 the acting president of the section decided to indicate to the government, under rule 39 of the rules of court, that the applicant should be immediately examined by medical experts independent from the penal system, including by an oncologist, with a view to determining (a) whether the treatment he was receiving in detention was adequate to his condition; (b) whether his current state of health was compatible with detention in a correctional colony or prison hospital; and (c) whether his current condition required his admittance to a specialist hospital or release.31.  following communication of the case to the parties, on 29 june 2015 the government informed the court that the applicant had died on 8 april 2015. they submitted a copy of the death certificate and asked the court, in the absence of any person wishing to pursue the application on his behalf, to strike the case out of the list of cases pursuant to article 37 § 1 (c) of the convention.the acting head of the colony laid down the details of the applicant’s criminal record, indicated that he had not made any complaints to the colony administration between 21 november 2014 and 8 april 2015 and that a request he had made for early release had been dismissed by the ingodinskiy district court on 16 march 2015. in separate certificates the acting head of the medical unit recorded the progress of the applicant’s illness, placing particular emphasis on the rapid deterioration of his health in 2014 when new and growing metastases had been discovered in his lungs, lymph nodes, adrenal gland and brain, and the development of cancer intoxication, accompanied by serious bilateral polysegmental pneumonia, brain oedema and terminal kidney failure.33.  in the letter of 18 august 2015 the applicant’s lawyer informed the court that ms artemyeva, the applicant’s sister and heir, wished to continue the proceedings before the court on the applicant’s behalf.
9.  the government did not contest the fact that the applicant’s former cellmates had been held in the same remand prison as the applicant or the veracity of their statements.11.  the government provided a description of the applicants’ conditions of detention, relying on certificates issued in june 2015 by the director of the remand prison, photographs of the cells, prisoner transfer logs (суточная ведомость учёта лиц, временно выбывших из следственного изолятора) and registration logs (журнал количественной проверки подозреваемых, обвиняемых и осуждённых).the applicants denied that the photographs showed the cells in which they had been held because those cells had not had the vaulted ceilings that were visible in the photographs.17.  on 13 march 2012 the rostov regional court amended the judgment on appeal, reducing the sentences and revoking the forfeiture order on the grounds that the relevant provisions of criminal law had been enacted after the commission of the crimes.19.  the applicants appealed and by a final decision of 16 december 2015 the rostov regional court ordered the rest of the applicants’ property to be returned to them, finding that the district court’s forfeiture order had been unlawful and procedurally defective.
the aforementioned grounds ... have not changed, have not lost their relevance to date, and the circumstances of the case [and] the nature of the crime committed by [the applicant] lead the court to conclude that the need for the [pre-trial detention] has not, at this stage, ceased to exist ... this term is reasonable, [it] is justified by the objective circumstances, it is not in conflict with the term of the pre-trial investigation, also extended on the same grounds ... in accordance with the constitutional court’s [case-law], the proportionality of the preventive measure to the [gravity of the] charges imputed to [the applicant] show that in this case the public interests, in particular those related to the criminal investigation, override the importance of the principle of respect of individual liberty.” 45.  on 24 may 2013 the applicant’s criminal case was transferred to the zamoskvoretskiy district court for the determination of criminal charges.47.  on 6 june 2013 the latter court granted another extension of the applicant’s detention until 24 november 2013. this decision concerned eleven defendants and read, in so far as relevant, as follows: “... the court concludes that the preventive measure in respect of [all defendants] ... is to remain unchanged because the reasons taken into account when these measures were chosen have not ceased to exist and have not changed ... ... [the defendants] are accused of [grave crimes punishable by prison sentences] ... regard being had to all the available information about the personality of [the defendants] and the nature of the criminal offences imputed to each of them, the court still has sufficient grounds to believe that the said defendants, if at liberty, may flee the trial or otherwise obstruct the course of justice, [motivated by] the gravity of the charges.despite the defendants being registered as having permanent addresses in the russian federation, the analysis of the overall information about [the defendants’] personalities, and the nature of the offences imputable to them, give the court sufficient grounds to consider that the defendants, if the preventive measure is changed to another one not involving deprivation of liberty, may flee the trial or otherwise obstruct the course of justice, [motivated by] the gravity of the charges ... the reasons taken into account when these measures were chosen have not ceased to exist and have not changed ...” 54.  on 17 december 2013 the moscow city court upheld the extension order of 19 november 2013.this decision read as follows: “... the performance of a medical examination ... falls outside the competence of the investigating bodies ... however, given that the state of health of the accused mr belousov is of importance to the present criminal case, the investigating bodies have sent the relevant request to the administration of [iz-77/5] stating the need to carry out, in the shortest possible time, the medical examination of the accused mr belousov, the results of which are to be submitted to the investigating bodies for inclusion in the criminal case file.” 62.  it appears that the medical examination was not carried out.... mr belousov was filmed at the moment he threw a yellow object at the police ... the [defendants’] argument that no mass disorder took place is considered by the court unsubstantiated because ... as a result of the premeditated actions of a group of individuals who organised ... obstruction to the demonstrators’ march on their way to the intended meeting venue where the stage was, which caused discontent among the protesters towards ... the police ... those who were leading the march and who were able to make an unhindered approach to the meeting venue changed their tactics and called for ... a sit-in, hoping thus to secure a decision to change the placement of the cordon to their advantage and to extend their area beyond what had been agreed ... as a result ... the protesters forced their way through the police cordon ... public order was disrupted ... because of the larger crowd, uncontrollable and incited by organised groups ... conditioned the applicants’ intent to participate in such actions, accompanied by chunks of tarmac and plastic bottles being thrown and violence towards the police otherwise being used.
5.  the applicants sued different municipal companies, referred to in the appendix as the “debtor companies”, in various unrelated sets of the court proceedings.the companies had “the right of economic control” (право хозяйственного ведения) over the assets allocated to them by the administrations in order to carry out their statutory activities.7.  on the dates tabulated below by decisions of the local authorities some of the assets allocated to the companies were transferred back to the administration.9.  on the dates tabulated below domestic courts by separate judgments made pecuniary awards in the applicants’ favour, to be paid by the debtor companies.several applicants’ subsequent court actions against authorities, including subsidiary liability claim, legal succession proceedings or claims for damages against the respective local administrations, as well as repetitive complaints to the bailiffs’ service or the prosecutor’s office in connection with pending criminal proceedings brought in 2006-07 with regard to the company’s insolvency (applications nos.

8.  for the duration of his suspension, that is to say between september 2007 and september 2008, the applicant was entitled to monthly salary compensation in the amount of 60% of the salary remitted in the month prior to his suspension from the civil service.9.  on 5 september 2008 the osijek civil service tribunal (službenički sud u osijeku) found the applicant guilty of severe breaches of his official duties and fined him 10% of the salary paid to him in the month in which the said sanction was imposed.10.  on 14 october 2008, after the applicant lodged an appeal, the superior civil service tribunal (viši službenički sud) amended the impugned decision and fined the applicant 5% of his salary paid in the month in which the said sanction was imposed.11.  on 3 november 2008 the applicant lodged an application for the reimbursement of the portion of his gross salary – in the total amount of 78,428.47 croatian kunas ((hrk), approximately 10,900 euros (eur) at the time) – withheld during the suspension period between september 2007 and september 2008, together with accrued default interest running from the date of his suspension until payment of the said portion.16.  by a decision of 4 january 2012 the high administrative court, relying on sections 9 and 30(1), point 5, of the administrative disputes act, declined jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter, stating that an ordinary municipal court (redovni, općinski sud) was the appropriate court to hear the applicant’s case, and declared the applicant’s action inadmissible.
the relevant parts of the article read as follows: “... someone who does not share these views is the president of the im, [a.s.], who has assured o independente that ‘the project does not face any risk’ and denigrated carlos câmara, whom he does not recognise as having the ‘skills to evaluate the development of the project’, and his opinions ... with regard to câmara leaving the project, [a.s.] mentioned that the former scientific coordinator ‘had broken a relationship of trust’, adding that his behaviour and his profile had led to his removal ...” 9.  on 10 march 2006 o independente published an opinion article, entitled “the liar”, written by the applicant in reply to the article of 3 march 2006. the article was divided into three parts: i) the reasons he had decided to write the article; ii) the problems with the project in question, namely financial mismanagement and lack of staff; and iii) a reaction to the statements made by a.s. the relevant parts of the article read as follows: “last friday, o independente devoted an article to the circumstances surrounding my removal from scientific coordinator of the project... contacted by a.f.s., my declarations focused on two issues of extreme gravity since they undermine the operational functioning of the project: the lack of a cost centre for the financial management and the non-recruitment of the necessary elements for its execution.it further established that from 2004 to 2006, when the applicant had been coordinating the project, he had written various emails and memoranda which had been addressed to the manager of the project, c.t., and the science minister reporting problems in the implementation of the project, and an additional open letter to staff working for the im; the applicant had also had a meeting with the secretary of state for science and innovation where those problems had been discussed.the court further noted that the applicant’s article, and in particular the choice of the words “petty liar” and “poor wretch”, had been vindictive and a personal attack on a.s. the relevant parts of the judgment read as follows: “the article published on 10 march 2006 was the culmination of a tense relationship between [the applicant] and the assistant to the public prosecutor and an example of their professional disagreements.in fact, the phrases had only one purpose – to be used as a counterattack to the interview given by the assistant to a journalist in which he mentioned that he did not consider that [the applicant] was competent to evaluate the progression of the programme, and with the aim of downgrading and humiliating the assistant.” 13.  the lisbon criminal court sentenced the applicant to 250 day fines, totalling 2,000 euros (eur).the relevant parts of the judgment read as follows: “in the instant case the phrases ‘petty liar’ and ‘poor wretch’, in the context of the written piece concerning the professional relationship between the assistant and [the applicant], their academic background and their personal relationship, cannot be disregarded as [the applicant] wishes.
the constitutional court considers it necessary to note at this point that the appellant is wrong when he argues that the agreement between the holy see and croatia on education and cultural affairs does not require a canonical mandate as a condition for employment and that such a requirement only flows from the agreement between the government of croatia and the croatian episcopal conference on catholic religious education in state schools and pre-school institutions of 29 january 1999. the appellant specifically contends that the agreement between the government [of the republic of croatia] and the croatian episcopal conference is a bilateral agreement which ‘is not a statute and does not have the status of an international treaty’ and thus could not be binding for [him and the state] nor could it be applied to [his] case, as was done by the [lower] courts.although the appellant relies on an erroneous premise that the canonical mandate, as a condition for employment as a teacher of religious education, has been stipulated (only) by the agreement between the government [of the republic of croatia] and the croatian episcopal conference, it could be held that in essence he considers that the consequences of the withdrawal of the canonical mandate on his contract of employment, and his position of teacher of religious education, are contrary to the constitution.10.2.4. the enforcement of the obligation undertaken by an international agreement, namely the organisation of catholic religious education in state elementary and high schools and pre-school education institutions, as provided for under the agreement between the holy see and croatia on education and cultural affairs and the agreement between the government of croatia and the croatian episcopal conference, brought religious education teachers into the employment system of the republic of croatia.although their employment status is not fully defined by these agreements, the provisions of the agreement between the holy see and croatia on education and cultural affairs in themselves show that the employment status of religious education teachers is a sui generis employment status – in order to teach religious education they must be suitable for that position in the opinion of the church authorities; they must hold a canonical mandate and the withdrawal of the mandate leads to the loss of the right to teach catholic religious education.in view of the fact that for the position of teacher of religious education there is a further special requirement, without which it is impossible to conclude a contract of employment (a canonical mandate), and having found that the appellant, due to the withdrawal of [the canonical mandate] no longer met the requirements for teaching catholic religious education, and the fact that the defendants had tried to find him another post ..., the [competent] courts, in the constitutional court’s view, applied a constitutionally acceptable interpretation according to which the appellant’s contract of employment had been terminated in accordance with the relevant law.
11.  on 16 october 2007, after becoming aware of the second measure of preventive protection following an enquiry with the land registry, the applicant challenged the extended application of that measure before the ministry of culture (ministarstvo culture, hereafter “the ministry”).it stressed that the decision of 10 january 2007 extending the preventive protection after the expiry of the first three-year period had been necessary, owing to the fact that it had not been possible to obtain an excerpt from the land register from the split municipal court, and that the building represented an important example of early industrial architecture in split.13.  on 31 january 2008 the ministry dismissed the applicant’s appeal as unfounded, on the grounds that there was nothing in the law preventing the competent authority from applying the measure twice for periods of three years, and that the measure of preventive protection had not limited the applicant’s ownership rights.14.  on 9 march 2008 the applicant lodged an administrative action in the administrative court (upravni sud republike hrvatske), challenging the lawfulness and reasonableness of the measure of preventive protection, and emphasising the passivity of the competent authorities in finally resolving the matter.17.  on 10 september 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske), complaining of a violation of his property rights under article 48 of the constitution with regard to the allegedly unlawful and unreasonable application of the measure of preventive protection in respect of his property.
however, it turned out that, according to the documents, the flat was no longer municipal property and that it belonged to l. the federal registration service sent the relevant data to the head of the municipality’s administration on 16 february 2011. the head of the administration asked the regional prosecutor to look into the situation with the flat.10.  on 31 march 2011 the prosecutor responded to the head of the administration advising him as follows: “it appears that the persons who were parties to the transactions with the flat committed a crime in this respect.furthermore, in order to prevent further transactions with the flat, i have asked the chief state registrar to refuse state registration of any future transactions with the flat.” 11.  on an unspecified date the police opened a criminal investigation into the transactions involving the flat.the court reasoned as follows: “pursuant to article 302 of the civil code of the russian federation, if a property has been purchased from a person who had no right to sell it, and the purchaser is unaware and could not have been aware [of that fact] (the bona fide purchaser), the owner shall have the right to reclaim that property from the purchaser, if the said property was lost by the owner or by the person into whose possession the owner has conveyed the property, or if it was stolen from either of them, or if it left their possession against their will in another way.accordingly, the flat ... should be recovered from [the applicant] and transferred to the municipality.” 18.  on 5 march 2012 the chelyabinsk regional court upheld the judgment of 23 december 2011 on appeal.
7.  on 22 november 2006 the nógrád county regional court convicted the first applicant of murder committed with special cruelty and abuse of firearms.8.  on 28 june 2007 the budapest court of appeal upheld the judgment, adding that the murder had been committed for ‘villainous’ reasons, namely, the applicant was considered to have killed the victim in a particularly atrocious manner, so as to prevent her from reporting the initial abduction and stabbing and thereby to cover up a previous crime.10.  on 5 november 2013 the president of the republic dismissed the applicant’s request for pardon, by which he sought commutation of his life sentence to twenty years fixed-term imprisonment as well as allowing the possibility of his release on parole.12.  on 14 may 2010 the borsod-abaúj-zemplén county regional court convicted the second applicant of double murder and abuse of firearms.15.  on 23 october 2014 the president of the republic dismissed the applicant’s request for pardon, by which he sought commutation of his life sentence to twenty years fixed-term imprisonment as well as allowing the possibility of his release on parole.
on the same day the district court dismissed the application, citing the applicant’s history of previous convictions which, in the court’s opinion, demonstrated that he “had failed to take the path of improvement”.16.  on 23 march 2015 the president of the section, acting upon the applicant’ s request, decided to apply rules 39 and 41 of the rules of court, indicating to the government that the applicant should be immediately examined by medical experts which were independent from the prison system.17.  on 7 april 2015 the government responded to the court’s letter of 24 march 2015. it submitted documents related to the applicant’s conviction; certificates issued by the head of the detention facility where the applicant had been previously detained, describing the state of his health and giving a list of medical procedures he had undergone; documents showing that the detention facility was authorised to provide medical services to inmates; extracts from the applicant’s medical history; certificates issued by the head of the prison hospital describing the state of the applicant’s health, the quality of the medical treatment and the conditions of his detention; handwritten statements by three of the prison hospital’s staff stating that they had provided the applicant with the necessary care; the report of the special medical panel of 26 september 2014; and copies of the decisions of 27 november 2014 and 24 february 2015 on his applications for early release.18.  the government also asserted that the scope and quality of the treatment provided to the applicant in the prison hospital was appropriate for his state of health.however, two independent doctors acting at the request of the applicant’s lawyer had assessed the quality of the applicant’s medical treatment in detention and whether his further detention in the prison hospital was appropriate for someone as ill as him.
instituted civil proceedings against the applicants and other four defendants before the matosinhos court seeking the payment of 11,843.48 euros (eur) due to the alleged sale of a part of the plaintiffs’ property.in the notification letter they were given notice that the lack of opposition would entail the confession of the facts pursuant to article 484 § 1 of the code of civil procedure (see paragraph 11 below).in particular: on 21 april 2005 the remaining defendants contested the action; on 3 november 2005 the plaintiffs submitted observations in reply; on 17 october 2007 the plaintiffs lodged a request seeking the intervention of i.t.in the proceedings, which was admitted by the matosinhos court on 29 may 2009; on 15 december 2010 the judge gave directions concerning the matters to be discussed at the hearing (despacho saneador); on 21 march 2012, following i.t.’s death, the matosinhos court stayed the proceedings pending the outcome of inheritance proceedings.9.  on 10 january 2014 the applicants requested the participation of an expert of their own choosing in the preparation of the expert report which had been sought by the plaintiffs.
after the shooting the unidentified persons stole cattle belonging to the applicants ...” 15.  on 17 july 2000 the first applicant complained in writing of the infliction of bodily injuries and the theft of her livestock to the naurskiy district temporary department of the interior (наурский временный отдел внутренних дел) (hereinafter “the naurskiy vovd”).24.  on 24 october 2000 the investigators questioned two of the first applicant’s neighbours, ms s.g. and ms p.kh., both of whom stated that they had not witnessed the incident in october 1999, but that they had been told that the first and second applicants had been shot and wounded by the military servicemen and one man had been shot dead by them and that as a result of the incident the applicants’ cattle had been lost.the reasoning for the decision stated, inter alia, the following: “... the investigation established that an unidentified person had opened fire and wounded in the arm [the first and the second applicants], causing them medium and minor gravity bodily harm, respectively [...] ... it was also established that unidentified persons had committed the theft of sixteen cows belonging to [the applicants] and of two cows belonging to mr m.r.the examination of the contents of the criminal case file demonstrated that the victims [the applicants] had been shot at with firearms, from a distance ... and the location of their wounds showed that life-threatening damage could have been caused to them ... in addition, according to the information in the case file, mr d. had been shot and killed on the spot in [the applicants’] presence.therefore, the above information provides grounds for concluding unequivocally that the unidentified person had the clear intention of killing [the applicants and mr d.]; ... thus, the actions of the unidentified person should be deemed to constitute murder under parts 1 and 2 (subparagraph “a”) of article 105 of the russian criminal code, and the case file in respect of criminal case no.
the experts noted that the municipality also bore 25% responsibility for the two children’s deaths, as (i) they had failed to duly inspect whether the construction, for which it had issued a permit, had complied with the rules on work safety, and to ensure that the construction site had been properly closed off with wooden panels as a safety measure, and (ii) it was not clear on what legal ground it had allowed the digging and the use of the hole in question as a shelter, as such shelters had to be built beneath buildings and not in open spaces.reiterating the factual findings in the previous report of 16 april 1998, the experts identified four main causes of the accident in question: (i) absence of wooden panels around the construction site, which was located in a residential area in close proximity to other houses and public roads; (ii) absence of any railing around the hole; (iii) absence of signs prohibiting entry into the construction site or warning against the water-filled hole on the site; and (iv) lack of diligence of the deceased children.after setting out the circumstances in which the incident had occurred, much like in the previous reports submitted to the criminal court, and referring to the relevant provisions of the labour code and the regulation on workers’ health and occupational safety in construction work, the experts concluded that h.c. bore 85% of the responsibility for the incident on account of his failure to take the necessary safety measures on the construction site, such as erecting wooden panels or other fencing around the site, taking special precautions in those parts of the site that presented a danger of falling, placing warning signs as necessary, informing the construction workers of possible hazards at the construction site and employing a guard to control access to the site.20.  turning to the liability of the deceased children, the report held that while it was natural for the children to have been playing out on the street, they should not have entered the construction site and approached the water-filled hole, the dangers of which were obvious bearing in mind in particular that the ground had been slippery at the relevant time.30.  on 11 march 2011, relying solely on the expert report submitted to the hatay civil court of first instance on 5 november 2004, and without undertaking any analysis of its own as to the responsibilities of the municipality under the applicable legislation and whether it had fulfilled those responsibilities, the hatay administrative court held that no fault was attributable to the municipality on the facts of the instant case and thus dismissed the compensation claims of the applicant and his family.
6.  on 30 march 2007 the applicant, who was at that time a journalist of the weekly magazine wprost, contacted a.c., the then rector of the university of gdańsk, in order to inform him that she considered him to be a long-term informant for the communist secret services in the past.a photo showing a.c. in the course of his official duties alongside the article had the caption: “a.c., rector of the university of gdańsk, used to be an informant for the communist secret services under the name lek”.17.  at a hearing on 15 march 2011 in the latter proceedings, the gdańsk regional court held, referring to documents stored by the ipn, that a.c. had made a true vetting statement to the effect that he had not been an informant for the communist secret services.23.  the court considered that while before it the applicant had referred to ipn documents, neither the documents she had submitted originating from these files nor the full file obtained by the court had supported the conclusion that a.c. had been an informant.the mere fact that the court had gathered more material relevant to establishing the facts concerning a.c.’s past than the applicant had had at her disposal prior to the publication of the impugned articles demonstrated that she had formulated her allegations without a sound factual basis.
the decision of the warsaw court of appeal of 19 september 1996 (upheld by the supreme court (sąd najwyższy) on 22 november 1996) and the decision of the warsaw court of appeal of 6 december 1996 (upheld by the supreme court on 13 january 1997) were all justified by the courts by the existence of strong evidence against the applicant, comprising the testimony of the alleged victim w.s., the results of the line-up and confrontation with witnesses, as well as by the gravity of charges and a need to take additional investigatory measures.the regime was to entail (1) general security measures as regulated by the law, including the monitoring and censorship of the applicant’s correspondence and monitoring and control of his telephone conversations and visits, and, in addition, (2) the use of handcuffs and fetters during the applicant’s transport; (3) transport only with the help of police; and (4) handcuffing the applicant behind the back anywhere outside the remand centre’s living quarters.the requests were justified by invoking: (1) the gravity of the offences of which the applicant had been convicted and the long sentence; (2) the fact that the applicant manifested his hostility towards the agents of the justice department; (3) serious lack of moral character; and (4) other unspecified features of the applicant’s character and his personal qualities (właściwości i warunki osobiste) which, together with the above‑mentioned elements, made him a person who posed a serious threat to the society and to the security of the remand centre.(a)  the imposition of a high-security regime 217.  on 13 may 2010 the administration of pińczów prison requested that the applicant be classified as a prisoner posing a serious threat to society or to security of a prison on the following grounds: (1) the applicant had been convicted of murder with the use of arms and an attempted murder; (2) he had been previously classified as a special-type prisoner within the meaning of article 88 § 3 of the code; (3) in opole lubelskie prison he had been gathering information about officers of radom remand centre and had been inciting prisoners to rebellion; (5) he had received disciplinary punishments many times during his incarceration; (6) he seriously lacked moral character and was vexatious; (7) he had close links with the criminal world; and (8) prisoners looked up to him because of his leadership qualities and facility to dominate other people and the fact that he had become a self-declared speaker for prisoners’ rights.257.  by the letter of a penitentiary judge of the supreme court of 7 november 2002 and a letter of the warsaw election commissary (komisasz wyborczy) of 3 december 2002, the applicant was informed that he should have been allowed to cast his vote in the elections because on 23 october 2002 the remand centre’s management had been officially notified that the ruling depriving the applicant of his civic rights had been quashed by the supreme court on 22 october 2002. the applicant was further informed that, following the supreme court’s judgment, he should have immediately lodged a reclamation about the fact that his name was missing from the register of persons entitled to vote in the remand centre (reklamacja na nieprawidłowości w spisie wyborców).
the written record of the interview repeated almost identically the wording of his initial report (see paragraph 13 above), and added: “we found out that [the applicant] was a minor only at the police station ... had we known that earlier, we would not have used physical coercion and restraining measures against him ... at the time of the arrest, there was blood on [the applicant’s] hand.there were three officers in the car, one of them was a.r., the other was the one with the shaved head who was sitting next to me, and the third was about 172 cm tall; this one had a large build and short dark hair ... in the police station a.r.i gave them my mother’s telephone number, and the officers called her and took me to her ... the officer with the shaved head handed me over to my mother and said “i don’t know how you will react but the officers have given him a little lesson to not run away from them the next time.” 26.  on 22 november 2011 the investigator examined twenty-two photographs of the applicant which had been taken by his mother on 23, 25 and 29 october 2011. the investigator noted that injuries were visible on the applicant’s forehead, arms and legs, upper chest and the left side of his back.the prosecutor opened a pre-trial investigation, noting that the medical examination of the applicant had shown numerous injuries, so it was necessary to assess whether the use of force by the police officers had been within the limits provided in the law (see “relevant domestic law” below).and i left and i didn’t see anything else.” 33.  on 10 july 2012 the applicant’s mother submitted a request to the kaunas city prosecutor for the investigation to be transferred to the prosecutor’s office on the grounds that the kaunas police officers could not be considered impartial.
... this court considers that what is missing in the present case are the reasons for not accepting the status of the accused in the czech republic, the explanation of where the accused actually lives [resides] and, consequently, a clear conclusion as to whether or not he satisfied the conditions set out in article 5 of annex c of the convention on temporary admission ....” 22.  in the resumed proceedings, by a decision of 9 october 2008 the customs administration again found the applicant guilty of committing the same administrative offence and fined him hrk 5,000. the customs administration again found that at the time of the commission of the offence the applicant had had his domicile in croatia according to the domicile and residence of citizens act (see paragraph 32 below) and thus did not satisfy the conditions for exemption from payment of customs duties set forth in article 5 of annex c to the istanbul convention (see paragraph 45 below).161/03 with subsequent amendments), which was in force between 1 november 2003 and 30 june 2013, at the material time read as follows: chapter 5 temporary importation division 2 conditions for granting temporary importation with total relief subdivision 1 road vehicles section 265(1) “total relief [from customs duties] shall be granted for road vehicles ... in the following cases: (a)  if they are registered outside the customs territory of the republic of croatia and in the name of a person outside [that territory]; in the event that [they] are not registered, these conditions shall be considered satisfied if they are owned by a person having seat outside the customs territory of the republic of croatia, b) if they are used by persons having seat outside the customs territory of the republic of croatia ...” ... section 269 “without prejudice to the application of any special provisions, the time-limit for the completion of the temporary importation is ... for road vehicles for private use ... six months within a twelve-month period.” 31.  the relevant part of the general tax act (opći porezni zakon, official gazette, nos.45.  the relevant provisions of the istanbul convention read as follows: chapter i general provisions definitions article 1 “for the purposes of this convention, the term: (a) ‘temporary admission’ means : the customs procedure under which certain goods (including means of transport) can be brought into a customs territory conditionally relieved from payment of import duties and taxes and without application of import prohibitions or restrictions of economic character; such goods (including means of transport) must be imported for a specific purpose and must be intended for re-exportation within a specified period and without having undergone any change except normal depreciation due to the use made of them; ...” ... annex c annex concerning means of transport ... chapter ii scope article 2 “the following shall be granted temporary admission in accordance with article 2 of this convention: (a) means of transport for commercial use or for private use; (b) ...” chapter iii miscellaneous provisions article 5 “for the facilities granted by this annex to apply: (a) ...

he stated that he had used the knife against the victim because he had known that the victim wanted to hit him, although he could not say whether the victim had already hit him at that point or, if not, when the victim was going to attack him.19.  on 27 may 2005 a senior lawyer of the daugavpils bar refused the court’s request to provide the applicant with another state-appointed lawyer, stating that s. had carried out his duties diligently, and article 98 of the code of criminal procedure (kriminālprocesa kodekss) did not give an accused the right to freely choose a lawyer.the court then dismissed the applicant’s application for another forensic medical examination on the grounds that one had already been carried out in november 2004. all the applications were dealt with at a hearing and the applicant was present when the relevant decisions were announced.the written application stated that the applicant was refusing the services of d. on the grounds that all applications made to the court on 1 september 2005 had been drafted by the applicant, and d. had not shown any interest in asking the court to order the examination of witness statements about the scene of the crime, new psychiatric expert evidence, or the correction of the motive in the bill of indictment.it noted that the applicant had declined the services of d. because the latter could not guarantee that he would be acquitted, and the applicant had been of the opinion that d. had not adequately defended him.
5.  by a final judgment of 21 june 1996 the tepelenë district court ordered the tepelenë district council (këshilli i rrethit) to pay the applicant 530,941 albanian leks (all) as compensation for the nationalisation of her house by the state in 1967. the judgment became final on an unspecified date in 1996.7.  by a final judgment of 25 april 2008 the gjirokastër district court ordered the gjirokastër regional council (këshilli i qarkut) to pay the applicant all 1,237,336 as compensation for the delayed enforcement of the tepelenë district court decision of 21 june 1996. the judgment became final on 25 may 2008.9.  from 1996 to 2009 the applicant had continuously addressed letters to the authorities for the enforcement of the final judgments.10.  on 23 january 2009 the constitutional court acknowledged that there had been a breach of the fair trial as a result of the non-enforcement of the final judgments.11.  on 8 december 2009 both judgments were enforced and the sums were paid to the applicant.
s.a. in their tax returns for the years 2002 to 2006. it indicated that the applicants had evaded tax payments of eur 16,360 in 2002, eur 24,270 in 2003, eur 22,500 in 2004, eur 18,512 in 2005 and eur 18,000 in 2006. the search warrant stated that the house search was urgently needed in order to find further evidence and that, weighing the seriousness of the alleged crimes against the constitutional rights of the applicants, the house search was proportionate.even assuming that the german authorities might have committed the criminal offences of acting as an “accessory to a criminal offence” (begünstigung, article 257 § 1 of the german criminal code) and an “accessory to the divulgence of official secrets” (beihilfe zum geheimnisverrat, section 17(1) and section 17(2)(2) of the unfair competition act, in conjunction with article 27 of the german criminal code) in buying the liechtenstein data from k., and that k. might have committed the offence of “industrial espionage” (betriebsspionage, section 17(2)(1) of the unfair competition act), it considered the search warrant to have been lawful.they were of the view that the regional court and the district court should have decided that the search warrant had not been in accordance with the law, as the use of the liechtenstein data as a basis for a search warrant had violated international treaties and the sovereignty of liechtenstein, which had protested against the use of the data.20.  in applying these general principles to the case at hand, the federal constitutional court ruled, at the outset, that it was not necessary to decide upon the question whether the acquisition of the data had been in breach of national or international law or violated the principle of the separation of the secret service and the prosecution in germany, as the regional court had departed in its decision from the applicants’ allegation that the evidence might in fact have been acquired in breach of domestic and international law, including criminal law.22.  with regard to the regional court’s finding that the search order could be based on the liechtenstein data the federal constitutional court found that the regional court’s legal assessment sufficiently took into account the applicants’ basic rights as the regional court had departed from the applicants’ allegation that the evidence had been obtained in breach of domestic law and thus based its decision on, what was, for the applicants, the best possible assumption.
the regional court endorsed the findings which psychiatric expert b. had made in his report dated 4 june 2010 on the possibility of granting relaxation of the conditions of the applicant’s detention (vollzugslockerungen) after having examined the applicant in person.he complained, in particular, that the regional court had failed to obtain a new report by a different expert and had relied on the report of expert b. dating back two-and-a-half years, on relaxation of the conditions of the applicant’s detention, which had not addressed the issues relevant to his continued detention.as regards the finding that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder for the purposes of section 1 (1) of the therapy detention act, the court of appeal stressed that the decision to extend the applicant’s preventive detention had not only been based on the written report submitted by expert b. in 2010. the expert had been heard in person by the regional court in different proceedings (concerning the applicant’s transfer to a psychiatric hospital, see paragraph 19 below) on 6 june 2012 and had updated and confirmed his previous findings.as had been confirmed by the applicant in the hearing before the regional court, his personal and therapeutic situation had not changed since the court of appeal’s last decision of 18 november 2011 in which, in periodic review proceedings, it had ordered the extension of the applicant’s preventive detention.19.  prior to the proceedings at issue, on 14 june 2012 the lübeck regional court dismissed the prosecution’s request to transfer the applicant to a psychiatric hospital for the further execution of his preventive detention under article 67a § 2 of the criminal code (see paragraph 23 below).
11.  the applicant was detained in the following detention facilities: - the simferopol temporary detention facility (“the simferopol itt”, a part of the police system): from 25 september to 26 october and from 4 to 19 november 2004 (during the intervening period from 26 october to 4 november 2004 the applicant was undergoing a forensic psychiatric examination in a psychiatric hospital); - the simferopol pre-trial detention centre (“the simferopol sizo”): from 19 november 2004 to 16 march 2006 and from 2 may to 18 october 2006; - the dnipropetrovsk sizo: from 17 march to 6 april, from 25 april to 1 may and from 19 to 29 october 2006; - the kyiv sizo: from 7 to 25 april 2006 (that is during the time when the applicant’s case was examined by the supreme court); - the odessa sizo: from 30 october to 4 november 2006 (the applicant raised no complaints in respect of his detention there); and - kherson prison no.(b)  in the simferopol sizo 20.  according to the information note issued by the governor of the simferopol sizo on 29 november 2012 at the request of the government’s agent, the applicant was detained in the following cells: - from 19 november 2004 to 18 march 2005 and from 22 april to 23 november 2005 – in cell no.22.  the case file contains a copy of the sizo governor’s decision of 24 november 2005 about the applicant’s placement in a separate cell of the maximum security unit on the ground of the prevention of the spread of tuberculosis (the applicant was then diagnosed with active tuberculosis).39.  on 17 october 2012 an official of the kherson city prosecutor’s office in charge of the supervision of lawfulness in penitentiaries, a representative of the association of ukrainian human rights monitors in law-enforcement institutions, as well as the governor and the deputy governor of the prison, conducted “a monitoring visit” of the prison.88.  in october 2006 the court received several copies of the completed application form from the applicant, in which he elaborated, in particular, on the complaints, which he had outlined in his initial letter to the court, including about the conditions of his detention in the simferopol, dnipropetrovsk and kyiv sizos.
10.  on 29 march 2004 the investigating judge drew up an indictment in respect of the applicant and c.g., accusing the applicant of having forged: (a) a certificate from the tax authorities attesting that he had paid inheritance tax on land valued at eur 63,768,920, whereas he knew that the land was part of the public forest estate and the tax had not been paid; and (b) a document allegedly issued by the penteli forestry commission attesting that the land was not part of the forest estate.addressing the findings of m.m.k.’s report, it noted the following: “the forgery of the aforementioned certificates by the first two defendants has been validly proved beyond all doubt, in particular through the handwriting analysis by the graphology expert m.m.k., the contents of which the court finds entirely convincing; in addition, the report’s credibility is backed up by the documents in the file and the witness testimony.the defendants who are asking for the above-mentioned witnesses to be called to testify in court have, moreover, not stated the reason for their request ...” 21.  as regards the expert report by m.m.k., the court of appeal held that the applicant had had no factual or legal basis for challenging it, and that his objections were contradicted by the factual circumstances, which were established and undisputed.summing up, over six pages, the factual circumstances as established by the documents and the witness testimony, the court of appeal also mentioned the findings of m.m.k.’s report, describing it as “detailed” while adding: “the contents and conclusions of the handwriting analysis by m.m.k.has produced a detailed analytical report, which has been read out in court ... the defendants who are asking for the above-mentioned witnesses to be called to testify in court have, moreover, not stated the reason for their request ...’ accordingly, the ground of appeal submitted to that end by john constantinides, alleging a violation of article 510 § 1 (a) and (d) [failure to provide specific reasons] of the code of criminal procedure, is unfounded and must be dismissed, since no provision relating to the accused’s defence rights has been infringed, whether article 6 § 3 (d) of the convention or the constitutional requirement to provide detailed and specific reasons for a judicial decision.” ...
13.  on 27 march 2013 an investigator at the prosecutor’s office of the zavodskyy district of mykolayiv terminated the criminal proceedings, finding no elements of a crime on the part of the itt officers in question.14.  on 24 july 2013 the zavodskyy district court of mykolayiv quashed the decision of 27 march 2013 as unfounded, noting that the investigator had failed to take the necessary measures in the case.15.  on 3 october 2013 the investigator terminated the criminal proceedings, concluding that there was no evidence to suggest that the itt staff had caused the death of the applicant’s son.16.  relying on the available evidence, the investigator found that, shortly before his death, the applicant’s son had unsuccessfully attempted to commit suicide by asphyxiating himself with a rope which he had produced from the bed linen.17.  as regards the applicant’s son’s condition during his detention, the available medical evidence suggested that a.g. had not had any acute condition necessitating his admission to hospital during his detention in the itt; on the other hand, he had been medically supervised within the itt.
10.  on 25 august 2010 the assistant prosecutor of the kyivskyy district prosecutor’s office of kharkiv (“the prosecutor’s office”) inspected the premises of the police station where the applicant had allegedly been ill-treated.14.  on 29 october 2010 the prosecutor’s office, having completed its pre-investigation inquiry, refused to initiate criminal proceedings concerning the applicant’s allegations that he had been ill-treated by police officers between 16 and 19 august 2010. according to that decision, the applicant had only been present at the district police station between 7 a.m. and 9.45 a.m. on 16 august 2010 and there had been no evidence suggesting that the police officers had been involved in any alleged ill‑treatment or unlawful detention.according to the decision, which referred to the explanations by the police officers and other evidence, the applicant had left the police station at 9.45 a.m. on 16 august 2010 and there had been no involvement of the officers in any unlawful action in relation to the applicant.23.  on 15 december 2014 the kharkiv region prosecutor’s office terminated the investigation, finding that the applicant’s allegations had been refuted by the statements of the police officers, other witnesses, and documentary and medical evidence which suggested that the applicant might have sustained minor injuries during his fight with the neighbour on 15 august 2010.38.  on the same day the deputy prosecutor of the kyivskyy district of kharkiv ordered that the applicant be examined and asked the medical expert to detail, among other things, the nature, quantity, location, and severity of his injuries.
in the course of the proceedings, neither the opposing party nor any of the courts raised any doubts as to whether the rei was the correct defendant in the case.10.  following the entry into force of the judgment of 24 november 2005, the applicant applied to take up her duties on 6 december 2005. on the same day a new order for her dismissal was issued by the head of the rei.it appears from the case file that at the first court hearing, the date of which was not specified, the rei argued that it was not the proper defendant in the case and that the claims had to be addressed to the secondary school in which the applicant had been working prior to her dismissal.12.  during a court hearing on 12 april 2006 the district court ruled in favour of the objection, and, reasoning that the proper defendant in the case was the school, discontinued the proceedings.14.  on 26 may 2006 the regional court quashed the decision of the lower court, explicitly stating that the proper defendant in the applicant’s case was the rei.
following an application by the applicant to have his contact time increased, the family court held on 16 january 2001 an oral hearing, joined the proceedings on contact to the proceedings on custody rights previously initiated by ms k. in 1999, and commissioned an expert opinion with regard to the custody of d. on 1 october 2001 the applicant requested that the family court impose a fine on ms k., because she was not cooperating.on 16 november 2001, after the appointed psychology expert had informed the family court that he considered that contact with the father was in the child’s best interest, the parties concluded an in-court settlement according to which contact between the applicant and his son should be re-established.30.  on 12 december 2008, before the expert had submitted her expert opinion, the family court decided to suspend the applicant’s contact until 31 december 2011. it considered that because of the massive and continuing conflict between the parents, the child would experience a serious conflict of loyalty if contact was enforced.33.  on 12 may 2009 the family court rejected the applicant’s application for custody while having regard to the fact that neither the appointed guardian ad litem nor the expert had been able to examine ms k. and the child owing to ms k.’s refusal.34.  on 30 june 2009, the cologne court of appeal rendered its decision on the basis of the case-file and confirmed the family court’s decision to suspend contact (see paragraph 30 above), even though this decision meant that ms k., who – for whatever reason – had wanted to prevent contact with the applicant, had managed to attain her aim.
6.  the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in vlora.7.  on 30 may 2007 the vlora district court ordered the vlora construction police (policia e ndërtimit dega vlorë) to pay the applicant 2,795,956 albanian leks (“all”) for the unjustified destruction of his property.8.  on 11 june 2008 the decision was upheld by the vlora court of appeal and became final.10.  from 2009 to 2012 the bailiff unsuccessfully sought the enforcement of the decision from the vlora construction police and the national urban construction inspectorate (inspektorati ndërtimor urbanistik kombëtar).11.  to date, the final decision has remained unenforced.
8.  a second recommendation to the same effect was made, following the applicant’s second parole board review on 31 january 2007 and rejected by the secretary of state on 23 may 2007. at the conclusion of its statement of reasons for rejecting the board’s recommendation, the national offender management service (“noms”) wrote: “the secretary of state has therefore decided that you should remain in closed conditions and your next review will conclude in january 2008.” 9.  the accompanying letter stated: “it has been decided that your case will next be referred to the parole board for a provisional hearing to take place in january 2008.if you are not content with the paper panel’s decision you may request that the case proceeds to the arranged oral hearing.” 10.  the case was referred to the parole board on 21 december 2007. on 6 may 2008 the applicant and the parole board were sent relevant reports as required by the applicable rules.this delay had prevented the applicant from having the lawfulness of his continued detention decided in accordance with article 5 § 4. on the question of damages, the court was satisfied that the applicant had shown, on a balance of probabilities, that he would have been released had the review taken place in march 2008. damages on the basis of a loss of liberty were therefore appropriate.17.  as regards the alleged violation of article 5 § 1 of the convention, lord reed, giving the leading opinion, observed that article 5 § 4 provided a procedural entitlement designed to ensure that persons were not detained in violation of their rights under article 5 § 1. however, he added, a violation of article 5 § 4 did not necessarily result in a violation of article 5 § 1. he considered this court’s judgment in james, wells and lee, cited above, not to be directly relevant to the applicant’s case since that judgment concerned lack of access to rehabilitation courses and the just satisfaction awards made were for the feelings of distress and frustration resulting from continued detention without access to courses, and not for loss of liberty.he considered that no clear guidance could be derived from the cases since none concerned awards for loss of liberty resulting from a violation of the speedy decision guarantee in article 5 § 4. while, he said, an appellate court would not interfere with an award of damages simply because it would have awarded a different figure if it had tried the case at first instance, in the applicant’s appeal the court was being invited to give guidance as to the appropriate level of awards in cases of this character.
14.  on 6 august, 27 november and 3 december 2014 and on 9 january and 4 june 2015 the applicant consulted the prison doctor, complaining in particular of discomfort in the hypochondrium (below the lower ribs), on the right-hand side.19.  on 19 june 2015 the acting president of the section, upon the applicant’s request under rule 39 of the rules of court, decided to indicate to the government that they should present the applicant urgently for medical examination by a specialised doctor of the city hospital; secure for the applicant immediately, by appropriate means, treatment to his state of health; and inform the court by 17 july 2015 about the applicant’s state of health and the measures undertaken.26.  the relevant part of the report to the ukrainian government on the visit to ukraine carried out by the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment from 9 to 21 october 2013 reads as follows: “161.the committee recommends that measures be taken to remedy this regrettable state of affairs.” 27.  in 2013 the ukrainian parliamentary commissioner for human rights published a special report dedicated to the monitoring of the observance of the right to medical care in the remand prisons within the purview of the state correctional service of ukraine.28.  on 29 april 2013 the cabinet of ministers approved a state programme for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of viral hepatitis for the period until the end of 2016. the programme stipulates a number of goals to be achieved over that period, including extending access to hepatitis treatment to 30% of all patients.
the court referred to the gravity of charges, the applicant’s character, lack of permanent residence in saint-petersburg, and risk of absconding or re-offending.8.  on 7 april 2005 the district court returned the case to the prosecutor and extended the applicant’s detention without specifying any reasons.10.  on 2 march 2006 the saint-petersburg city court quashed the detention order of 15 december 2005 and remitted the case for a fresh examination.11.  on 16 march 2006, 22 march 2006 and 21 june 2006 the district court extended the applicant’s detention referring to the gravity of charges, absence of permanent residence, his character, possibility of absconding and committing crimes.as regards the applicant’s appeal against the detention order of 21 june 2006, the court noted that the lower court had failed to ensure the applicant’s and his lawyer’s presence at the hearing of 21 june 2006. however, in view of the applicant’s conviction, it discontinued the appeal proceedings finding them unnecessary.
8.  mr semenov appealed: on 14 july 2006 against the detention order of 11 july 2006 and on 12 september 2006 against the order of 11 september 2006.9.  on 22 august and 3 october 2006, respectively, the tver regional court dismissed the appeals and upheld the detention orders.12.  on 16 november 2006 the regional court dispatched the case-file to the supreme court which on 11 january 2007 upheld the decision of 11 october 2006.on 1 march 2007 the regional court transmitted the case-file to the supreme court which on 11 april 2007 upheld the order.17.  the detention order was upheld on appeal by the moscow city court on 27 august 2007.
5.  on 5 july 2007 the applicant, a police officer at the material time, was arrested on suspicion of abuse of official powers causing serious damage.6.  on 6 july 2007 the zamoskvoretskiy district court of moscow remanded the applicant in custody on the ground of the gravity of charges.7.  on 3 september 2007, 11 december 2007, 10 april 2008 and 1 july 2008 the district court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention stating that the investigation was still pending, the case comprised 118 volumes and concerned fifteen suspects, the applicant had been suspected of a serious crime, could interact with his accomplices, abscond, destroy evidence and threaten witnesses.8.  on 30 december 2008 and 20 april 2009 the district court issued collective detention orders in respect of the applicant and other co-accused pending their study of the case-file.the court referred to the gravity of the charges, the defendants’ possibility to abscond, commit crimes and interfere with the investigation.
at the bottom of the record, the applicant has written that it had been explained to him that the search and seizure could be appealed to a higher authority and that, while the record had been handed to him at 1 p.m., the actual seizure of the ticket by officer a. had taken place at 8.30 a.m. at the check-in desk.on the statement the applicant has written that the ticket was obtained legally and that, relying on article 51 of the constitution (the right against self-incrimination) he refused to give any further explanation because he had been detained illegally in the departure hall without explanation.when questioned, the head of the operational-search unit of the aviation division of the department of the interior, [s.], stated that, on 18 may 2007, on the occasion of the high-profile summit in samara the policemen of the aviation division of the moscow branch of the department of the interior, together with its subordinate units in the airports of the moscow region, carried out operational search activities to identify persons of an extremist nature intending to organise mass riots.... held: 1.  to refuse the institution of criminal proceedings further to the complaint about the commission of criminal offences of [abuse of powers] and [exceeding official powers] by the [eleven policemen involved] for absence of corpus delicti.” 18.  the applicant challenged this decision before a court under the procedure set out in article 125 of the code of criminal procedure.the court found the applicant’s allegations about the unlawfulness of the ticket seizure to be unsubstantiated, finding that the seizure had been carried out in accordance with articles 27.7 and 27.10 of the code of administrative offences (see paragraph 26 below).
the administrative decision ordered the owner of the protected water reserve, the hungarian state, to make an offer compensating the owners of the plots of land within the protection zone within sixty days.the decision also required that if the owner of the protected water reserve was different from that of the land in the protection zone, the owner of the protected water reserve had the obligation to acquire ownership of the land in the protection zone, either through expropriation or through a sale and purchase agreement (see paragraphs 24 and 25 below).11.  on 16 november 2005 the owners of the plots of land within the protection zone addressed a letter to the treasury asset management directorate (kincstári vagyoni igazgatóság), the trustee of the water reserve, offering their plots of land for sale and asking the directorate to make an offer.12.  the directorate transferred the request to the central danube valley inspectorate for environmental protection, nature conservation and water management (közép-dunavölgyi környezetvédelmi és vízügyi igazgatóság), which, due to lack of jurisdiction, returned the case to the directorate on 13 december 2005, informing the ministry of environment protection and water management about the measure.21.  on 14 december 2010 the pest county governmental office (pest megyei kormányhivatal) (the legal successor of the central hungarian regional administration office) ordered national asset management inc. (magyar nemzeti vagyonkezelő zrt) (the legal successor of the treasury asset management directorate) to serve an expropriation notice on the land owners within ninety days of receipt of the decision.
8.  on 15 october 1999 the enforcement court ordered the ministry of interior to provide the exact address of the debtor.12.  on 4 october 2005 the enforcement court again ordered the ministry of interior to provide the exact address of the debtor.14.  on 18 november 2005 the bailiff went to the address provided by the said ministry and established that the debtor was no longer living there and that he had moved away to an unknown address.15.   on 20 january 2006 the enforcement court requested the ministry of interior to provide the exact address of the debtor and his latest known place of residence.16.  on 24 october 2006 the enforcement court informed the applicant that the ministry did not establish the exact address of the debtor nor did it initiate misdemeanour proceedings against the debtor in accordance with article 25 of the domicile and temporary residence act (see paragraph 22).
6.  on 7 october 2005 the leninskiy district court of cheboksary convicted the applicant of fraud and sentenced him to six years and nine months’ imprisonment.8.  on 22 june 2007 the presidium of the supreme court of the chuvash republic quashed the judgments of 7 october and 13 december 2005 and remitted the case for a fresh examination.10.  on 22 november 2007 the leninskiy district court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention, having noted that: “... taking into account the seriousness of the charges against [the applicant], his health condition, personal profile, a possibility that he might abscond, the court considers that the previous measure of restraint should remain unchanged ...” 11.  on 5 february 2008 the supreme court of the chuvash republic upheld this decision on appeal.having heard the parties, the court ruled that: “... as it can be seen from the case file, [the applicant] has been accused of a serious crime, which is punishable with an imprisonment exceeding two years.being at large, [the applicant] may abscond and continue his criminal activity...” 13.  on 27 march 2008 the leninskiy district court convicted the applicant of fraud and sentenced him to five years and ten months’ imprisonment.
6.  on 5 september 2008 the leninskiy district court of ufa remanded the applicant in custody noting as follows: “[the applicant] is charged with serious offences, which fact suggests that, being a former law enforcement officer, if released, he may interfere with the establishment of the truth, influence or threaten witnesses and victims, continue criminal activities or abscond and it will not be possible to complete the investigation or conduct a trial.relying on the seriousness of the charges against the applicant, the district court extended the applicant’s detention during investigation on 30 october and 18 december 2008. on 15 july and 20 october 2009, 20 january, 15 april, 16 june, 19 august and 15 november 2010 the supreme court of the bashkortostan republic extended the applicant’s detention pending trial.relying further on the seriousness of the charges against the five defendants, the supreme court reasoned that, if released, they might abscond, continue criminal activities or interfere with the establishment of the truth.according to the stamp on the court’s letter of 17 april 2009, the correctional colony received it on 2 september 2009. then the administration of the correctional colony sent the letter back to remand prison no.the letter arrived there on 2 october 2009 and on the same day the applicant received it (according to the applicant, he received the letter on 5 october 2009).
12.  subsequently the kaunas regional prosecutor (hereinafter “the prosecutor”), at the request of the kca and relying on the findings of the audit report, asked the domestic courts to reopen the civil proceedings concerning the size of s.f.’s land, and to suspend the enforcement of all the kca’s decisions concerning the restoration of property rights in respect of that land.she stated that on 23 october 2001 the kca had restored her property rights by cancelling her debt to the state, but due to circumstances beyond the applicant’s control the ministry of finance had only informed the bank about the cancellation on 6 december 2004. the applicant submitted that from 23 october 2001 until 6 december 2004 she had repeatedly contacted the bank and asked it to not count the interest and late payment fines.thus, she considered that the bank had known about the cancellation of her debt, and it was therefore unjust and unfair for it to ask her for any payments for that period, or to unilaterally terminate the loan agreement of 2000. the applicant further asserted that in the period of 2001‑2002 she had paid the bank a total of ltl 5,222.26 (eur 1,512.47) in interest and late payment fines under the two loan agreements; she claimed that there had been no grounds for the bank to accept those payments, and asked the court to order the bank to return them to her.the court also noted that the delay in the cancellation of the applicant’s debt had been caused not by the actions of the bank but by those of the kca and the prosecutor, so the bank had had the right to receive interest payments during the period in question.in addition, the supreme administrative court distinguished between the kca’s competence and that of the ministry of finance: while the kca was responsible for the restoration of property rights, it was the ministry of finance which had the authority to cancel the applicant’s debt and issue the bank with a certificate confirming such cancellation.
7.  on 10 september 1997 the kolpashevo town court of the tomsk region dismissed the applicants’ claims in full.8.  on 17 october 1997 the aforesaid judgment was quashed further to the applicants’ appeal by the tomsk regional court and the case was remitted for fresh examination.12.  on 8 september 1998 the regional court upheld the judgment in part but remitted the claim for salary arrears for a fresh examination.17.  on 23 april 1999 the regional court quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case for fresh examination.22.  on 13 march 2002 the presidium of the tomsk regional court, by way of supervisory review, quashed judgments of 14 january and 15 february 2000 and remitted the case for fresh consideration.

twelve of them have already been solved, thanks to the industry of the police department and the investigators from the prosecutor’s office.... the fingerprint identification of ex-convict [n.b.]but even after these downright senseless murders, the crime wave in the town continued.” 8.  when the case came to trial before the sverdlovsk regional court, the applicant moved to disqualify the prosecutor for the prejudice apparent in that interview.on 4 october 2002 the court refused the motion because the prosecutor had only cited facts from the investigative file, had affirmed the applicant’s complicity but not his guilt, and was not personally interested in the outcome of the trial.on 23 october 2003 the supreme court upheld the sentence, leaving unanswered the applicant’s complaint about the press interview.10.  in reply to a post-conviction complaint brought by the applicant, in december 2004 the sverdovsk regional prosecutor’s office found that the interview had breached the agency’s ethics policy as it had preceded the trial without, however, tangibly redressing the applicant.
the detention orders were essentially based on the gravity of the charges, the primary grounds being the risk of the applicants’ absconding and interfering with the course of justice.5.  the first applicant was born in 1973 and lived, prior to his arrest, in yekaterinburg, sverdlovsk region.6.  the second applicant was born in 1978 and lived, prior to his arrest, in angarsk, irkutsk region.7.  the third applicant was born in 1967 and lived, prior to his arrest, in yekaterinburg.the applicant was arrested on 16 august 2012. on 17 august 2012 the court held to place him in pre-trial detention.
the order stated that in the course of the applicant’s interview the police officers, who had failed to carry out their duties in accordance with the service regulations and to take into account the applicant’s personality, had opened a window thereby creating conditions for the applicant to jump out of it.33.  the moskovskiy district prosecutor’s office and subsequently the cheboksary inter-district investigation department of the investigative committee at the chuvashiya prosecutor’s office refused to open a criminal case into the applicant’s alleged ill-treatment and unlawful deprivation of liberty twenty-four times, pursuant to article 24 § 1 (2) of the code of criminal procedure (“ccrp”), because none of the elements of the offences provided for in articles 127, 285, 286, 299 and 301 of the criminal code (unlawful deprivation of liberty, abuse of powers, criminal prosecution of persons known to be innocent and unlawful arrest and detention respectively) were present in respect of the actions of the police officers.the investigator stated that injuries other than those to both feet had been found on the applicant at the time of his admission, as set out in the forensic medical expert’s report of 14 december 2006. however, the lack of any detailed description of those injuries in the applicant’s medical records had made it impossible to establish when and how they had been received, in particular whether they had been received as a result of him falling from the first floor or being beaten up.38.  the decision of 2 december 2008 also referred to the applicant’s statements that immediately before his arrest he had been drinking, and to statements by the investigator from the district police and a police officer who had guarded the applicant at the hospital on 9 october 2006 that the applicant had allegedly stated off the record that he had jumped out of the window himself trying to flee, without any influence by the police officers.40.  on 3 november 2009 the district court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the most recent refusal to open a criminal case, finding that the investigating authorities had carried out all the measures necessary for establishing the relevant facts fully, objectively and thoroughly, and had taken a reasoned decision on the basis of a full and comprehensive inquiry in accordance with the law.

6.  on 5 march 2009 he was committed for trial before the oktyabrskiy district court of irkutsk.7.  on 3 august 2009 the district court extended his pre-trial detention on the ground that the circumstances of the case had not changed since the applicant’s arrest, he was accused of a serious crime, did not live at his domicile, hence he could abscond, threaten witnesses and interfere with the investigation.8.  on 26 november 2009 and 2 march 2010 the district court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention referring to the above grounds and stating that the victims of his crimes were minors.the court also took into account the applicant’s character, his state of health and age.9.  the applicant’s appeals against the detention orders were rejected.

7.  on 27 october 1999 the elista town court of the republic of kalmykiya (“the town court”) awarded the applicant monthly payments as compensation for damage to her health, with subsequent index-linked adjustment in accordance with changes in the statutory minimum monthly salary.5 of the republic of kalmykiya (“the justice of the peace”) ordered the ministry to pay the applicant the interest in respect of certain delays in the monthly payments, in accordance with the judgment of 27 october 1999. on 22 february 2007 the judge agreed with the applicant’s calculation of the delay interest (based on the index-linking of the monthly payments in accordance with the changes in the statutory minimum monthly salary).on 25 june 2007 the town court held that, as a result of changes in the relevant legislation, as of 1 january 2003 the index-linking of the amounts in question was to be based on changes in the level of inflation.13.  in a letter received on 1 october 2009 the applicant informed the court that in august 2009 the ministry had stopped paying the monthly payments, owing to a lack of funds in the relevant budget.14.  according to the government, the amount due to the applicant from august 2009 onwards was paid to her in full on 8 october 2009. on 11 november 2009 the town court awarded her delay interest for late payment in respect of the delays in payment between september and october 2009. the judgment came into force on 23 november 2009, and was executed on 9 december 2009.

... [l]oss of control over drinking and complete lack of awareness regarding alcohol abuse and its consequences result in a high probability of the repetition of previous relapses and, therefore, in behaviour which could, for similar reasons, pose a threat to the financial, social and personal stability of the person examined.” 9.  in a judgment of 16 october 2012 the district court, having examined an expert report and heard the expert and the applicant, decided to limit the latter’s legal capacity to act.... apart from the fact that the provisions of the civil law require that the legal act – the conclusion of the contract on provision of residential social services – be approved by the court, another requirement of generally binding rules, or more precisely the commitments of the czech republic under international law, cannot be overlooked, i.e. article 5 § 4 of the convention ... ... [in the applicant’s case], in order to comply with the convention, the czech republic ... guarantees ... the right to institute proceedings in which the court would speedily decide on the lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty and order the [applicant’s] release if the deprivation of liberty is unlawful.44.  on 28 november 2011 the applicant lodged a second constitutional appeal challenging the decisions of the prague municipal court of 19 september 2011 and the plzeň regional court of 4 october 2011, the procedural measures taken by the prague 4 district court and the plzeň-jih district court and, lastly, the practice of the prague 11 municipal office.the same applied in respect of the procedural steps taken by the prague 11 municipal office and by the prague 4 district court, as the district court, in its judgment of 10 november 2011, had approved the agreement concluded with the social care home by the public guardian and the latter’s termination of the agreement.62.  in a decision of 11 july 2013 the district court discontinued the proceedings for damages on the grounds that, as the applicant was fully legally incapacitated, the power of attorney that he had given to his representatives was null and void, and that in a letter of 28 june 2013 the guardian ad litem had informed the court that it would not join the proceedings.
20.  in an undated letter submitted to the shevchenkivsky court on 8 june 2015 the kyiv sizo governor and the head of its medical unit informed the court that the applicant was receiving art at the sizo but her cancer could only be treated with radiation therapy, which could not be provided at the sizo.23.  on 1 july 2015 the acting president of the section decided, upon the applicant’s request under rule 39 of the rules of court, to indicate to the government that they should present the applicant urgently for medical examination by a specialist doctor; secure immediately, by appropriate means, treatment of the applicant appropriate to her conditions, and inform the court by 1 august 2015 about the applicant’s state of health and the measures undertaken.30.  on 31 july 2015 the government informed the court of the steps taken by the authorities after the court had indicated the interim measure and provided the relevant medical documentation.34.  on 16 september 2015 the applicant left the kyiv sizo for the hiv treatment facility, travelling through the odessa sizo, where she was held from 17 to 19 september, and the kherson sizo, where she was held from 20 to 24 september 2015. on 24 september 2015 she arrived at the hiv treatment facility.37.  on 25 september 2015 the government again informed the court of the medical examinations the applicant had undergone during the period following the court’s decision to indicate the interim measure.
7.  the applicant stated in his application that no coercive measures had been applied to him during or after his arrest on 17 august 2005. he also noted that immediately after his arrest he had been brought to the local police station, where the officer on duty had examined him and had drawn up a report about his injuries in the presence of two attested witnesses.she finalised the examination report on 16 september 2005, in which she documented the following injuries: a bruise measuring 2 x 1 cm in the applicant’s left temple, another bruise of about the same size on the right part of his head, a 6 x 0.2 cm bruise and abrasion under his right eye, a horizontal linear abrasion on the right part of his torso measuring 3  x 0.6 cm, a bruise of 2 x 1 cm and a vertical linear abrasion measuring 18 x 3 cm on his left thigh.14.  the applicant submitted that the expert had not reported all his injuries and that he had not dared to complain to her of his ill-treatment, firstly, because of the presence of the officers in question during his examination and, secondly, because he had been ashamed in front of a woman.17.  in his reply to the government’s observations on the admissibility and merits of the application, the applicant submitted a different version of the events: that his first questioning had actually taken place on 19 august 2005 and that its report had wrongly been dated 18 august 2005.37.  both the applicant and the lawyer acting on his behalf appealed against the conviction, arguing principally that the applicant’s guilt had not been proven (there had been no sufficient material evidence and the statements of the applicant and of the witnesses had been inconsistent) and that the conviction was based on the applicant’s statements obtained under duress.
the decision, based on section 98 (1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973 (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство – “the tupa”), stated that the applicant’s husband was to be compensated with a four-room flat and a garage in a building which the municipality intended to construct.even though, after judicial review initiated by the applicant’s husband, in a final judgment of 18 march 1987 the sofia city court ordered the mayor to supplement the decision and specify the exact garage to be provided to the applicant’s husband, this was not done.10.  in a letter signed by the chief architect of sofia and dated 8 july 2009 the applicant was informed that the decision of 12 september 1986 had not yet been supplemented to specify the garage to be provided to her because no buildings with garages earmarked for the purpose were being built.in a final judgment of 23 june 2010 the supreme administrative court dismissed her claim, noting that the case at hand did not concern what was defined by statute as “unlawful failure to act”, but instead the enforcement of the judgment of 18 march 1987 (see paragraph 7 above), which had to be pursued under a different procedure.in a final decision of 23 september 2010 the supreme administrative court declared the claim inadmissible, on the ground that the courts had already established in the judgment of 23 june 2010 that there had not been any unlawful failure to act on the part of the administrative authorities.
21.  on 12 november 2003 the voroshylivsky district court of donetsk (hereafter “the voroshylivsky court”) allowed this claim, having found, in particular, that article 113 of the civil code of ukraine of 1963 did not authorise the transfer of title to a part of shared property, which had not been divided into allocated parts and that it also obliged co-owners of a shared property to seek the consent of their counterparts before carrying out transactions in it.(by then the owner of half the flat) of his share against payment by the applicant of compensation in the amount of uah 5,602. the court noted, in particular, that there was extensive evidence that the defendants had allowed numerous strangers to live in the flat; that the applicant had been harassed; and that the flat’s appliances and the applicant’s belongings had been misused and damaged.26.  on 20 october 2005 the regional court, having reviewed the case on appeal by the applicant’s opponents, upheld the judgment with respect to the reimbursement of the costs borne on the flat by the applicant and the revocation of v.s.’s right to occupy it, as he no longer owned any share in the flat.the relevant part of the judgment read as follows: “neither the provisions of the housing code of ukraine nor those of the civil code of ukraine of 2003, which the applicant cites as the basis for her claims, nor the property law of ukraine, envisage dispossession of the owner of his or her property and his or her eviction from a flat owned by him or her on the grounds cited by the applicant.” 27.  the applicant appealed in cassation.it noted, in particular, as follows: “... the court comes to a conclusion that the basis of the present criminal proceedings is the existence of a private-law dispute between the defendants and the injured parties concerning the use of shared property, which the injured parties demand to resolve by way of criminal proceedings in view of their extremely antagonistic relationship with the defendants.” 49.  on 27 february 2012 the regional court quashed this verdict on appeal by the prosecution and the injured parties and remitted the case for retrial.
the expropriation decision, based on section 98 (1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973 (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство – “the tupa”), provided in particular that in compensation the applicants were to receive a three-room flat.its value was set at 21,185 old bulgarian levs (bgl), later amended to bgl 21,231. the applicants paid to the municipality the part of this amount which was not covered by the value of the expropriated property.10.  the action was dismissed on 21 february 2006 by the sofia district court, which found that the applicants had not proven that they had sustained damage, in particular because they had been accommodated in a municipally-owned dwelling, and that in any event domestic law provided for a special remedy for persons in the applicants’ situation, namely the possibility to request a new valuation of the expropriated property.in a letter by the municipality dated 2 june 2006 and signed by a deputy mayor, they were informed that they were not entitled to seek such a valuation since they had not been the owners of the expropriated property.13.  in the tort proceedings, in judgments of 14 december 2006 and 8 july 2008 the sofia city court and the supreme court of cassation upheld the sofia district court’s judgment of 21 february 2006, reiterating its findings.

the investigator cited the following grounds for his decision: “... taking into account that the materials of the criminal case provide sufficient grounds to believe that, if at large, [the applicant] will not abscond from the authority dealing with the case, obstruct the investigation and commit a criminal offence ...” 8.  on 9 august 2010 the charge against the applicant was modified to a more severe one under article 112 of the cc following the results of the forensic medical examination, according to which the damage to health suffered by y.p.9.  on the same date the investigator filed a motion with the lori regional court seeking to have the applicant detained, taking into account the fact that the materials of the case provided sufficient reasons to believe that, if at large, the applicant could obstruct the investigation by exerting unlawful influence on the persons involved in the proceedings and commit a new criminal offence, as well as the nature and dangerousness of the offence.11.  on 10 august 2010 the lori regional court, having heard the applicant, found the investigator’s motion to be well-founded and decided to grant it by ordering the applicant’s detention for a period of two months: “... taking into account the nature and dangerousness of the act committed by [the accused], and the fact that, if at large, he may abscond from the authority dealing with the case or obstruct the investigation by exerting unlawful influence on the persons involved in the criminal proceedings, as well as avoid liability and sentence.” 12.  on 12 august 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal arguing, inter alia, that his detention on conditions provided by article 135 of the ccp was incompatible with the guarantees of article 5 of the convention.13.  on 3 september 2010 the criminal court of appeal decided to uphold the regional court’s decision, finding that: “... the severity of the sentence risked by [the applicant] provides sufficient ground to believe that, if at large, [the applicant] may abscond from the authority dealing with the case, obstruct the investigation and avoid criminal liability and serving the imposed sentence ... ... thus, the regional court ... has ensured the requirement of [article 134 of the ccp] to prevent the accused’s inappropriate behaviour in the course of the criminal proceedings, as it was impossible to ensure this by applying other available preventive measures in this particular case and was also in the public interest.” 14.  on 24 september 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, which was declared inadmissible for lack of merit by the court of cassation’s decision of 29 october 2010.17.  on 4 october 2010 the regional court decided to grant the investigator’s motion, finding that the grounds for the applicant’s detention – as stated in its decision of 10 august 2010 – still persisted, and it was necessary to extend the detention in order to complete the investigation.

8.  on 28 march 2007 the same court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention for two more months on the ground that there was a considerable volume of investigative measures to be carried out and there were no reasons for changing the preventive measure.12.  on the same day the lviv regional court of appeal (the court of appeal) extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention to six months.15.  on 14 may 2009 the investigation was completed and the case was referred for trial, this time to the court of appeal as a first-instance court.16.  on 27 may 2009 the court of appeal held a preliminary hearing, at which it decided, among other things, to remit the case for further investigation once again and to maintain the applicant’s detention.17.  on 4 august 2009 the supreme court quashed the above decision in so far as it concerned the remittal issue and rejected the applicant’s request for release on the ground that he was accused of serious crimes.

10. according to the report drawn up on the applicant’s arrival in gherla prison on 31 may 2012 the applicant was allowed to take with him to his cell, among other items, one glucometer with forty-one test strips and needles as well as several drugs.14. according to the government’s submissions and copies of the applicant’s medical chart, throughout his detention in baia mare prison the applicant was given, as needed and according to doctors’ prescriptions, insulin and drugs for his hypertension as well as neurotrophic, gastric protective, hypercholesterol and other drugs.on 5 september 2013 the applicant’s lawyer was informed by the baia mare prison administration that the applicant could not be compensated for the work he had performed in detention with permission to leave the prison.17.  from the government’s submissions it appears that the applicant was transferred sixteen times between detention facilities, to the hospital or to the courts, in special vehicles (iveco, mercedes or raba vans) which were well-maintained and met the legal comfort requirements.as regards the food received during transport, the applicant was provided with a diabetic menu as follows: during transport to and from gherla prison the applicant received 100 grams of biscuits, 100 grams of cheese, one egg and 500 grams of bread; during transport to and from baia mare prison the applicant received 320 grams of unsalted cheese, two eggs, 300 grams of processed poultry meat, 260 grams of semi-white bread and 250 grams of apples.
10.  in april 2013 the applicant’s husband obtained a copy of a decision pronouncing her presence in russia to be undesirable (“the exclusion order”), which the consumer protection authority (cpa) had issued on 9 june 2012. the text of the order indicated that the applicant’s presence in russia had been declared undesirable by the krasnodar regional division of the cpa on 9 june 2012, in accordance with section 25.10 of the entry and exit procedures act.to declare that the closely related provisions of section 25.10 of the entry and exit procedures act, section 11(2) of the hiv prevention act, and section 7(1)(13) of the foreign nationals act are incompatible with the russian constitution ... in so far as they allow [the executive authorities] to declare undesirable the presence of a foreign national or a stateless person whose family permanently resides in russia, to issue a deportation order or an entry ban, to refuse him a residence permit or to cancel a previously issued residence permit solely because that person is hiv-positive, provided that the person has complied with the legal requirements on hiv-positive individuals relating to the prevention of spreading the infection, and provided that no other circumstances would call for such restrictions.2.  the federal legislator should – in the light of the requirements of the russian constitution and the position of the constitutional court, as expressed in the present judgment – introduce the necessary amendments into the existing corpus of laws which would clarify the grounds and the procedure for making decisions relating to the right of hiv-positive foreign nationals or stateless persons to stay and live in the russian federation.” pending such amendments, the constitutional court directed that the executive and judicial authorities be guided by the position it had formulated in the judgment.18.  the applicant’s husband appealed and on 22 october 2015 the krasnodar regional court quashed the above judgment, finding that the district court had not heeded the position of the constitutional court and had incorrectly shifted the burden of proof onto the applicant: “the krasnodar office of the consumer protection authority did not produce any evidence of ms ustinova’s conviction under article 122 of the criminal code (infection by hiv) and/or under article 6.1 of the code of administrative offences (concealing the source of hiv infection).it follows that the first-instance court’s finding that ms ustinova’s presence constitutes a threat to other russian residents, including those with whom she has had social and casual contact, is erroneous and contradicts the constitutional court’s judgment since the mere fact of hiv infection is not a ground for applying such important restrictions on her private life.” 19.  the regional court pronounced the exclusion order unlawful and directed the krasnodar office of the consumer protection authority to redress the effects of the violation.
19.  in its response of 26 august 2009 the hajdú-bihar county police department refused the applicant ngo’s request, stating that “the names of the defence counsel are not public-interest data nor information subject to disclosure in the public interest under section 19(4) of the data act, since defence counsel are not members of a body performing state, municipal or public duties.referring to article 46 of the code of criminal procedure on mandatory defence and to article 48 of the same code on the investigative authorities’ duty to appoint defence counsel under certain conditions, the court observed that the duties of the investigative authorities also included giving effect to the constitutional right to defence.in the court’s view, the provisions of the code of criminal procedure relied on by the applicant ngo provided for equal recognition before the law and for the right to defence and imposed a duty on the state to ensure these rights.28.  the applicant ngo sought review of the second-instance judgment, maintaining that although the names of the defence counsel and the number of their respective appointments were personal data, this was nevertheless information subject to disclosure in the public interest as being related to the public duties carried out by ex officio defence counsel.in answering this question [of interpretation of the notion of ‘persons performing public duties’], the applicant’s argument concerning article 137(2) of the criminal code is irrelevant, since that provision only prescribes that defence counsel were to be regarded as persons performing public duties for the purposes of the criminal code itself, but not for the purposes of the data act or for any other legal relationship.

6.  the applicants complained of the excessive length of different civil and criminal proceedings under article 6 § 1 of the convention.7.  all applicants obtained decisions of the constitutional court of serbia, which found a violation of their right to a hearing within reasonable time (see appended table for details of each civil proceedings and constitutional court’s decisions).the court, additionally, declared that the applicants were entitled to the non-pecuniary damages sought, in accordance with article 90 of the constitutional court act (see paragraph 14, article 90, below).9.  on 14 october 2010 the commission for compensation offered to pay ms prohaska prodanić rsd 60,000 (at the time approximately eur 600) for non-pecuniary damage incurred and rsd 25,000 for costs and expenses.10.  the applicant v. tomić contacted the commission for compensation on several occasions and requested the payment of non-pecuniary damage.
19.  subsequently, the migration office of the canton of aargau declared that it would grant a permanent residence permit to the second applicant for purposes of family reunification and, on 28 january 2008, transferred the file to the federal office of migration to seek the required consent.on 4 march 2008 the latter refused to give its consent, finding that the requirements for family reunification were not met and that the decision of the court of the canton of aargau was in contradiction to the case-law of the federal supreme court.it found, second, that the applicants could not rely on article 8 of the convention, as the second applicant had reached the age of adulthood and was not dependant on the first applicant (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 33 below).it noted that the first applicant had not applied for family reunification immediately after his arrival in switzerland, that the second applicant was cared for by his mother and his grandmother in egypt until he turned 18 years, that the second applicant had lived almost all of his life in egypt and had more important social and personal ties to his country of origin, which would be negatively affected if he moved to switzerland, and that he had returned to egypt after having stayed with his father in switzerland for one and a half years.while noting that the first applicant had a close relationship to his daughter in switzerland and that he could, thus, not be expected to relocate to egypt to live there with the second applicant, the court noted that the applicants had not submitted sufficient reasons to justify the second applicant’s reunion with his father in switzerland.
7.  according to the applicant, on 4 april 2007 at approximately 7 p.m. he was arrested on suspicion of having participated in abduction of m. and p. according to the arrest record, the applicant was arrested on 5 april 2007 at 10:40 a.m. 8.  on 6 april 2007 the achkhoy-martan district court of the chechen republic authorised the applicant’s detention pending the criminal proceedings against him.the court relied on the statements of m. and p. given during the questioning by the investigator, the written statements made by their parents to whom m. and p. had told about their abduction, the written statements made by other soldiers who confirmed that m. and p. had been missing in 2001. investigator mir.testified in court as regards his questioning of m. and p. the court also heard a number of the applicant’s relatives and neighbours who testified as to the applicant’s character and the curfew introduced in the village in 2001 and studied the materials from the case-file prepared by the investigator.as regards the use of m. and p.’s written statements, the court noted as follows: “... according to [the rules of criminal procedure], if the victim of the crime fails to appear in court, the court, if requested by a party to the proceedings or of its own motion, may decide to have the [victim’s] earlier statement read out in the event of a natural calamity or other extraordinary circumstances preventing the [victim’s] appearance in court.the court considers that the victims were prevented from appearing in court for the following reasons: their psychological state, i.e, their lack of desire to reminisce about the circumstances of the abduction coupled with deprivation of liberty and, possibly, with the life threat, and to live through this again; lack of safety during the trip to chechen republic where the political situation is still troublesome, especially ... for ethnic russians who are not locals; a risk that the [applicant’s] relatives might put pressure on them; and the fact that they live far away and do not have means to pay for the trip to attend the court hearing.
5.  on 6 april 2012 the leninskiy district court in nizhniy tagil issued a detention order in respect of the applicant who had been charged with murder and had absconded.7.  on 30 april 2013 the leninskiy district prosecutor asked the district court to extend the applicant’s detention for a further two months.on 26 september 2013 a judge of the regional court refused the applicant leave to appeal to the regional cassation instance.10.  on 4 march 2014 a judge of the supreme court of the russian federation refused the applicant leave to appeal to the supreme court.the judge noted, in particular, that the belated filing of an application for an extension of the authorised period of detention was not a ground for varying the custodial measure.
he claimed compensation for damage caused as a consequence of the offence (damaged chair which had been hit by the bullet, damaged or lost belongings (mostly various items used to wrap parts of the victim’s cut up body), damaged flooring after the police had cut out a piece of parquet with a bullet mark to serve as evidence, a lock cylinder removed for evidence, cleaning bills, unpaid utility bills) in the amount of 28,259 kroons (eek) (corresponding to approximately 1,806 euros (eur)).he asked the court to dismiss the applicant’s request for the summoning of witnesses, as these individuals would be unable to give testimony about the items in the apartment or their value, and their statements could not refute the findings of a final court decision.in such circumstances, the court of appeal could only accept an appeal for examination if the county court in its judgment had granted leave to appeal or a provision of substantive or procedural law had clearly been incorrectly applied or it was clear that the evidence had been wrongly assessed and this could have significantly influenced the court’s ruling.pursuant to article 405 § 1 of the ccp, in such proceedings the court had to guarantee that the fundamental rights and freedoms and the essential procedural rights of the parties were observed and that the parties were heard (kohus kuulab menetlusosalise ära) if they so requested.the court of appeal further noted that the applicant had not objected under article 333 §§ 1 and 2 of the ccp to the county court’s decision of 8 july 2010 whereby the court had ordered that the case be examined in simplified proceedings and requested the applicant to make his submissions in writing.
the decision, based on section 98 (1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973 (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство – “the tupa”), stated that the applicant’s father was to be compensated with a two-room flat and the applicant was to be compensated with another, three-room, flat.11.  by a decision of the mayor of 10 july 1996 the applicant was allocated another flat, with a surface which was about 28 square metres bigger than the surface of the flat originally offered in compensation to him.13.  on 10 june 2004 the applicant requested that the mayor of sofia offer as compensation one of the several flats in the vicinity of the expropriated property managed by the ministry of foreign affairs, successor to the bsdc.in a final judgment of 9 april 2008 the supreme administrative court quashed the tacit refusal and remitted the case back to the mayor for examination of the request.it held that it was the duty of the mayor, and not of the ministry of foreign affairs, to provide a flat to the heirs of the applicant’s father.
the experts, who conducted the examination on the basis of s.j.’s medical records from 15 to 20 november 2006 and the results of the post-mortem and histological forensic examinations, concluded that the cause of the death was “general poisoning” (ümumi intoksikasiya) which had resulted from endogenic toxic substances developed in the body owing to multiple traumas and toxic substances introduced into the digestive organs.39.  on 25 january 2010 the applicant again requested that the prosecuting authorities reclassify the case as murder under article 120 of the criminal code, taking into consideration the fact that the death had resulted from an unidentified poison and that various injuries on s.j.’s body had been sustained before her fall from the balcony.it appears from the nasimi district court’s decision of 6 march 2012 that in the proceedings before the court the investigator stated that on 27 january 2009 a request for a chemical forensic examination in the united kingdom to determine the type of poisoning had been sent to the ministry of justice, but that no reply had been received.the investigator further stated that the investigation of the case had become very difficult as a long time had gone by since the commission of the crime and some items of evidence related to the case had been lost when it had been transferred from the binagadi district prosecutor’s office to the prosecutor general’s office.59.  on 27 february 2013 the nasimi district court granted the applicant’s appeal and overruled the investigator’s decision of 30 november 2012. in that connection, the court held that the investigator should not have terminated the criminal proceedings by relying solely on the fact that it had been impossible to identify the perpetrator of the crime and had to take all the relevant steps to identify that person.
13.  on 4 and 11 february 2002 the first applicant signed two documents explaining in detail his rights as a suspect or accused in the course of the pre-trial investigation, including the right to have a lawyer appointed for him, to consult a lawyer before being questioned for the first time and the right to remain silent.he denied any knowledge of or involvement in either crime but admitted that he knew a.b., had had a conflict with one of the victims, and that on the night of the luhansk murder the second applicant had lent his lorry to the victims.he replied that he wished to confirm the statements he had given in the course of the pre-trial investigation, and that the only point he might be confused about was the make of the foreign car he had seen on the night of the murder, since he was not a specialist.in rejecting that allegation, the court stated in particular that: (i) the second applicant’s statements had been made in the presence of a lawyer hired by his wife; (ii) the defendants had changed their statements over the course of the investigation to minimise their own role in the crimes and their culpability, which was inconsistent with their allegation that their statements had been forced on them by the authorities; (iii) a video recording of the second applicant’s interview and of a reconstruction of the crime with him and mr zakshevskiy had shown that his statements had been given freely; (iv) two investigations of the defendants’ allegations of undue pressure and ill-treatment conducted by the prosecutor’s office at the trial court’s request had found no proof in support of the allegations, which was consistent with the court’s own conclusions.41.  in response to the applicants’ allegations of various procedural irregularities, in particular alleged violations of their right to defence, in the course of the pre-trial investigation, the trial court stated that all evidence obtained in violation of the code of criminal procedure had been excluded from the file and the remaining evidence had been obtained in compliance with the code.
thereafter they had all entered the room where parcels for prisoners were dropped off and there he had seen the applicant putting the syringe inside the cake and spreading the cream so that it could not be seen.having heard the opinions of the parties, the court decides to proceed with the trial and read out the pre-trial statements of absent witnesses m.s., d.t.[the applicant] pleaded not guilty and reiterated his statements made during the investigation ... that ... when they brought the cake, he had already signed [the papers] ... then they brought the cake and gave it to [g.b.].during the inspection of the cake a medical disposable syringe ... was discovered inside the cake... witness a.a. stated before the court that he worked in the ... penitentiary facility... he was invited to the parcel drop-off room where he saw a disposable syringe that had been discovered inside a cake ... ... the pre-trial statement of witness m.s.and had been warned about the responsibility for sending items prohibited by law ... ... the record of discovery of a prohibited item ... ... the record of seizure of the discovered prohibited item ... ... the opinion of the forensic expert ... thus, the court finds it established that [the applicant] committed the offence charged and that his guilt in committing it has been substantiated.
the decision, based on section 98 (1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973 (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство – “the tupa”), stated that the applicant and his brother were to be compensated with flats in a building which the municipality intended to construct.the applicant’s brother informed the mayor that he renounced his right to compensation with a garage in the applicant’s favour.9.  by a supplementary decision of 30 may 1995, based on section 100 of the tupa, the mayor held that the applicant was to be compensated with the right to build a garage on a municipal land and determined the exact location of the future garage.10.  by a decision of 9 october 2002 the mayor modified the previous decision of 30 may 1995, indicating another municipal plot of land where the future garage was to be built, as it had turned out that the previous one was not owned by the municipality.the action was dismissed, the final judgment being given by the supreme administrative court on 30 march 2011. the domestic courts held that no unlawful inactivity on the part of the authorities had been established, neither had it been shown that the applicant had sustained any damage.
6.  in connection with an investigation into an international prostitution ring, measures were taken to intercept telephone conversations in accordance with article 706-95 of the code of criminal procedure, on one mobile telephone line in particular: from 5 p.m. on 6 august 2009 until 8.39 p.m. on 19 august 2009, on the basis of an order of 5 august 2009 by the chambéry judge responsible for matters concerning civil liberties and detention (“the liberties and detention judge”), authorising interceptions for two weeks; and from 28 august 2009 until 11 september 2009, on the basis of an order of 26 august 2009 by the same judge.2012-228/229 qpc) the constitutional council declared the seventh paragraphs of articles 64-1 and 116-1 of the code of criminal procedure unconstitutional, holding that by providing for an exception to the rule of compulsory video recording of interviews in connection with serious offences where such interviews were carried out during preliminary or judicial investigations into serious offences relating to organised crime or undermining the fundamental interests of the nation, the impugned provisions infringed the principle of equality.... it rejected his argument that there had been violations of the convention (he had relied on articles 6 and 14 of the convention and, more broadly, the right to a fair trial and the prohibition of discrimination) and the constitution as a result of the application of the seventh paragraphs of articles 64-1 and 116-1 of the code of criminal procedure in his case.secondly, it observed that the applicant had not been questioned in police custody and that, although his interviews by the investigating judge had not been recorded on video, “this did not result in any infringement of his rights under the convention, be it his defence rights or the right to a fair trial, seeing that he was given the option of receiving legal assistance, and had the opportunity to review the manner in which the questions and answers had been transcribed in the record, which had been approved by a registrar, to ask for any corrections to be made and to challenge, at any stage of the proceedings, the meaning and scope of his statements as transcribed”.... lastly, it held that “it is not possible for anyone other than the party concerned to complain of a breach of the substantive requirements governing police custody, or of the lack of a video recording of police questioning or interviews by the investigating judge, in support of an application to have a procedural step or document declared void”; accordingly, the applicant was not entitled to object that the judgment appealed against had stated that there was no cause to declare void any police questioning or interviews by the investigating judge concerning individuals other than himself.
8.  later that evening the applicant was taken to the police station, where he was questioned in relation to the incident.9.  at 2.00 a.m. on 25 april 2006 the applicant confessed that he had had a fight with sh., and that during the fight he had grabbed a knife and stabbed sh.later on the same day, in the course of a reconstruction of the events, the applicant showed how he had been beaten by sh.15.  on 2 august 2006 the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal (“the court of appeal”) commenced the trial of the applicant.however, having regard to his behaviour immediately after the incident, namely the efforts he had made to provide the victim with medical assistance, it reduced the sentence to fifteen years’ imprisonment.
the decision, based on section 98 (1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973 (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство – “the tupa”), provided that the applicant was to be compensated with a three-room flat in a building which the municipality intended to construct.7.  by a supplementary order of 27 march 1990, based on section 100 of the tupa, the mayor determined the exact location, size and other details in respect of the future flat to be offered to the applicant.on the basis of that distribution, on 13 january 2004 the mayor issued a new decision under section 100 of the tupa in respect of the applicant, revoking the previous decision of 27 march 1990 (see paragraph 7 above) and indicating the exact flat in the new building to be provided to her in compensation.12.  in the meantime, in 2005 the applicant made a request to the mayor, seeking the revocation of the 1983 expropriation order in respect of her share of the property.14.  the house was pulled down on an unspecified date, after which the municipality selected a company to carry out the construction works on the site, which started in april 2011. in the meantime, the applicant contested before the courts the 2001 building permit (see paragraph 10 above) concerning the building to be constructed, but was unsuccessful.

that detention order was upheld on appeal on 22 october 2007 by the moscow city court.9.  on 2 july 2008, in reply to the applicant’s complaint about the failure to examine his appeal, the city court informed him that his appeal against the detention order of 16 october 2007 was not received by the city court.however, by a letter of 22 august 2008 the city court forwarded the applicant’s appeal statement lodged on 17 october 2007 to the district court, requiring it to perform procedural steps necessary to initiate the appeal proceedings.the city court also informed the applicant that his appeal complaint of 17 october 2007 was mistakenly attached to another case-file.10.  no further information on organisation of the appeal hearing against the detention order of 16 october 2007 was provided.

on 13 december 2006 a judge of the supreme court rejected his complaint, finding as follows: “the fact that [the presidium of the city court] unjustifiably (необоснованно) omitted to rule on the preventive measure is not a ground for setting aside its decision because it appears from the ... city court’s decision of 26 july 2006 and the ... district court’s decision of 31 august 2006 that the matter of detention was addressed in subsequent judicial decision which maintained the custodial measure in respect of [the second applicant].” 7.  on 26 july 2006 the city court held a new appeal hearing and quashed the initial conviction for formal defects, ordering a re-trial.9.  on 31 august 2006 the district court returned the case file to prosecutor and extended the applicants’ detention, referring to the gravity of the charges but without setting a time-limit.10.  on 16 january 2007 the district court extended the applicants’ detention until 28 february 2007, relying on the gravity of the charges and unspecified circumstances that indicated a risk of perverting the course of justice.11.  on the same date the district court granted a further extension of the applicants’ detention until 30 april 2007, relying on the gravity of the charges.12.  further extensions were approved by the district court on 27 and 28 april (upheld on appeal on 25 june), 8 and 16 may (upheld on appeal on 23 july), and 13 june 2007 (upheld on appeal on 1 august).
16.  on 28 february 2012 the constitutional court (ústavní soud) dismissed the appeal, holding that it would be contrary to the principle of subsidiarity for it to decide on the merits of the case, because the applicant had not exhausted all the available remedies, which included an action for protection of personal rights under the civil code and an application for judicial review under article 82 of the code of judicial administrative procedure.26.  on 18 january 2013 the governmental council for equal opportunities for women and men (rada vlády pro rovné příležitosti žen a mužů), an advisory body to the government, recommended the prevention of further discrimination against women in the enjoyment of their right to a free choice of the method and circumstances of giving birth and the place of delivery.the council also referred to the recommendations of the committee on the elimination of discrimination against women, which monitors implementation of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, to support its position that women should have a choice of where to give birth.the new procedure allows for the discharge of the newborn from the maternity hospital less than seventy-two hours after the birth at the request of the newborn’s legal representative, provided that the latter: “(a) has submitted a written withdrawal of his or her agreement to the provision of medical services to the newborn, or a written statement declaring his or her disagreement with the provision of the medical services, or, alternatively, such agreement or disagreement has been entered in the newborn’s medical documentation ...; (b) has been demonstrably and duly informed about the possible consequences following the discharge of the newborn before seventy-two hours have elapsed since the birth ...; (c) has been duly informed that – in the interests of the subsequent healthy development of the newborn – the czech specialist medical associations recommend: 2. that a blood sample be taken within forty-eight to seventy-two hours following the birth for the purposes of screening for hereditary metabolic malfunctions ...” 28.  according to estimated data provided by the world health organisation for 2004, the czech republic was among the countries with the lowest perinatal mortality rate, which is defined as the number of stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life.29.  according to the european perinatal health report on the health and care of pregnant women and babies in europe in 2010, issued in 2013 within the framework of the activities of the euro-peristat project, the czech republic was among the countries with the lowest mortality rate for newborns in the first twenty-seven days of their life.

the court found no evidence in the case file that the applicant had been informed of the court hearing and the final decision of 26 september 1997. he had been arrested more than five years later.20.  as confirmed by a postal acknowledgement of receipt, on 17 october 2007 the supreme court received a registered letter from the applicant’s representative, which had been dispatched on 12 october 2007 and which concerned the case under the number indicated in the ruling of 6 september 2007. according to the applicant, his representative had sent the requested authority form by the above-mentioned registered letter.according to the government, the content of that letter and the documents enclosed, if any, could not be established in the absence of their detailed description on the acknowledgment of receipt.it held that, contrary to its instructions of 6 september 2007, he had failed to submit the power of attorney “within the set time-limit and before the delivery of the present ruling”.23.  on 3 december 2007 g. requested that the supreme court give reasons for the dismissal of the applicant’s appeal on points of law, since the ruling of 6 september 2007 had been complied with.

6.  at the material time, the applicants occupied different posts within the ministry of foreign affairs, namely head of press and information department, head of nato division of arms control and international security department, counsel of the european department and head of usa and canada division of the american department respectively.8.  on 23 february 2008 several ambassadors for armenia in foreign countries made the following statement: “we, the undersigned, remaining faithful to our calling as armenian diplomats and led by our feeling of responsibility before the republic of armenia and the armenian people, with concern for the situation which has arisen in armenia, with profound respect for the right of armenian citizens to free elections, with the conviction that only a president elected as a result of free and fair elections can best tackle the challenges facing our country on the international level and substantially raise the international image of armenia, express our support to our compatriots who have risen to struggle for freedom, protection of the right to a fair election and establishment of true democracy in armenia.considering the preservation of stability in the country important and public accord necessary, we appeal to our compatriots and especially the representatives of all the structures in the country responsible for maintaining public order and peace to avoid the temptation of resolving problems by use of force.10.  on 24 february 2008 the applicants made the following statement: “by joining the statement issued by our colleagues from the ministry of foreign affairs we express our concern with the situation created in armenia, fraught with internal and external undesirable challenges, and outrage against the fraud of the election process, which shadow the will of our country and society to conduct a civilised, fair and free presidential election.only by acting in conformity with the letter and spirit of the law can we create democracy and tolerance in armenia and earn the country a good reputation abroad.” 11.  the names of the applicants, with the indication of their office, appeared under the statement.
on an unspecified date the city registration committee registered the transaction and issued the relevant deed, confirming the applicant’s title to the flat.14.  on 5 march 2002 the prosecutor brought a civil claim on behalf of the department for housing of the city of moscow (the “housing department”) seeking (1) the annulment of r.’s will and of the applicant’s title to the flat; (2) the applicant’s eviction; (3) restitution of the flat to the city of moscow; and (4) annulment of the purchase agreement between yar.16.  on 16 june 2004 the moscow city court held that the district court had failed to duly inform the applicant of the date and time of the hearing.the court dismissed the remainder of the prosecutor’s claims concerning the annulment of the sale contract concluded by yar.had acquired r.’s flat fraudulently, he had, in fact, stolen it from the city of moscow and the latter had the right to reclaim the flat from the applicant, despite the fact that she was a bona fide purchaser.
according to that document, the three parties had agreed that the value of the twenty slabs received by the applicant was uah 2,000 and that the transfer of the slabs to the applicant covered the relevant portion of k.’s debt to d. and d.’s debt to the applicant’s farm.the delay in finalising the papers had been due to various objective circumstances, including initial disagreements between the parties concerning the scope of the transaction and a fair price for the slabs, the replacement of d.’s director in november 2000, and a lengthy break in the functioning of d.’s accounts office.that ... the three-party agreement had been concluded ... before the initiation of the criminal case, and that the managers of the three entities had agreed on the price and procedure for the transfer of the concrete slabs, the court cannot accept them, as they contradict the case file materials and the evidence examined in court.on 6 june 2001 the [police investigator] ... questioned [the applicant] as a witness, despite ... sufficient evidence ... for him to be questioned as a defendant, in compliance with all the requirements of the code of criminal procedure of ukraine ... with regard to the said breaches, the testimony [of the applicant] given ... during his questioning as a witness on 6 june 2001 was not taken into account by the court as evidence in the present case ....” 20.  it appears from the case-file materials that on an unspecified date the applicant filed an appeal against his conviction, which was accepted for examination.without addressing directly the applicant’s complaint concerning the breach of his right to defence, it made the following general remark concerning the procedural fairness of the proceedings: “... no breaches of the provisions of the criminal-procedure law in the course of pre-trial investigation as well as during the court proceedings can be identified”.

having examined the photographic collage and the text of the article ... the use of the name ‘prostitute-werewolf vasilinka’, the explanations of the claimant’s lawyer, who has insisted that the character’s name in the article and the surname of the prosecutor of the primorskiy region have the same root, and that the article states that the character is a lawyer by profession and has extensive working experience as a prosecutor, the court concludes that [the applicants] undertook deliberate actions which were insulting to [mr v.], and which were committed publicly as [the insult was disseminated] in a newspaper, that is to say in the media.in the district court’s opinion, “the text of the article and the photographic collage [were] of an insulting nature, ascribe[d] negative characteristics, expressed in an indecent manner, to mr v.’s personality and damage[d] the honour and dignity of mr v., the prosecutor of the primorskiy region, as a private individual and as an official”.in reaching that conclusion, the district court “[took] into account the fact that the prosecutor of the primorskiy region, mr v., [was] a public figure and his photograph [had] been published in the media on many occasions ...” 18.  with reference to its findings, the appellate court concluded that the applicants “[had taken] deliberate actions which [had been] of an insulting nature in respect of mr v. and were performed in public, as [the impugned information] was disseminated in the media”.it had therefore been clear that information “of an insulting nature” had related to mr v. the district court observed that, “by virtue of his office, mr v. [was] a public figure and readers [could] therefore easily understand that the photographic collage [showed] mr v.; so that readers [were] not mistaken, the name of the character in the article, ‘vasilinka’, [had] the same root as mr v.’s surname, and the character [was] a lawyer by profession and has extensive working experience as a prosecutor”....in the court’s opinion, the offence took place in the form of public speech in the media, [the applicants] acted deliberately, the related words ‘prostitute’ and ‘werewolf’ indicate an intention to humiliate, dishonour and disgrace the subject of the article and photographic collage and, in a figurative sense, portray condemnable and distinctly negative characteristics, which are seen by the public as well as the person to whom they are addressed as insulting.
8.  two days later the krasnyy sulin town court of the rostov region authorised the applicant’s detention, having noted the gravity of the charges against him and the possibility of his absconding and reoffending in the light of the fact that he had not been living at his registered address in krasnyy sulin at the time of his arrest.10.  on several occasions the town court extended the detention of the two defendants, each time using similar wording, citing the gravity of the charges and the lack of any change in the circumstances and risks which had initially warranted their detention.13.  two days later the head of the prison hospital informed the town court that the applicant’s medical condition warranted further treatment in the hospital.17.  the town court continued regularly extending the applicant’s detention, citing the gravity of the charges and the risks of his absconding or reoffending.26.  on 14 july 2009 the regional court upheld the most recent detention order, stating as follows: “the [case-file] materials ... show that the preventive measure was imposed [on the applicant] in conformity with the requirements of law.
6.  on 12 april 2007 the presidium of the regional court, upon hearing the prosecutor, counsel for the applicant and for the injured party, quashed the conviction for formal defects and ordered a re-trial.it annulled the detention order on the ground that the district court had failed to set a time-limit for the applicant’s detention, in breach of the requirements of the code of criminal procedure.9.  on 7 september 2007 the district court extended the applicant’s pre‑trial detention for a period of six months starting from 28 april 2007 and lasting until 28 october 2007, referring to the gravity of the charges and the applicant’s new line of defence which, in the district court’s view, was an indication that he might abscond.noting that the trial was approaching the final stage, that the witnesses had been heard, and that the applicant had family and dependent children, the court held that the applicant could be released on bail.on 20 february 2008 the district court reconsidered the matter and held that the applicant should be re-detained for a further three months on account of the gravity of the charges against him.
5.  on 25 february 2009 an investigator charged the applicant with kidnapping in absentia and put his name of the international list of fugitives from justice.on the same day the investigator asked the vasileostrovskiy district court in st petersburg to detain the applicant on remand.6.  on 2 march 2009 the district court granted the investigator’s application for a detention order, referring to the gravity of the charges against the applicant.9.  on 1 september 2009 the st petersburg city court heard the appeal and set aside the detention order, finding that the failure to follow the legal procedure for putting the applicant’s name on the list of fugitives from justice amounted to a “fundamental breach” of the rules of criminal procedure.it held, firstly, that the gravity of the charges was not a sufficient reason for detaining the applicant and, secondly, that the procedure for putting his name on the list of fugitives from justice had not been followed.
5.  on 11 january 1999 the parish of the russian orthodox church of the dormition of the theotokos (the “parish”) brought a civil claim against the applicant and her family claiming title to the land plot de facto used by the latter.7.  on 23 november 1999 the butyrskiy district court of moscow granted the parish’s claim and dismissed the counterclaim lodged by the applicant.10.  on 24 august 2000 the presidium of the moscow city court quashed the judgments of 23 november 1999 and 18 february 2000 by way of supervisory review and remitted the matter for fresh consideration.15.  on 25 december 2005 the parish asked for the supervisory review of the judgments in the applicant’s favour.16.  on 13 july 2006 the presidium of the city court quashed the judgments of 4 may and 11 august 2005 by way of supervisory review and remitted the matter for fresh consideration.
9.  the applicant lodged a complaint under article 127 of the constitution with the constitutional court contesting the length of the proceedings in so far as those had been held before the district court.ús 423/2012) rejected her complaint on the ground that, prior to lodging her constitutional complaint, the applicant had failed to exhaust ordinary remedies, in particular lodging a complaint with the president of the district court under the courts act (law no.the constitutional court noted that the court of appeal had transferred the case file to the district court on 4 june 2010 and that the applicant had lodged her constitutional complaint on 27 september 2012. it found that, within that period, the district court had failed actively to proceed with the matter for one year and a half.the constitutional court considered that, because the unjustified delays in the present case had been shorter (compared to those in respect of ištván and ištvánová and other similar cases), it was justified in requiring – before turning for protection to the constitutional court – that the applicant lodge a complaint with the president of the district court with a view to accelerating her proceedings.11.  following the constitutional court’s decision, the district court scheduled a hearing for 9 september 2015. at the time of communication of the application the proceedings were still pending.
in view of the progress in his treatment, and as he appeared more reasonable and able to abide by agreements, he had been transferred from the acute station to the subacute ward on 20 april 2010. however, he had then succumbed to so‑called “dynamic exhaustion” (dynamische entleerung), which manifested itself in a noticeable loss of drive and the desire for a quiet environment.15.  the city of vienna submitted that under the provisions of the hospitalisation act and in keeping with current practice in the treatment of mentally ill patients, “open” psychiatry was the norm and restriction of a patient’s freedom of movement was permissible only in cases of absolute necessity and within the bounds of proportionality.in the present case, by 12 may 2010 restriction of the physical movement of the applicant’s son (known as “fixation”), and/or the spatial restriction of his movement to the confines of a psychiatric bed, or his permanent supervision, were no longer medically indicated, nor would such measures have been reasonable or adequate.at the material time, the applicant’s son had been lawfully hospitalised by a decision of the fünfhaus district court of 7 april 2010, which remained valid until 21 may 2010. sections 3 and 33 of the hospitalisation act in force at the time provided that, in cases where hospitalisation had been ordered, it was also necessary to guard against threats potentially posed by the patient.m.k.’s hospitalisation had therefore not been unlawful, even though he had been placed in the open ward from 20 april 2010. contrary to the applicant’s line of argumentation, the otto wagner hospital had not had a duty to implement the fünfhaus district court’s decision on m.k.’s hospitalisation in a manner which compelled it to restrict his movement.
7.  having been a judge since 1 january 1978 and a member of the supreme court since 1 march 1994, on 15 november 2009 he was appointed vice-president for a six-year term by the president of the republic, after being proposed for the post by the president of the supreme court.it held that the premature termination of the applicant’s term of office as vice-president had not violated the fundamental law, since it had been sufficiently justified by the full-scale reorganisation of the judicial system and important changes made in respect of the tasks and competences of the president of the kúria.under the act lxvi of 1997 on the organisation and administration of the courts, the vice-president was already entitled to act in the stead of the president of the supreme court only with regard to managerial tasks at the supreme court, but not with regard to his or her functions as president of the national council of justice (see baka, cited above, § 56).the dissenting judges concluded that the premature termination of the applicant’s term of office had not been sufficiently justified by the reorganisation of the judicial system; and that it had weakened the guarantees in respect of the separation of powers, had been contrary to the prohibition on retroactive legislation, and had breached the principle of the rule of law and the right to a remedy.on the basis of that judgment, the budapest labour court found, in a first-instance judgment of 21 march 2013, that the termination of the applicant’s judicial service had been unlawful and reinstated him – without, however, ordering his reinstatement in his previous position as president of one of the civil law division benches of the kúria.
it was further extended at the investigative authorities’ requests on a number of occasions given the seriousness of the charges, negative references about the applicant’s character and the fact that the applicant did not have permanent residence or a job.10.  on the day of the incident a medical expert, b., performed an autopsy of the victim at the request of the investigator.20.  on 19 december 2008 the trial court rejected an application by the applicant for release, in which he complained that his detention had been excessively lengthy, that there was no reason to suspect that he had been involved in the crime, that he had a permanent place of residence and that he suffered from a serious medical condition.the court extended the applicant’s detention until 20 march 2009, referring to the seriousness of the charges, negative references about the applicant’s character and the “need to proceed with the trial.” 21.  on 29 december 2008 the defence appealed against the detention order.having heard the prosecutor, who insisted on the importance of the applicant’s continued detention, the regional court upheld the detention order, agreeing that the seriousness of the charges and stage of the proceedings warranted the extension.
6.  on 25 december 2008 the olekminskiy district court of the sakha (yakutia) republic remanded the applicant in custody.7.  on 21 february, 19 march, 18 may, 18 june, 15 august, and 12 september 2009 the court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention and held that despite the fact that he had permanent residence, job and family, he should remain in detention as the investigation was still pending, he could threaten witnesses or re-offend.8.  on 18 june 2009 the judge stated in his detention order as follows: “... the circumstances of the case have not changed.[the applicant] ... committed the crime under the influence of alcohol ..., he concealed that he had committed the crime ...” 9.  on 27 november 2009 the court replaced the pre-trial detention with a house arrest.10.  on 10 june 2010 the olekminskiy district court convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to 8 years’ imprisonment.
the detention orders were essentially based on the gravity of the charges, the primary grounds being the risk of the applicants’ absconding and interfering with the course of justice.7.  on 23 october 2006 the leninskiy district court of yekaterinburg convicted the applicant of fraud and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment.his appeals against these detention orders were examined on 24 july and 30 october 2009. the applicant and his lawyer were not present at the hearings on 24 july, 2 september and 30 october 2009.10.  on 6 november 2009 the vorkuta town court of the komi republic convicted him of drug dealing and sentenced him to fourteen years and nine months’ imprisonment and a fine.11.  having regard to the similarity of the main issues under the convention in the above cases, the court decides to join the applications and examine them in a single judgment.
39.  in response to the court’s request for a copy of the contents of the criminal cases opened in connection with the abductions, the government did not furnish any documents but provided an information statement concerning the investigation of joint criminal case no.the relevant decision stated, among other things: “... the preliminary investigation has established that between 21 may and 10 june 2002 in the vicinity of mesker-yurt in the shali district of the chechen republic, servicemen of the russian ministry of defence and the russian ministry of the interior together with servicemen from the department of the execution of sentences of the russian ministry of justice, conducted a special operation to check identity documents and identify members of illegal armed groups.for instance, from a copy of the decision of the kizilyurt town court of 5 april 2010 declaring mr magomedrasul magomedov dead, it transpires that on unspecified dates in march 2003, april 2005, may 2006, december 2009 and march 2010 the applicants requested assistance in searching for him and complained to the supervisory prosecutors of the lack of progress in the investigation.54.  it appears that following complaints lodged by the applicants, on 4 october 2011 the investigation of the joint criminal case was resumed and transferred again to the military authorities – the main military investigations department of the investigative committee of the russian federation.the relevant decision gave the following reason for the transfer: “... the investigation has established that the military servicemen who conducted the special operation in mesker-yurt between 21 may and 10 june 2002 were involved in the abductions.” the joint criminal case file was given a new number, 14/90/0091-11.
the return decision stated that he was a prohibited immigrant by virtue of article 5 of the immigration act (chapter 217 of the laws of malta) because he was in malta “without means of subsistence and liable to become a charge on public funds” and “without leave granted by the principal immigration officer”.19.  until the date of the lodging of the application, that is eight months after his arrival in malta, mr burhaan abdullahi elmi had not received a written decision informing him of the outcome of the age‑assessment procedure, and was still in detention.he considered that the conditions in warehouse 2 were very similar to those in warehouse 1, which had been documented in a number of reports, including two cpt reports of 2007 and 2011. the first applicant also stated that he had difficulty communicating with a doctor in the absence of an interpreter and that he suffered from dizziness and eye problems.he subsequently left malta before the termination of his asylum proceedings; indeed the last day of registration at the open centre was 2 august 2013. in the absence of any further contact with the office of the refugee commissioner, on 31 august 2013 the applicant’s asylum claim was implicitly “withdrawn as discontinued”.27.  in a signed declaration sent to the court by his legal representatives the first applicant admitted to being in schonbach, germany, as he was waiting there for the outcome of the judicial proceedings as to whether he would be sent back to malta in terms of the dublin ii regulation to have his asylum claim determined.
8.  in february 2005 the applicant lodged an action with the leninskiy district court, arguing that his detention from 2 to 26 april 2004 had been unlawful as there had been no legal order authorizing his detention during that period.9.  on 23 september 2005 the leninskiy district court, in the presence of a defendant’s representative, dismissed the applicant’s action, finding that the applicant’s conviction precluded him from claiming compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damages.its operative part reads as follows: “given that mr artemenko was found guilty of the crime in relation to which he had been detained since 17 june 2003, he did not acquire the right to exoneration and to compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage.therefore, there exist no grounds for satisfying mr artemenko’s claim for compensation in respect of his unlawful detention pending trial.” 10.  the applicant appealed, complaining, inter alia, that the district court had refused to secure his attendance and had not provided him with copies of materials presented by the defendants.11.  on 29 november 2005 the smolensk regional court upheld the judgment of 23 september 2005 in the applicant’s absence.
she also complained that she had not been able to participate in it in a meaningful way, as she had not been allowed to consult the case file and had been very poorly informed about the measures undertaken by the authorities with a view to identifying her sister’s murderer.that he had detected no irregularities in the manner in which the investigation had been conducted and that ‒ according to the applicable law ‒ aggrieved parties were not entitled to consult case files until completion of the pre-trial investigation, that is to say, until the likely perpetrator has been identified and committed for trial.that there had been many inadequacies in the investigation of her sister’s violent death and notified her that the chief and deputy chief of the investigative department had been reprimanded for poor planning of their department’s work and supervision of their subordinates.he also stated that, in his view, virtually no action aimed at identifying the murderer had been taken in 2008, that the operative officers had carried out the instructions received from the investigative officers in a perfunctory manner, and that the investigative and operative departments needed to streamline their methods of communication.25.  on 15 april 2013, following the entry into force of the new code of criminal procedure, the applicant was admitted into the proceedings as an aggrieved party and given an opportunity to consult the case file.
the prosecution relied on the following evidence: statements from s.s., k.m., s.m., a.m. and v.j., the record of the formal confrontation between the applicant and v.j., the results of forensic examinations, including a biochemical examination which had shown the presence of gunshot residue on the clothes worn by the applicant on the day of the murder, and the records of various investigative actions.in doing so, it stated, in particular, the following: “examination and evaluation of the evidence: on 1 july 2009 ... [the applicant] made a confession ... and, having surrendered a gun, stated that he had shot at [k.s.’s] car that night ... in the course of the investigation [the applicant] did not accept the charges against him stating that his deceased brother [v.m.]]; he had been in ... [v.j.’s] house ... at the trial [the applicant] pleaded not guilty ... the crime committed by [the applicant] is proven by the following evidence collected in the case: the statement of the victim’s legal heir, the witness s.s. ... ... the pre-trial statement of the witness k.m.maintained his statement during the confrontation with [the applicant] ... ... the record of the examination of the scene of the incident ... ... the record of the examination of the body ... ... the record of the examination of the ... car ... ... the record of the seizure of [the applicant’s] clothes ... ... the record of the photo line-up ... according to which k.m.had identified [the applicant] ... ... the record of ... the confession and surrender of the gun ... the conclusion of the forensic medical examination [concerning k.s.’s injuries] ...

claimed that he had not used force against the applicant and that, in any event, he had not been on the premises of the ndpo between 1 and 7 p.m. on 2 april 2011 when the applicant had been taken there.19.  on 20 and 22 april 2011 the investigator separately questioned two police officers, i.m., who had participated in the applicant’s arrest on 2 april 2011, and i.s., who was the neighbourhood police officer for the area where the applicant was arrested.the relevant part of the decision reads as follows: “as no appearance of a criminal act was disclosed in the material collected during the inquiry at the request of hajili mustafa mustafa oglu, who claimed that on 2 april 2011 he had sustained injury as a result of a beating by the deputy head of the ndpo, s.n., the institution of criminal proceedings should be refused.” 21.  on 5 january 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with the nasimi district court, arguing that the prosecutor’s decision was unsubstantiated.22.  it appears from the transcript of the court hearing of 16 january 2012 that in the proceedings before the nasimi district court the applicant’s lawyer asked the court to hear t.y.whereas the investigator had explained that those cameras were simply for surveillance purposes and did not record, the first-instance court had indicated in its decision that the impossibility was due to the absence of memory cards in the security cameras, which led to automatic deletion of the video recordings one month later.
... in the thickness of the muscles in the area of the left side of the abdomen, in the projection of the spleen, bruising measuring 10 x 9 cm was discovered... the blood sample taken from suren muradyan at the hospital was sent to the ministry of defence of armenia and the national security service of armenia for a bacteriological examination... the following reply, dated 21 august 2002, was received from military unit no.... of the above-mentioned bodily injuries the old and new bruises to soft tissues and muscles in the area of the left side of the abdomen [and] spleen rupture and bruising ... were inflicted by blunt objects or tools having a limited surface; judging by the nature of the old and new bruises to soft tissues and muscles in the area of the left side of the abdomen it can be said that the old bruises are more than about 8-10 days old, while the new bruising is about 1-2 days old.the abrasion on the right side of the forehead was inflicted while alive by a blunt object having a limited surface and is considered a minor bodily injury... 4.  as indicated above, the death occurred more than 8-10 days after the infliction of the main injuries (the above-mentioned old bruising in the area of the left side of the abdomen, in all probability accompanied by an initial sub-capsular rupture of the spleen and absorbent haemorrhage).34.  on 25 september 2002 investigator g. decided to assign a panel forensic medical examination in order to determine the scope of responsibility of the military unit and the hospital doctors for suren muradyan’s death, including the timeliness and accuracy of the diagnosis and the treatment provided, the timeliness of his transfer to hospital and whether they could have detected the injuries revealed by the post-mortem examination.alleged that during the argument of 21 july 2002 he, infuriated by [suren muradyan’s] behaviour, had grabbed his hand and shaken it briskly, during which his hand had touched [suren muradyan] in the area of the spleen.” the decision further referred to the expert opinion of 12 october 2004 and specifically its finding that suren muradyan had sustained bruises to muscles and a sub-capsular rupture of his spleen as a result of the blow sustained during the argument of 21 july 2002. the senior assistant to the general prosecutor concluded that the arguments raised by the applicant had been examined in the course of a thorough and objective investigation by the military prosecutor’s office and his challenge was therefore unfounded.
13.  on 9 april 2001 the president of the sevastopol court lodged with the presidium of the same court a request for supervisory review (protest) of the nakhimovskyy court’s judgment of 25 august 1998. on 27 april 2001 the presidium allowed the request, quashed the judgment and remitted the case for fresh consideration.15.  in the meantime, on 17 march 1999 the applicant lodged a new claim with the nakhimovskyy court, seeking compensation for the smz’s failure to pay her salary arrears during the period 26 august 1998 to 17 march 1999.on 6 june 1999 the sevastopol court quashed the decision of 19 may 1999 and adopted a new decision discontinuing the proceedings, relying on the same grounds as the first-instance court.it held that she had failed to lodge her claims within the three-month limitation period provided by article 233 of the labour code, which had started to run on 6 june 1997, the day the labour disputes commission had awarded her salary arrears.24.  on 20 may 2004 the sevastopol town court of appeal upheld the judgment of 28 january 2004. on 28 november 2006 a panel of three judges of the supreme court rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal in cassation.
the order, based on section 98 (1) of the territorial and urban planning act (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство – “the tupa”), provided that the applicant’s father was to be compensated with a two-room flat and a garage in a building which the municipality planned to construct.7.  in a supplementary decision of 19 february 1979, based on section 100 of the tupa, the mayor specified the exact location, size and other details in respect of the flat to be provided by way of compensation.in a final judgment of 21 june 1979 the sofia city court found in his favour and referred the case back to the administrative authorities with instructions to specify the exact garage to be provided as compensation.10.  in 2008 the applicant’s father brought an action for damages under the state and municipalities responsibility for damage act (закон за отговорността на държавата и общините за вреди) for unlawful failure on the part of the sofia municipality to fulfill its obligations to build and provide him with a garage.the action was dismissed in a final judgment of 21 june 2011 of the supreme administrative court, on the grounds that no unlawful failure to act on the part of the authorities had been established.
the second applicant was chairman of the jalilabad district branch of the pfpa and had also been a candidate of the pfpa-musavat political bloc in the parliamentary elections of 2010. the third and sixth applicants were bodyguards for a chairman of the pfpa, mr a.k.in addition, the fourth applicant was an organiser of a protest scheduled for 23 february 2014. according to him, he had created a facebook group calling for the resignation of the baku city mayor, who had allegedly insulted the azeri nation in a speech by saying that the only man in the country was the president.10.  according to the official records: (a)  the first applicant was arrested for disobeying a lawful order of a police officer to stop swearing loudly without addressing anyone in particular; (b)  the police approached (stopped) the second and sixth applicants because they had been noticed “behaving suspiciously”, the third applicant because he was suspected of committing a traffic accident, the fifth applicant because there was a complaint against him by a certain ms k.n., and the fourth applicant because there was “information” about him.14.  according to a record (protokol) issued by a police officer (who had arrested the fifth applicant and prepared an administrative offence report on him) and signed by that police officer and the fifth applicant, a state-funded lawyer was proposed to the applicant, but the applicant refused his assistance.27.  on various dates the applicants lodged appeals with the baku court of appeal, presenting their version of the facts surrounding their arrests, and arguing that they had been unlawfully arrested for their political activity, including their active participation in demonstrations (the first, second, third, fifth and sixth applicants) or the comments they had posted on social media (the fourth applicant).
7.  following a tacit dismissal of the claim by the administrative authorities, the applicant initiated compensation proceedings in respect of the injuries he had sustained during his military service before the supreme military administrative court on 1 november 2005. he sought 20,000 turkish liras (try) (approximately 12,400 euros (eur)[1]) in respect of pecuniary damage and the same sum in respect of non-pecuniary damage.9.  on 19 october 2007 the applicant asked the court to increase his initial claim via an amendment (ıslah), stating that he had only become aware of the true extent of his pecuniary damage when he had received the expert’s report.10.  on 28 november 2007 the supreme military administrative court ruled in favour of the applicant and awarded him the full amount of his initial claim in respect of pecuniary damage, namely try 20,000. it awarded him a further try 12,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.however, in the proceedings before the supreme military administrative court, the time-limits of one year [from the date when a claimant becomes aware of the impugned act] and sixty days from the date of referral of the administrative authorities apply.consequently, the applicant’s amendment claim must be rejected for being out of time ...” 11.  by a judgment of 16 april 2008 the supreme administrative court dismissed the applicant’s application for rectification of its previous decision.
126/1990 which gave the courts jurisdiction to rule on the merits of cases concerning properties that had belonged to the uniate parishes and were in the possession of the orthodox church (see paragraph 42 below), the court of appeal upheld the second applicant’s appeal and sent the case back to the county court.comparing the parties’ title deeds in respect of the property in question, it noted that the greek catholic party had been entered in the land register as owner of the property from 1940, and that in 1967 the orthodox church had entered its ownership right to the same property, transferred to it under decree no.126/1990 ... a distinction is made between two situations: (a) that in which the property is in the ownership of the state ... (b) that in which the places of worship and the parishes have been taken over by the romanian orthodox church and in respect of which [the question of] restitution will be decided by a joint committee made up of representatives of the clergy of the two denominations, a committee which will take account of the wishes of the worshippers in the communities in possession of these properties.in the light of those provisions, the court of appeal, examining an action for recovery of possession of a place of worship, correctly applied the criterion of the wishes of the (predominantly orthodox) worshippers of the community in possession of the property, while simultaneously emphasising the unlawfulness of the reasoning of the first-instance court, which had merely compared the title deeds and ignored the special law... however, it appears that there are 24,968 orthodox worshippers and 509 greek catholic worshippers in lupeni, that the worshippers who were obliged to transfer to the orthodox church in 1948 do not wish to return to the greek catholic church and that an attempt has been made to resolve [the dispute] through the joint clerical committee (according to the minutes of 20 april 2007 ... the orthodox party had indicated that the request for the return of the place of worship could not be granted, having regard to the wishes of the worshippers in the parish and the fact that since 1948 the place of worship has been administered by the orthodox believers)... the fact of supplementing article 3 [of legislative decree no.49/1995)... in the court of appeal’s view, the fact that the state unlawfully dispossessed the greek catholic church of its places of worship in 1948 cannot be remedied – in a state subject to the rule of law – by committing the opposite error, that is, by failing to take account of the wishes of the majority of worshippers at the point of adopting the given measure.
... the accused was not suffering at the time of the events, and is not currently suffering, from a mental disorder or a severe mental disturbance or defect making her incapable of controlling her actions.” 28.  in an order of 17 june 2008 the indictments division (chambre des mises en accusation) of the brussels court of appeal, upholding an order made by the investigating judge on 19 may 2008, committed the applicant to stand trial in the assize court for the following offence: “... in nivelles, on 28 february 2007, having knowingly, intentionally and with premeditation, killed the following persons: - [y.m.], born on 9 august 2003.” 29.  the indictment of 19 october 2008, drawn up by the principal public prosecutor, ran to fifty-one pages and gave an account of the precise sequence of events, the steps taken and evidence obtained during the investigation, and the forensic medical reports; a substantial part of it also focused on the applicant’s personal history and family life and the motives and reasons that had prompted her to carry out the killings, particularly in the light of the expert assessments of her psychological and mental state.30.  the applicant’s trial took place in the assize court of the province of walloon brabant from 8 to 19 december 2008. at the start of the trial the indictment was read out by the advocate-general representing the prosecution, and the nature of the offence forming the basis of the charge and any circumstances that might aggravate or mitigate the sentence were likewise indicated.... regard being had to the specific circumstances relating both to the accused’s character and to her living environment, the genuine difficulties experienced by her do not constitute mitigating factors, given the extremely serious nature of her acts.” 37.  as an ancillary penalty, the applicant was stripped of all titles, ranks and functions she held and was permanently deprived of certain rights in accordance with articles 19 and 31 of the criminal code as in force at the material time.in response to the applicant’s argument that no reasons had been given for the jury’s disagreement with the experts’ unanimous opinion that she had been suffering from a severe mental disturbance making her incapable of controlling her actions at the material time and at the time of the trial, the court of cassation held: “in noting the accused’s cold-blooded manner and her determination to carry out her crimes, the judgment indicates the reason why the assize court did not accept that the perpetrator had been suffering from any mental disturbance making her incapable of controlling her actions at the time of the events.
15.  in all, the evidence presented before the court consisted of the following: on behalf of the applicant: - the affidavit of the applicant, as well as his oral testimony (where he noted the good relationship that had existed between him and the plaintiff and categorically denied any involvement in the robbery, during which he had been at home sleeping, and claimed that the plaintiffs had instituted the case only in response to the proceedings his company had lodged against mr z., in which they had eventually been successful; following these proceedings mr z. had started telling neighbours who had been robbed that he (the applicant) had been responsible; he related that the morning following the incident he had been surprised to see the police on the road at the salibas’ shop, close to mr z.’s house and, after hearing what had happened, he had repeatedly tried to call mr z. to offer a helping hand.since he had not been able to get through, he had gone to the house where he had been greeted warmly at the entrance by mr z., who had recounted what had happened during the night including a reference to three persons who mr z. had claimed had been watching the roof intermittently for a period; some days later, while the applicant had been visiting a relative in hospital with his family, they had also visited ms z.; mr z. had been happy to see him (the applicant) and had told him not to worry about the money he had been owed as only a little had been stolen and it had not even been worth the beating they got; the applicant further noted that he had been surprised about ms z.’s written testimony, given the relationship of mutual respect they had had, and he wished to cross-examine her; he further recounted how he had been called out to mr z.’s house during the night only once, and that he had never fallen off a ladder, contrary to what had been alleged by mr z. he further referred to certain jobs completed in the house and to a number of named individuals who could have seen the safe; he stated that the only times he had avoided mr z. had been when the latter had failed to pay him; he noted that contrary to what mr z. had alleged, he had had no connection to arms or drugs (save for possessing a hunting rifle with the relevant police permits, which he had no longer used); he stated that he had not stopped work on one of mr z.’s properties of his own motion, but because mr z. had told him to do so; the applicant had also explained this to n.s.t (an architect); the applicant also contradicted various elements of mr z.’s affidavit; in particular he denied ever having been told about buckets of gold by mr z., and reference to such gold had only been made by mr z. during the proceedings lodged against him, and by the police one time when they had questioned him (the applicant)); - the affidavit of the applicant’s wife (she recounted that the applicant had only left the house twice during the night since 1989 – once to go to the z. family’s premises following an urgent call-out, and once to go to another client; she also recounted their visit to ms z. after the robbery and in what circumstances they had met prior to the robbery; she lastly explained how surprised and hurt she was about mr. z.’s actions in their regard).he stated that at the time of the robbery the saliba brothers had been working on project d. but works had been stalled; that the applicant’s sisters had gone to his office worried and in fear of the applicant, who they said was clever and armed; mr z. explained that a few weeks before the robbery the applicant had been working at the house, including on the roof, and at one point, while distracted, the applicant had fallen off a ladder; mr z. explained that on some occasions both the applicant and his brother had had access to the door of his roof and had known how to open it, and had also worked close to the safe.(to the effect that robbers had targeted the safe, which they had tried to remove entirely until they had found the key to it in her handbag; she stated that absolutely nobody had known about the safe before the robbery as nobody had entered that very private area of the house; she further stated that it had been only the applicant who – in the three years before the robbery – had continuously and at all times of day and night entered all parts of the house as he had been their trusted handyman, and that sometimes he had been accompanied by his brother and that they had both known about the safe.stated that he and other neighbours had been robbed while being clients of the applicant who ran a shop on the same road where they lived – this fact was known in the area); - evidence of police inspectors s.g. and j.c. (s.g. confirmed that at the time of the incident they had not known who the robbers had been: j.c. stated that the investigators had spoken about the applicant in june 1995 and that subsequently he had been questioned (amongst others – five people altogether) as a person with the knowhow to commit such a robbery, as well as a result of mr z.’s claim to the effect that he had mentioned the buckets of gold only to the applicant.
8.  as a result of a number of reorganisations of stroitel, the title to the building in question was transferred to the closed joint-stock company, stroitel-m. subsequently, separate rooms in the building were resold to third parties, including the applicants.10.  on 23 august 2002 the samara region commercial court found the samaraavtotrans privatisation plan and the agreement of 10 november 1993 – which the regional property fund and stroitel had entered into, and which partly concerned the transfer of the title to the building to stroitel – null and void.11.  on an unspecified date the promyshlenniy district prosecutor, acting in the interests of the municipality, brought an action against stroitel, stroitel-m and the owners of the rooms in the former dormitory building, including the applicants.referring to the invalidation of the privatisation of samaraavtotrans, the prosecutor submitted that the subsequent transactions relating to the building were also null and void, and asked the court to return the title to the building to the municipality.the court recognised that the owners of the rooms were bona fide purchasers, but ordered that the title to the building be transferred to the municipality.
15.  by a judgment of 10 june 2010 the city court in odense (retten i odense) found him guilty, in part jointly with others, of 18 counts of offences including drug trafficking and drug dealing contrary to article 191 of the criminal code with regard to a significant amount of hashish (more than 100 kg in total, in addition to an attempt to import a large supply from holland) and an attempt to buy 200 g of cocaine, all committed in the period from 2006 until 9 september 2009. in addition he was convicted of coercion by violence and threats, blackmail, theft, handling stolen property, escaping while under arrest and possession of weapons.16.  when sentencing the applicant to five years’ imprisonment the city court took into account, in particular, the significant amount of hashish and cocaine; that the latter was a “hard drug”; the huge profit that the applicant had obtained from the resale; the long period concerned; the applicant’s absolute leading role, notably in relation to the drug dealers under him, whom he had subjected to violence and threats; and that as a member of a gang, he had delivered hashish for resale to various towns in the region.19.  on appeal, by a judgment of 30 march 2011 the conviction was upheld in part by the high court of eastern denmark (østre landsret) and the sentence was increased to six years’ imprisonment due notably to the nature and quantity of the drugs, the extent of the drug offences committed and the applicant’s leading role.since the applicant’s arrest in september 2009, she and the children had spent one and a half months in syria in 2010, and two months in 2011. during the spring of 2011 she had gone alone to syria for seven or ten days because the sister had fallen ill. 23.  during the summer of 2009 the applicant began negotiations to buy an apartment in syria because his wife and children went there quite often.37.  the supreme court further noted that the applicant still had ties to lebanon, where his mother and sister lived and where the applicant had lived until he entered denmark at the age of 23. he also had ties to syria, where a sister and her family lived, and where the applicant had stayed for three weeks in 2007, for four weeks in 2008, and in 2009. before his arrest, the applicant had set about buying an apartment in syria for the family to use during stays there.
in the course of the psychological examination it had been established that one of the reasons for his psychologically traumatic situation had been his promotion to the position of chief of the tsaritsino branch of the moscow department of the interior.had been accepted to serve in the police and subsequently promoted to chief of the tsaritsino branch of the moscow department of the interior, even though the relevant medical data had been available at the institutions that provided medical care to the staff of the agencies of the interior.there had thus been a breach of section 19 of the police act, sections 130 and 131 of the order of the ministry of the interior of 14 july 2004 and section 9.7 of the order of the ministry of the interior of 14 december 1999.40.  having regard to the irregularities in the functioning of the ministry of the interior which had contributed to the offences committed by d.e., the court ruled that it would draw the attention of the minister of the interior to the said irregularities and invite him to take measures aimed at their rectification.the fact that at the relevant time he had held the position of chief of the tsaritsino branch of the moscow department of the interior and had had the rank of major did not constitute grounds for the state’s liability under article 1069 of the civil code, as it had been established that d.e.
documented bruises on the deceased’s head behind the left ear, at the corner of his right eye, on the right cheek and on the right side of the lower jaw.the investigator based his decision on the reports filed by doctor m. and the officers who had discovered mr antonov’s body, the report on the inspection of the cell where mr antonov had been found and on his body, and on his medical file.he again questioned doctor m. about the state of mr antonov’s health on 22 july 2007. the doctor explained that following the treatment he had been given mr antonov had been in a satisfactory condition and that it had been possible to leave him alone in a cell.26.  the investigating authorities subsequently refused to open a criminal investigation into mr antonov’s death on 25 october 2008 and 2 january 2009. on 8 december 2008 and 12 january 2009 respectively the supervising prosecutor quashed those decisions and ordered a further inquiry into the matter, noting each time that the inquiry had been incomplete and the findings contradictory.in particular, on 8 december 2008, the regional prosecutor noted that the reports of 23 july 2007 and 23 october 2008 concerning the inspection of the cell where mr antonov had been found had given different and mutually contradictory descriptions of the layout of the cell.
the applicant produced statements written by five inmates with whom he had been detained in the same penal institutions from 2007-2014. the statements corroborated his account of the lack of effective dental treatment.a medical certificate issued by the applicant’s dentist on 27 june 2014 confirmed the presence of dental prostheses for eight teeth and the absence of another ten.12.  the applicant brought the issue of inadequate medical treatment to the attention of various domestic authorities, including the head of the remand prison, the tomsk regional prosecutor’s office, and the federal service of execution of sentences (“the fsin”), but all to no avail.on 3 february 2011 the applicant raised his dental problems during a visit to the head of the medical unit but there was no entry in the medical file indicating that the applicant’s complaint had been investigated.between 3 june and 20 july 2011 he visited the dentist on seven occasions, during which he was diagnosed with gingivitis of the front teeth and dental caries, three permanent dental fillings were put in, the gingivitis was treated and the tartar build-up was removed.
upon an appeal by the split county state attorney’s office, on 5 december 2002 the supreme court quashed the judgment in respect of the applicant and dismissed the charges against the other accused on account of the statutory prescription period.in the presence of the applicant and his defence lawyer on 18 february 2004. however, since one of the lay judges changed during the proceedings, the trial had to start afresh.a request by the applicant for the trial panel to hear the witness in person was denied on the grounds that the witness was undergoing treatment for alcoholism in a psychiatric institution and that any absence from the institution would have a negative effect on his treatment.13.  on 27 march 2012 the supreme court upheld the judgment of 16 june 2011. the relevant part of the supreme court’s judgment reads: “the accused is not right in [alleging] that the first-instance court committed a serious breach of the rules of criminal procedure when it, without the [defence’s] consent, read out the statements of witnesses a.b.(page 967 of the case file), who was questioned several times in these criminal proceedings, because a letter from the rab psychiatric hospital shows that he was undergoing medical treatment, namely that ‘... the medical treatment is ongoing and possible absence would not contribute to the overall therapeutic procedure ...’ (page 965 of the case file).” 14.  a subsequent constitutional complaint by the applicant was dismissed by the constitutional court on 12 july 2012.
28.  on 23 october 2002 the prosecutor’s office ordered a forensic medical opinion to establish the origin of the applicant’s injuries, stating that at about 2 p.m. on 5 august 2002 the applicant had been hit in the right hip by v. with a spade handle, and that the applicant had alleged to have been punched multiple times by police officers on his way to the staropoltavskiy district police station, where he had allegedly been taken in the boot of a police car.the expert concluded that all the injuries could have been inflicted in the manner alleged by the applicant, given their nature, number and location, the mechanism of their formation, the means of their infliction, notably by punching and kicking, the positions of the victim and attackers in relation to each other, and the direction of the blows.the decision also included statements by the applicant saying that v. had hit him in the left hip with a spade handle and that he had punched him back in the face, that he had travelled to the police station in the boot of a police car after being thrown in by police officers, that during the journey the officers had stopped the car and beaten him up, punching him in the head and chest, after seeing that he had dented the boot lid, and that they had assaulted him again at the police station.8.  decision of 10 march 2005 terminating the criminal proceedings against police officers s. and sh., annulled on 9 september 2005 40.  according to a letter from the volgograd regional prosecutor’s office dated 3 november 2005, a new decision terminating the proceedings was issued on 10 march 2005 and annulled on 9 september 2005. according to a letter dated 17 may 2005, the volgograd regional prosecutor’s office had in the meantime requested the district prosecutor’s office to inform the applicant of the results of the investigation and report back before 4 june 2005.12.  decision of 30 april 2012 terminating the criminal proceedings against police officers s. and sh., annulled on an unspecified date 54.  on 30 april 2012 the investigative committee terminated the proceedings in accordance with article 24 § 1 (2) of the ccrp, because none of the elements of a crime were present in respect of the actions of police officers s. and sh.. the decision was based, inter alia, on the following new statements received during the additional investigation in 2012.
6.  on 3 september 2005 a demonstration was held in the gemlik district of the city of bursa by the association for the solidarity of prisoners’ and convicts’ relatives (tutuklu ve hükümlü yakınları yardımlaşma ve dayanışma derneği – “tuhay-der”) in order to protest about the conditions of detention in prisons, and in particular those of abdullah öcalan, the leader of the pkk (the workers’ party of kurdistan), an illegal armed organisation.the applicant was charged with disseminating propaganda in favour of a criminal organisation and its goals, proscribed by article 220 § 8 of the criminal code, on account of his speech on 5 september 2005. the public prosecutor submitted that the following passages in the speech constituted propaganda in favour of an illegal organisation: “... we want peace in this country.11. the cizre criminal court held nine hearings on the merits of the case and obtained a report by an expert on the video-recordings of the gathering of 5 september 2005, which stated that the applicant had made a speech to a crowd.14.  according to the report, dated 21 may 2007, on the examination of the police video-recordings of the gathering of 5 september 2005 submitted by the expert to the first-instance court, the applicant had made the following speech: “... friends, i would like to say a few words about how grateful we are to you.the first-instance court further noted that it was a well-known fact that during illegal demonstrations and meetings pkk members and supporters disseminated propaganda by way of waving photographs of the leader of the pkk and yellow, red and green pieces of cloth, symbolising the so-called flag of the pkk.

it argued that the proceedings before the first-instance court had not been adversarial, and had not complied with the principle of procedural equality between the parties: the first-instance court had not provided the applicant company with an opportunity to prepare and submit observations as to s.’s counterclaim or collect and provide evidence in defence.in the cover letter, the applicant company set out the circumstances which had resulted in its missing the deadline for appealing on points of law, and asked the hccu to extend the relevant time-limit and consider the appeal.apart from that information, the cover letter contained the date, name and address of the court to which it was addressed, the case reference number, the parties’ contact details, and the disputed amount which was the subject of the case.14.  on 19 december 2006 the hccu found that the applicant company had submitted the second appeal on points of law outside the time-limit provided for by article 110 of the code of commercial procedure, and had failed to enclose an application for an extension.15.  on 4 january 2007 the applicant company challenged the decision of 19 december 2006 before the supreme court, arguing that on 21 november 2006 it had in fact applied for an extension of the time-limit for lodging the appeal on points of law with the hccu.
the prosecutor based his decision on the information available from the applicant’s medical file and the written statements obtained from the prison staff, including the medical officer who had examined the applicant upon his arrival at the prison, and also from some of the prisoners who had been transferred to the prison on the same day as the applicant.(b)  submissions by the government 25.  according to the government, a part of the applicant’s submissions concerning the conditions of his detention, specifically his allegations that he had been detained in cells with poor sanitary and hygiene conditions together with inmates suffering from the open form of tuberculosis, that he had been escorted to a medical unit or a meeting place with a felt-lined bag over his head, and that while handcuffed he had been obliged to walk with his hands raised above his head, were untrue and not supported by any evidence.the prosecutor found that the medical assistance provided to the applicant by the administration of the prison had been adequate; the applicant was informed of this by a letter of 3 november 2005. the prosecutor’s finding was based on the information contained in the applicant’s medical file, according to which the applicant had received treatment for hypertension in october and december 2004, in january and february 2005, and between april and july 2005, which included the administration of inosine, nitroglycerinum and other medication.40.  the government challenged the trustworthiness of part of the applicant’s submissions concerning restrictions on family visits and telephone calls, specifically his allegations that family visits had lasted less than two hours, that he had not been allowed to make telephone calls between 15 october 2004 and 2 november 2005, that other restrictions had been imposed on his right to make telephone calls after 2 november 2005, that only three adults and one minor child or two adults and two minor children had been allowed to visit him at any one time in the cherkasy sizo, that only two adults and two minor children had been allowed to visit him at any one time in sokalska prison, and that those visits had taken place in the presence of a guard with a guard dog.43.  on 4 july 2002 the applicant lodged an application with the court, complaining, inter alia, under article 3 of the convention that he had been tortured by the police and under articles 6 and 7 of the convention that he had been unfairly convicted and that his sentence had not been based on the law in force at the material time.

accordingly, if released, he might abscond and interfere with [administration of justice].” 13.  on 12 november 2008 the town court extended the applicant’s detention until 31 december 2008. the court reasoned as follows: “taking into account the fact that [the applicant] is charged with a serious offence which he committed whilst on parole, that he has a prior criminal record and that he might abscond, continue his criminal activities, and interfere with the administration of justice, it is necessary that [the applicant] remain in custody.” 14.  on 16 december 2008 the town court set the trial-date for 23 december 2008. the court also ordered that the applicant remain in custody pending examination of the case and noted as follows: “... according to the material submitted by the prosecutor, [the applicant] had been previously convicted.accordingly, ... the detention imposed on [the applicant] cannot be lifted.” 17.  on 25 june 2009 the town court returned the case file to the prosecutor’s office for rectification of certain omissions and extended the applicant’s detention until 8 september 2009. the court referred to the gravity of the charges against the applicant and noted that the latter was charged with having committed a serious offence whilst released on parole.22.  during the subsequent hearings the court heard evidence from a certain p., police officers and., rom., ak., z., shch., and t. − who had taken part in the applicant’s arrest − the head of the police unit pl., lay witness r. − who had been present when the applicant was searched on 16 july 2008 − and forensic expert p., who had run a laboratory test on the heroin found on the applicant.the head of the interpreters’ agency reported that [the applicant] spoke chechen [in the courtroom] with the sole intention of insulting and threatening the interpreters.” 27.  the trial continued in the applicant’s absence.
16.  on 13 august 2008 the kurgan town court, at the request of the kurgan prosecutor and in the absence of the applicant, ordered his detention pending the receipt of an extradition request from the belarusian authorities.18.  a week later, this time after hearing evidence from the applicant, the town court, on the basis of the same legal provisions, ordered his detention until receipt of the extradition request from the republic of belarus.the decision was based on the seriousness of the charges, the fact that the applicant had been on the run and had no permanent residence in russia.30.  on 26 may 2009 the regional court upheld the conviction and sentence, but amended the type of the detention facility where the applicant was to serve his sentence to a settlement colony.40.  the medical documents in the court’s possession cover the period up to 21 may 2009. they show that at that time the applicant was seen by the prison doctor on account of his chronic peptic and liver conditions.
it rejected as unfounded the claimants’ argument concerning a breach of their right to respect for their private life, noting that, by placing their relative, mrs s., in a state-owned medical institution for the elderly, the claimants had stepped out of the private sphere and into the public domain, and therefore the constitutional principle of the inviolability of private life was inapplicable in the circumstances.it also rejected as unfounded the claimants’ argument that the disputed publication had been propagandistic and had aimed to influence voters’ opinions; in this respect, it noted that the text of the article was socially oriented and contained general argument concerning the problems affecting ill and elderly people, with the specific example of the lesnaya dacha care home.in particular, the regional court noted that the headline of the article and the sequence of its sentences made it clear that the statement, along with the reference to the lack of mercy for next of kin, although generalised, related to the claimants.21.  it further found that the disputed information, namely that the claimants had placed their seriously ill close relative in the care home for the elderly because of a lack of mercy, and in order to avoid unnecessary troubles, was a statement that the claimants had breached their moral principles, and was therefore damaging to their honour and dignity, according to the resolution of the supreme court.the tomsk regional court thus concluded that the information in the publication that “...quite a few respectable people bring their ill relatives to the care home in an attempt to escape unnecessary troubles because of lack of mercy for their next of kin...” was untrue and damaging to the claimants’ honour and dignity, and ordered the applicant to pay 10,000 russian roubles (rub – approximately 285 euros (eur)) to each of the three claimants as compensation for non-pecuniary damage.
11.  a few days later lawyer b received a transcript of the judgment, which in the operative part relating to legal fees stated: “each of the accused is to pay the legal costs relating to them, including the fee to counsel appointed to them.” 12.  the applicant did not appeal against the judgment to the high court, nor did the public prosecution.in support thereof, and with reference to section 1008, section 2, of the administration of justice act, he submitted that the applicant had only played a minor role in the criminal case; that an extensive part of the production of evidence did not relate to him; that he had been acquitted of one count; and that the total fee was of a significant amount.17.  on 8 february 2010 the city court submitted a letter to b, with which was enclosed a copy of the judgment of 4 december 2009, which on 5 february 2010 had been rectified on page 90 in the operative part as follows: “the accused are to pay the legal costs, so that each of them pays the legal costs relating to them, including the fees for their appointed counsel.” 18.  the court records of 24 september 2009 and a’s letters of 1 and 9 september 2009 were also enclosed with the letter.in his view, the time-limit for appealing against the decisions on the fees to be paid to a should, at the earliest, run from 25 january 2010, the date on which the applicant received the invoice from the police and thus became aware for the first time of the fees that had been granted to a.more specifically, it stated: “the interlocutory appeal does not concern the amount of the fee granted to the applicant’s two defence lawyers; it only concerns the city court’s decision that the applicant must pay the legal costs relating to him, including the fee to his appointed counsel.
the dentist was unable to complete the treatment as the applicant had to be transported back to the detention facility.16.  between 24 december 2009 and 16 march 2010 a civilian dentist removed the dental crowns and bridges from twenty-two of the applicant’s teeth, extracted two teeth, and treated and shaped the remaining teeth for the forthcoming dental restoration work.in a letter to the head of the remand prison dated 30 march 2010, the dentist stressed that it was crucial to ensure that the applicant was transported to the clinic in line with the fixed schedule, starting from 13 april 2010. failure to do so would entail the necessity to start the treatment anew.the dentist also pointed out that the excessively long time the treatment had taken had already caused substantial suffering to the applicant and increased the risk of digestive problems.17.  having not been taken to the dentist as recommended, the applicant submitted several requests for the dental treatment, stating that he had lost the ability to chew and in addition to severe teeth pain he started experiencing stomach pain.
7.  on 29 january 2014 the fokino town court of the primorskiy region convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to six and a half years’ imprisonment.9.  on his admission to a remand prison in january 2014, the applicant was given a general medical check-up by the doctor on duty, to whom he complained of lower back and joint pain.19.  on 27 august 2014 a specialist medical panel of the prison hospital concluded that the applicant was not eligible for early release, because none of his illnesses were included in the governmental decree containing a list of illnesses precluding offenders from serving their sentences.20.  on 2 october 2014 the olovyannaya district court dismissed the applicant’s application for early release, referring to the medical report of 27 august 2014. that decision was upheld on appeal by the zabaiykalsk regional court on 16 december 2014.21.  in the meantime the applicant lodged several complaints with the head of the prison medical authorities, the federal service for the execution of sentences and the federal supervisory service for healthcare and social development of the russian federation.

26.  the aliens office declared the request inadmissible on 5 april 2007 on the ground that the evidence adduced did not amount to exceptional circumstances for the purposes of section 9(3) of the act such as to warrant the lodging of the request in belgium rather than with the competent diplomatic mission or consulate, as was the rule.57.  in a judgment of 20 august 2008 the aliens appeals board dismissed the applicant’s claims in the following terms: “it is clear from the wording of [section 9ter] that there is nothing to prevent the administrative authority, when dealing with a request for leave to remain on the basis of the above-mentioned section 9ter, from ruling immediately on the exclusion of the person concerned from the scope of the said section 9ter without first being required to take a decision on the medical evidence submitted to it, if it considers at the outset that there are substantial grounds for believing that the person concerned has committed any of the acts referred to in section 55/4, cited above.... as regards the alleged violation of article 3 of the convention, it should be observed that the decision complained of in the present application is not accompanied by any removal measure, with the result that the alleged risk of discontinuation of treatment in the event of the applicant’s return to georgia is hypothetical.” 58.  the aliens appeals board also dismissed the complaint under article 8 of the convention in view of the fact that the impugned decision had not been accompanied by any removal measure.the conseil d’état held that, contrary to the applicant’s assertion, the grounds for setting aside advanced before the aliens appeals board had simply stressed, in a theoretical and general manner, that section 9ter of the act encompassed the application in domestic law of the obligation under articles 2 and 3 of the convention prohibiting the removal of a seriously ill person if such a measure was liable to result in death or inhuman and degrading treatment; no specific explanation had been given, however, as to how the applicant himself risked facing that situation.87.  on 28 july 2010 the court indicated to the belgian government that it was desirable, in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the court, to suspend enforcement of the order for the applicant to leave the country issued on 7 july 2010 “pending the outcome of the proceedings before the aliens appeals board”.
8.  rea registered the applicant company’s application but refused to accept the accompanying documents on the grounds that on 20 december 2004 a new order providing for the authorisation of activities with a significant impact on the environment had been adopted and the guidelines for implementing the new order had not yet been published.14.  following an inspection carried out at the applicant company’s headquarters, on 6 may 2005 the cluj finance inspectorate (garda financiară cluj) fined the company rol 25,000,000 (approximately 694 euros) and ordered the confiscation of rol 768,471,700 (approximately eur 21,347), representing the market value of the scrap iron collected for recycling between 8 march and 14 april 2005. the finance inspectorate based its decision (proces-verbal de constatare şi sancţionare a contravenţiilor) against the applicant company on article 13 (a) of emergency government ordinance no.it pointed out that even after the publication of the guidelines for the application of the new order on 11 january 2005, rea had not acted effectively, as it had not written to the applicant company until 25 january 2005. moreover, rea had interpreted the applicant company’s application as a request for a new permit instead of for an extension of the existing permits, given that the operation conditions had not changed.it held that the applicant company had not complied with the obligation to lodge an application for a new environmental permit forty-five days prior to the expiry of the existing permit, as provided for by article 16 of the new order regulating the procedure for obtaining an environmental permit, namely order no.26.  in january 2013, before the court had communicated the applicant company’s complaints to the respondent government, the administrator and sole shareholder, mr teodor morar, informed the court of the company’s dissolution on 24 february 2010 and his intention to continue the procedure initiated before the court by the applicant company.

those orders, which were virtually identical and drafted in italian with a translation into arabic, read as follows: “the chief of police (questore) for the province of agrigento having regard to the documents in the file, showing that (1)  on ‘17 [18] september 2011’ members of the police force found in the province of ‘agrigento’, near the border of: ‘island of lampedusa’, mr [surname and forename] born ... on [date] ... ‘tunisian’ national ... not fully identified, ‘undocumented’ (sedicente); (2)  the alien entered the territory of the country by evading the border controls; (3)  the identification (rintraccio) of the alien took place on/immediately after his arrival on national territory, and precisely at: ‘island of lampedusa’; whereas none of the situations [provided for in] article 10 § 4 of legislative decree no.–  the director of the migration office will proceed, for the enforcement of the present order, with its notification, together with a summary translation into a language spoken by the alien or into english, french or spanish; and with its transmission to the diplomatic or consular delegation of the state of origin, as provided for by article 2 § 7 of legislative decree no.the calculation of a “reasonable time” for the adoption of that measure and for the migrants’ stay in the cspa had to take account of logistical difficulties (state of the sea, distance between lampedusa and sicily) and of the number of migrants concerned.29.  in the light of the foregoing, the preliminary investigations judge concluded that the case file contained no evidence of the physical and mental elements of the offences provided for in articles 323 and 606 of the criminal code.286 of 1998 (see paragraph 33 below) did not indicate any time-frame for the adoption of such orders, the judge took the view that a measure which by its very nature restricted the freedom of the person concerned had to be taken within a reasonably short time after the identification (fermo) of the unlawful migrant.
6.  the applicant and her partner began to cohabit in 2003. their daughter was born in november 2004. in the spring of 2006 the applicant felt that, in her view, the child’s father was behaving strangely with the child and that the child did not want to stay at home alone with her father.moreover, concerning the visiting rights, the social worker explained that the decision of 4 september 2007 by the kouvola district court was still in force and that if the applicant was not satisfied with it, she would have to appeal against it in courts of law instead of complaining about it to the child welfare authorities.25.  on an unspecified date, the father of the child asked the police to investigate whether the applicant had defamed him as she had given false information about him to the social worker on 19 october 2007, claiming that the child was in danger of being sexually abused by her father during their upcoming meetings (see paragraph 17 above).from the medical certificate of 15 october 2008, which was admitted as written evidence, it appears that the meetings between the father and the child had been supervised until 16 june 2007 and that thereafter until the filing of the police report on 29 august 2007 and the freezing of the meetings, there had been unsupervised day meetings only three times, lasting four hours each.did not have any such reasons to make an insinuation towards [the father of the child] that she would have had a reasoned ground to do so without defaming him.” 28.  by letter dated 12 october 2009 the applicant appealed against the judgment of the district court to the helsinki appeal court (hovioikeus, hovrätten).
10.  on 5 november 2012 the senate of the supreme court (augstākās tiesas senāts) quashed the ruling of the appeal court and remitted the case to the first-instance court.13.  as concerns the strip-searches carried out on 9 december 2009, 8 and 11 june 2010, the court, on the basis of witness testimony, found that the applicant had been searched in the presence of one inmate and at least one additional escorting officer.however, taking into account that the applicant had not voiced any concerns in this regard during the first round of proceedings, the court concluded that “the strip-searches ... had not humiliated the applicant in the eyes of others or in his [own] eyes”.14.  as concerns the strip-searches carried out on 22 february and 8 june 2011, the court found that the evidence did not support the applicant’s allegation that he had been searched in the presence of other persons.15.   on 9 july 2013 the senate of the supreme court, by a final decision, dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the ruling of the lower court.
and two volunteer citizen guards (добровільна народна дружина), who were identified in the course of the ensuing proceedings (see paragraphs 9-11 below), entered the yard of the applicant’s house and, according to the applicant, assaulted him.according to the material available in the case (see paragraph 9 below), the volunteer citizen guards used force against the applicant while exercising their powers under the relevant regulations (see paragraph 13 below) in an attempt to take him to a police station in relation to the incident of 1 august 2004 (see paragraph 5 above).between december 2004 and march 2009 they issued a number of decisions rejecting the applicant’s complaint, finding, inter alia, that the applicant had been injured after disobeying the lawful orders of the volunteer citizen guards, who had lawfully resorted to force in order to take him to a police station in relation to the incident of 1 august 2004 (see paragraph 5 above).10.  on 12 march 2009 the novomoskovsk prosecutor opened criminal proceedings related to the applicant’s complaint and ordered the police to investigate the incident of 1 august 2004 at the applicant’s house.11.  in the course of the investigation the two volunteer citizen guards who had taken part in the incident on 1 august 2004 at the applicant’s house died.
with regard to the suspicion of theft, he reasoned as follows: “there are reasons to suspect that [the applicant] has committed the crime under section 175(3) of the criminal law (krimināllikums) [theft] ... these suspicions are confirmed by the evidence gathered in the criminal case.” 11.  on 18 august 2011 the applicant appealed against that decision.with regard to the suspicion of theft, the judge stated: “the ... suspicion that [the applicant] has committed the crime ... is confirmed by the information contained in the file.” 13.  no appeal lay against the aforementioned decision.14.  on 19 september 2011 the public prosecutor charged the applicant with robbery, theft, involving a minor in theft and petty theft on the basis of the facts as alleged.he gave the following reasoning: “the accusation against [the applicant] of the crimes under sections 175(3) [theft], 176(2) [robbery], 180(2) [petty theft] and 172 [involving a minor in theft] of the criminal law ... is confirmed by the evidence gathered in the criminal case.” 18.  no appeal lay against the aforementioned decision.the judge stated as follows: “[the applicant’s] detention is based on the suspicion that he has committed the crime under section 175(3) of the criminal law [theft]... in other criminal proceedings [he] has been declared a suspect in relation to crimes under sections 180(1) [petty theft] and 176(2) [robbery] ... ... there has been no change in the reasons noted in the detention order of 16 august 2011 ... which had been re-examined in [the subsequent decisions]...” 20.  on 3 february, 19 june and 6 august 2012, the applicant complained to the ludza district court that it had failed to assess his detention in relation to the alleged robbery.
5.  on 9 june 2004, the applicant, 69 at the time, was walking in the centre of kharkiv and was hit in the face by a pellet fired from an air gun.10.  by decisions of 22 march and 8 december 2005 and 9 august 2006, the police refused to open criminal proceedings, stating that it was not possible to identify the offenders and that the applicant’s allegations that the shot had been fired from a particular location were unfounded.11.  on appeal by the applicant, those decisions were annulled by different prosecutors and the courts generally on the grounds that the police enquiry had fallen short of the requirements of a full and objective examination of the circumstances of the case.it was noted that the police had failed to examine the relevant evidence, including the pellet, and that the case contained elements of the crime defined by article 296 of the criminal code (hooliganism).13.  by a letter of 21 august 2009, the deputy prosecutor of the dzerzhynskyy district of kharkiv informed the applicant that the investigation case file had gone missing.
8.  not considering it appropriate to order sns to provide the required documents, the tax agency further requested that the application for coercive measures should not be communicated to the company and that it should not be notified of the court’s decision before the measures had been undertaken, as there was a risk that the documents to be searched and seized could be withheld or destroyed.present were mr carl lindstrand, a lawyer of the applicant law firm, representing mr jurik (who was at the time in switzerland), and – towards the end of the search – mr roland möller, who, as an associate of the law firm, had been the liquidator of sns and who was also the designated person to be served writs on behalf of draupner in sweden.in regard to the applicant, it stated that, while the appealed judgment did indeed allow the use of coercive measures on the premises of the applicant law firm, the reason for this was not that the law firm was the subject of the measures but that it could be assumed that documents relevant to the audit of sns would be found there.25.  by a letter dated 14 march 2008, the day of the search of the flat and the law office, and received by the county administrative court on 17 march 2008, the applicant requested that those parts of the material seized and copied at the flat that could concern the law firm be exempted from the audit.the appellate court agreed with the county administrative court’s assessments that the material, including the hard disk drive and the usb memory stick, had been seized on draupner’s business premises, that there was, accordingly, a presumption that it was included in the audit and eligible for the tax agency’s examination and that the burden of proof for exemptions rested with the company, even though a modest level of evidence was sufficient.
23.  at daybreak, the police officers asked the group to go to the migration service office again, where they spent the whole day waiting outside at a temperature of 5o c. 24.  in the evening the first applicant’s health deteriorated, her children were crying and coughing and no shelter, water or food was offered by the authorities.28.  on 3 and 4 december 2006, after having gone back and forth to the migration service office, and with the help of an employee from the consulate service of the georgian embassy in moscow, the first applicant finally obtained transit visa for her children and all other necessary documents, so that all five applicants could leave for georgia.29.  several national broadcasting television companies reported on the georgians’ situation in derbent on a daily basis between 1 and 7 december 2006. b)  the government’s version of the subsequent events 30.  according to the government the border control services, which conducted immigration controls in the trains going to the republic of azerbaijan, did not bring any georgian nationals to the migration services on 22 or 23 november 2006. however, on 23 november 2006 the name of the fifth applicant was registered by the line division of the interior at derbent station in the register of passengers put off trains.according to the testimony of the house owners the first applicant lived there free of charge, was not accompanied by children and no police officer or other official visited the first applicant in the house.the last 5 kilometres to the border the applicants had to walk, as the bus driver had asked them to get off the bus: the first applicant and her youngest child, the fifth applicant, were able to take a taxi to the border, but the three other applicants had to continue walking; the temperature was below 3o c. 35.  after having arrived in georgia, the first applicant’s health was particularly bad.
11.  after two unsuccessful attempts on 16 february and 23 march 2005 to sell it through public auction, the enforcement court on 13 april 2005 at a third public auction sold the house and awarded it to the enforcement creditors for hrk 100,000. in so doing it relied on section 97(4) of the 1996 enforcement act, as amended in 1999, (hereinafter “the 1999 amendments”) under which at a third public auction a debtor’s immovable property could be sold without restrictions regarding the lowest price (see paragraphs 25-26 below).it held that the enforcement court had misinterpreted section 97(4) and that the contested decision was in breach of section 6 of the enforcement act because that court had not sufficiently respected the applicant’s dignity and the requirement that the enforcement be the least onerous for the debtor (see paragraph 30 below).it noted that the purchase price was not sufficient to cover even half of the debt, which on 13 april 2005 had amounted to hrk 107,974.40[3], meaning that the sale of the applicant’s house had not achieved the main purpose of the enforcement proceedings – namely, the settlement of the creditors’ claim.having regard to the fact that the creditors’ claim in these proceedings on 13 april 2005 ... amounted to hrk 107,974.40 and that now, on account of the lapse of time and accrued [default] interest, it is [even] higher ..., given that the established value of the property is three times higher than the debt, and since the price offered at the last public auction would not settle even half of the debt, it is reasonable to conclude that accepting the said offer was in breach of section 6 of the enforcement act and that it cannot be held that the sale in question was carried out with a view to achieving the purpose of enforcement proceedings – namely, settling the creditor’s claim.” 15.  in the resumed proceedings the enforcement court again scheduled a third public auction, which was held on 12 may 2009 and at which the applicant’s house was again sold to d.d.the relevant part of the county court’s decision, which was served on the applicant’s representative on 12 january 2011, reads: “it is not disputed that on 3 june 2009 a third public auction was held, at which the debtor’s property was sold for hrk 70,000. the third public auction was carried out in accordance with section 97(4) of the enforcement act, which provides that if a property is not sold at a second auction, the court shall, within 15 to 30 days [of the second auction], schedule a third auction at which the property may be sold without restrictions regarding the lowest price [calculated in proportion to its] established value.” 19.  on 11 february 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint alleging violations of his right to equality before the law and his right of ownership, as guaranteed by article 14 paragraph 2 and article 48 of the croatian constitution (see paragraph 22 below).
7.  on 30 august 1994 the applicant received a decree issued by the municipality on 29 july 1994, informing it that the repairs had been carried out in view of the “serious risk of harm” posed by the condition of wall in question, and ordering it to pay a provisional amount of 18,030.36 euros (eur).9.  on 29 october 1994, before the madrid high court of justice, the applicant brought a first set of judicial administrative proceedings (recurso contencioso-administrativo) against the decree of 29 july 1994, complaining of the shortcomings of the procedure which had led to the municipality repairing the wall.10.  on 18 march 1996 the municipality asked the applicant to pay the remainder of the amount owed: the final cost of the repairs minus the amount already paid as a provisional amount.14.  on 9 december 2004 the madrid high court of justice ruled against the applicant, on the grounds that the repairs had been carried out by the municipality in view of the poor condition of the wall and the “serious risk of harm” present at that time, which had given the municipality no other choice but to repair it and then ask the applicant for payment in respect of the costs incurred.17.  on 31 january 2010 the community of owners agreed to authorise mr. garcía caballero to act on its behalf in the framework of the judicial proceedings concerning the costs of the repairs to the wall.

12.  on 28 september 2006 the district court stayed the proceedings pending the outcome of the first set of auxiliary proceedings (see paragraph 18) and this decision was upheld on appeal with final effect on 27 september 2007. subsequently, the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law to no avail.13.  between 9 september and 1 december 2008 the district court monitored the first set of auxiliary proceedings and once those were finalised it resumed the main proceedings on 20 march 2009. the district court then dealt with the applicants’ applications to modify the claim, it ordered the taking of expert evidence, scheduled a number of hearings, and traced the defendants’ whereabouts in order to serve the court documents on them since they were continually changing address.it examined the procedural steps taken by the district court following the applicants’ first constitutional complaint until 17 september 2012, when the district court had stayed the main proceedings for the second time.the constitutional court further stated that the applicants’ arguments about the unfairness of the domestic courts’ decisions on the staying of the proceedings were manifestly ill-founded.19.  in april 2003, the applicants jointly received a domestic award from the constitutional court amounting to the equivalent of 2,656 euros (eur) in damages for the breach of their right to a hearing within a reasonable time in the context of those proceedings (file no.

8.  on 10 march 2010 the sumgayit city court, relying on the official charges brought against the applicant and the prosecutor’s request to apply the preventive measure of remand in custody (həbs qətimkan tədbiri), ordered the applicant’s detention for a period of two months, calculating the period of detention from 9 march 2010.24.  in the meantime, on an unspecified date the applicant’s lawyer had lodged a complaint with the sumgayit city court under the procedure concerning the review of the lawfulness of procedural actions or decisions by the criminal prosecuting authority under article 449 of the code of criminal procedure.25.  in the proceedings before the sumgayit city court the judge heard the applicant, the two other co-accused, the applicant’s lawyer, the police officers involved in the applicant’s arrest, and the two investigators who had been in charge of the applicant’s case.although the police officers denied the ill-treatment allegation, the investigator who had replaced the first investigator in charge of the case stated that he had also noticed the signs of a beating on the applicant’s body during his questioning.30.  on 24 august 2010 the applicant’s lawyer lodged a complaint with the prosecutor general’s office and the ministry of internal affairs, complaining that the investigating authorities had failed to investigate the applicant’s ill-treatment, despite the explicit acknowledgment of the fact of the ill-treatment by the court decisions of 25 june and 27 july 2010.
12.  on 30 december 2004 a forensic expert examined the applicant and documented the following injuries: “bruises around the right and left eyes and on the right part of the head; haemorrhage ... on the left of the lower lip; bruises on the nose, right cheek, forehead and right knee joint.” 13.  in the expert’s opinion, the injuries had been inflicted between three and eight days before the examination and had not caused any serious damage to the applicant’s health.as regards the interception of the defendants’ mobile telephone calls, the court noted as follows: “it is clear from the material in the case file that the regional court authorised the interception of the [defendants’] telephone communications ... pursuant to [the applicable legislation], information about covert operational and search activities is classified as a state secret.the [appeal court] discerns no violations of [applicable laws] in the course of the storage, transfer, inspection of, and listening to, the audiotapes containing the recording of the defendants’ telephone communications.the results of [the interception of the defendants’ telephone communications] were submitted to the investigator and the court in accordance with an instruction prepared on the basis of [the applicable legislation].” 21.  from 26 to 31 december 2004 the applicant was detained in a temporary detention centre.(a)  description provided by the government 23.  the government provided copies of the prison’s population register for each day of the applicant’s detention in the remand prison and the relevant floor plans.
8.  on 4 december 2003 the golovinskiy district court in moscow convicted the first applicant of smuggling and issued a confiscation order in respect of the foreign currency he had carried on him.noting that there was no evidence that the confiscated currency had been the instrument of a crime or had been criminally acquired, it cancelled the confiscation order and ordered the confiscated money to be refunded to the first applicant.11.  the first applicant sued the ministry of finance, seeking to recover the interest accrued on the retained amount during the period from 6 may 2003 to 3 june 2009, which he assessed at rub 458,777.it awarded the first applicant rub 11,719.20[3] in respect of the period from 2 april 2009 when his representative had submitted the bank details to the ministry of finance until 3 june 2009 when the transfer had been made.16.  on an application from a deputy moscow prosecutor, on 26 august 2011 the presidium of the moscow city court amended the judgments in respect of the second and third applicants.
the court noted contradictions between the testimony given by the applicant, who had referred to the alleged serious problems in marital life prior to 2004 on the one hand, and the decision to treat r.’s infertility in summer 2004 on the other.17.  the court emphasised that under article 56 § 3 of the family and guardianship code, a divorce could not be granted if it had been requested by the party whose fault it was that the marriage had broken down, if the other party refused to consent and the refusal of the innocent party was not “contrary to the reasonable principles of social coexistence” (zasady współżycia społecznego) within the meaning of article 5 of the civil code.it referred to the case-law of the supreme court to the effect that a refusal of consent to a divorce was to be presumed to be compliant with those principles unless there were case-specific indications to the contrary.19.  the court stressed that the duration of the applicant’s new relationship could not by itself be considered to be a sufficient reason for granting the divorce.he argued, inter alia, that the court had erred in holding that a spouse’s refusal to consent to a divorce could be disregarded only when it was of an abusive nature or was dictated by hostility towards the spouse seeking the divorce.
m. according to those calculations therefore, the regulated rent of the flats possessed by the applicants corresponded to some 14-26% of the market rent in 2010. the relevant data are set out in appendixes 2‑5 (columns g‑i).12.  the applicants submitted that in 2010 the regulated rent for their flats amounted to eur 95 and 105 a month, whereas the monthly free-market rent for comparable flats was eur 616. they relied on data from the national association of real estate agencies (“the narea”).depending on the period and the relevant law in force, the regulated rent represented some 5-13% of the market rent for comparable flats in the area.he submitted that the market rent in the same area in 2005 was between eur 305 and eur 366 a month for the single-room flat and between eur 396 and eur 488 a month for the two-room flats.14.  the applicants submitted that the regulated rent for their flats ranged between eur 38.5 and 104 a month in 2010. relying on data from the narea, they maintained that the market rent for comparable flats in the area amounted to approximately eur 616 a month.
17.  on 10 february 2010 the administrative court of the canton of zurich dismissed the applicant’s appeal lodged on 20 october 2009. it considered that the applicant had committed a serious criminal offence, that he was not well integrated in switzerland despite the length of his stay, that expert prognosis regarding the likelihood that he would reoffend was positive but did not rule out any such risk, that he spoke albanian and was familiar with the culture in “the former yugoslav republic of macedonia”, where he spent parts of his childhood and which he had visited since.moreover, the court considered that the applicant could reasonably (re-)integrate in “the former yugoslav republic of macedonia”, considering that he spoke albanian, was born there and had spent a part of his childhood there and had visited the country since.the federal supreme court concluded that the public interest in the applicant’s removal outweighed the applicant’s interest in remaining in switzerland and enjoying respect for his family life there, also noting that his wife and children had a choice between either following him to “the former yugoslav republic of macedonia” or remaining in switzerland and maintaining contact through short but regular visits.it noted that the applicant could ask for a temporary suspension of the entry ban for humanitarian or other important reasons (article 67 § 5 of the federal act on foreign nationals) and that the applicant’s wife, who originated from “the former yugoslav republic of macedonia” herself, could visit him there together with their children and also maintain contact by various means of communication.24.  in august 2015, i.e. after almost four years, the applicant’s wife and children returned to switzerland to avoid the expiry of their permanent residence permit pursuant to article 61 § 2 of the federal act on foreign nationals (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 27) and because their socioeconomic living conditions in “the former yugoslav republic of macedonia” were difficult.
on the same day he was seen by a medical expert who noted two abrasions on his forehead that could have been caused by a solid blunt object four to six days prior to the examination.referring to the statements from three police officers and from the investigator all of whom denied any ill-treatment or intimidation, the decision of 31 december 2009 concluded that the applicant’s allegations were unsubstantiated because the expert had determined his injuries to have been caused no later than 21 august, that is to say, three days prior to his arrest.on 28 july 2015 the prosecutor of the sovetskiy district in omsk annulled the decision of 31 december 2009 and ordered an additional inquiry which should establish whether or not the applicant had been brought to the police station already on 20 august 2006 and whether or not the specific police officer described by the applicant had been on duty on that day.on the latter date the applicant was transferred to ik-3 where he stayed until 26 march 2010. the dormitories in which the applicant slept were overcrowded, affording at times no more than 1.5-1.7 sq.on 26 march 2010 the applicant was transferred to liu-2, a medical facility, where he appears to have stayed until the end of his sentence on 23 august 2015. the premises of the facility were overcrowded and afforded no more than 1.8 sq.
in the final part of the written grounds for the judgment the court of appeal stated that the position of the opole regional court as to the substance of the case was supported by the wording of the international agreements and existing domestic case-law.this part of the court’s reasoning read as follows: “as to the substantive grounds for the court’s legal view expressed in the judgment under appeal, it should be stated that it finds support in the content of the agreement between the governments of the republic of poland and the federal republic of germany on the secondment of workers of polish companies to carry out construction work (journal of laws 1998/84, items 474 and 475) as well as in the hitherto interpretation of this agreement in judicial decisions (see, e.g., iii a pa 29/00 wrocław court of appeal, decision of 31 may 2000).” 12.  on 10 december 2002 the applicant challenged one of the judges, alleging his partiality.in the supreme court’s view, the court of appeal had not sufficiently clarified the meaning of those contracts in the light of statements made by the polish company concerning the applicant’s employment conditions and the obligations imposed on the company by the provisions of german law to which those statements referred.22.  on 8 december 2006 the wrocław court of appeal, having taken into account the recommendations of the supreme court, again dismissed the applicant’s appeal lodged against the regional court’s judgment of 24 may 2004. the court reiterated that the applicant was entitled to the rates of pay fixed in his employment contract.26.  additionally, the supreme court noted that the interpretation made by the lower courts of the applicant’s contract of employment, seen as a whole, had taken into account the applicant’s employer’s declarations submitted to the german authorities and also a wealth of other evidence in so far as it had been relevant for the determination of the applicant’s working conditions and remuneration.
12.  on 21 may 2015 the applicant’s extradition in respect of certain charges was authorised by the deputy prosecutor general of the russian federation.13.  the applicant challenged this decision in the courts, arguing that he belonged to a vulnerable group and therefore faced a real risk of treatment contrary to article 3 at the hands of the uzbek authorities.without reference to any relevant evidentiary material, the supreme court considered that the applicant’s claims were hypothetical and lacked specific indications regarding the level of risk, and observed that the situation in a requesting state might change over time.18.  on 25 december 2015 the meshchanskiy district court of moscow ordered the applicant’s expulsion for violating the migration rules.the applicant’s appeal, which referred to the risk of ill-treatment, amongst other factors, was dismissed by the moscow city court on 24 february 2016.
7.  on 31 january 2002 the presidium of the rostov regional court quashed by way of supervisory review the decisions of 2 july and 2 october 2001 and discontinued criminal proceedings against the applicants.it reasoned as follows: “... the court finds that, since the applicants’ guilt of the commission of the above‑mentioned crimes was established, the use of the measure of restraint was justified.this being so, the court has no reason to grant the applicants’ claims for compensation in respect of the non-pecuniary damage resulting from their unlawful detention and the obligation not to leave their usual place of residence.it stated that: “ ... the first instance court, in reaching its decision refusing to grant the applicants’ claims for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage, correctly assumed that the decision of the presidium of the rostov regional court dated 31 january 2002 cleared them of liability on non-exonerating grounds.in the court’s view, since the applicants’ guilt of the commission of the above-mentioned crimes was established, the application of the measure of restraint during the investigation was justified.
in the view of the experts, taking into account the necessity to ensure the proper development of the child, contact between the applicant and the child should take place four times a month and last two hours on each occasion.20.  the experts opined that an increase in contact, as requested by the applicant, was not advisable, on account of the limited level of communication between him and the child, the child’s age and history, and the strength of the child’s ties with the mother and maternal grandparents.35.  the applicant contested the lower court’s finding that the child’s paternal grandmother was a stranger to him; he argued that the child would not be exposed to stress in the event of contact without the mother’s presence and outside her home in view of the fact that the child attended nursery school and was cared by a neighbour a few times a week.the communication barrier was a real obstacle to the forging of ties between the applicant and his son and it could not be disregarded, given that the interests of the child were of primary consideration, overriding the individual interests of the parents.in the view of the experts, the mother of the child properly exercised her parental authority, in particular with respect to the child’s needs, the necessity of treatment, and the development of the child’s social skills.
5.  on 3 august 2009 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of the rape of a girl, who was also a minor.6.  on 5 august 2009 the staroshaygovskiy district court of the mordovia republic remanded him in custody.he remained in pre-trial detention pending investigation and trial on the grounds that he was accused of a serious crime, might reoffend, abscond, destroy evidence, threaten witnesses, or interfere with the investigation.7.  on 24 december 2010 the supreme court of the mordovia republic found him guilty as charged.9.  on 4 august and 4 october 2010 he provided two powers of attorney authorising mr frimu, one of his cellmates, to represent him before the court.
10.  by a letter of 13 august 2008, the public education department of the canton of basle urban (erziehungsdepartement des kantons basel-stadt) advised the applicants that under section 91 (9) of the education act of the canton of basle urban (see paragraph 24 below), they were liable to a maximum fine of 1,000 swiss francs (chf) (around 923 euros (eur)) each if their daughters did not comply with the obligation to attend school.it cited, firstly, section 22 of the education act of the canton of basle urban, which stated that gymnastics was one of the compulsory lessons in primary school, and section 139 of the same act, stating that at least three hours of the pupils’ weekly timetable was to be spent in physical education.it further stated that, in accordance with section 68 of the act, the precise organisation of this subject, especially the various lessons and the number of hours allocated to them, was set out in the curriculum, point 9.2.4 of which provided that swimming formed part of compulsory gymnastics and sports lessons.it noted that detailed information on exemptions was set out in point 34 of the school regulations (schulordnung) of the canton of basle urban, and that the arrangements for dealing with religious issues in schools were included in a recommendation (handreichung) that had been issued by the education department of the canton of basle urban in september 2007. it added that, under point 5.1 of that recommendation, exemption from swimming classes could only be granted to pupils who had reached the age of puberty.it further considered that the interference was lessened by the fact that the swimming lessons were mixed only until the age of puberty, and that the impact of the measure was attenuated by the accompanying measures (separate changing rooms and showers, and the option of wearing a burkini).
it noted that all the doctors and the nurses who had given evidence stated that the balloon of the intubation catheter had been leak‑proof (etanche); however, the fact that the cause of death had been the presence of blood in the child’s lungs could only lead to the conclusion that such statements had been inaccurate.it stated that the cause of death had not been the presence of blood in the child’s lungs owing to a lack of adequate post-operative monitoring, but the post-operative reaction of a child with pre-existing medical conditions (cardiac congenital malformation, hepatic dystrophy, renal stasis, mesenteric adenopathy and hemorrhagic enterocolitis) mentioned in the medical records kept by the child’s paediatrician.it considered that although a new forensic report had not been produced, the decision of the superior committee of the national college of doctors provided enough information concerning the cause of death, which had been the presence of blood in the child’s airways owing to the balloon of the tracheal catheter not being tight enough.it noted that the conclusions of the extrajudicial report were in total contradiction to the conclusions of the medical report of 8 november 2005 and the conclusions of the commission for confirmation and supervision of the iaşi forensic institute.noting that the lower courts had not examined the allegation made by the child’s parents that they had not given their consent for surgery and the general anaesthesia, the appeal court sent the file back to the brăila district court.
the decision referred to article 61 of the convention on legal assistance and legal relations in civil, family and criminal matters (signed in minsk on 22 january 1993 and amended on 28 march 1997, “the minsk convention”).on 6 march 2007 the prosecutor applied to the court for authorisation of the applicant’s detention pending extradition.he again relied on article 61 of the minsk convention and articles 97‑101, 108 and 466 § 1 of the code of criminal procedure of russia (“the ccrp”).the district court did not set a limit on the length of the applicant’s detention.9.  it appears that on 10 july 2007 the applicant was handed over to the authorities of the republic of uzbekistan.
in particular, no expert dna analysis had been carried out on the material found under the victim’s nails; several key witnesses had not been questioned about the reasons for their presence in the office in which the victim had been killed on the day in question and about the reason for the return to the office of one of them during the evening of the same day; no confrontation had been held between two of those witnesses, despite several discrepancies between their respective statements; and no information had been collected about the state in which the police officers had found the accused at the time of his arrest.on 20 april 2001 the prosecutor returned the case to the investigating authorities for further investigative measures, giving specific instructions aimed at the remedying of the deficiencies in the investigation.12.  at the start of the trial the defendant’s lawyer claimed that the indictment was defective because it did not contain a clear description of the offence with which the defendant had been charged; the lawyer sought, without success, the return of the case for further investigation.14.  on 18 july 2008 the sofia court of appeal accepted that the indictment had not contained a description of how the accused had killed the victim and that this had been a fundamental procedural defect which had prevented the defendant from effectively exercising his rights.the sofia court of appeal carried out a thorough analysis of the witness statements given at first instance, of the record of the examination of the murder scene conducted on the day after the killing, of the search and seizure measures, and of the conclusions of the numerous expert reports, the autopsy, etc.
6.  on 28 january 2007 the applicant, at the material time a member of the shakhtarsk district council and president of the local branch of the party of regions, read out a letter at a meeting attended by over forty party members and inhabitants of the village of zolotarevka which contained the following text: “to the member of the shakhtarsk district council, president of the district branch of the party of regions, mr lykin v.v., from the inhabitants of the village of zolotarevka ... we, the inhabitants of zolotarevka ... appeal to you with indignation concerning the election and performance of the deputy president of the shaktarsk district executive committee, mr g. sh.as the purported authors of the letter had signed it without indicating their full names or address details, it should have been disposed of without any follow-up as an anonymous application within the meaning of the citizens’ applications act.himself had confirmed that uah 30 per household had been collected for the renovation of the water supply conduit, and that the boiler-room equipment in the kindergarten had been dismantled upon his orders.it found that the court had rightly concluded that the letter had been anonymous, as it was not possible to identify the authors from the signatures contained therein, and that it had been addressed to the applicant as a public official rather than a private individual, hence the citizens’ applications act had been properly applied.furthermore, the trial court had rightly concluded that the applicant had not verified the accuracy of the accusations contained in the letter as required by article 302 of the civil code of ukraine, and had therefore been liable for disseminating defamatory statements against g.sh.
14.  when the vessel was passing through the suez canal, the insurer tried to arrange with the egyptian authorities that the applicants could disembark in egypt, but the authorities refused the request.15.  following the vessel’s arrival in tuzla on 3 february 2012 the turkish authorities and a representative of the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees (“the unhcr”) in turkey met with the applicants on board the vessel.17.  on 24 february 2012, sometime before the vessel anchored in the port of mykolayiv, a non-governmental organisation “faith, hope, love”, which at the time was based in odesa and assisted refugees and asylum‑seekers under a contract with the unhcr, contacted the head of the border control service in the southern region of ukraine informing him that there were two nationals of eritrea and a national of ethiopia on board the vessel and that, according to the unhcr, they might require international protection.22.  on 28 february 2012 the applicants, allegedly having been misled by the vessel’s captain who was acting on the instructions of the ukrainian border guards, signed type-written statements in english, according to which they had boarded the vessel with the aim of reaching sweden “in search of better living conditions” and that they did not “need the status of refugee, addition[al] [or] temporary protection in ukraine”.she essentially requested the court to indicate to the government of ukraine that the applicants should be allowed to leave the vessel and should be granted access to a lawyer and to the asylum procedure.
first, the proceedings to establish tods murray’s fees, which ran from 8 october 1996 to 2 october 2008 (in this the courts were assisted by the auditor for taxation, an expert officer of the outer house who advises the court on disputes concerning legal fees); second, proceedings in respect of arakin’s allegations of fraud against tods murray running from july 2001 to 22 january 2004; third, proceedings concerning the principal claim and counterclaim which ran from 9 january 2009 to 14 november 2012; and fourth, proceedings settling the overall costs of the case (excluding the fraud proceedings) which ran from 14 november 2012 to 13 november 2014.it concluded, inter alia, that none of the allegations were well-founded; that the applicant had made representations which he knew or ought to have known were incorrect; that the hearing had taken an inordinate length of time because the applicant had persistently resorted to irrelevant lines of inquiry and had been disorganised in his presentation; that the hearing had been used as a vehicle to air grievances going beyond its scope and to advance the applicant’s interests in other litigation; that the applicant’s approach had been reckless; and that he had had no reasonable grounds for his asserted belief in the truth of the allegations.3.  the third set of proceedings: the principal claim and the counterclaim (a)  the preliminary determination of the legal issues (the “legal debate”) 29.  following the conclusion of the taxation proceedings, the outer house heard the parties on several occasions between 9 january 2009 and 22 october 2009 to determine future procedure and finally listed an eight‑day hearing of legal issues to commence on 1 december 2009. by the time of the hearing the applicant sought over gbp sixty-two million in his counterclaim.it further noted: “throughout the course of this protracted litigation mr mcnamara has sought to revisit arguments and allegations which have not found favour with the court on previous occasions ... many of the issues which mr mcnamara has sought to argue before us cannot be argued competently before us now.” 36.  it held that it was not open to it to revisit the various decisions it had made previously concerning aspects of the litigation in the context of interim appeals.he has thereby caused the pursuer unnecessary expense...” 41.  it also awarded an additional fee to tods murray to reflect the “huge amount” of correspondence and documents sent to the tods murray’s solicitors by the applicant, much of which was irrelevant, the complexity of the proceedings, having regard to the “number, difficulty and novelty of the questions raised”, the skill time, labour and specialist knowledge required of the solicitors and the accusations of deception, incompetence and bad faith levelled against individual solicitors at tods murray.
1 was transferred: according to the government’s submissions, he was transferred on 18 september 2013, whereas the applicant argued that he was transferred on 3 december 2013. according to the material in the court’s possession, applicant no.10.  on 19 november 2013 the applicants had lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor, complaining of the conditions of their detention but had not received a reply.they submitted two contracts with cleaning companies for the building for the periods in question: one from 10 june 2013 to 10 august 2013 and the other from 11 august 2013 to 11 october 2013. the contracts included cleaning the detention areas and the sanitary facilities every day and disinfecting the detention areas once a week.14.  regarding recreational activities, the government stressed that detainees had had unlimited access to telephone cards and that it had been standard practice for them to receive newspapers and magazines.17.  the government pointed out that the applicants had not referred to or adduced any evidence that they had needed medical treatment which they had not received.
in that regard, he referred to the reports of amnesty international and human rights watch concerning the human rights situation in palestine in 2012. the applicant also contended that the migration service had disregarded that, as a palestinian refugee registered with unrwa and outside its field of operation he was entitled to the same protection in ukraine as refugees under the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees of 1951.in particular, the court noted that the material relating to the applicant’s asylum proceedings demonstrated that he did not run an individual and real risk of persecution by the palestinian authorities, as hamas and fatah had entered into negotiations concerning a transitional government for palestinian territories; he had not been subjected to such persecution at any time; the applicant had not provided any evidence that he would not be able to avail himself of the protection of his country of origin; he had travelled freely to and from palestine; all his family lived there; and he did not face criminal prosecution there.relying on the latter ground, the court found that the applicant had missed the time-limit for lodging an asylum application pursuant to article 5 of the refugees and persons in need of complementary or temporary protection act of 2011. on the whole, the court found that it had been for the applicant to provide documents or persuasive arguments demonstrating that he had run a real and personal risk of persecution, which he had failed to do.46.  on 4 december 2012 the court of appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal, having agreed with the first-instance court in that the applicant had failed to substantiate his asylum application as required by the national law and pertinent international documents, including the european union council directive of 1 december 2005 on minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status and the guidelines on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status under the 1951 geneva convention, issued by the unhcr in 2011.the court in particular found that, although the arguments on which the applicant’s new application for asylum had been based were the same as in the applicant’s initial application, the new application needed to be reconsidered in the light of the decision of the desnyanskyy district court of 29 october 2014 and on the basis of the new act on the legal status of foreigners and stateless persons, which had entered into force on 25 december 2011. it therefore ordered the state migration service to reconsider the applicant’s new asylum application.
the court further relied on customs documents stamped using the personal rubber stamps of specific customs officers, comparing these with the testimony of the truck drivers, the records of service rotations and the database linking the applicants to the times at which the interviewed truck drivers obtained their customs clearance.the district court stated: “as regards the defendant roman bátěk, he is incriminated by the relevant documentary evidence referring to counts 2 and 3 of the indictment and counts 4 and 5 of the indictment, from which it is apparent that he used a rubber stamp with the number 005 and that his personal number was 20627, these numbers appearing on the relevant documents.as to counts 4 and 5 of the indictment, the defendant bátěk is also incriminated by a police officer of the czech republic who saw the defendant accepting a bribe and recorded this fact in the corresponding document, produced in evidence, which also corresponds with the testimony of the undercover agent given before the court.as to count 9 of the indictment in relation to the defendant karel elsner, the witness stated that on 10 november 2003 he gave a bribe at a particular time and ‒ by checking the driver and the documentation relating to his border crossing ‒ it was established who had cleared him and who had stamped his documents, from which it is clearly apparent that it was the defendant elsner who carried out the administrative measures concerned and hence received the bribe.14.  on 22 march 2007 the brno regional court (krajský soud) rejected the applicants’ appeal as unsubstantiated, arguing as follows: “(...) the hearing of an undercover police agent as a witness is in practice exceptional, occurring only in the particular circumstances of a specific case and in the interests of proper clarification and vindication of particularly serious criminal actions and the conviction of the perpetrators thereof.
accordingly, the trial court decided as follows: “to recognise the [applicant’s] rights to compensation from the state for material, pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by the criminal offence, and to remit (nodot) the question of the precise amount to be awarded/enforced (piedzīt) to the court to decide in civil proceedings”.in the claim the applicant relied on the operative part of the judgment of the daugavpils court (see above), section 27 of the law on police and various provisions of the civil law which regulated tort liability.the court referred to the findings of the experts in the criminal proceedings and stated that the applicant’s bodily injuries caused by the police officer might have been the reason for the worsening of his eye disorder (myopia) that had resulted in a rapid deterioration of his sight and eventually complete loss of vision.30.  in a letter dated 21 october 2010 addressed to the government, the supreme court stated that there were no grounds for the national courts to extend the scope of the applicant’s claim and decide on the awarding of non-pecuniary damages on the following grounds.according to the supreme court, no such obligation could be inferred from any other legal acts on the account that the subject matter of the present civil dispute did not concern the public law obligation which the latvian state had undertaken in the area of human rights.
she also stated that on 29 december 2005, between 12 noon and 4.30 p.m., she had been present in the applicant’s flat, where he had tied her to the bed, partially undressed the lower part of her body, and threatened to drug her with heroin, to carry her out from the flat in a large bag and to hand her over to unspecified persons to be trafficked to turkey for 100,000 czk (eur 3,622) unless she promised to resume their intimate relationship, which she had broken off on 25 december 2005. according to her, the applicant had threatened to take pornographic pictures of her or to record a porn movie with her, which he would then send to her employer in the united kingdom and the company which had acted as intermediary in finding her a job in the united kingdom.on 31 october 2006 the judge ordered the compilation of a list of communications carried out from several of the applicant’s other mail-boxes in the period from 25 december 2005 to 30 june 2006, and also the provision of information on the total number of communications logged in these mailboxes between 25 december 2005 and 18 october 2006. on the same day, the judge ordered the compilation of a list of outgoing telephone calls from the applicant’s land line on 9 june 2006 between 11 a.m and 3 p.m. 16.  on 5 april 2007 criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicant for unlawful restraint (omezování osobní svobody) in concurrence with coercion (vydírání), defamation (pomluva) and false accusation (křivé obvinění).she said that she had advised her ... to immediately cut off all contact with [the applicant] ... i told her about what [the applicant] had done to my daughter at christmas 2005 and she essentially replied that [the applicant] had also told her about it and that she had strictly forbidden him to ever do such a thing again ... [c.] told me that in december 2005, when she was in his flat, [the applicant] had tied her up, threatened to kill her, to traffic her, to make a movie of her taking drugs or a porn movie; he had also searched through her handbag and taken a piece of paper with her home address or had written it down, had searched through the address book in her mobile phone and had accessed her electronic mail box after forcing her to give him the password ...” 20.  the investigation having been concluded in may 2008, the applicant was indicted for coercion under article 235 §§ 1 and 2 of the criminal code on 16 june 2008. this legal classification of his criminal acts was more serious than that indicated in the notice served on him on 20 april 2007, when he had been charged with deprivation of personal liberty under article 231 §§ 1 and 2 of the criminal code in conjunction with coercion under article 235 § 1 of the criminal code.the testimonies given by [c.] and her mother ... regarding the relevant facts correspond to the content of the criminal complaint filed by the victim at the police station in surrey, united kingdom ... on 7 june 2006. the defendant’s complaint that the unreliability of the victim is proved by the fact that she did not confide earlier in her mother or a close female friend about his alleged behaviour is ill-founded: the evidence taken clearly shows that the victim and her mother did not previously have a particularly close relationship since she did not confide in her mother about her relationship with the defendant.... the reliability of the victim and the veracity of her testimony is also corroborated by the emails included in the ... these emails, which were submitted to the police by the victim, correspond case file to her testimony as to the timeframe and the contents ... it is hardly possible for the municipal court to believe that the victim would systematically and for many months beforehand prepare all the evidence ... in order to be able to file a criminal complaint against the defendant.
he provided the investigators with information which he had obtained from l.m., in particular stating the names of those involved in the attack, including the applicants, and mentioning that the attack had been prepared a long time in advance by a different team and that one of the weapons discovered in one of the vehicles abandoned at the scene of the crime had been purchased by l.m.article 6, cited above, does not prohibit ... the judge from using in evidence a statement by a witness under police protection pursuant to articles 102 to 111 of the code of criminal procedure, even where such witness is an informer who has decided, after having provided information under informer status, to testify officially in court.” 53.  the applicants submitted that r.c.’s use of the status of informer and then that of witness, given that confidentiality had been observed in respect of his contacts as informer with the police, had amounted to a violation of the principle of adversarial proceedings, because his statement had been used in evidence against them, especially since that witness had received a bounty in the context of his informer status.the court of cassation dismissed those arguments as follows: “an official statement by a person having previously provided information under informer status does not infringe the general principle of law relating to compliance with the rights of the defence, given that it has the effect of making the witness statements subject to inter partes debate and that the confidentiality requirement set out in article 47decies, § 6 of the code of criminal procedure does not cover evidence referred to the trial court.the appellant’s submission to the effect that the confidentiality of the informer’s involvement has the effect of removing the evidence which the latter provided against him from the inter partes debate is therefore unjustified.” 54.   the court of cassation gave the following reply to the applicants’ criticism of the fact that the procedure for granting a threatened witness assistance and protection is not subject to court supervision and, owing to its confidentiality, prevents the defendant from establishing that the financial assistance provided is tantamount to the covert purchase of witness statements: “article 6 of the convention requires the prosecuting authorities to communicate to the defence all the relevant evidence in their possession for or against the defendant.the limits on the disclosure of those confidential data are adequately offset by the oral adversarial proceedings conducted before the jury, since the case-file presented to the latter comprises no elements other than those communicated to the defence and the latter has had an opportunity before the trial court to criticise the statements received against the defendant, as regards both their content and their origin.
the facts established concern the publication of several articles on the above-mentioned topics ... however it is not understood how or to what extent these articles allowed the applicant to reach the conclusion that: “for years, first in the trade union association of judges then [as a member of] the high council of the judiciary, and lastly [sitting on] the supreme court of justice, this person – of whom the majority of the portuguese have never heard – has been weaving a web of connections, of back-scratching, of favours and undertakings (there is an even worse word but i will avoid it) which enabled him yesterday to stick into his somewhat tousled mane the peacock feather he has been lacking: the presidency of the supreme court of justice.in fact, it was proved that in the letter he distributed to his colleagues, the plaintiff, as a candidate for the presidency of the supreme court, defended the enshrinement – through a constitutional revision – of the president of the supreme court as a permanent member of the council of state, as well as the improvement in a timely manner, consistent with the economic situation of the country, of the remuneration of members of the supreme court of justice.19.  on 13 november 2012 the lisbon court of appeal delivered a new judgment in which it upheld its previous judgment of 9 november 2010. as to the facts, the lisbon court of appeal considered, inter alia, the following to have been established: (i)  the plaintiff had been the only candidate for the post of president of supreme court of justice and had previously been a member and the vice-president of the high council of the judiciary; (ii)  several articles had been published in the press and in blogs (in the periods preceding and following the election) about judge n.n.and his electoral programme and past elections for the presidency of the supreme court of justice; (iii)  on 6 august 2008 the newspaper público had published an interview with p.m., a member of the supreme court of justice, in which he had questioned the system of elections to the post of president of the supreme court of justice on the grounds that it could be distorted in so far as the hcj’s functions included the grading of judges who ascended to the post of member of the supreme court; (iv)  with regard to a past competition to the supreme court of justice, the daily newspaper diário de notícias had, in 2004, published two different articles in which it had raised questions about the grading of judges by the hcj and the possible power strategy involved; in one of the articles (for one of which a judge of a court of appeal who had participated in the competition had been interviewed and for which a document known to judges had been consulted) it had been mentioned that judge n.n.had already mustered support for his election in the next elections for the post of president of supreme court; (v)  in 2001 público had published an editorial [by the then editor] criticising the system of electing the president of the supreme court and of hcj judges; with regard to the latter, criticism was made of judge n.n.’s lobbying on his own account of while exercising his functions as union leader; (vi)  the first applicant’s editorial had received both positive and negative comments in the press and in blogs; (vii)  the first applicant had had knowledge of the different articles which had been published in the media before the elections and had spoken to different people about them, judge n.n.
8.  the applicant described the conditions of his detention as follows: -  there was no water during summer days; -  he was placed with smokers (in the court-room and for few days during detention) although he did not smoke; -  the windows were covered with bars and thick galvanised wire which rendered the ventilation of the cell impossible; -  he was transported to court hearings in small dirty vans, with no ventilation or natural light; -  from 2009 until the date of the last information received (22 july 2014) he had been held with five other inmates in a 17.65 sq.9.  based on the documents presented by the prison administration, the government explained that during his stay in giurgiu prison the applicant had occupied the following cells, all non-smoking: - cells nos.m and which he shared with a maximum of five other detainees, between 26 january 2009 and 5 august 2010, between 12 august and 6 september 2010, between 7 march and 28 april 2011, between 20 may and 22 august 2011, between 29 august 2011 and 3 february 2012, between 9 february and 2 april 2012, between 7 may and 23 july 2012, between 2 august and 13 september 2012, between 4 october 2012 and 4 march 2013, between 11 march and 11 april 2013, between 18 and 29 april 2013, between 7 may 2013 and 7 february 2014 and between 21 february and 22 july 2014.13.  according to the government, from 21 february 2014 onwards the applicant had been sharing the cells with a maximum of four other persons, in compliance with the decision adopted on 31 january 2014 by the giurgiu district court (see paragraph 15 below).17.  ruling on a similar complaint lodged by the applicant about his stay in a cell with smokers from 8 to 11 march 2013 in rahova prison, the post‑sentencing judge for this prison decided, on 19 march 2013, that no measure could be imposed on rahova prison as the applicant was no longer there.
7.  by decision of 23 july 2001 the daa granted the applicant company permission to modify its facility site and dismissed the objections lodged by persons living in the vicinity of the site (hereinafter, “the neighbours”).8.  on 18 december 2001 the upper austria regional governor (landeshauptmann von oberösterreich – hereinafter, “the regional governor”) lifted the daa’s decision because of lack of jurisdiction, and on 19 december 2001 he dismissed the applicant company’s application for transfer of jurisdiction.10.  the administrative court (verwaltungsgerichtshof) lifted the minister’s decision on 17 december 2002 and held that the regional governor was the competent authority to decide on the matter.11.  on 16 october 2003 the minister lifted the regional governor’s decision of 19 december 2001 and held that the latter was competent to decide on the merits of the applicant company’s case.13.  on 22 december 2003 the regional governor lifted the daa’s decision because of lack of jurisdiction, and granted the applicant company the permission.
the reason for the demonstration was that riots had broken out between roma and non-roma families of the municipality on 25 july 2012. following that incident, seventeen people were questioned by the police, and an enhanced police presence was ordered in the municipality, with the constant surveillance of streets inhabited by the roma community.the report of the police’s contact officer noted that the organiser of the demonstrations, mr g.f. had not been able to keep the events under control and had been unwilling to confront the participants.17.  on 21 september 2012 the minister of the interior, reacting to a letter from civil society organisations, informed the public that the conduct of the police had been adequate and that forty people, including five demonstrators, had been questioned by the police.the court went on to find that the police had been under an obligation to respect the principle of proportionality and had been right to conclude that dispersing the march could have caused more serious prejudice to the roma community than allowing the demonstration to continue in a controlled manner.28.  the investigation into incitement against a group was discontinued by the police department on 24 september 2013. the police department considered that although the content of the speeches had been injurious to the roma minority and was morally reprehensible, it could not be classified as a crime.
it was formulated as follows: “based on article 100 of the rccp, in view of the prosecutor’s application issued on 20 october 2005 and the investigative work which has been presented, namely: the minutes attesting to the decision of the prosecutor to initiate criminal investigations ex officio, confirmation of the proposal to initiate criminal investigations against cacuci floare in relation to the offence of intellectual forgery as set out in article 289 of the criminal code, and the forensic reports included in the file, [the court] authorises that a home search (percheziție domiciliară) be performed at the suspect’s place of residence, [the suspect being] cacuci floare, daughter of ..., born on ..., in oradea, ..., in the bihor district.16.  the prosecutor’s notes in the search report produced on that occasion at the place of residence of the first applicant state that the first applicant was asked to surrender the items used to commit the alleged offence of intellectual forgery, namely the computer, the printer, and the documents on which the second expert report was based (articles 96-99 of the rccp, see paragraph 45 below).17.  the applicants argued that, while the copy of the search report handed to them at that moment had made no mention of the manner in which the seized items had been sealed, the copy in the criminal file contained supplementary information on page 4, mentioning that the objects had been put in a sealed cardboard box labelled mai (the ministry of internal affairs) 15980.24.  on 24 november 2005 the head prosecutor of the prosecutor’s office attached to the district court of oradea dismissed the first applicant’s claims, finding that the complaint against the search measure itself was inadmissible, given the lack of specific legal provisions allowing for such an appeal, while the complaint concerning the carrying out of the search was ill-founded.41.  the first applicant filed several criminal complaints against the relevant prosecutors and police officers who had requested and carried out the search of 21 october 2005 with various domestic authorities (the romanian senate, the high council of the judiciary and the ministry of internal affairs), accusing them of abuse of office for carrying out the search in breach of articles 100-111 of the rccp (see paragraph 46 below).
aikos provides the possibility of searching information about professions, qualifications, studies and study programmes, educational and science institutions and rules of admission... aikos allows users to submit a question to a consultant and to receive a reply ... the information provided in the central part of the aikos website under the sections ‘i wish to learn’, ‘i wish to study’, ‘i wish to improve my qualifications’ reflects only the current and most pertinent information relevant to the current academic year and is aimed at those who wish to enter university, vocational school, or a secondary school, or who wish to improve their qualifications.the latter information on the aikos website is renewed monthly...” 8.  on 28 june 2006 the applicant wrote to the pravieniškės correctional home authorities, noting the reply by the ministry and asking to be granted internet access to a website “where there was information from the ministry about studies, as well as to [the applicant’s] email accounts hosted on the internet sites <www.one.lt> and <www.yahoo.com>”.10.  the prison governor also informed the applicant that the request to have internet access could not be granted because at that time none of the legislation allowed the prisoners to use the internet or to have a mailbox.14.  in their written response to the court, the pravieniškės correctional home authorities noted that, although prisoners had a right to address requests and complaints to the state authorities under article 100 of the code of the execution of sentences (see paragraph 29 below), this meant correspondence by regular post and not via electronic communication.15.  the prisons department also asked the court to dismiss the applicant’s complaint, arguing that although article 96 of the code of the execution of sentences permitted prisoners to use computers (see paragraph 29 below), this did not encompass the right to internet use.
especially during the hot days of summer the situation could have been described as inhuman and humiliating, because he had been forced to satisfy his physiological needs together with other prisoners along the fences of the yard, in the same place where they were supposed to walk and breathe fresh air.the prison authorities noted on the applicant’s request that in fact he had been allowed to take water with him during his daily exercise and he had also been able to go to his cell in order to satisfy his physiological needs during this time.they further noted “at the moment renovation works are under way in the yards.” 10.  on 16 july 2008 the post-sentencing judge in arad prison rejected a complaint on the same matter lodged by the applicant.12.  in a final judgment of 28 october 2008 the arad district court found that the applicant had indeed been deprived of access to a toilet and drinking water during daily exercise, and that this was in breach of article 48 of law 275/2006, which regulates prisoners’ right to daily exercise.in view of the evidence before it, the court allowed the applicant’s complaint and ordered the arad prison authorities to ensure the applicant’s right to daily exercise in a yard provided with sanitary facilities and drinking water.
it further informed the applicant company that the lorry had been seized in accordance with section 220 of the criminal procedure act read in conjunction with section 186(5) of the criminal code and that no decision could be made on the return or confiscation of the lorry until a decision on the merits had been issued.it held that the legislative framework provided for mandatory confiscation in cases of drug-related criminal offences since the nature of their commission, their magnitude and the dangerous consequences thereof called for the extension of coercive measures to persons who were not the perpetrators of the criminal offence, irrespective of whether or not the owners of the vehicle knew what the perpetrator had been transporting.according to the constitutional court, drug-related criminal offences sanctioned under section 186 of the criminal code represented a great evil and an extremely high degree of threat not only from the perspective of the individual, but also from the perspective of society as a whole; the purpose of the impugned measure was to prevent the commission of such criminal offences in the future and thus to protect important legal values in society, such as health and life – especially of young people.the constitutional court stressed that the nature of the criminal offences in question, the manner in which they were committed and their consequences justified the interference with the ownership rights of all owners of the means of transport used for drug-trafficking, regardless of their potential involvement in the criminal activities at issue, adding that a different regulation governing the confiscation of goods would diminish considerably the possibilities for effectively preventing the criminal offences in question.15.  balancing the general interests in question with the property rights of the applicant company, the constitutional court held that the measure complained of did not amount to an excessive interference despite the fact that the applicant company had had no effective possibility for preventing the misuse of its property for criminal purposes and had not participated in the commission of the criminal offence.
on 3 june 2008 the court of first instance, acting on the basis of article 78 of the code of civil procedure (hereinafter, “the ccp” – see paragraph 15 below), ordered information concerning the proceedings to be published in a daily newspaper called 24 hours.9.  it appears from the case file that the custody and guardianship authority, which represented the interests of the child in the above proceedings, made its own attempts to contact the applicant.in conclusions submitted to the tbilisi city court, the authority noted that during its visit to the applicant’s registered address it had learnt from neighbours that he had sold the house in 2003 and left for moscow.the court ruled, with reference to articles 71 § 3 and 422 of the ccp (see paragraphs 15 and 17 below), that the applicant had been duly informed about the proceedings via public notifications in a newspaper and that there was therefore no legal basis to set the impugned decisions aside.it noted that the applicant had been registered at the address where the summonses had been sent and that for the purposes of the proceedings the courts had been justified in using that very address.
police captain t. submitted that the decision to arrest the applicant had been taken on the basis of “operative” information received on 10 january 2010 that the applicant was in possession of firearms and ammunition and that he was the leader of a group of young people of ingush ethnic origin who disturbed peace in the town and provoked tension between ingush and ossetian population.he stated that the policemen had stopped the applicant in the street, and had then put him in the car and taken him to the police station, where they had searched him and found a grenade.the medical expert documented the following injuries: “a bruise near the upper edge of the right shoulder blade measuring 4.5 by 4 cm ...[;] similar bruises on the rear surface of the chest at the level of the sixth to ninth ribs measuring 10 by 8 cm and on the rear surface of the chest at the level of the tenth to eleventh ribs measuring 8 by 6.5 cm; [bruises] near the sixth to eighth vertebrae measuring 8 by 1.5 cm”.the prosecutor found as follows: “the investigative actions were conducted in violation of [the rules of criminal procedure] and the proceedings should be discontinued in view of the following: the case file contains no information as regards the reasons for the [applicant’s] arrest; [the applicant] was not searched at the place of his arrest ...; instead, the search was carried out at [the police station]; in contravention of [the rules of criminal procedure], ... the taking of the [applicant’s] fingerprints was not documented ... ; the case file contains no evidentiary material as regards the examination of the grenade or the detection and recovery of the fingerprints; accordingly the findings set out in the forensic dactyloscopic expert report must be regarded as inadmissible evidence ... .” 15.  on 19 february 2007 the deputy municipal prosecutor opened a criminal investigation into the applicant’s unlawful arrest and detention at the police station.18.  on 12 january 2015 the deputy regional prosecutor studied the evidence in the applicant’s case file and identified the following defects in the investigation: (1) the investigating authorities had failed to complete all the necessary actions in order to clarify the facts in connection with the alleged ill-treatment; (2) no findings had been made as regards the existence of the applicant’s injuries; (3) the contradictions in the statements made by the forensic medical expert and the applicant had not been reconciled; (4) the investigating authorities had failed to question the forensic medical expert and the forensic expert who conducted a dactyloscopic examination; (5) the investigating authorities had failed to establish whether the police had conducted an internal inquiry in response to the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment; (6) the investigating authorities had not conducted a face‑to-face confrontation between the police officers and the applicant in order to reconcile the contradictions in their statements; (7) the investigating authorities had failed to identify the persons who had been present at the police station when the applicant was searched.
and her boyfriend were invited to the clejani mayor’s office, where they met with the deputy mayor, a representative of the department for social assistance from the mayor’s office, the chief police from the clejani police office, and two police officers from the neighbouring commune of bulbucata and the town mihăileşti.as the boyfriend had a criminal record of violent crime and as the boacă family members were known to the police for being violent, the local police team was reinforced by a team of five members of the r.i.s.the prosecutor in charge took statements from the eight police officers who had participated in the events: the chief of police, the two local policemen and the five members of the rapid intervention squad.24.  according to the police’s mission statement and the report of the operation, the police officers had been equipped with firearms and tear gas and had used them in self-defence.the prosecutor also concluded that the injury sustained by the sixth applicant was not consistent with a gunshot wound and was thus irrelevant for the purposes of the investigation.
the demonstrators blocked the entrance of a car park adjacent to the parliament building by chaining themselves to each other and to concrete columns situated next to the entrance.7.  following the incident the budapest main police department opened criminal investigations against twenty-nine persons, including the applicants, on charges of violation of personal liberty under article 175(1) of act no.9.  on 29 march 2012 the budapest main police department discontinued the criminal investigation against the twenty-nine suspects, pursuant to article 190 §§ 1 (e) and 2 of the code on criminal procedure on the grounds that they had been granted amnesty.10.  on 6 september 2012 six of the applicants, ms bende, ms kalocsai, ms ámon, ms székelyné rákosi, mr moldován and mr gajárszki, lodged a constitutional complaint requesting the constitutional court to declare sections 1, 2 and 4 of the amnesty act unconstitutional as infringing the right to their reputation and the principle of presumption of innocence.the constitutional court pointed out that the language employed by the act could not be interpreted as establishing that the applicants had indeed committed the offence.
some of the applicants had had to comply with additional requirements laid down in the agreement between the united states of america and the russian federation regarding cooperation in adoption of children (“bilateral agreement on adoption”) upon its entry into force on 1 november 2012. they then applied to the competent russian authorities who, except in those cases where the adoption proceedings had focussed on a particular child from the outset, provided them with information concerning the children who were available for adoption.pursuant to article 17 of the bilateral agreement on adoption, it should have remained in force until one year from the date on which one of the states parties informed the other party of its intention to terminate the agreement, and this move therefore caused confusion regarding the validity of the agreement and the outcome of the pending adoption cases involving prospective adoptive parents from the united states.21.  on 10 january 2013 news agencies including the bbc and ria novosti reported that the russian president’s press secretary had stated that the bilateral agreement on adoption was still in force on that date and that it would remain valid until early january 2014. on the afternoon of the same day the russian ministry of external affairs posted a comment on its website stating that russia had not merely suspended the bilateral agreement on adoption but had terminated it, and that a communication to this effect had been handed over to the united states embassy in moscow on 1 january 2013.27.  on 2 july 2013 the parliamentary assembly of the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce) adopted a resolution on intercountry adoption in which it called on member states “to recognize the foundational bond between prospective adoptive parents and the child and to honor and protect these nascent families” and urged them “to resolve differences, disputes, and controversies related to intercountry adoptions in a positive and humanitarian spirit” so as “to avoid any general, indiscriminate disruption of intercountry adoptions already in progress that could jeopardize the best interests of the child, harm the nascent family, or deter prospective adoptive parents from pursuing an intercountry adoption” see paragraph 301 below).248.  on 12 november 2012 the st. petersburg city court stayed the proceedings on the grounds that certain documents were not enclosed and instructed the us applicants to submit them by 11 december 2012. at the us applicants’ request, the deadline was subsequently extended to 15 january 2013. according to the us applicants, after the entry into force of the bilateral agreement on adoption, they had to comply with additional requirements introduced by the agreement.
21.  when the third applicant told her employer that she wished to return to the philippines, she was told that she would have to pay the cost of the flight and the agency fees, which her employer knew she could not afford at that point.24.  the night following the incident – that is, two or three days after their arrival in austria – the applicants left the hotel with the help of n., who had organised a car to pick them up in a side street near the hotel and take them to a “safe place”.there is no reason for further prosecution if, on the basis of the ... results of the investigation, a conviction is no more likely than an acquittal ... according to article 64 § 1 (4) of the cc, if austrian interests have been harmed by the offence or the perpetrator cannot be extradited, austrian criminal laws apply independently of the criminal laws of the place where the crime was committed, for example in relation to the offence of kidnapping for ransom under article 104a of the cc.owing to the fact that the applicants spent approximately three days in vienna, the conditions regarding the fulfilment of the elements of the crime under article 104a § 1 (2) of the cc have not been met, since the relevant acts relating to the exploitation of labour must be committed over a longer period of time; therefore, the commission of the offence in austria is ruled out.the applicants’ argument that the elements of the crime under article 104a of the cc had also been fulfilled in austria therefore fails, and the plea that the alleged criminal actions against them by their employers in dubai ... would lead to an obligation on the part of austria under international law is likewise not convincing.
7.  on 13 march 2007 the applicant was interviewed on the telephone by m.z., a journalist from rzeczpospolita, a national daily newspaper, on the subject of lustration of journalists which at that time was widely commented on in the media.9.  on 26 and 27 march 2007 a legal representative of a.m., an editor-in chief of gazeta wyborcza, one of the biggest daily newspapers, sent a legal letter to the applicant, offering to settle the issue amicably provided that the applicant published a relevant apology.the court did not take into consideration two private expert opinions on language analysis provided by the applicant and a.m. the court further stressed that while the parties’ representatives had questioned these opinions they had not asked for a court-appointed expert on linguistics nor requested that their experts be heard by the court as witnesses.17.  on the applicant’s appeal, on 15 october 2008 the warsaw court of appeal (sąd apelacyjny) upheld the first-instance judgment and ordered the applicant to pay pln 1,170 (approximately eur 278) in court fees for the proceedings before the second-instance court.22.  during the proceedings against the applicant, several thousand people signed a letter titled ‘defending freedom of expression’, which was handed to the ombudsman on 21 november 2008. they argued that a publicist had a right to express this type of opinion about other participants in a public debate.
5.  on 26 august 1998 the wels regional court (landesgericht) issued an arrest warrant against the applicant, as he was suspected, inter alia, of having committed aggravated fraud on a commercial basis in several countries together with numerous other suspects, and of being a member of a criminal organization.8.  on 13 january 2003 the applicant filed a request under section 91 of the courts act (gerichtsorganisationsgesetz) for the setting of a time-limit (fristsetzungsantrag) in order to accelerate the proceedings.13.  on 4 september 2008, following the issuance of the above‑mentioned strike-out decision, the applicant requested the wels regional court to discontinue the proceedings against him, or in the alternative to set a new date for a hearing as soon as possible.the applicant failed to attend because he had fallen ill. during that hearing, the public prosecutor lodged the request that another expert opinion be obtained, to which the wels regional court acceded.16.  on 1 september 2011, 17 november 2011 and 13 december 2012, the applicant filed further requests under section 91 of the courts act, which were dismissed by the linz court of appeal on 7 november 2011, 1 february 2012 and 2 january 2013 respectively.

the expert was asked in particular to reply to the question of whether the phrase “two agents and one their fierce defender”, in the context of the case, constituted a statement of fact or an opinion.while the applicant in his statement had not specified who in his opinion had been “an agent” and who “their fierce defender”, from the nature of the publication and taking into account the readers’ general knowledge it was clear that it was the plaintiff who was considered to be “the fierce defender of two agents”.it noted that in the context of that debate the phrase that someone was “a fierce defender of ... agents” suggested that that person had defended them, justified their actions and searched for a way to absolve them from any responsibility in the eyes of the public.the court further held that the sum of pln 1,000 to be paid to charity was symbolic and that pln 10,000 was a more appropriate sum, given the circumstances of the case – especially considering that it was not an excessive burden for the applicant.after the applicant failed to comply with that order, on 10 june 2011 the warsaw district court allowed a.m. to publish the apology in rzeczpospolita in the applicant’s name and ordered him to cover the fee for its publication in the amount of pln 23,124 (approximately eur 5,505).
20.  on 26 march 2013 the lugoj prosecutor’s office noted the victim’s family’s requests for a murder investigation and decided to refer the case to the timiş prosecutor’s office, which had the competence to investigate the allegations.40.  the report also held that according to i.m.r.’s statement the time which had elapsed between the moment he had checked (s-a asigurat) that the first applicant’s husband was at a safe distance from the tree and the moment the victim was hit by the said tree was very short.56.  the prosecutor also noted that even though the victims of the incident had later declared that they knew the identity of the perpetrators, at the time of the incident and after the police had arrived they had been unable to identify the perpetrators and had stated that they did not know their identity.it held that the investigating authorities had heard evidence from the victims, the suspects and the witnesses in the case and had correctly established the facts of the case.2.  the denunciation for abuse of office lodged against the police officers involved in the investigation concerning the death of the first applicant’s husband 68.  on 8 february 2013 ldiacr initiated proceedings before the timiş prosecutor’s office denouncing an abuse of office (abuz în serviciu) allegedly committed by the local police officers involved in the investigation of the first applicant’s husband’s death.
the parents also agreed that the father would collect the child from her mother’s home in kazanlak, bulgaria, and would take her back to the same location; the father could spend his time with the child at one of two specific addresses in bulgaria, located in koprivshtitsa and srednogorovo respectively.7.  on 18 march 2009 the first applicant brought a claim under article 72 of the 1985 family code before the varna district court, seeking the court’s authorisation for the child to leave the country in the absence of her father’s agreement.importantly, the first applicant had not sought in court a change in the regime for contact between the child and the father with a view to her and the child moving their primary place of residence to the united kingdom.however, as this was not the case, in view of the young age of the child, the court found that it was not in her interest for her mother to be granted permission to take her abroad at any time, for an unlimited duration and to unknown destinations throughout the period before the child reached majority.16.  on 18 december 2011, a little over a year after the final judgment of the supreme court of cassation on the issue of the child’s travel, the first applicant and her partner, who was still living in the uk, married in bulgaria.
it was established during the relevant investigation that the applicant’s son had been taken to the sbu’s premises at the applicant’s request and had not been arrested or detained and had been returned to his relatives as soon as the decision to arrest the applicant had been taken; and that the applicant had raised no complaints during his son’s stay at the sbu.the fact that the applicant’s son had remained in the sbu’s premises for about twenty-four hours after the applicant’s initial arrest, without his relatives having been informed of his whereabouts and with no medical assistance provided in view of the stress he had been under, was listed among the violations referred to by the court.48.  during the proceedings in his criminal case before the court of appeal and the supreme court the applicant and his wife repeatedly requested, referring to the separate ruling of 25 october 2005 by the district court (see paragraph 45 above), that measures be taken to bring the respective officers to trial for the unlawful detention of their son.49.  on 22 december 2008, in its judgment upholding the applicant’s conviction, the court of appeal observed that the complaint related to the unlawful detention of the applicant’s son had been considered by the prosecutor’s office and no corpus delicti under criminal law had been found on the part of the sbu officers.79.  on 15 august 2004 the applicant’s wife asked the prosecutor’s office to provide truthful information about the applicant’s state of health and stated that adequate medical assistance could not be provided to the applicant in the sizo in view of the absence of the relevant medical specialists at the detention facility.
it requested the annulment of the planning decision; in the alternative that it be stipulated in the planning decision that the applicant company be compensated for the interference in its quarrying operation; or in the alternative that it be stipulated in the planning decision that the land of thuringia was obliged to take over the quarrying operation, the remaining land and the mining licence.it changed the wording that “the amount and scale of the compensation [had to] be agreed upon in a private-law agreement” and “if the parties d[id] not reach an agreement, the expropriation authorities [would] determine the compensation in separate compensation proceedings” into the wording that “the seizure [inanspruchnahme] entitle[d] to compensation” and that “the amount and scale of the compensation w[ould] not be decided on in the planning decision”.13.  on 26 march 2008 the administrative office of thuringia land (landesverwaltungsamt) expropriated the part of the applicant company’s land on which the motorway had been built and decided that the federal government should compensate the applicant company by a payment of some eur 865,000. that amount included about eur 22,800 in compensation for the land value as farmland and some of the costs of the relocation of the plant (new infrastructure, transport of machinery and opening the ground of the new mine).15.  on 18 february 2009 the meiningen regional court dismissed the applicant company’s request and – on the request of the federal government – reduced the amount of compensation to about eur 22,800. it held that only the value of the expropriated land – not taking into account that there existed a limestone deposit underneath it – had to be compensated.mentioning that for reasons of proportionality the planning decision might in a case like the present one call for a formal expropriation of the mining rights with corresponding compensation, it found that such a claim – as well as the issue of disproportionality as such – should have been raised in the proceedings concerning the planning decision before the federal administrative court (see paragraph 10).
8.  the applicants alleged that the prison had held 2,400 prisoners while it had been designed to accommodate 700. the applicants had been detained in wings a, b, d and e in various cells which all had measured 9 sq.13.  the government asserted that irrespective of the number of prisoners in each cell, which in any case had not been constant, prisoners had had access to a large yard daily from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to thirty minutes before sunset.the prison had had a central heating system and hot water had been available on a daily basis in the morning and in the afternoon.in addition, they had had the opportunity to take up one of the 640 jobs available, to take part in educational courses or to attend the “second chance” school.17.  all the detainees had had access to the prison’s infirmary which had been open twenty-four hours per day and there had been twenty doctors of different specialities, including two psychiatrists who had offered consultations to the prisoners.
the applications were worded as follows: “in the course of the proceedings, the need has arisen to carry out a search and seizure in [the applicants’ house, the first applicant’s car, and the photography studio], since the available evidence gives probable cause to suspect that [these places] contain items of relevance to the case – items relating to the subject matter of the case.i therefore ... ask for permission for an investigator to search [these places] with a view to finding and seizing the above-mentioned items.” 11.  between 3.30 and 4 p.m. the same day, a judge of the plovdiv district court, sitting in private, issued three warrants authorising the searches and seizures in the following terms: “the submitted materials make it clear that it is necessary to carry out a search and seizure in [these places] with a view to finding the items set out in the application[s] ‑ relating to the forging of identity documents and others, relevant to the case which is the subject matter of the criminal proceedings.” 12.  at about 9 a.m. the following day, 14 march 2014, just as the first applicant was leaving his house, he was intercepted by three police officers, two in plain clothes and one in uniform.the officers then put the first applicant in a police car and drove to the photography studio, very close to the corner of a busy pedestrian street in the centre of plovdiv, which they searched between 11.35 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. they again refused to allow the first applicant to acquaint himself with the search warrant.he stated that he agreed to provide access to the account for the needs of the investigation, so that the police could subject the messages in it relating to the turkish national to examination by an expert, and then gave his password.21.  on 6 june 2014 the investigator asked the same expert to copy the data from the laptop computer seized in the applicants’ house to an external hard drive and to inspect the three desktop computers seized in the photography studio for the presence of software or files which could be used for the forging of documents.
the last-instance court found in particular that the buyer had not acquired ownership of the shop and that, in any event, the applicant was protected by the privatisation act in that she could not be evicted from the shop pending the examination of her privatisation proposal.23.  she specified that she sought pecuniary damages in respect of: the rent she had had to pay between january 1998, when her request to privatise the shop should have been granted, and february 2006, when the shop had been demolished; those of her belongings that had been destroyed together with the shop; the loss of income resulting from the impossibility of collecting rent from a company with which she had concluded a contract on 17 january 2006 in respect of part of the shop; and the impossibility of increasing her investment by buying the plot on which the shop stood and by building upon it.24.  in addition, the applicant sought non-pecuniary damages in respect of the intense stress and emotional suffering that had led her to fall into a lasting and severe depression, which had been the result of the shop’s demolition and of the failure of the municipal council to sell it to her, despite the final judgments.26.  as to the merits, the court held that the claim for pecuniary damages was unjustified and also that there was no causal link between the municipal council’s refusal to privatise the shop and the applicant’s claims for loss of financial opportunity as a result of the impossibility of buying the land and building on it.38.  the supreme administrative court found her request admissible but rejected it as unjustified (неоснователна) in a final decision of 2 june 2015. on 25 november 2015 the bailiff invited the applicant to voluntarily comply with the final judgment of 3 december 2014, indicating that failure to pay the sum due would result in the forced sale of items of the applicant’s personal movable and immovable property.
it rejected the applicant’s contentions that the dismissal proposal had not been based on the real facts and that the chairman of the court had been biased against him and had interfered with the applicant’s professional activity.as to the proceedings in parliament, the hac found that the applicant’s right to participate in the parliamentary procedure had not been respected and declared the parliamentary resolution in respect of the applicant unlawful.the hcj noted that the applicant had on several occasions taken leave without obtaining the relevant approval from the court administration; he had failed to appear in the office without valid reasons; he had prevented his judicial assistant from performing his functions; he had refused to take cases for consideration; and he had not complied with the requirement to submit income-tax declarations.the hcj noted that the applicant had on several occasions taken leave without obtaining the relevant approval from the court administration; he had failed to appear in the office without valid reason; he had refused to take cases for consideration; he had delayed the examination of criminal cases; he had prevented his judicial assistant from performing his functions; and he had not complied with the requirement to submit income-tax declarations.the hcj noted that the applicant had on several occasions taken leave without obtaining the relevant approval from the court administration; he had failed to appear in the office without valid reason; he had refused to take cases for consideration; he had shown disrespect to the officers of the court registry; and he had not complied with the requirement to submit income-tax declarations.
the applicant told the doctors that her hypothyroidism resulted from the treatment with a radiopharmaceutical, j-131 (radioactive iodine), which dr s. had administered to her between march 1995 and july 1996. the doctors from the endocrinology centre recorded in the applicant’s medical file that the applicant suffered from hypothyroidism resulting from the treatment with radiopharmaceuticals.8.  in may and june 1998 the applicant complained to the lviv department of the ministry of health (“the department”) that the radiopharmaceuticals administered to her by dr s. had seriously damaged her health.10.  in july 1998 the applicant complained to the lviv prosecutor’s office that dr s. had treated her with j-131, that the treatment had been inadequate and that it had destroyed her thyroid.a number of decisions were taken rejecting the applicant’s complaint principally for the reason that, according to the forensic reports, it was impossible to establish the cause of the destruction of the applicant’s thyroid.the most recent decision in that regard was taken by the frankivskyy district court in lviv on 18 january 2016, by which it instructed the police to carry out further investigation in the applicant’s case, finding inter alia that the police had failed to examine all pertinent evidence and that an additional forensic examination was necessary.
12.  on 3 february 2010 the applicant received notice from the kaunas district court that the civil case and both his and d.l.’s appeals had been referred to the kaunas regional court, and he was asked to submit a reply to d.l.’s appeal within twenty days.13.  subsequently the applicant asked the kaunas regional court to proceed with the examination of the case in his absence – the applicant stated that he had presented all his arguments in his appeal and in his reply to d.l.’s appeal and had nothing else to add.the kaunas regional court also found that since his mother’s death the applicant had been using the car previously owned by her and on that basis the court concluded that the applicant had de facto accepted the inheritance (see paragraph 21 below).submitted that although the court in previous proceedings had acknowledged that the applicant had de facto accepted the inheritance (see paragraph 14 above), the applicant had not formally completed that acceptance and his sister had remained the official heir to their mother’s estate.the court found that the total value of the applicant’s mother’s estate (the car and the savings) had been ltl 6,860 (approximately eur 1,987), and that the applicant’s sister had spent ltl 7,817 (approximately eur 2,264) on their mother’s funeral.

7.  on 17 december 2002 the novo mesto district court, at the request of the police, issued a warrant to search the applicant’s premises on the basis of a suspicion that he had exchanged the chassis numbers of two cars in order to be able to register the second one, bought in austria, and smuggle it through the state border without paying customs duties.he alleged that the decisions on the unlawfulness of the search warrant and the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings had to be considered as new evidence which could influence the outcome of the proceedings.they also argued that the customs proceedings had not taken an unduly long time as they had lasted only from 27 may 2003 to 7 july 2003. the applicant argued, inter alia, that the order which had led to the seizure of the car had been unlawful and that it therefore gave rise to a liability on the part of the state for any damage resulting from it.the court noted that it was not bound by the findings of the criminal court that the seizure had been unlawful, but, basing its conclusion on its own assessment, it concluded that the seizure had been ordered on the basis of gossip and newspaper article and that all the other information relating to the alleged offences had been obtained on the basis of the unwarranted seizure.34.  the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (revizija), challenging the conclusions of the court in respect of the break in the causal link and arguing that the loss had already been incurred before the issue of customs duties had arose.
6.  on 26 january 2006 the niš municipal court ordered pik niš (the debtor), a company predominantly comprised of socially-owned capital, as the end user of that land, to pay the applicants specified amounts on account of the compensation for the land in question.7.  on 25 october 2006 and 1 february 2007 respectively, upon the applicants’ request to that effect, the niš municipal court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor to pay the applicants the enforcement costs.13.  on 17 march 2011, 4 april 2012 and 23 may 2012, respectively, the constitutional court found a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time in respect of all applicants, except mr tomislav đorđević.however, the court did not award the applicants any damages, merely stating that the applicants “had not claimed non-pecuniary damages”.14.  the constitutional court dismissed the appeal in respect of one applicant, mr tomislav đorđević, since he had failed to request enforcement of the judgment in question.
on the basis of the foregoing and in accordance with section 16(5) of the federal law on civil status and article 51(4) of the family code, i hereby give my consent for the above couple to be entered in the birth record and the birth certificate as parents of the child to whom i have given birth...” 15.  in the days following the child’s birth, the first applicant moved with him into a flat in moscow, rented by her in advance.21.  on 5 may 2011 the prosecutor’s office opened criminal proceedings against the applicants, who were suspected of “misrepresentation of civil status” within the meaning of article 567 of the criminal code, of “use of falsified documents” within the meaning of article 489 of the criminal code and of the offence set out in section 72 of the adoption act, since they had brought the child to italy in breach of the procedure provided for by the provisions on international adoption contained therein (see paragraph 67 below).mr campanelli and mrs paradiso requested primarily that the court award them temporary care of the child with a view to subsequent adoption; in the alternative, they requested the suspension of these proceedings pending the criminal classification of the offences, and the suspension of the above-mentioned criminal proceedings against them and of the proceedings before the campobasso court of appeal to challenge the refusal to register the child’s birth certificate; again in the alternative, they requested the suspension of these proceedings under section 14 of law no.in particular, the court noted the following facts: the first applicant had spread a rumour that she was pregnant; she had gone to the italian consulate in moscow and implied that she was the natural mother; she had subsequently admitted that the child had been born to a surrogate mother; she had stated to the carabinieri on 25 may 2011 that the second applicant was the biological father, which had been disproved by the dna tests; she had thus made false statements; she had been very vague as to the identity of the genetic mother; the documents concerning the surrogate motherhood stated that the two applicants had been seen by the russian doctors, which did not correspond to the fact that the second applicant had not travelled to russia; the documents relating to the birth did not give any precise date.by way of introduction, the court of appeal dismissed the objection raised by the guardian to the effect that the applicants did not have standing to bring an action before that court; it acknowledged that the applicants had standing to bring proceedings in that they were referred to as the “parents” in the birth certificate that they wished to have entered in the civil-status register.
18.  on 9 december 2002, in the course of the applicant’s study of the case file, which at the material time consisted of two volumes, the district court found that the applicant was abusing this right by requesting simultaneous familiarisation with the court minutes and the audio and video recordings, and challenging the lawfulness of the minutes of the court hearings and how the case file was processed.26.  according to the applicant, at several points during the trial and re‑trial he requested the summoning of certain witnesses (in particular, c., the investigator; an unidentified policeman who on 24 august 2001 escorted the applicant to the police station; a., the policeman in whose office on 25 august 2001 his bloodstained shirt had allegedly been produced; s., the policeman who signed the protocol on the examination and seizure of the aforementioned evidence), but to no avail.the court referred to the reports of 25 and 29 august 2001 stating that, according to them, the applicant’s injuries had been caused on “23-24 august 2001” and noted that, according to the applicant’s own explanation to the medical expert, these injuries had been caused by the fight with d. (see paragraph 40 below); (c)  the testimonies of those who discovered d.’s body; (d)  the testimonies by the applicant’s colleagues, according to which the hoe had been at their workplace on 23 august 2001, before the murder, but could no longer be found there on 24 august 2001, after the murder; (e)  the statement by l., the police officer who interrogated the applicant in august 2001, that the applicant had pleaded guilty but refused to confirm his confession in writing; (f)  the forensic cytological examination report of 7 september 2001 according to which the blood stain on the applicant’s shirt “could be from any person, including d.” and was not identified as being the applicant’s blood; (g)  the post-mortem examination report of 15 september 2001 according to which the injuries to d. could have been caused either by a blunt instrument or by a hoe; (h)  the forensic expert report of 9 october 2001 concluding that it was not possible to establish the features of the instrument with which d. was attacked but “the probability that the injuries to d. [had been] caused by the hoe under examination [could] not be excluded”; (i)  the additional forensic expert report of 9 july 2004 stating that blood would not have gushed out of d.’s injuries during the assault but could have spattered onto surrounding objects.42.  according to the government, the applicant had not complained to the prosecutor of ill-treatment by the police and the investigator until 15 december 2001. in his description of ill-treatment the applicant stated that on 24 august 2001 l. had exerted pressure under the applicant’s ear with his finger, had slapped him with the palm of his hand on his forehead and had hit him on the nose with a passport; at the same time another police officer had pushed the applicant in the back with his hand, and had punched him below the knee and on his head.in particular, in reaching her conclusions in the latter decision the prosecutor took into account: -  the conclusions in the forensic report of 25 august 2001 (see paragraph 40 above), namely that the injuries had been caused before the applicant first came into contact with the police; -  the report of 12 june 2002 from the itt (the police detention facility) that in the period from 15 to 18 september 2001 no bodily injuries had been found on the applicant; -  the report of 29 december 2001 from the sizo (the remand prison), according to which the applicant did not complain and had no bodily injuries upon arrival; -  the explanations offered by the police officers and the investigator against whose actions the applicant had complained.
the objection was based on the grounds that the jurmala city court had wrongly applied the land reform legislation, that it had not been competent to hear the case and that it had not taken into consideration the important evidence of order no.16.  on 1 august 2001, the senate of the supreme court upheld the prosecutor general’s objection, quashed the judgment of the jurmala city court and ordered a new adjudication of the case.the senate noted, inter alia, that the appellate court had ignored the applicant’s argument that it was necessary to decide on a reversal of the execution of the judgment of the jurmala city court.it upheld the ministry of finance’s application to recognise the state’s ownership rights over the contested property and to delete the entry in the jurmala land register on the applicant’s title.the supreme court noted that the applicant had obtained the property unlawfully (prettiesiski) because the jurmala city court had exceeded the limits of its competence when adopting the judgment of 2 february 2001. the ministry of finance, being the lawful owner of the contested property, could file a property claim against any person who had taken possession of its property.

[the arresting officer] was a law-enforcement officer and thus the court has no doubts that his actions concerning [the applicant’s] escorting to the police station and then to the department of the interior were within the scope of his functional responsibilities.” 23.  the applicant appealed, arguing as follows.before the beginning of the search [the applicant] made no request for counsel while having had access to the search order ... under [articles 38 and 182 of the ccrp] it is within the investigator’s purview to decide whether a search is opportune and, if so, to issue the relevant order, except for a search of residential premises.it is also up to the investigator to decide which documents or other evidence are important for the case ... [the applicant’s] allegation that the office ... was his ‘abode’ is unsubstantiated, within the meaning of article 139 of the ccrp ... thus there was no legal requirement to obtain a court order for the search.” 46.  on 29 november 2006, following an appeal by the applicant, the belgorod regional court upheld the judgment, endorsing its reasoning.

the applicant asked the court to order that he be able to see his son twice a month from 10 a.m. on friday to 7 p.m. on sunday; one day at christmas or easter from 10 a.m. to 10 a.m. the next day; and three weeks in the summer holidays and one week in the winter holidays.on 23 november 2007 the celle district court in germany ordered that the child be returned to poland to the father or a guardian because under the hague convention the mother had abducted the child.retained joint custody of j. the court established that in the period up to 2008 the bond between the applicant and the child had weakened considerably owing to a lack of contact between them.34.  on 28 may 2013 the bydgoszcz regional court quashed the interim order of 19 february 2013. the court ordered the parties to attend counselling and to submit attendance certificates to the court every two months.the court further emphasised the need to modify the way the father and the child communicated without suspending contact between them, which would lead to breaking the bond between them.
the relevant parts of the decision read as follows: “on the basis of evidence submitted with the constitutional complaint and the reply of the parliament of the republic of macedonia, the court has established the following facts: ... there was an increased interest on the part of the public and the media in (the parliamentary proceedings) given the importance of the state budget and the fact that before the proceedings, namely in november and december, there had been long, intense and sometimes tense discussions between opposition and ruling party mps regarding the draft budget ... on 24 december 2012 ... before the plenary debate of parliament started, there was a disturbance by a group of mps who started destroying technical equipment in the chamber.the court considers that the removal of [the applicants] from the gallery amounted to an interference with their freedom to carry out their professional duties and to inform the public about events that were of considerable interest for the citizens of the republic of macedonia – the events in parliament regarding the approval of the state budget for 2013, in which the public had significant interest in following and being informed about.the actions of the security officers constitute standard practice for these and similar situations in case of endangerment, i.e. protection of media representatives while reporting from places of crises, demonstrations and other potentially dangerous events ... the fact that the journalists had been present within and outside the parliament building since the morning of 24 december 2012, and were reporting on the events as they occurred, confirms that, notwithstanding the indications and expectations that discussion about the approval of the budget would be tense, they were allowed access to the parliament building and the gallery in order to carry out their function and inform the public about the debate.... i think that it is of crucial importance that the constitutional court clarifies and explains the reasonableness of the assessment of the situation and the reason for which the journalists were removed from the gallery ... in order to establish the facts and assess the need for [their] removal ... it was necessary to determine the reason which prompted the security officers to remove them, despite the undisputed fact that all the incidents and disorder in the parliament chamber were physically and clearly isolated and distant from [the gallery].it is absurd that [such a removal] was carried out ‘for the safety of journalists’, when it is clear that they were in their seats and were completely passive; they did not participate in the events at all, but only observed ... it is a fact that the journalists did not contribute to the conflictual situation in any respect [not disputed by parliament]; they did not disturb order in the parliament building; they were in direct contact neither with the speaker or the mps, nor with the events outside the parliament building ... besides, it is clear that the journalists themselves did not feel threatened; so they did not seek and expect any protection.”
7.  on 14 january 2009 the applicant applied to the memmingen district court for the right to administer her father’s estate, asserting the incapacity of her father’s wife to protect the applicant’s inheritance due to a grave illness, and notified the district court of her inheritance claims.the regional court referred to the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act of 19 august 1969 (see paragraph 15 below) and to a decision of the federal constitutional court of 8 december 1976, in which the provision had been found to be in conformity with the basic law (see paragraph 16 below).11.  on 8 march 2009 the applicant appealed to the munich court of appeal, arguing that the application of the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act would discriminate against her and breach her inheritance rights and was therefore not in conformity with the basic law.12.  in a decision of 14 may 2009 the munich court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal on the grounds that it was bound by the decisions of the federal constitutional court in which the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act had been found to be in conformity with the basic law.as the applicant doubted the validity of the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act, which had previously been declared valid by the federal constitutional court, she had been obliged to give further reasons, which she had failed to do.
9, the sixth to ninth applicants and the eleventh and twelfth applicants were placed in cell no.9.  the applicants pointed out that the toilets in the cells were not partitioned off from the rest of the cells, and there was no hot water.filthiness of the cells, in addition to overcrowding, exposed the inmates to contagious diseases and created various psychological problems, in respect of which no medical treatment was provided.10.  the applicants stressed that inmates were not sufficiently separated according to their health conditions or according to whether they were in pre-trial detention or serving prison sentences, as was required by the penal code.15.  in respect of prison overcrowding, the government argued that the prison had accommodated 142 inmates at the time the applicants had lodged their application with the court, only slightly exceeding its capacity of 120 detainees.
20.  on 10 may 2010 the applicant’s counsel sent an e-mail to the advocate general (advocaat-generaal) to the court of appeal, with a copy to the president of the criminal division, restating his request for the applicant to be brought to the netherlands in advance of the hearing of the court of appeal and announced his intention to oppose resumption of the hearing if this were not done.its reasoning, reflected in the official record of its hearing, was as follows: “if a request is made to adjourn the hearing on the merits all relevant interests should be weighed, including the right of the accused to be present, the interest of not only the accused but also of society in a speedy determination of the charges and the interest of a proper organisation of the judicial system.fourthly, the court of appeal had failed to respond to the suggestion made by the defence to await the outcome of the proceedings in norway, after which the applicant could return of his own accord or the execution of any norwegian sentence could be taken care of in the netherlands, thus enabling the applicant’s attendance.28.  the advocate general (advocaat-generaal) to the supreme court submitted an advisory opinion (conclusie) in which he expressed the view that, in the light of article 281 taken together with article 415 of the code of criminal procedure (wetboek van strafvordering), the court of appeal had been called upon to decide whether the interest of the examination of the case at the hearing required the hearing to be adjourned.12.  contrary to the argument made by the drafter of the point of appeal, the court of appeal was under no obligation to consider the seriousness of the charges against the applicant in deciding on the request for an adjournment but it was at liberty to consider the presence of counsel authorised to conduct the defence and the length of the criminal proceedings.
12.  on 19 april 2005 the ministry quashed the decision of the steiermark regional governor and remitted it back to the first instance authority on the grounds that the applicant company had failed to provide sufficient information in order to assess a possible negative impact on the spring.26.  on 17 april 2007 the ministry rejected the requested dredging licence on the grounds that the applicant company had failed to submit all the requested documents.27.  on 26 april 2007 the administrative court closed the proceedings on the applicant company’s complaint about the administration’s failure to decide (see paragraph 19 above) and ordered the reimbursement of the costs related to this complaint.40.  on 12 january 2010 the ministry requested the bad radkersburg municipality and the bad radkersburg spring company (h. p.’s appeal had meanwhile been considered to be withdrawn) to submit written observations on the documents recently transmitted by the applicant company.45.  on 18 november 2010 the administrative court closed the proceedings on the applicant company’s second complaint about the administration’s failure to decide (see paragraph 35 above) and ordered the reimbursement of the costs related to this complaint.
15.  according to the applicant’s own statement before the court, on her return from the hospital two police officers presented her with the warrant to appear and took her to the dna’s offices even though she had informed them of her medical condition and had shown them her medical documents.when she asked the prosecutor to mention in her statement that she was being interviewed while under treatment, in poor health and after a trip to the hospital, she was told that she would not be allowed to leave the premises for the rest of the evening.according to the statement, she informed them that she had been monitored for endometrial hyperplasia, that she agreed with the information recorded by the medical staff and that the information in respect of her health was complete and accurate.30.  according to the applicant’s own statement before the court, she informed the detention centre medical service of her pregnancy and treatment and asked them to give her the medication and vitamins that evening and the following morning as recommended.34.  on 28 january 2016 the detention centre coordination department informed the government that the applicant had arrived at 8.20 p.m. on 6 november 2014. according to the rules in force at the time, detainees were served dinner from 5.30 to 6 p.m. there were no written rules setting out the procedure which needed to be followed for detainees arriving later than 6 p.m. and the applicant had not asked for a meal.
6.  in november 2002, the prosecutor’s office attached to the timişoara court of appeal committed the applicant and his co-accused for trial for drug trafficking and the case was registered with the arad county court.the court based his conviction on the report drafted by the undercover agents after the applicant had been caught red-handed, as well as a search report and the statements given by the applicant and his co-accused.he requested the appellate court to impose a milder sentence and accordingly, to overturn the decision of the timisoara court of appeal and to uphold the judgment of the arad county court by which he had been convicted to only three years’ imprisonment.17.  the government contended that the records held by the prison authorities concerning the cells’ size and their occupancy rate were no longer available as the archives for that period had been destroyed, pursuant to the domestic law.however, as regards the general detention conditions in jilava prison the government submitted that every cell had been equipped with two squat toilets connected to the water network and separated from the rest of the room by a wall.
8.  on the same date the prosecutor from the organised crime department authorised the use of x as undercover police agent in order to determine the facts of the case, identify the offenders and obtain evidence.13.  the applicant’s lawyer argued before the court that the applicant had in fact been incited by x to act as an intermediary in the drug deal and requested that x be called to give evidence, along with two witnesses in the applicant’s defence.and the in-court testimonies given by the applicant, the co‑defendants and x. the court considered that the applicant’s allegations that he had been incited by x were clearly disproved by the above‑mentioned evidence taken as a whole.the court considered that the applicant had not been incited by x since it was apparent from the evidence in the file that he had called the officer on several occasions and had planned the meeting of 19 july 2007 (see paragraph 10 above).in addition, the information collected by x and the applicant’s active participation in the crime in question were supported not only by the police reports, but also by transcripts of the telephone conversations that the applicant had with c.a.o.
7.  on 14 july 2005 e. sought to restart the time-limit for the enforcement of the judgment dated 23 february 2000, arguing that it had been unable to initiate enforcement proceedings within the three-year statutory period because the bailiff had lost the original writ of enforcement.14.  on 22 april 2009 the ciocana district court dismissed the application for revision, finding that the applicant had requested the plot of land in 2005. her husband’s death had not qualified as a new circumstance because the local administration had been aware of that matter at the time of the proceedings.15.  on 24 june 2009, in the applicant’s absence, the chișinău court of appeal allowed the appeal, quashed the decision of 22 april 2009 and upheld the application for revision.18.  on 25 october 2012 the chișinău court of appeal, by a final judgment, found the length of the proceedings to have been excessive, which it attributed to the acts of the authorities.the court dismissed the remainder of the claim, noting that the applicant had failed to substantiate alleged costs for renting alternative accommodation and finding that no compensation for the land should be awarded because the judgment acknowledging her entitlement to that land had been quashed.
6.  on 5 december 2013 criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicant by the public prosecutor of the department of investigation and prosecution (departamento de investigação e ação penal) in sintra in respect of allegations of him having committed the crimes of coercion (coação), aggravated attacks upon the physical integrity of a person (ofensas à integridade física qualificada), rape (violação), and failing to assist a person in danger (omissão de auxílio).10.  on 19 march 2015 the applicant lodged an appeal with the lisbon court of appeal, challenging the lawfulness of the decision remanding him in custody, pursuant to article 219 § 1 of the code of criminal procedure.13.  on 29 april 2015 the investigating judge ordered that the applicant be notified of the public prosecutor’s observations and that the file be sent to the lisbon court of appeal.the judge rapporteur’s analysis of the appeal was afterwards put on the agenda for discussion by the judge rapporteur and the two other judges.17.  on 24 june 2015 the applicant lodged a habeas corpus application with the supreme court, claiming that the lack of analysis of his appeal in respect of the lawfulness of the decision placing him in pre-trial detention had violated article 5 § 4 of the convention.
14.  one week later the following entry was made in his medical file: “we, the undersigned, have made the present record to state that mr s. grabarchuk has refused art.” (the document was signed by the head of the medical unit, an infectious diseases doctor and a general practitioner).on the same day doctors at the medical unit made the following entry in the medical file: “we, the undersigned, have made the present record to state that mr s. grabarchuk has refused anti-tuberculosis treatment.” (the signatures are illegible).16.  the applicant submitted that after the medical unit doctors had erred in the diagnosis of pyelonephritis, her husband had lost faith in them and had therefore refused to follow their recommendations, including those pertaining to the antiretroviral therapy.24.  shortly after the death of her husband the applicant complained to the orenburg regional office of the federal service for the execution of sentences about the refusal on 14 may 2010 to transfer him to a civilian hospital.30.  on 17 january 2011 the novotroitsk town court, upon an application by the applicant, overruled the decision of 27 october 2011 on account of the failure of the investigating authorities to address the applicant’s allegation of deliberate indifference to the patient’s medical condition on the part of the head of the medical unit.
9.  according to the information provided by the national prison administration and forwarded to the court by the government, the applicant was held in the following cells: - cells e 4.3, e 6.2. and e 6.7., all measuring 33.33 sq.10.  the government did not provide any information concerning either the exact number of detainees who had occupied the cells or the time spent by the applicant in each of the above-mentioned cells.19.  the government contended that the medical certificate on his disability had been issued only on 29 october 2013 (see paragraph 13 above) because the applicant had failed to submit the documents requested by the special commission for disabled persons.23.  the complaints were joined and examined together by the post‑sentencing judge on 14 june 2013. the judge noted that the prison doctor’s opinion was that the applicant was not entitled to a personal assistant.the applicant produced a handwritten statement by c.f., dated 20 june 2013, in which the latter had stated that he had not helped the applicant because the prison authorities had refused to consider his activity as a personal care assistant as work that should be remunerated.
the penalty of administrative removal is also necessary for the sake of national security, to avoid the spread of various infectious diseases such as hiv, tuberculosis and leprosy, and to ensure the optimal balance of labour resources and in order to support, as a matter of priority, the employment of russian nationals ...” 10.  in the same judgment the district court ordered that, while awaiting enforcement of the administrative removal, the applicant be placed in a special detention facility for foreigners in the town of makhachkala.the appeal court held as follows: “article 18.8 § 1.1 of the cao provides for the following penalties: a fine of between 2,000 and 5,000 roubles with administrative removal from russia ... [the applicant] has committed a violation of the regime applicable for the presence of foreigners in russia, by way of omitting after 7 october 2012 to leave russia ... the court dismisses [the applicant’s] argument relating to his family life in russia ... the marriage with ms b. was concluded on 28 april 2014, which was a long time after the commission of the offence by [the applicant] ... the administrative offence record did not contain any information relating to his family life in russia.however, even after this, he did not seek asylum, while neglecting the real possibility of his future deportation from russia ... the ministry of foreign affairs points out that syrian nationals who return to their homeland or who are deported or expelled there may arrive in damascus and then proceed to other regions that are controlled by governmental forces.” 19.  on 14 october 2015 the applicant, assisted by lawyer m., sought judicial review of the refusal of temporary asylum under the code of administrative procedure (“the cap”) and asked the leninskiy district court of makhachkala to put in place an interim measure by way of suspending enforcement of the judgment of 26 february 2015. on 16 october 2015 the court refused to deal with the case, concluding that it had to be lodged before a court with jurisdiction in the area of the applicant’s current “place of residence”; his stay in the detention centre did not qualify as a place of residence.the court held that the applicant was at risk of violence which was no more intensive than for other people living in syria: “the grounds for granting temporary asylum on account of humanitarian considerations include the following situations: a grave medical condition for which the foreigner will not receive the requisite medical care in the country of nationality, thus putting his or her life at risk; a real threat to his or her life or liberty on account of hunger, epidemics, emergency situations of environmental or industrial origin or on account of an internal or international conflict that encompasses the entire territory of the state of nationality; a real threat of being subjected to torture or another cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the country of nationality.his appeal was dismissed by the moscow city court on 8 june 2016. the appeal court held as follows: “the first-instance court considered that the applicant did not fall within the scope of the notion of “refugee” under the refugees act ... in view of the applicant’s failure to submit specific facts disclosing that in the event of his removal to syria he would be exposed to a real threat to his security ... or that he was persecuted in this country, the appeal court agrees with the first-instance court ... the appeal court also notes that the applicant arrived in russia in 2011 but only sought temporary asylum in 2015.”
the final court award in the applicant’s favour consisted of a sum in compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage sustained (equivalent to 30,462 euros (eur)), to be paid once the judgment became final, and of a monthly allowance (equivalent of eur 207), to be paid until the end of the applicant’s life.10.  on 17 june 2006 the commercial court of the republic of bashkortostan (hereinafter “the commercial court”) granted the applicant’s application for aggregation as a lump sum («капитализация») of the amounts of the monthly allowance awarded by the judgment of 29 november 2005, in accordance with section 135 § 1 of the insolvency act (see paragraph 20 below).11.  since the award remained unenforced, on 11 january 2009 the district court granted a prior application by the applicant to have the amount of the monthly allowance index-linked, and raised it to eur 909. the judgment became final on 22 january 2009.13.  on 15 july 2009 the commercial court accepted the applicant’s claim for transfer of the transport company’s debt to the russian federation, as provided for in section  135 § 3 of the insolvency act (see paragraph 21 below).the parent company was a unitary company with the right of “economic control” over the assets allocated to it by the state committee on construction, architecture and transport of the republic of bashkortostan.

m dates of stay 29 6.  the parties disagreed on the design capacity of the cells and the actual number of inmates.7.  the first applicant, relying on three hand-written statements from his co-detainees, submitted that cell 49 had contained three two-tier bunk beds with metal sheets welded to beds on the upper and lower levels to create additional sleeping places.8.  the government submitted that the number of prisoners in the cells had not exceeded the occupancy limit.11.  according to the government, the second applicant was held in cells 80, 90, 92, 98 and 103. the actual number of inmates detained in the cells did not exceed their designed capacity.the government submitted selected pages from registration logs, some of which appears to contain erasures and alterations in the fields showing the number of inmates in cell 90. on some pages the listed total number of inmates is ten less than the number produced by adding up the population of individual cells.

on 11 august 2005, following his appeal, the navy court of appeal upheld the decision of the first-instance court.8.  on 17 october 2005 the higher administrative court of ukraine allowed the applicant a time-limit until 1 november 2005 to rectify the procedural shortcomings of his appeal on points of law.the relevant part of the decision reads as follows: “the [present] appeal on points of law does not comply with the requirements laid down in article 213 of the code of administrative justice, as the applicant failed to pay the court fee and to provide a number of copies of the appeal on points of law corresponding to the number of persons involved in the proceedings ... [the court decides to] set for gavrilov v.v.that if he fails to rectify the above shortcomings, in accordance with article 108 of the code of administrative justice, the appeal on points of law will be returned to the applicant and considered not submitted.” 9.  the applicant dispatched his rectified appeal on points of law by registered post on 24 october 2005. it appears that the applicant resubmitted several copies of the appeal dated 30 august 2005 accompanied, in accordance with the instructions of the higher administrative court of ukraine, with proof of payment of the court fee.failed to rectify the shortcomings indicated in the ruling [of 17 october 2005] within the time-limit granted by the court, the appeal on points of law should, therefore, be considered as not submitted and be returned to the applicant.” 12.  on 10 november 2005 the higher administrative court of ukraine adopted another decision, the relevant part of which read as follows: “when the higher administrative court of ukraine received the [applicant’s] appeal on points of law, it was established that the above appeal on points of law had been lodged outside the statutory time-limit for lodging such an appeal as provided for by article 212 of the code of administrative justice ... in particular the challenged ruling of the navy court of appeal was delivered on 11 august 2005, the appeal on points of law was dated 30 august 2005, and, according to the postmark, was dispatched to the higher administrative court of ukraine on 24 october 2005, the applicant failed to submit a request for an extension of the time-limit for lodging an appeal on points of law, his appeal on points of law should therefore be left without examination.”
lodged a civil action claiming the 0.6021-ha plot of land allocated to the applicant and seeking annulment of the land-ownership certificate issued to him on 4 june 2003. it noted, in particular, that the berdychiv district administration had already annulled its own decision of 17 january 2003, which had served as the basis for the issuance of the land-ownership certificate to the applicant.it noted that the disputed plot had been allocated to the applicant mistakenly on the basis of the decision of 17 january 2003, without due regard to the fact that in 1999 this very plot had already been expropriated and transferred to u.c.c.20.  in february 2007 the applicant added to his cassation appeal, informing the supreme court of ukraine that on 12 february 2007 the regional court had annulled the decision of 22 july 2005 and revalidated the decision of 17 january 2003, on the basis of which he had obtained his land-ownership certificate (see paragraph 23 below).it noted, in particular, that parliament had ordered the expropriation of kh.’s land, while the land, whose boundaries had been in dispute, had belonged to v.g., which had been a separate legal entity on the date of the decision at issue.25.  after several rounds of proceedings, on 14 september 2011 the berdychiv court found that the decision of 22 july 2005 had been unlawful in so far as it had related to the plots of land of the individuals who had instituted the proceedings.
relying on article 132 paragraph 1 of the housing code (see paragraph 35 below), the plaintiffs argued that because the first applicant had resigned from military service, he and his family were obliged to vacate the accommodation, which had been provided to them on a temporary basis in connection with the first applicant’s military service.13.  during the trial, the applicants alleged that the first applicant had been “cantoned” or quartered in the disputed accommodation as a military serviceman, a fact which triggered a special duty on the part of the state to keep providing him with housing upon his resignation from the armed forces.17.  according to the applicants, the court of appeal did not notify them of the date and time of the hearing of 29 january 2004. they further stated that on two occasions – in april 2004 and sometime in 2005 (the applicants could not recall the exact dates) – the first applicant had visited the court to enquire about the status of the proceedings, but did not receive any meaningful response.24.  on 13 december 2005 the applicants lodged a request with the supreme court of ukraine for leave to appeal in cassation out of time against the rulings of 11 november 2003 and 29 january 2004, on the grounds that they had not been notified of the latter ruling until 29 november 2005. they argued, in particular, that the court of appeal had failed, in breach of the requirements of the applicable law, to notify them of the date and time of the appeal hearing and the decision taken in their case.25.  on 20 december 2005 the supreme court rejected the applicants’ request for leave to appeal out of time, noting that, in accordance with article 325 § 2 of the new code of civil procedure of 2004 such leave could only be granted within one year of pronouncement of the decision subject to appeal (see paragraph 34 below).
however, they could not provide any factual information as to whether the applicant had been present at the police station on the date in question as the time-limit for keeping the relevant documents had expired and the admissions register of the police station had been destroyed.the relevant parts of the arrest reports read as follows: “investigator ... k., on 5.05.2005 at 18:00 in accordance with article 115 of the criminal procedure code of ukraine detained, on suspicion of the commission of a crime: dolganin valeriy nikolayevich ... brought before the investigator ... or actually arrested: on 5.05.2005 ...” 11.  he was taken for a forensic medical examination, which was conducted in the presence of a police officer.37.  on 8 august 2006 and 5 september 2006 the applicant’s mother and the applicant, respectively, again complained to the district prosecutor’s office about the applicant’s ill-treatment by the police on 3 may 2005. in letters dated 18 september 2006 the prosecutor informed the applicant and his mother that a similar complaint from the applicant had already been examined and declared ill-founded on 2 march 2006.it was noted that the applicant and the police officers needed to be questioned in detail about the circumstances in which the alleged ill-treatment had taken place, including the exact place and time of the ill-treatment, the persons involved and their individual role in the alleged incident.in the judgment of 13 april 2007, by which the applicant was convicted, his ill‑treatment complaint was dismissed as unsubstantiated mainly on the basis of the forensic medical report of 5 may 2005 and the results of the inquiries conducted by prosecutors in respect of the applicant’s complaints.
6.  in 1991 the applicant asked the authorities to return to her some buildings and a plot of land owned by her father before nationalisation in 1940. in november 1995 the applicant wrote to the authorities to ask why the buildings and the land had been sold to other persons in 1992. the authorities replied in december 1995 that the applicant had given an incorrect address for the buildings when submitting her request for her property rights to be restored and the buildings in question had already been privatised.12.  on 10 june 2004, the applicant lodged a claim with the kaunas district court, requesting the annulment of the valuation of the buildings made by the centre of registers on 14 july 2003 (see paragraph 10 above) and the appointment of independent experts to assess the market value of the buildings because she considered that the value set for the buildings was too low.her requests were granted and the examination of the case was postponed until 9 may 2006. on 19 april 2006 the applicant lodged a modified claim in which, inter alia, she asked the kaunas regional administrative court to (i) annul the assessment of the value of the buildings made by the centre of registers, (ii) to annul that part of the order of the authorities for her property rights to be restored in which the value of the buildings was indicated and (iii) to renew the time-limit for lodging a complaint.subsequently the court proceedings were resumed, and on 21 september 2007 the kaunas regional administrative court held that the new assessment of value of the buildings was more accurate and decided to annul the assessment of value of 14 july 2003 by the centre of registers and that part of the decision of 9 october 2003 to restore the applicant’s property rights in which the value of the buildings was set at ltl 36,000 (approximately eur 10,426) (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above).the court concluded that the decision of the authorities of 9 october 2003 was still in force and that the question of the amount of the compensation was a matter for the public authorities and that it was not within the court’s power to give instructions to them.
12.  the applicants immediately complained about the abduction to various authorities, including the sunzhenskiy district prosecutor’s office (hereinafter “the prosecutor’s office”), the ministry of the interior (hereinafter “the police”) and the federal security service (федеральная служба безопасности (фсб)) (hereinafter “the fss”).27.  on an unspecified date in june or july 2006 the first applicant again complained to the prosecutor general, the head of the federal security service and the minister of the interior, stating that her family was being threatened by law-enforcement agents, who had harassed her and her relatives and that her son mr ibragim kushtov had been abducted in order to make him confess to crimes he had not committed.38.  on 30 january 2006 the investigators also questioned ms s.s. whose statement about the abduction was similar to that of ms r.i. in addition, she stated that the abductors, a group of at least five people, had been in uniforms, armed with machine guns and that judging by the position of the vaz-02107 car, it had been blocked in by the abductors’ two nivas.he had been summoned through the lawyer to the fss for questioning on 7 february 2006, to officer s. g. earlier that day s.g. had told the applicant that the fss was not involved in the abduction and that mr ibragim kushtov might have been detained on the premises of the police’s department for the fight against organised crime in khankala in chechnya.the applicants appealed to the supreme court of ingushetia (“the supreme court”) stating, amongst other things, that the investigators had failed to take various basic steps, such as questioning the police officers who had been on duty at the checkpoints on the roads leading to and from the crime scene, or requesting information from the fss and the police about agents who had been using niva cars on the date of the abduction.
6.  pursuant to the articles of incorporation, the founders were in charge of setting up an editorial board and determining the editorial policy; in the case of disagreement on the editorial policy the matter was to be resolved by a meeting of the founders’ representatives.7.  during the election campaign for the state duma, the lower chamber of parliament, on 2 december 2007, the applicant organisation expressed to the electoral committee of the orel region (see paragraph 41 below) its intention to accept proposals for publication for a fee and, as required by law, published the fees applicable to the publications on behalf of political parties (30,000 roubles (rub) per page).8.  apart from the publications mentioned above, on 7 and 14 november 2007 the applicant organisation’s newspaper also published, in the same weekly issues, two articles written by its staff correspondent, ms o. both articles were critical of mr stroyev, the then governor of the orel region and the former chairman of the federation council (the upper chamber of the russian parliament).13.  the official of the electoral committee compiled an administrative offence record against the applicant organisation, referring to the legislative provisions defining “campaigning” (see paragraph 40 below): “[the applicant organisation] has committed an administrative offence: publications on 7 and 14 november 2007 containing elements of election campaigning as defined in sections 10 and 55 § 1(6) of the state duma deputies elections act” ... liability for this offence is prescribed under: article 5.5 § 1 of the cao.” 14.  the case was then submitted to a justice of the peace.this would go against the constitutional guarantees of freedom of information and freedom of expression ... it is incumbent on the courts and other authorities to establish that there is a campaigning aim in each case ... thus, in view of the above statement of principle, the impugned legislative provisions cannot be considered to have violated the applicant organisation’s rights or freedoms ... establishment of the specific circumstances (whether or not the information provided by the applicant organisation concerned the electoral campaign rather than the reporting on the candidate’s professional activity as a governor) are beyond of the constitutional court’s competence ...”
29.  the town court’s decision of 31 july 2008 was initially set aside after an appeal by the prosecutor before the mariy el supreme court on 22 september 2008 for the reasons that on 15 august 2008 the criminal case against the applicant had been transferred for trial to the mariy el supreme court, that those proceedings were pending, and that it was open for the applicant to raise in the course of his trial complaints concerning his ill‑treatment.369-o of 18 november 2004, 156‑o of 25 march 2004, 500-o of 20 december 2005, 576-o-p of 19 may 2009, 1107-o-o of 13 october 2009 and 79-o of 16 march 2006. the mariy el supreme court stressed that in the course of a trial the task of a court was to examine the admissibility of evidence and other questions relevant to the merits of the case; such questions were factually and legally different from those examined in a review under article 125 of the ccrp.in particular, the applicant’s allegations of ill‑treatment had not been refuted; the circumstances in which he had received the injuries had not been established; the existence of the pit at the place of the applicant’s alleged ill-treatment had not been assessed; the allegations of electric shocks had not been verified; and the forensic medical expert had not been given all the necessary information (including the applicant’s version of the cause of the injuries).the prosecutor further noted that (i) the ivs records, which recorded at what times in the period from 7 until 9 september 2007 the applicant had been taken from the detention facility for the purpose of carrying out investigative actions and when he had been brought back, had not been assessed, and (ii) the documents indicating the grounds for the applicant’s absence from the detention facility were missing.39.  the applicant lodged an appeal with the russian supreme court against the judgment, complaining, inter alia, that the mariy el supreme court should not have examined as evidence the witness statements made by a., o. and s. he further complained that his sentence in respect of the murder had been unfair because, in contrast with the decision on the punishment for the robbery, his disclosure of the whereabouts of a.k.’s body had not been taken into account as a mitigating circumstance.
he argued that there had been a case of mistaken identity and that the alleged breaches of the terms of his special supervision concerned a person who shared his first name and surname but had been born in 1973. he further submitted that no criminal charges had been brought against him since a conviction dating back to 2002. although he had been convicted of absconding in 2004, that was not a decisive factor for the imposition of the measure in question.15.  the court observed, in particular: “the subject was issued with a ‘verbal warning for public safety’ on 18 september 2006, but this did nothing to improve his conduct; he continued to associate regularly with key figures in the local underworld (malavita locale) and carried on committing offences (see statement of charges pending: breach of supervision order on 25 april 2007; breach of supervision order on 29 april 2007).” 16.  the district court further held: “the findings of the investigation (see documents and certificates in the case file) show that mr angelo de tommaso remains personally involved in various criminal activities, among which the greatest threat to public order and safety is posed by offences against property and weapon- and drug-related offences.to ensure more thorough monitoring, it is therefore necessary to order not only special police supervision for a period of two years (a measure deemed reasonable on account of the subject’s character as clearly emerges from the acts attributed to him), but also compulsory residence for the same duration.” 17.  the preventive measure imposed the following obligations on the applicant: –  to report once a week to the police authority responsible for his supervision; –  to start looking for work within a month; –  to live in casamassima and not to change his place of residence; –  to lead an honest and law-abiding life and not give cause for suspicion; –  not to associate with persons who had a criminal record and who were subject to preventive or security measures; –  not to return home later than 10 p.m. or to leave home before 6 a.m., except in case of necessity and only after giving notice to the authorities in good time; –  not to keep or carry weapons; –  not to go to bars, nightclubs, amusement arcades or brothels and not to attend public meetings; –  not to use mobile phones or radio communication devices; and –  to have with him at all times the document setting out his obligations (carta precettiva), and to present it to the police authority on request.it observed in particular: “while it is true that the application of special supervision is compatible with the status of detention, which relates solely to the time of the execution of the sentence, the assessment of dangerousness is inevitably even more significant in the case of an individual who has fully served his sentence and has committed no further offences after his release, as is the case for mr de tommaso.the government’s partial unilateral declaration 28.  on 7 april 2015 the government submitted a letter containing a friendly-settlement proposal in respect of the part of the application concerning the complaint of a lack of a public hearing in the bari district court and court of appeal (article 6 § 1 of the convention), as well as a unilateral declaration under rule 62a of the rules of court in relation to that complaint.
they argued that the applicant had been held in seventeen cells of the same type during his detention in the sizo, and it was unclear which of them he was referring to in his complaint to the court.the government provided no details as to the exact size of the cells, but stated that an inspection carried out at some point after the complaint had been communicated to the government had determined that each cell in the sizo allowed each detainee at least 2.5 sq.18.  the government could not provide any information about the dates and conditions of the applicant’s transport to and from the court hearings, because the time-limit for keeping the relevant documents had expired and the records had been destroyed.71.  referring to, inter alia, the medical evidence he had submitted to the court, the applicant alleged that his health had seriously deteriorated while he was in detention, in particular owing to the poor conditions of his detention, combined with the absence of medical care.these submissions appear to be based on the information contained in a reply to the applicant’s complaint regarding the lack of medical treatment in prison, which was given by a prosecutor in 2008. the government asserted that the relevant medical documents had been studied by prosecutors during their inquiries into the applicant’s complaints regarding the lack of medical assistance, and no proof had been found.
in the process of examination of the appeal, the court of appeal did not question the suspects, victims or witnesses again, but only cited some of the statements they had made before the first-instance court.in his submissions to the supreme court of justice the applicant’s lawyer argued, inter alia, that the applicant’s conviction had been contrary to article 6 § 1 of the convention because the court of appeal had neither examined the case file nor heard him, the victims or witnesses in person.14.  on 25 february 2011 the supreme court of justice dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law, finding, inter alia, that in the circumstances of the case it had not been necessary for the court of appeal to examine the witnesses again because their statements had not been contested by the defendants.as to the objection that the court of appeal had not heard the defendants or the victims in person, the supreme court considered that asking them whether they agreed with the appeal had been sufficient to ensure the fairness of the proceedings.15.  one of the members of the panel of judges of the supreme court wrote a dissenting opinion, expressing the view that a new examination of the victims and witnesses before the court of appeal had been imperative to ensure the fairness of the proceedings and concluding that the proceedings had not been fair within the meaning of article 6 of the convention.
11.  on 8 july 2004 the applicant filed an objection (vorstellung) against the municipal council’s decision of 18 june 2004. on 24 june 2005 the upper austria regional government (hereinafter, “the regional government”) quashed the municipal council’s decision in the part rejecting the applicant’s request for suspensive effect of 15 june 2004 (see paragraph 9 above) and referred it back to the lower instance for a new decision.12.  on 5 august 2005 the applicant complained to the constitutional court (verfassungsgerichtshof) against the regional government’s decision of 24 june 2005. on 25 september 2006 the constitutional court declined to examine the complaint and on 15 november 2006, at the applicant’s request, transferred the complaint to the administrative court (verwaltungsgerichtshof).consequently, on 5 september 2008 the administrative court closed the proceedings regarding the applicant’s complaint of 4 january 2008 about the municipal council’s failure to decide (see paragraph 17 above) and awarded costs to the applicant.on 29 november 2010 the constitutional court declined to examine the complaint and on 27 january 2011, at the applicant’s request, transferred the complaint to the administrative court.22.  on 25 january 2012 the administrative court dismissed the complaint against the regional government’s decision of 9 february 2009. the decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 9 february 2012.
it further issued an order for the applicant’s house to be searched and pursuant to section 412 code of criminal procedure (hereinafter, the “ccp”) the criminal proceedings were interrupted until the submission of the final report.11.  on 22 april 2003 the vienna local tax authority informed the vienna regional criminal court that they had completed the investigations and had sent their findings to another vienna local tax authority which would assess the facts and prepare the final report.18.  on 27 july 2009 the vienna regional criminal court dismissed the applicant’s second request for the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings stating that the persecution of the applicant did not seem inadmissible.the court noted however that the tax authority had still not submitted its final report even though it had concluded the investigations in 2003 and had already issued new tax assessment orders in 2004. it further noted that the measures set by the court and the public prosecutor to accelerate the proceedings were insufficient and amounted to a violation of article 6 § 1 of the convention because the administrative proceedings had already ended on 4 december 2007 (when the applicant’s appeal had been dismissed by the ifp).28.  following the termination of the criminal proceedings, the official liability proceedings were apparently continued and were still pending at the date of the last information available to the court (22 july 2016).
9.  the applicant submitted that her husband, who was an alcoholic, had already been physically abusing her for a long time when, on 2 june 2012, she requested the intervention of the police after she and her daughter had been assaulted by a.t. 10.  when the police arrived, a.t. had left the family home.26.  the government gave a different interpretation of that letter, saying that, as the applicant had not first been referred to the udine social services, which cared for victims of violence in the context of another project, called “zero tolerance”, the latter could not pay the association’s expenses.32.  on 30 may 2013 the udine public prosecutor’s office, after noting, firstly, that the applicant, who had been interviewed in april, had mitigated her allegations against her husband saying that he had not threatened her with a knife and that she had been misunderstood by an employee from the shelter where she had taken refuge and, secondly, that no other violent episode had occurred, asked the investigating judge to close the complaint lodged against a.t. for ill-treatment of family members.he considered that the course of the events was unclear and that, with regard to the alleged ill-treatment, the offence had not been made out because, since the applicant had complained only about the incident of august 2012, the criterion of repeated episodes of violence was not satisfied.34.  with regard to the complaint of threats aggravated by the use of a weapon, the investigating judge noted that the applicant’s statements were contradictory and that in the report drawn up by the hospital there was no reference to knife injuries.
17.  at the time the administrative court noted that the interim measure under rule 39 of the rules of court, was awaiting a lead judgment on returns to mogadishu (sufi and elmi, cited above) and it was clear that there would be no resolution of the applicant’s claim - and the interim measure would therefore not be lifted - before that judgment was handed down.in addition, he submitted that the detention was vitiated by two public law errors that bore directly on the decision to detain: first, following the indication of the interim measure the secretary of state had failed to take any reasonable steps to acquaint herself with when it might be lifted; and secondly, that the detention was maintained on the unlawful basis that the applicant could reduce the length of time in detention by withdrawing his application to the court and returning voluntarily to somalia.20.  in its judgment of 20 october 2012, the court of appeal conducted an extensive review of the circumstances of the case, in particular the fact that the applicant’s appeal against deportation as well as three separate bail applications had been rejected by immigration judges, as well as the broader context in relation to the on-going litigation concerning removals to somalia both before the domestic courts and tribunals as well as before this court (see §§ 28 to 32).it also took account of correspondence between the government and the registry of this court from which it was clear that from april 2009 the court would be granting a fact-insensitive rule 39 measure to any applicant with removal directions to mogadishu as well as the separate correspondence between the government and this court concerning the progress of sufi and elmi, cited above and the linked domestic case law.likewise, the court of appeal saw no reason to differ from the overall conclusion of the lower court on the lawfulness of the applicant’s detention at the time of the application for revocation of the deportation order or after the judgment in sufi and elmi was handed down.
14.  at the court hearing held on the same day the prosecutor, in the light of the above-mentioned information from the police, asked the court to read out the pre-trial statements of the witnesses who had failed to appear, including all those listed in the table below.witness evidence element of the applicant company’s operations to which witness evidence related witnesses, their status and the tenor of their evidence corroborating evidence, if any, in respect of the relevant element of the applicant’s operations was a confrontation conducted during the investigation?20.  on 4 march 2005 the donetsk regional court of appeal held that the applicant should be deemed to have been convicted for smuggling under the criminal code of 1960 instead of the criminal code of 2001. otherwise, the court of appeal upheld the findings of the first-instance court and the applicant’s sentence.23.  on 6 september 2005 the supreme court heard the case in the presence of the prosecutor but in the absence of the applicant and his lawyer, who were not informed of the date and time of the hearing.the supreme court dismissed the appeals lodged by the applicant and his lawyer, stating that the lower courts’ findings had been based on a substantial amount of evidence, in particular the statements of the directors of the seller companies made at the investigation stage.
according to the applicant, his lawyer immediately indicated to the investigator that, under the code of criminal procedure, the applicant had to be provided with the possibility to talk with him in private before the questioning, with a view to defining the legal defence strategy.19.  the forensic expert, questioned in the court hearings, had confirmed the conclusions of the examination that the shots had been fired from some distance and not from close range, as the applicant had suggested, given that traces of metals and gunpowder, typically found following close-range shots, had not been found on the victim.21.  on 28 november 2006 the supreme court, in the presence of the applicant and his two lawyers, upheld the decision of the court of appeal, noting the aggregate of evidence against the applicant.29.  the government could not provide any information about the number of inmates in the cells at the relevant time or regarding the conditions of the floor, walls and linen because the compulsory period for keeping the relevant documents had expired and the records had been destroyed.30.  they stated that the general detention conditions in the sizo had been satisfactory and in compliance with the domestic standards: all the cells had had windows and had been equipped with sufficient artificial lighting; the applicant had been provided with adequate nutrition in accordance with the applicable standards.
1.  the case originated in application against ukraine lodged with the court under article 34 of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms (“the convention”) on the date indicated in the appended table.4.  the applicants complained of the excessive length of civil proceedings and of the lack of any effective remedy in domestic law.5.  the court received friendly-settlement declarations under which the first applicant agreed to waive any further claims against ukraine in respect of the facts giving rise to the part of the application concerning her complaints, subject to an undertaking by the government to pay her the amount detailed in the appended table.the payment will constitute the final resolution of this part of the application.
8.  the following year the applicant was examined by a social security medical assessment board (бюро медико-социальной экспертизы) and certified as having the highest-degree disability on the grounds that he had lost the ability to work, to walk without assistance or to look after himself.12.  in the remand prison the applicant was detained in a normal cell block where he allegedly faced great difficulties in his daily routine owing to the lack of special arrangements, in particular when using the squat toilet and shared dormitory shower, which lacked handrails and non-slip flooring.18.  on 1 july 2009 the special medical board, at the request of the penal authorities, issued an advisory report confirming the gravity of the applicant’s disability.23.  on 28 august 2009 the smolninskiy district court of st petersburg dismissed their application, citing the gravity of the applicant’s offence, the fact that he had developed paralysis and epilepsy prior to his arrest and that in detention his condition had remained stable.26.  on 10 june 2010 the tosnenskiy town court dismissed the application for early release on medical grounds, referring to the gravity of the applicant’s offence, the fact that his health status had already been taken into account by the court which sentenced him, and, lastly, to the fact that the applicant’s medical condition had not worsened in detention.
as of 1 april 1996, he was declared to have lost 67% of his capacity to work and was granted a disability pension of 114,880 hungarian forints (huf) per month (approximately 370 euros (eur) at the rate of january 2017).7.  the relevant assessment methodology changed as of 1 january 2008. the applicant’s case was reviewed under the new rules in 2009. without any significant change in his state of health having occurred, he was then found to have lost 50% of his working capacity.as a consequence, his disability pension was terminated and, as of 1 july 2009, he was declared suitable for institutional rehabilitation and granted a monthly rehabilitation allowance in the amount of huf 152,820 (approximately eur 490), minus payroll deductions.the law allowed for one extension of the time-limit, making the maximum deadline for the benefit 30 june 2012. however, under the law, the overall period allowable for rehabilitation could not exceed three years.on 26 may 2014 the kúria rejected his petition for review on the grounds that he had not relied on any particular breach of the law, as required by the code of civil procedure.
however, they testified about a number of other circumstances in relation to the charges, for example similarities in the way the trees had been cut down on the first applicant’s land and on that of the injured party, traces of the transport of trees, the fact that the first applicant had regularly sold wood and that he had also cut down unmarked trees on his own land.the husband of the injured party, m.p., stated that they had found out about the stolen wood six months after the event and that neighbours had told them that the second applicant had been seen in the forest at the time, while another person, i.t., had been seen transporting the wood.the judge found that the applicant had cut down and taken eight oak trees in a forest without the knowledge of its owner and had appropriated wood worth eur 2,028. she ordered him to either deliver to the injured party the same quantity of oak that had been taken from the forest or to pay compensation of eur 2,028. she pronounced a guilty verdict and sentenced him (izrek, hereinafter referred to as “the verdict”) orally.(see paragraph 9 above), which were served on the first applicant’s counsel on 17 august 2010. in her reasoning, the judge relied on the records of the hearings, the transcript of the inspection of the location and other documents in the file.19.  on 6 january and 1 september 2011 respectively, the supreme court dismissed the applicants’ applications for the protection of legality, holding that only the operative part of the judgment, namely the verdict, could have interfered with the rights of the parties, while the purpose of written grounds was to enable a decision to be reviewed by higher instances.
it appears that the basis for this decision was a telegram of 18 april 2008 from the deputy head of the fsin of russia that read as follows: “the primorskiy regional department of the fsin are allowed, until special notice, to send up to thirty convicts per month from remand prisons to the care of the krasnoyarskiy regional department of the fsin pursuant to article 73 § 2 of the ces.” 10.  on 30 september 2008 the primorskiy regional department of the fsin informed ms polyakova that her request for mr r. to be allowed to remain in the facility in the primorskiy region had been refused, and advised the applicant as follows: “... pursuant to article 73 § 2 of the ces and the instruction by the fsin of russia, on 14 september 2008 mr r. was sent to serve the remainder of his sentence in the care of the krasnoyarskiy regional department of the fsin.on 11 april 2012 the fsin submitted their objections to the zamoskvoretskiy district court of moscow, which read, in particular, as follows: “the claimant’s arguments that he is unable to receive visits from his relatives cannot be taken into account, because the possibility of receiving visits from next of kin and relatives is governed by the norms of the russian code on the execution of sentences and is unrelated to the location of any penal facility.” 32.  on 5 june 2012 the zamoskvoretskiy district court of moscow examined the applicant’s complaint under articles 254-5 and 258 of the ccp, and dismissed it with reference to articles 73 and 81 of the ces.the judgment read, in so far as relevant, as follows: “the claimant’s arguments that it is difficult to receive visits from relatives owing to the remoteness of the [place of] the sentence is being served cannot be taken into account by the court, because the possibility of receiving visits is governed by the norms of the russian ces and is unrelated to the location of any penal facility.” 33.  on 14 january 2013 the moscow city court upheld the first-instance judgment.the applicant’s argument related to the difficulties of maintaining his family ties was rejected as follows: “the claimant’s arguments that he cannot receive visits from his relatives does not give grounds for allowing the claims, because the possibility of receiving visits from family members and relatives, receiving correspondence, or using the telephone, are all governed by the norms of the code on execution of sentences and are unrelated to the location of any penal facility.” 41.  the applicant appealed against the judgment and requested that an appeal hearing be held in his presence.42.  on 4 june 2014 the moscow city court held a hearing in the applicant’s absence, which was explained as follows: “under article 167 of the code of civil procedure the appellate collegium deems it possible to examine the case in the absence of the parties to the proceedings; they have been notified of the date and place of the court hearing”.
at the hearing, in reply to a question from the representative of the applicant concerning the actual basis for the applicant’s exclusion and the sixteen-year re-entry ban, the fss’s representatives replied “[t]he actual grounds for the ban cannot be disclosed in the interests of state security, which have priority in the russian federation over the rights of foreign citizens ... what exactly mr kamenov did cannot be disclosed as this information constitutes a state secret ...” 12.  on the same date, 25 july 2014, the regional court upheld the applicant’s exclusion until 2030. in its decision it did not cite any documents submitted by the fss as serving as the basis for the ban, apart from noting that the measure had been imposed on the basis of the report of 14 january 2014 and the relevant internal instructions of the fss.the court further noted that the appropriate procedure had been followed and stated that “mr kamenov’s request that the state body [the fss] that issued the [exclusion] decision be obliged to rescind it cannot be granted as the court [can only verify] the lawfulness of [the procedure of] the taking of such a decision.as to whether the exclusion order amounted to an interference with the applicant’s family life, the court stated that the impugned decision “contained information on the basis of which the fss concluded that the actions of mr kamenov had threatened the national security of the russian federation.13.  the applicant’s representative lodged an appeal against the above decision with the administrative cases chamber of the supreme court of the russian federation (hereinafter “the supreme court”) stating, among other things, that in spite of the fact that he had submitted a signed undertaking of confidentiality to the regional court, he had not been given the chance to familiarise himself with the contents of the fss report of 14 january 2014 and the other documents which had served as the basis for the exclusion and that the actual reasons for that measure remained unknown to the applicant.15.  in reply to the court’s request for the information and documents that had served as the basis for the applicant’s exclusion, the government furnished copies of the courts’ decisions in the applicant’s case and a copy of the records of the hearing on 25 july 2014 by the regional court of the applicant’s appeal.
7.  on 12 october 2006 the first applicant gave birth to a boy, s. 8.  although he no longer lived with the first applicant, and had had no sexual contact with her since 2004, the second applicant nevertheless submitted to the state administration for greater copenhagen (statsforvaltningen hovedstaden) (now the state administration) a declaration, co‑signed by the first applicant, stating that together they would take care of and be responsible for s. the declaration was dated 21 december 2006 and received in mid-january 2007. consequently, the second applicant was registered as s.’s father under section 2, subsection 1, of the children act.9.  without the knowledge of the second applicant, during the period from 2003 to 2008, the first applicant had also had a relationship with a man called e. when that relationship ended in october 2008, the first applicant told the second applicant that e. was the biological father of s. and probably also of l. 10.  on 29 november 2008, the applicants requested that both paternity cases be reopened in order to establish formally e.’s fatherhood of l. and s. the first applicant submitted, in english, that e. was the children’s biological father and that he “had warned me not to tell the truth about the fatherhood of the children”.12.  the first applicant explained that she had met the second applicant in tanzania in 2001. they had married in december 2001 and she had moved to denmark in 2002. in march 2003, she had met e. on a dating site and they had commenced a relationship and had sexual relations twice a week, on a few occasions without protection.it found it established that the first applicant had allowed both men to treat the children as theirs; that e. had taken on a paternal role; that e. had had frequent and regular contact with both children; that e. had taken l. swimming; that e. had taken the children with him on trips, to birthday parties and so on; and that e. was spoken of in familiar terms by the children.25.  the majority (two judges) noted that it was not until the proceedings on paternity that the applicants had informed the authorities that they had not had sexual contact in the fertile period as regards s. moreover, despite giving the children the impression that e. was their biological father, the second applicant had continued to treat the children as his own, at least until the end of 2008. in these circumstances, and since it was uncertain whether paternity would be established for the children if the paternity cases were to be reopened, they did not find a basis for reopening the case regarding s. under section 24 the children act.
12.  between 12 june 2006 and 27 march 2014 the competent second‑instance administrative body (firstly the ministry of finance and later the appeals commission) and the administrative court, before which the case was first brought on an unspecified date in 2006, issued sixteen decisions in total (eight decisions each).13.  on at least four occasions, when initiating an administrative dispute before the administrative court, the applicants explicitly referred to section 37 and/or section 58 of the administrative disputes act (see paragraph 26 below) and urged the administrative court to decide on the merits of their request.the administrative court never ruled on the merits of the initial compensation request, but instead quashed or upheld the quashing of the first-instance decision of the commission.the government submitted that, on the same day, in addition to those constitutional appeals against the supreme court’s decision, the applicants had also each lodged a second constitutional appeal against the decision of the administrative court of 27 march 2014. no copies of those second constitutional appeals were provided by either party.the decision stated that the applicants’ constitutional appeals had been filed against the judgments of the administrative court and the supreme court.
6.  according to the examples submitted by the applicants, the petitions were worded, with slight variations, as follows: “i want my child who is studying at ... school to receive education in kurdish, which is his [her] mother tongue, in addition to education in turkish, at school...” 7.  on receipt of the petitions the relevant education directorates informed the istanbul security directorate, which brought the matter to the attention of the principal public prosecutor’s office at the istanbul state security court.16.  in the meantime, on 14 january 2002 the public prosecutor informed the lawyer that the applicants in question were in custody on suspicion of being affiliated with an illegal organisation, and that there was no need to decide on the lawyer’s request to have access to them as no authorisation for their detention in police custody had yet been issued by the public prosecutor’s office.17.  it appears that shortly after that decision, still on 14 january 2002, the public prosecutor authorised the applicants’ detention in police custody for four days between 13 and 17 january 2002. the authorisation was granted in response to a request made by the anti-terrorism branch of the istanbul security directorate, who had claimed that the applicants’ detention was needed for the completion of their files, in particular to verify whether the petitions had been submitted by the applicants themselves, whether they had any affiliation with the pkk and whether they were being searched for in connection with other offences (see paragraph 32 below for the legal basis for that authorisation).20.  on the same day the public prosecutor filed an objection concerning the decision to release the applicants, claiming that it was evident from the statements made by them following their arrest that they had submitted the petitions in an organised manner with the aim of assisting the pkk’s “politicisation” process.29.  on 28 may 2003 the istanbul state security court acquitted all the accused, including the applicants, because on the facts none of the elements of the crime of aiding and abetting an armed organisation had been present in their actions and there was no other evidence to support the allegations brought against them.
36.  on 24 december 2007 the kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office noted that the pre-investigation inquiry was incomplete and that it was necessary to question the children who had attended the nursery school with the applicant and their parents, to obtain an expert opinion on the contra‑indications and side-effects of the eye drops given to the children, and to question other teachers at the nursery school.it noted that it was necessary to question the children who had attended the nursery school with the applicant and with their parents; to establish the seriousness of the damage sustained by the applicant to his health; to obtain and analyse the documents regulating the actions of the staff of public nursery schools; and to investigate ms p.’s actions.71.  on 17 march 2014 the investigator questioned the applicant’s neighbour who lived on the same landing, who stated that the applicant’s tics had started in november 2005. she also stated that the applicant’s parents were on good terms with ms ch.’s sister but that she had not noticed any kind of relationship between the applicant’s parents and ms ch.the breaches of procedure committed during the investigation – such as the failure to promptly notify the applicant’s mother about certain procedural decisions taken by the investigator or the investigator’s failure to comply with the prosecutor’s instructions – were insufficiently serious as to warrant the quashing of the decision of 10 august 2012.114.  by letters of 16 and 18 november 2011 the st petersburg prosecutor’s office informed the applicant’s mother that the investigator and the officials of the kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office responsible for supervising the case had been disciplined for the delays during the investigation and its ineffectiveness.
the relevant part of the ruling read: “acting investigator has applied to the court with a request to authorize search of the dwelling of [the applicant] ... with a view to locating a mobile telephone “nokia‑7270” stolen from private entrepreneur [k.] ... [theft] having taken place on 2 december 2006 at night.during the hearing, the acting investigator and the prosecutor have supported their request ... having heard the acting investigator [and] the opinion of the prosecutor, and having examined the material of the criminal case, the court concludes that ... [it] has been provided with sufficient data indicating a possibility that the nokia 7270 mobile telephone may be at the [applicant’s] place of residence.” 7.  on 30 january 2007 the police searched the applicant’s flat in his presence and seized three mobile telephones, which, according to the applicant, belonged to him and his family members.it noted that all complaints regarding the unlawfulness of procedural actions by law-enforcement authorities taken in connection with a criminal investigation had to be lodged within the framework of relevant criminal proceedings based on articles 234 and 236 of the code of criminal procedure of ukraine (“the ccp”), then in force.he alleged that there was no meaningful opportunity for him to obtain redress on the basis of the ccp provisions, since a criminal court could only examine complaints concerning the actions of investigation authorities in the context of its examination of a criminal case.however, as the applicant considered himself to have been a victim of an arbitrary search, regardless of the outcome of the relevant criminal investigation, he also considered that he had standing to bring an administrative complaint under articles 2 and 4 of the code of administrative justice of ukraine (“the caj”).
11.  on 17 june 2009 the town court granted the applicant’s claims against mr n. junior and awarded her 613,280 russian roubles (rub) for unjust enrichment and damages corresponding to different sums invested by the applicant in the plot of land and the house as well as the reimbursement of cost and expenses.it however quashed the judgment of 19 january 2010 and restored the judgment of 4 august 2009 on its own motion, considering that: “in the interest of lawfulness and taking into account the principle of legal certainty recognised by the russian federation the presidium considers it possible and necessary to go beyond the arguments developed in the supervisory review application.taking into account the aforementioned principle, the final decision in the present case should be the judgment of the belgorod regional court of 4 august 2009 which granted certain damages to the claimant and rejected her claims for the rest, including as regards unjust enrichment.in the course of the new examination by the cassation court the principles above have not been taken into account, this omission resulted in a violation of the principle of legal certainty provided by article 6 § 1 of the convention and undermined the stability of a binding judicial act.in view of the above, the judgment of 19 january 2010 subject to the present application shall be quashed and the judgment of 4 august 2009 restored.” 18.  on 3 november 2010 a single judge at the supreme court refused the applicant’s supervisory review application.
under the terms of this contract, the applicant company acquired a debt belonging to the bank resulting from a final court judgment of 28 december 1999. that judgment was rendered against a socially-owned company called mehanizacija (hereinafter “the debtor company”) with its seat in vladičin han.on 29 august 2000, upon the bank’s application to that effect, the leskovac commercial court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and the debtor company subsequently paid a part of the judgment debt.7.  on 26 july 2005 the applicant company concluded a settlement with the debtor company, which was later annulled following an application by the debtor company by a decision of the leskovac commercial court of 22 january 2009. that decision became final on 3 march 2010.12.  on 15 october 2010 the leskovac commercial court recognised a part of the applicant company’s claims and instructed the applicant company to initiate civil proceedings in respect of the remainder.that decision was upheld by the commercial appeals court on 25 october 2013. the domestic courts found that the contract which the applicant company had concluded with the bank (see paragraph 5 above) entitled it only to the recovery of the amount paid for the transfer of the debt owed to the bank in question, not the judgment debt itself.
14.  following the request of l.n., the third and the fourth applicants (see paragraph 13 above), the kaunas city municipality assessed the value of the entire house and on 8 october 1996 set it at 239,190 lithuanian litai (ltl – approximately 69,274 euros (eur)) in total, the third applicant signed for himself and as l.n.’s and the fourth applicant’s representative, signalling their agreement to such compensation.on the same day, the kaunas city board amended the decision of 11 april 1995, establishing that the remaining part of the house would not be returned, compensation of ltl 79,730 (approximately eur 23,091) would be paid to l.n., the third and the fourth applicants each, and that the remaining part of the compensation would be paid when the market value of the house had been calculated.died, and the first, the second applicants, who became her heirs, the third and the fourth applicants lodged a claim with the kaunas regional administrative court, asking for the annulation of one part of the order of the authorities of 19 march 2008 (see paragraph 20 above), and to oblige the authorities to calculate the remaining compensation as well as the compensation that had already been paid in accordance with the market price of the house in 2008. they also asked to be awarded damages.23.  on 9 march 2009 the kaunas regional administrative court decided to annul one part of the decision of the authorities of 19 march 2008 and to oblige the authorities to recalculate the compensation for the remaining part of the house in accordance with the market value in 2008. the court decided to reject the claim for damages as no unlawful acts by the authorities had taken place.the supreme administrative court also referred to the same case where it had held that although the authorities had not taken the necessary actions to calculate the remaining part of the compensation from 22 october 1996 until 28 april 2008, these had not been appropriate grounds for annulling the decision of the authorities to pay the remaining part of the compensation.
the injury does not [fall under the category of] harm ...” 30.  on 6 march 2006 the applicant was transferred to sizo 20/1 in grozny, where he was examined by a doctor who made the following notes in his medical record: “... complaints of headaches; healing haematoma on the upper-right shoulder; fresh scar on the back of the knee measuring 2 cm; haemorrhage in the right eye; abrasion on the back of the head ... handcuff marks on both wrists ...” 31.  on 11 may 2006 the applicant complained to the chechnya prosecutor’s office of having been ill-treated in moscow and in the orb‑2, stating that the police officers had tortured him to make him confess to crimes he had not committed.37.  on 27 december 2007 the applicant’s lawyers appealed to the supervisory prosecutor against the investigators’ decisions in respect of the applicant’s complaint of ill‑treatment and requested that the prosecutor recognise as unlawful the following: “(a) the delays in the verification of a. mukayev’s complaints concerning the unlawful actions of the law-enforcement officers against him; (b) the investigator’s refusal to question important witnesses who could have confirmed the use of violence against a. mukayev; (c) the investigator’s refusal to question a. mukayev.” 38.  on 17 january 2008 the investigator’s refusal of 9 december 2007 to initiate a criminal investigation was overruled by the supervisory prosecutor, and the applicant’s complaints of ill-treatment were sent back to the investigators for further inquiries.however, after his arrest he started to have health problems ... in spite of consistent allegations [of torture] in the complaint lodged by a. mukayev, the investigator refused to open a criminal case ... on the basis of the above, it is requested that the court: order the chechnya prosecutor’s office to furnish [the applicant with] the materials gathered by the inquiry which resulted in the refusal to institute criminal proceedings on the basis of the complaints of a. mukayev, as he was neither provided with a copy of this decision nor familiarised with the contents of the file; recognise as unlawful the failure of the prosecutor’s office to investigate substantiated allegations of torture; and order the chechnya prosecutor’s office to conduct a thorough, objective and effective investigation into the applicant’s torture, and to prosecute the culprits ...” 40.  on 26 september 2007 the applicant’s lawyer lodged an additional complaint with the zavodskoy district court.[b]eaten [according to a. mukayev] in the head during the journey from moscow ...’ on 10 may 2006 in sizo 20/1 the following note was made in mukayev’s medical record: ‘[c]omplaints of numbness in the right side of his face; lacrimation of the right eye; sharp pains in the right side of the face, the ear and the gums.’ on 1 june 2006 in sizo 20/1, the following note was made in mukayev’s medical record: ‘[o]n the upper left shoulder there are round purple bruises, both internal and external, measuring 2-3 cm.on 6 august 2008 the latter upheld the decision of the leninskiy district court, stating that: “... in [citing] the overruling of the decision in refusing to open a criminal investigation within the framework of a criminal case which has been resolved by a sentence, [the applicant’s representative] is in fact proposing that the court examine and evaluate evidence that has already been examined and evaluated by the chechnya supreme court and the supreme court of the russian federation.
7.  following the death of a six-year-old boy, rakhim amriev, in the course of a counter-terrorist operation in the chemulga settlement in ingushetia on 9 november 2007, a protest meeting against abuse of authority by the security forces was planned in nazran, the capital of ingushetia, for 24 november 2007. on 22 november 2007 ren tv dispatched a team consisting of the second, third and fourth applicants in order to cover the protest planned for 24 november 2007. the first applicant was on a business trip in nazran at that time.at about 8 p.m. on 23 november 2007 a duty officer from the ministry of the interior had arrived at the hotel and told them that a deputy minister of the interior had ordered the security team to leave the hotel and go to the ministry of the interior building.35.  on various dates in november and december 2007 the investigators questioned two police officers from the nesterovskaya police station and four officers from the sunzhenskiy district police station whose statements concerning the circumstances of the applicants’ arrival at the police station in the early hours of 24 november 2007 were similar to the applicants’ account before the court.50.  on 26 november 2007 the head of the ingushetia investigative committee issued instructions for the investigators, ordering them to take these steps, amongst others: “ [...] 4) to identify and question the deputy minister of the interior who, according to the statement of ms m.k., telephoned the hotel at about 9 p.m. and recalled the police security officers; [...] 9) to identify the police officers who had manned the checkpoints on motorway “kavkaz” on 23 november 2007 and question them about the passage of the gazel minibus and examine the passing vehicles’ registration logs; [...] 15) to identify persons who had been staying at the hotel at the material time and question them about the events; [...] 17) to establish whether there were cctv cameras inside and outside the hotel and examine their contents; [...]” 51.  on 27 november 2007 the investigators took fingerprints from six employees of the hotel for comparative forensic examination of the fingerprints collected at the crime scene.your intervention could change the basis of the operational search officers’ attitude to the execution of their tasks...” 73.  on 30 may 2011 the head of the criminal police department of the ministry of the interior replied to the investigators, stating that as the result of their criticism they had conducted an internal inquiry and implemented various disciplinary measures against the officers responsible for their failure to take the necessary steps.

8.  on 21 april 2004 the administrator of the estate submitted a list of j.c.’s assets (relação de bens) to the case-file; the applicant was notified of this on 20 september 2004.between that date and 3 september 2007 contact information with regard to some of the heirs was submitted by the administrator of the estate, the heirs who had sought to intervene in the proceedings were granted leave to do so (see paragraph 7 above), and land registry certificates were requested and added to the case-file.11.  following some difficulties in summoning the heirs (many of the letters sent had been returned undelivered to the court), on 20 may 2009 the court managed to summon all heirs.21.  on 6 february 2014 the administrator of the estate informed the court that she was unable to obtain information about the missing addresses of some of the heirs of a deceased party.22.   the court stayed the proceedings three times (on 12 february and 13 november 2014, and on 10 september 2015), ordering that they should not continue until one or more of the parties took the initiative to submit information regarding the addresses of some of the heirs.
he considered that despite the fact that he had not been married to b. and had not been registered as living in the room, he should be regarded as a member of her family who had acquired the right to occupy her room.in particular, he raised the following arguments: -  he had shared a common household with b.; -  he had paid for the maintenance of the room; -  he had assumed the cost of b.’s burial; -  he had no other housing: he could not return to the flat of his former wife z. since she had become the owner of that flat and lived there with her new family; -  on 8 september 2009 he had asked the authorities to deregister him from the flat of his former wife z.; -  since his eviction, he had been obliged to live in the school in which he was working as a night watchman.the district court established, in particular, that between 1999 and 2009 the applicant had cohabited with b. in the room in question, had shared a common household with her and had been removed from the register at his previous place of residence.the district court considered that the above circumstances should be regarded as exceptional within the meaning of article 69 of the housing code and that the applicant should therefore be regarded as a member of b.’s family who had acquired the right to reside in the room previously occupied by her.it follows that the court judgment should be quashed and a new decision should be taken dismissing those claims.” 17.  on 3 march 2011 a judge of the supreme court of russia (“the supreme court”) refused to refer the applicant’s application for supervisory review of the decision of 22 september 2010 to the civil chamber of the supreme court for examination, finding no grounds for such review and relying on the principle of legal certainty.

she had nothing against the children staying with their father during the summer but complained about the impracticability of the contact arrangements, in particular of having to exercise her contact rights during that period in i.b.’s home, which for her was both objectionable for psychological reasons, given the animosity between her and her husband, and costly, as it entailed her having to travel to s. 32.  the applicant’s appeal was only dismissed by the split county court (županijski sud u splitu) on 20 may 2011. the relevant part of that decision reads as follows: “the first-instance court adopted the provisional measure relying on [the relevant provisions of] the enforcement act and the family act after having established that the adoption of that measure was not contrary to the children’s best interests.since those interests were not called into question by the arguments raised by the appellant in her appeal, and given that in the proceedings leading to the adoption of the decision [on the provisional measure] there were no serious breaches of procedure ... the appellant’s appeal had to be dismissed and the contested decision upheld.” 33.  meanwhile, in a report of 30 june 2010 the ivanić-grad social welfare centre (centar za socijalnu skrb ivanić-grad) informed the split municipal court of the measures taken to prepare the children for their stay with their father during the summer holidays, as ordered under the measure of 18 june 2010 (see paragraph 30 above).did not hand the children over to the applicant, but kept them in s. 39.  in their opinions of 1 and 10 september 2010 submitted to the split municipal court the split and ivanić-grad social welfare centres respectively suggested that the experts’ recommendations made in the opinion of 10 may 2010 (see paragraph 27 above) be followed and the children returned to the applicant in i. in view of the children’s recent resistance to returning to their mother’s home, the split welfare centre also proposed that a supplementary expert opinion be obtained from the same experts.(see paragraph 37 above), dated 23 september 2010, which stated that: - the children needed psychological assistance, to which the father agreed (he had started taking them to therapy); - the father had been advised to encourage the children to have contact with the mother; - the children were refusing contact not because they did not love their mother but because they were afraid she would take them to i.; - the supplementary expert opinion proposed by the split social welfare centre (see paragraph 39 above) should determine (a) in what way the parents had been manipulating the children, (b) what kind of impact returning to i. would have on the children’s emotional health, and (c) the long-term consequences of either potential decision on custody.in particular, they: - stated that the children had been manipulated by their father and that their refusal to have any contact with their mother was completely irrational and resulted from the conflict of loyalties they had been drawn into; - criticised the opinions of dr j.š., who in their view had (a) failed to adequately explain the radical change in the children’s behaviour after they had spent the summer holidays of 2010 with their father, (b) failed to recognise that change as an obvious symptom of the children’s conflict of loyalties, and (c) recommended that the children’s wish to continue to live with their father be respected (see paragraphs 45-46 above), thus ignoring their long-term interests; - pointed out that the judicial authorities had ignored the split social welfare centre’s recommendation of 1 september 2010 that a supplementary expert opinion be obtained from them (as the experts who had on 10 may 2010 prepared the earlier opinion in the case – see paragraphs 27 and 39 above) and, instead of ordering a combined (psychiatric and psychological) evaluation of both parents and the children by a clinic in zagreb, had only ordered a psychiatric evaluation of the parents by an expert from split (see paragraphs 47-48 above).
11.  after deducting the surface of the in-cell sanitary facility and the storage closet from the overall surface of the cells, the applicant had personal space of 2.03 sq.12.  for the rest of the time spent in vaslui prison until 11 september 2014, the date of the correspondence from the national administration of prisons submitted by the government, the applicant had personal space of 3.05 sq.the government submitted a copy of a printed form for the distribution of toothbrushes, toothpaste, shaving cream, razors, toilet paper and soap in vaslui prison, dated 1 august 2014. according to this form, on the said date the applicant received one razor, one roll of toilet paper and one bar of soap.in case he did not have the necessary financial means to cover his contribution, the applicant was instructed to lodge a request with the vaslui prison administration after obtaining an estimate of the extent of the dental work needed and its total costs.the judge reviewed the applicant’s medical file and his doctors’ prescriptions and, taking into account that the applicant had failed to mention any specific failures on the part of the prison administration, concluded that no breach of rights could be found in the case.
24.  on an unspecified date the prosecutor’s office began a preliminary investigation into the applicant’s complaints, in the course of which a number of people were questioned as potential witnesses, including the police officers implicated by the applicant in her ill-treatment, the lay witnesses, who had signed the police report concerning seizure of opium from the applicant on 24 june 2009, the three men implicated in buying opium from the applicant, the applicant’s partner, brother, guests, and the applicant herself.(her brother), and two persons identified by the applicant as the guests present during the purported forced entry, gave statements similar to the ones the applicant had provided to the department of the interior on 26 june 2009. the applicant also submitted that there had been no lay witnesses present during the forced entry and search and that the jar and syringes with opium had been brought by the police officers and planted on her.34.  on 9 december 2010 the investigator s. discontinued the second set of criminal proceedings against the applicant for want of any evidence that she had stored opium in her house or had sold it to anyone on 24 june 2009. in his decision, the investigator referred to various procedural irregularities in the collection of evidence by the police officers and discrepancies in the statements of the various persons questioned as witnesses, which he deemed irreconcilable.37.  on 29 august 2011 the kharkiv prosecutor withdrew the bill of indictment against officer a.a., noting that the three men earlier identified as the drug buyers and one of the two people identified as the applicant’s guests who had been present during the purported forced entry had retracted their testimony incriminating a.a. and his colleagues in the assault.40.  on various dates in september 2011 formal confrontations were organised between the applicant, two of the three men identified by the police as the “drug buyers”, and a woman identified by the applicant as one of her guests on 24 june 2009. during those confrontations, the applicant confirmed her previous testimony, while the other people maintained that because they had been regular clients of the applicant’s for drugs in 2009, they had earlier given statements in her favour for fear of reprisals from her and officer y.b., who had protected her.
7.  on 8 february 1994 the frankfurt (oder) regional court annulled the 1958 judgment for its incompatibility with the principles of the rule of law and rehabilitated the applicant pursuant to section 1 § 1 of the criminal rehabilitation act (gesetz über die rehabilitierung und entschädigung von opfern rechtsstaatswidriger strafverfolgungsmaßnahmen im beitrittsgebiet ‑ strafrechtliches rehabilitierungsgesetz) designed to rehabilitate and compensate prisoners of the gdr regime for deprivation of their liberty incompatible with the principles of the rule of law.on 14 november 2007 he was granted a special monthly pension of eur 250 pursuant to section 17a of the criminal rehabilitation act, with the reservation that information held by the federal commissioner for the records of the state security service of the former gdr (“the federal commissioner”) must not contradict the applicant’s statements.referring to section 16 § 2 of the criminal rehabilitation act, he observed that the applicant, contrary to the statements in his applications, had worked as a secret informant for the ministry of state security and had produced at least five reports for the ministry in which he put at real risk the persons on whom he had informed.13.  on 16 february 2010 the frankfurt (oder) regional court, sitting as a chamber of three judges, dismissed the applicant’s request for judicial review, finding that his work as a secret informant for the ministry of state security was of such nature, scope and duration that it was reprehensible enough to justify ruling out the applicant’s eligibility for compensation payments pursuant to section 16 § 2 of the criminal rehabilitation act.further, the court could not see a connection between the applicant’s experiences relating to the impact of war and the post-war period on him and his psychological strain at the time of recruitment on the one hand and his willingness to cooperate with the state security service on the other hand.
8.  in 1989 the applicant paid to the authorities the part of the value of the future flat which had not been covered by the value of the expropriated property.the company was under an obligation to build, at its own expense, and deliver to the municipality, within twenty-four months, the flats earmarked for compensation of the expropriated owners; in exchange of that it was to become the owner of the remainder of the building.the latter apparently resold the property to a third company, which in 2006 obtained a notary deed declaring it the owner of the building and the flats in it, including one half of flat no.lastly, in a letter of 8 november 2011 the sofia municipality informed the applicant that he should have raised his claims in the winding-up procedure of the company b., or should contact the current owner of the building to claim the flat due to him.12.  in 2007 the applicant was evicted from the flat where he had been temporarily settled, after it had been sold to a private party in the context of the winding-up of the company b. in the ensuing judicial proceedings whereby he challenged unsuccessfully the eviction it was established that at that time the applicant was not living in the flat, and that it was uninhabitable and in a very poor state of repair.
7.  on 23 september 2010 the public prosecutor at the athens court of appeal ordered the attica police department to carry out searches at fifteen residential and business premises in various locations in athens and the attica region, including the applicant’s address, in the context of a preliminary police investigation being conducted in respect of s.g. and i.g.in view of the material gathered to date and in order to avoid the loss of decisive evidence, we hereby order searches, in application of articles 253-259 of the code of criminal procedure, at the residential and professional premises located in the following streets: 28-30 rue meletopoulou, palaio psychiko; ... in addition, should you consider it necessary, carry out body searches of the persons present in these homes and offices.in the indictment division’s view, this meant that in deciding whether to bring a prosecution the public prosecutor’s office had to use all the means at its disposal to gather evidence, in line with article 178 of the ccp and the procedure applicable to the pre-trial investigation, with the exception of evidence that was incompatible with the nature of a preliminary police investigation (such as, for example, the memorandum of defence as a suspect and issuing an arrest warrant).13.  the indictment division held that article 256 of the ccp, providing for the right of the occupant of premises being searched to be present, did not impose an obligation on the person conducting the search to await the occupant or invite him or her to be present, and that, should the occupant be absent, the presence of a neighbour was sufficient.14.  with regard to the authorities’ refusal to return the seized objects, the indictment division noted that a considerable amount of evidence had been seized during the searches of the applicant’s home and also at the residential premises of the other individuals concerned, and that this evidence provided sufficient proof of the existence of a criminal organisation involving persons who had committed serious offences, most of them crimes, in respect of which prosecutions had been brought.
he also stated that he had tried to establish the sisters’ credibility and the truthfulness of the allegations by interviewing the sisters, a’s son, the police, one of the sisters’ employers, another alleged victim and other people mentioned by the sisters in their writings, who could confirm that the allegations were not appearing for the first time because of a’s candidacy, but had been known to the family and the police for years.there would be general elections, where the same rules about eligibility and the right to vote applied as in the parliamentary election”... when the statements in sections a-c are compared to the sisters’ writings on their website on 2 november 2010, the court has to agree with [the applicant] that both the headline in section a and the statements in sections b and c are verbatim from their letter.20.  by a judgment of 21 february 2013 the supreme court partly overturned the district court’s judgment and found defamatory the statements in sections a, b, d and part of the statement in section c, consisting of insinuations that a was guilty of having abused children, and ordered the applicant to pay, under the tort act, 200,000 icelandic krónur (isk) (approximately 1,600 euros (eur)) for non-pecuniary damage, plus interest in compensation and isk 800,000 (approximately 6,500 eur) for a’s legal costs before the district court and supreme court.section 13 “any person who publishes, distributes, or is involved in the publishing or distribution of any publication other than a newspaper or periodical shall bear criminal liability and liability for damages pursuant to the general rules of law if the substance of the publication violates the law.” section 15 “as regards liability for newspapers or magazines other than those listed in section 14, the following rules shall apply: the author is subject to criminal liability and liability for damages if he or she is identified and either resident in iceland when the publication is published or within icelandic jurisdiction at the time proceedings are initiated.media service providers shall be obliged to provide any persons who consider they are the victims of a violation as a result of the publication of text content with information indicating who is liable for the content.” 28.  by judgment of 24 november 2011 (case no 100/2011), which concerned defamation proceedings against editors and a journalist of a newspaper and newspaper website, the supreme court of iceland found that before the media act entered into force, there had been no applicable legal rule about the responsibility of an editor of web-based media which published material solely online.
the governor of the lublin remand centre, in his application to impose the regime, stated that on 21 february 2011 the applicant had refused to undergo a strip-search, had been aggressive and had attempted to hit a prison officer in the face.he submitted that since the applicant’s arrival at the prison he had been aggressive towards the prison officers and had been trying to gain prominence in the prison community by plotting to assault a senior officer of the service.23.  the governor of rzeszow prison (to which the applicant had in the meantime been transferred) subsequently requested the extension of the regime imposed on the applicant.the governor considered that the applicant remained interested in belonging to the prison community and that his behaviour continued to pose a risk to the security of the prison.on 28 june 2012 the commission extended the regime, citing the same justification as in its previous decision of 3 april 2012. on 27 september and 27 december 2012 the governor of rzeszow prison made further requests to extend the measure imposed on the applicant.
the court pointed out that the applicant had not remained at his place of residence, had refused to accept a summons from the prosecutor and, although he was aware that an investigation was being carried out in respect of him, he had moved to new zealand in 1999 with a view to waiting until the charges that had been brought against him became time-barred; consequently, the proceedings against him had had to be stayed for ten years.13.  on 7 june 2010 the applicant’s detention was extended until 7 september 2010. the court again referred to the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he was charged and on the severity of the penalty to which he would be liable if found guilty.22.  on 21 june 2011 the kielce regional court extended the applicant’s detention until 21 december 2011. the court noted that the results of the applicant’s recent treatment in the łódź prison hospital ward had been satisfactory and that according to the experts in neurology and orthopaedics (see paragraph 21 above) he could be treated in prison facilities.the doctor also ordered a further examination of the applicant, which took place on 16 august 2011. on 16 october 2011 a fresh opinion was delivered, the relevant part of which reads as follows: “there are obstacles to [an extension of the] stay of the applicant in the kielce detention centre because he cannot receive neurological treatment there ... the results of the electromyography examination (emg) show a gradually worsening] dysfunction of the peripheral nerves ... which qualifies the applicant for neurological surgery that can only be executed in a neurological ward.2. the post-operation rehabilitation should take place in a good rehabilitation ward  ... it may also take place in detention, however i do not know in which detention centre such a ward exists.” 28.  on 14 november 2011 the applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal against the court’s decision of 8 november 2011. he requested the court, in the event that the appeal was not granted, to change the preventive measure applied to the applicant and to impose bail on him of a “reasonable amount”.
16.  the applicant did not lodge any complaint about the length of these proceedings under the law of 17 june 2004 on complaints of a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki – “the 2004 act”) 17.  on 10 november 2000 the mińsk mazowiecki district court remanded the applicant in custody on the grounds that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed armed robbery and deprived the victims of their liberty.23.  subsequently, the mińsk mazowiecki district court further extended the applicant’s detention on 9 april and 12 july 2002. the earlier decision was upheld by the siedlce regional court on 8 may 2002. the courts reiterated the grounds previously given for the applicant’s continued detention, also noting that there was a real risk that he would obstruct the proceedings if released in the light of the fact that many of his alleged accomplices were still at large.36.  on 30 december 2003 the mińsk mazowiecki district court resumed the proceedings in the applicant’s case in view of that decision and the fact that the psychiatric observation could be scheduled to start in march 2004. on the same date the court again remanded him in custody on the grounds that the evidence showed a significant probability that he had committed armed robbery.62.  on 15 january 2008 the ombudsman joined the proceedings, asking that article 263 § 3 of the code be declared unconstitutional in so far as it left a legal loophole which was filled in by an erroneously developed well‑established court practice not to include in the calculation of the statutory two-year period of detention on remand (prior to the first judgment of the first-instance court) periods of the detainee’s concurrent deprivation of liberty on the basis of a criminal sentence.the provision had been declared unconstitutional in so far as it was interpreted to the effect that the statutory maximum period of two years allowed for a person’s detention on remand prior to the first judgment of the first-instance court had not comprised the term of the prison sentence the detainee was serving in another case, concurrently to his detention on remand, thus allowing for an extension of the preventive measure beyond two years by a first-instance court on general grounds (see paragraphs 77‑81 below).
11.  all of the above institutions were at the relevant time under the control of the “republic of serbian krajina” (republika srpska krajina), an internationally unrecognised self-proclaimed entity established on the territory of the republic of croatia during the wars in the former yugoslavia.the entity ceased to exist after the adoption of the basic agreement on the region of eastern slavonia, baranja and western sirmium of 12 november 1995 (hereinafter erdut agreement) by which the republic of croatia assumed sovereignty over the entirety of its territory.12.  shortly after the adoption of the erdut agreement, and upon the request of the “beli manastir district prison”, the applicant was transferred on 20 june 1996 to sremska mitrovica prison (kazneno-popravni zavod sremska mitrovica), which is on the territory of the respondent state.it concluded that the legal ground for the applicant’s detention was his conviction by the “supreme court of serbian krajina” of 21 july 1994. it further noted that the procedure governing the recognition of a foreign criminal sentence and its enforcement was not applicable in the applicant’s case because serbian krajina was not a state.it finally held that the lack of procedure for recognition of a foreign judgment was proportionate to the obligation to enforce a prison sentence for murder especially given that the applicant had access to the constitutional court which had the power to review the legality of his detention and that he had access to other procedures available to any other prisoner in serbia, including the procedure for applying for a pardon.
the authority found that the foster care had not been satisfactory in the light of the fact that the foster parents had made important decisions without consulting the child welfare authorities, such as moving north and planning to place the applicant in a vocational school 300 km away from their home.13.  on 18 june 2009 the district court, on the basis of the guardianship service act, appointed a mentor for the applicant in matters concerning his property and economy, as well as matters pertaining to his person to the extent that the applicant was unable to understand their significance.the mentor was of the view that the applicant did not understand all the consequences of the plan, and did not realise that the good things in his present situation would not be relocated with him.the court found that the applicant clearly did not understand what it would be like to live in a remote part of the country, especially as he had previously lived there for only one year, and what the implications of the move would be for his situation.18.  as matter of law, the district court stated that as, on the evidence, the applicant was not able to understand the significance of the envisaged decision, the mentor was not required, or even permitted, to resolve the question of the applicant’s place of residence in accordance with the applicant’s own wishes.
the cologne regional court also considered that an interpretation of the relevant provision of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act in conformity with the case-law of the european court of human rights was not possible as the domestic law was clear and therefore not open to any interpretation.13.  on 18 march 2010 the first applicant appealed to the cologne court of appeal, arguing that the application of the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act would discriminate against him and breach his inheritance rights and therefore violate his right to equality before the law under article 3 and his rights under article 6 § 5 of the basic law.14.  in a decision of 11 october 2010 the cologne court of appeal dismissed the first applicant’s appeal on the grounds that it was bound by the decisions of the federal constitutional court and that it had found that the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act was in conformity with the basic law.the regional court referred to the federal constitutional court’s judgment of 8 december 1976. it noted that brauer (cited above) was not applicable to the case at hand because there had been no regular contact between the second applicant and his father, the deceased had a natural daughter and the second applicant had not lived in the former gdr for most of his life.20.  the second applicant appealed to the federal court of justice, which confirmed the hamburg court of appeal’s reasoning in a decision on 26 october 2011. the federal court of justice argued that neither the old nor the amended first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act discriminated against children born outside marriage before 1 july 1949 because the difference in treatment was based on legitimate grounds.
15.  in the course of the investigation the zagreb municipal state attorney’s office questioned the two suspects and on 17 june and 31 july 2013 it instructed the police to conduct an identification procedure and formal questioning of the applicant and š.š.on 12 november 2013 the police informed the applicant’s representative that they had lodged a criminal complaint with the zagreb municipal state attorney’s office against two individuals in connection with a suspicion that they had committed the offence of attempted grievous bodily harm against the applicant and her partner, which, in the circumstances of the case, had been classified as a hate crime.on 17 february 2014 the applicant’s representative, invoking the domestic authorities’ obligations under the convention, requested information from the police and the zagreb municipal state attorney’s office about the criminal complaint lodged on behalf of the applicant.... as criminal proceedings for the offence under article 177 § 1 of the criminal code are instituted on the basis of a private prosecution, the criminal complaint ... must be rejected ... on the grounds that the impugned criminal offence is not an offence that is prosecuted of the prosecutor’s own motion.threatened her, but rather š.š., and thus the criminal complaint ... should be rejected on the grounds that the impugned criminal offence is not an offence that is prosecuted of the prosecutor’s own motion.” 27.  the applicant was informed that she could take over the prosecution of s.k.
10.  on 28 june 1999 the ministry of construction of the moscow region issued a decision to “adopt” the general plan of lyubertsy town, “to invite the lyubertsy municipality to continue co-operating with the authors of the general plan when preparing future projects, bearing in mind that the plan is the main legal document in relation to town planning”.there is a car park on one side of the street and a residential area ont the other ... they have a well-developed infrastructure, good access to transport up to vykhino metro station, central lyubertsy and the above residential area ... description of the plot of land: ...vykhino metro station is within a ten-minute ride by public transport ... description of the house: ... the main building was first constructed in 1937; the remaining buildings later, until the 1970s ... the house is habitable, although it requires some superficial repairs ...” 28.  in november 2004 the district chief architect and the local land authority informed the municipal administration that the town’s general plan of 1999 made no provision for the construction of individual housing.the municipality will be ordered to remedy the violation of the code.” 34.  on 7 april 2005 the municipality’s mayor wrote to the town court asking to speed up the court proceedings, arguing that some of the flats were to be given to the people waiting for social housing and that the procrastination of the proceedings was also prejudicial to the people who had invested in the construction project.the first applicant also argued that the expert report had failed to take into account the scarcity of land in lyubertsy for individual housing; the commercially attractive location of the land, which bordered the city of moscow; the proximity of a metro station under construction (or planned); and the intended use of the land being expropriated for commercial gain arising from the construction of blocks of flats.50.  on 5 september 2007 the town court granted the first claim in part, considering that the applicant had not been informed in good time of the order launching the enforcement proceedings in 2005. she had thus been deprived of the right to contest the documents relating to the enforcement.
the panel took into account the nature of the misconduct, which it classified as serious, and the existence of another disciplinary measure against the applicant in the past, and decided to remove him from office.he questioned the assessment of the circumstances of the case and the application of the legal provisions to the established facts in the decision of 23 december 2004. his appeal was examined at a plenary session of the disciplinary council composed of eight members, including the same four, mr k.k., mr g.ch., mr d.s.he also stated that under article 6 of the convention the four members of the panel who had taken the decision of 23 december 2004 had not had the right to sit subsequently in the disciplinary council appeal hearing.the supreme court rejected the allegation of a delay in the examination of the case by the disciplinary council by noting that the latter had given its ruling within the statutory time-limit of one month.the supreme court also found that the presence of four members of the panel as participants in the subsequent disciplinary council proceedings had not contravened the requirements of sections 22 and 24 of the disciplinary proceedings act (see paragraph 17 below).
5.  the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in kaluđerica.6.  on 22 december 2006 the applicant was deprived of liberty on suspicion of participating in criminal association within the police operation “customs mafia” during which 43 persons were also arrested.the applicant was released on 15 june 2007.7.  on 31 july 2009 the investigation against all the accused was transferred to the prosecutor’s office for organised crime.9.  on 17 january 2013 the criminal proceedings against the applicant were suspended.
29.  the district court gave credence to the applicant’s mother’s version of events, which it found to be consistent with other evidence in the case, in particular statements by her that the applicant had had no injuries when he had left home with the police officers and that his health had appeared to have been damaged when he had returned from the police station.noting that the respondent authorities and the sovetskiy district police, acting as a third party in the proceedings, had submitted no evidence capable of proving that the applicant could have received the injuries (see paragraph 11 above) in other circumstances, the district court established that they had been sustained during his detention at the police station.30.  the district court noted that the applicant had been a minor at the time and that, according to his submissions at the hearing, various acts of violence, to which the police officers of the sovetskiy district police had, in the exercise of their duties, subjected him (see paragraph 9 above), had caused him mental and physical suffering.31.  having examined the evidence in its entirety, in particular the medical evidence of the applicant’s injuries, the district court found that the applicant’s mental and physical suffering had been caused by the unlawful actions of the police officers of the sovetskiy district police department, in particular by the inhuman and degrading treatment and by inflicting bodily harm.32.  relying on the russian constitution, in particular the provisions concerning the right to compensation for damage sustained as a result of the unlawful actions of state organs (article 53), the district court held that the state was responsible for the applicant’s ill-treatment regardless of the fact that the guilt of specific individuals had so far not been established.
6.  on 13 july 2006 the applicant filed a civil suit together with 18 other persons with the kragujevac municipal court against his former employer telekom srbija ad beograd requesting the payment of funds from profit made in 2005.7.  the applicant’s previous representative did not attend first preliminary hearing fixed for 15 november 2006, since he had been deleted from the register of the attorneys–at-law in may 2006. the applicant appointed the present representative on 25 january 2007.9.  on 27 august 2007 the proceedings were split to separate proceedings for each of the plaintiffs concerned.11.  within the period from 21 october 2008 until 29 april 2011 seven out of eight hearings were postponed for various reasons, mainly because the representatives on the both sides provided new submissions and evidence and on the proposal of both sides due to the cost-efficiency of the proceedings.12.  on 29 april 2011 the kragujevac first instance court ruled against the applicant.
that kind of conduct, by an employee who was at the time of the publication of the statement in the daily newspaper the director of the utility company, which she headed, who makes such allegations in the media or engages in unlawful conduct, constitutes, in the opinion of the company’s general meeting, totally inappropriate behaviour which tarnishes the company’s [business] reputation in the eyes of the public.the applicant argued, inter alia, as follows: “i contest entirely the argument that by making statements in the media i acted inappropriately and allegedly attacked the [business] reputation of the company ... the utility company is a public company which belongs to the [local] community ... it was my duty, as a member of the [company’s] management, to contact the media and inform the public because it is a public company and not someone’s private property.the relevant part of her statement of claim read as follows: “the defendant obviously did not properly read the [impugned] article because the plaintiff merely states some facts in it and, as an example, refers to a particular case of unresolved property issues, which is already the subject of judicial proceedings, and calls for an audit and the involvement of [the prosecuting authorities] with a view to protecting her integrity by expressly stating: ‘given that my work has been called into question i demand an audit of kd kostrena, and the involvement of the office for the prevention of corruption and organised crime and the state attorney’s office.’” 12.  by a judgment of 12 june 2008 the municipal court ruled in favour of the applicant.published a few days earlier in novi list on 19 september 2007, where he had criticised the plaintiff’s work and stated that she had betrayed the trust of the members of the general meeting by disclosing information that should only have been discussed at the general meeting, [had said] that the [company] was stagnating, that it did not operate the type of business for which it had been established [and so on] ... ... therefore, in this court’s view, the plaintiff’s actions should be interpreted as [the exercise of] her right to speak publicly and the right to freedom of thought, which are rights guaranteed by the croatian constitution.therefore, the behaviour of the plaintiff, in stating on 27  september 2007 in the novi list daily ... that the defendant company, which she heads, had acted illegally, namely by charging for parking when it was not allowed [to do so], asking that the [company] be audited, and also seeking the intervention of [the prosecuting authorities] with a view to verifying the activities of the defendant company, has significant repercussions on the employment relationship between the parties and gives the employer a justified reason for terminating the employment contract, within the meaning of section [107] of the labour act.
19.  the samsun police disciplinary council, which was in charge of the disciplinary investigation, asked for the applicant’s written defence, which he supplied on 29 november 2004, and concluded on 16 december 2004 that it had been established that the applicant had committed the offences of false imprisonment, attempted rape and threatening violence with a weapon, and transferred the case to the supreme disciplinary council of the general security directorate (“the supreme disciplinary council”) for a decision on the applicant’s dismissal from the police force in accordance with the provisions of section 8 § 6 of the disciplinary regulations of the security forces (“the disciplinary regulations”).although the applicant has denied these allegations, the fact that the weapons and tools used in the assault were found and confiscated at the crime scene, and that the victim’s injuries were corroborated by a medical report, and finally the fact that the applicant tried to conceal evidence, led the disciplinary authorities to rely on the victim’s version of the events, despite the fact that there were no witnesses to corroborate the victim’s allegations.notwithstanding the fact that the victim and the applicant gave different accounts of the events and that the specific allegations were not corroborated by witnesses, the court notes, on the basis of the preliminary investigation report of the samsun prosecutor’s office, that an anonymous caller notified the authorities that a cry for help came from a white şahin type civilian type vehicle in the vicinity of alanlı village, and that the applicant and ç.v.therefore, the disciplinary offence of which the applicant was accused and the corresponding sanction he received cannot be deemed unlawful.” 23.  the applicant appealed against the judgment of the samsun administrative court, drawing the attention of the appeal court to the fact that he had in the meantime been acquitted of the criminal charges of false imprisonment, robbery and attempted rape by the samsun assize court, and that his conviction for assault and battery would not in itself justify his expulsion from public service under the terms of the disciplinary regulations.the relevant part of the judgment read: “the applicant asked the court to quash the decision to dismiss him from the police service and to overturn the decision of samsun administrative court upholding his dismissal on the grounds that he had been acquitted of the criminal charges of false imprisonment, robbery, and attempted rape by the first-instance court, and that the charges of assault and battery on which he was convicted did not constitute conduct that attracted the penalty of dismissal from service.
6.  on 28 september 1994 the applicant initiated civil proceedings requesting the division of a certain estate.7.  on 5 january 2009 the ivanjica municipal court suspended the said proceedings until conclusion of another civil case.9.  on 23 june 2011 the constitutional court found a breach of the applicant’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time and ordered the speeding up of the impugned proceedings.the court, additionally, declared that the applicant was entitled to the non-pecuniary damages sought, in accordance with article 90 of the constitutional court act (see paragraph 13, article 90, below).10.   it seems that, the applicant contacted the commission for compensation on 11 december 2011 and requested the payment of the compensation awarded, but apparently received no response.
10.  on 29 july 2015 the applicant applied for refugee status in russia, arguing that in iraq he would run the risk of persecution by militants belonging to the islamic state of iraq and al-sham (isis – also known as islamic state of iraq and the levant) because he had refused to join them, as well as by iraqi government forces for the reason that he practiced the sunni form of islam.13.  on 29 december 2015 the russian fms dismissed the applicant’s appeal on the grounds that he had not received any direct threats targeted against him personally and that “the applicant [had not submitted] convincing evidence that he might become a victim of persecution by isis militants or iraqi authorities on the grounds contained in the definition of the term ‘refugee’, including his religion”.the applicant’s lawyer appealed to the russian fms, arguing that the applicant did not have any possibility to return to his home in the gaza strip, that the moscow region fms had failed to assess his personal situation and the risk he would face if returned to palestine, and that the moscow region fms, in breach of the refugees act (fz-4528-1 of 19 february 1993), had not issued him with an examination certificate.24.  on 31 december 2015 the russian fms dismissed the appeal for the reason that the applicant had “failed to provide evidence confirming that he runs a higher risk of becoming a victim of the palestine-israel conflict than the rest of the population of the palestinian national autonomy”.it reasoned, in particular, that the applicant had not proved that the terrorists who had threatened him in 2005 represented any danger more than ten years later and that, should such threats persist, he “has not been deprived of an opportunity to avail himself of the protection of his state of nationality [– that is to say] to apply to the law-enforcement agencies of the republic of somalia [for protection].” on the same date the applicant’s lawyer appealed.
on the pre-printed part of the report forms, the grounds for arresting them are cited as the need to stop the commission of the offence and to draw up a report (see relevant provisions of the code of administrative offences in paragraph 34 (i) and (iii) below).19.  when questioned by the prosecutor’s office in the course of the subsequent pre-investigation enquiries, the expert expressed the opinion that the above injuries suffered by mr grigoryan were the result of at least twenty impacts by blunt objects.the prosecutor’s office relied essentially on the police officers’ statements, according to which the applicants had been tied up in order to stop their disorderly behaviour at the police station and although the applicants had offered resistance, only the force necessary to control them and to bind them had been applied.27.  on 25 august 2010 the kyiv prosecutor’s office overruled the decision of 30 april 2010 on the grounds that the arresting officers had not been interviewed concerning the grounds for the arrest, the enquiry had not examined the allegation that ethnic prejudice had motivated the ill-treatment and, furthermore, no medical specialist had been interviewed to clarify the possible origins of the recorded injuries.the prosecutor’s office also repeated the statements of the applicants’ acquaintances who were in the taxi with them at the time of arrest and who made statements in the course of the internal police inquiry (see paragraphs 7 above and 32 below).
according to the certificate “on the sale of state property to legal entities or individuals” issued on 30 october 2003 by the ministry of economic development’s department of management and privatisation of state property, the total area of the property was 78.3 sq.9.  in 2004 the ganja city executive authority (“the gcea”) decided to renovate and widen attarlar and nizami streets in accordance with the city’s planning scheme because the streets were not wide enough for the pedestrian and car traffic.14.  in its submissions to the court, the gcea as the respondent stated that a number of “old shops and other retail facilities” on attarlar and nizami streets had been removed owing to the urgent need to widen the streets in order to accommodate the number of pedestrians and cars.the respondent argued that the compensation claimed by the applicant was excessive, taking into account the price he had paid the state for it in 2003.however, the court ordered the gcea to allocate the applicant a plot of land in ganja equivalent in size to the shop in question.
... in view of the variance of the results of the test shots, it was impracticable to identify the relevant carbine on the basis of the striae left on the obturators ... in particular, on account of the elasticity and low thermo-resistance of the material used in the obturators ...” 23.  on 15 november 2006 another ballistics report was requested from the forensic science institute of the federal security service (“the institute”).the requests were not complied with on account of the absence of the necessary equipment ... attempts were made to identify the relevant rifle in other expert institutions ... those were not equipped for this kind of forensic examination ... in consequence, the federal office of forensic examination was not able to identify the weapon ... another request is pending before the forensic science institute of the federal security service ... thus, the investigating authority has carried out all the investigative measures that were possible in the absence of an identified suspect.” 27.  on 14 january 2008 the supreme court of the republic of dagestan upheld the judgment.the decision reads as follows: “having examined the file, i conclude that the investigation did not exhaust the measures aimed at establishing the circumstances of the crime, at collecting the evidence and identifying the rifle used to cause the victim’s death ... in particular, the request for a ballistics report to the institute was submitted with volna cartridges instead of the type of cartridges used for causing the victim’s death.the criteria established by the court’s case-law when it rules on the question of just satisfaction (article 41 of the convention) are: (1) pecuniary damage, that is to say losses actually sustained as a direct consequence of the alleged violation; (2) non‑pecuniary damage, meaning compensation for suffering and distress occasioned by the violation; and (3) the costs and expenses incurred in order to prevent or obtain redress for the alleged violation of the convention, both within the domestic legal system and through the strasbourg proceedings.... rule 75 – ruling on just satisfaction 1.  where the chamber or the committee finds that there has been a violation of the convention or the protocols thereto, it shall give in the same judgment a ruling on the application of article 41 of the convention if a specific claim has been submitted in accordance with rule 60 and the question is ready for decision; if the question is not ready for decision, the chamber or the committee shall reserve it in whole or in part and shall fix the further procedure ...” 42.  the practice direction on just satisfaction claims (issued by the president of the court in accordance with rule 32 of the rules of court on 28 march 2007) read in the relevant parts as follows at the relevant time: “4.
13.  on 22 november 2007 the bailiff requested that the state committee of the real estate registry recognise k.’s ownership of the house, register it and issue a copy of the ownership certificate.14.  in reply, the real estate registry on 4 december 2007 informed the bailiff that in order to register k.’s rights to the house it needed an application from k., the original of the district court’s judgment of 24 october 2007 and receipts for the state fee and other related payments.16.  in 2008 the applicant brought a claim in the administrative court against the real estate registry and the bailiff, seeking to oblige them respectively to register k.’s ownership of the house and to confiscate it from her.in particular, the administrative court found that both the refusal of the real estate registry to register k.’s ownership rights and the non-enforcement by the bailiff of the judgment of 3 may 2005 owing to a lack of funds on the part of k. had been groundless as k.’s ownership of the house had been recognised by the final court judgment of 24 october 2007. it appears that no appeal was lodged against the administrative court’s judgment and it became final.the judgment became final on 1 april 2011. the applicant sought enforcement of the judgment on 2 april 2012 but was refused by the bailiff since he had failed to act within the time-limit of one year starting from the final judgment.
5.  in 1990 the three applicants bought from the state a flat in sofia measuring 144 square metres, which had become property of the state by virtue of the nationalisations carried out by the communist regime after 1945.6.  in 1992 the heir of the pre-nationalisation owner of the flat brought an action against the applicants under section 7 of the restitution law, seeking to establish that their title was null and void.7.  the proceedings ended with a final judgment of the supreme court of cassation on 22 june 2004. the domestic courts dealing with the proceedings allowed both actions against the applicants.in relation to the action under section 7 of the restitution law, the courts found the applicants’ title null and void, since they had bought their flat in breach of the law: the area where the flat was located had been earmarked for the construction of buildings of more than three storeys, and the applicants’ building was of two storeys; and the legislation at the time prohibited the sale of flats in such buildings.in a final judgment of 4 april 2012 the supreme court of cassation, finding that the applicants were only entitled to receive the price they had paid for the flat in 1990, which had devalued enormously over the years, awarded them the equivalent of about 12 euros (eur).

6.  on 28 october 1999 the vorkuta town court of the komi republic (the town court) awarded the applicant the equivalent of 1,591 euros (eur) in salary and allowances’ arrears against the coal mine.the court further found that awards made on 28 october 1999, 3 april 2001 and 24 april 2002 in the amount of eur 1,966 should be paid to the applicant by the ministry of energy, since the latter had been designated by the government to finance the debts of the coal mine, in so far as the salary arrears and related social payments prior to the decision to wind up the company were concerned.14.  on 7 december 2004 the town court ordered to index-link the awards of 21 january 2004 and held that the ministry of energy should pay the applicant eur 155 and the coal mine eur 41 respectively.16.  at some point the applicant claimed modification of the judgment of 21 january 2004, so that the respondent ministry be replaced in the enforcement proceedings by the ministry of industry and energy of the russian federation.17.  on 28 december 2005 the liquidation commission of the ministry of energy informed the applicant that the ministry had been liquidated and had no longer been in receipt of the funds from the federal budget and that the execution documents in respect of the ministry’s debts could no longer be accepted by the commission.

[it is] proven by the report of the panel of the hospital’s resident psychiatrists, which describes mr v.k.’s condition and confirms the existence of a severe psychiatric disorder indicating a risk of significant damage to [his] health due to a deterioration or aggravation of his psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric assistance.the arguments in the statement of appeal that legal aid lawyer mrs l. did not duly discharge her professional functions may not serve as a ground for annulment of the order, which is lawful on the merits ... ” 18.  nothing in the materials available to the court suggests that the applicant had ever been restricted in his legal capacity or appointed a legal guardian.
2.  the applicant’s complaint to the independent authority for the investigation of allegations and complaints against the police (“iaiacap”) and the initial refusal to investigate 36.  on 23 february 2008 the applicant lodged a complaint with the iaiacap (see paragraphs 99-104 below).41.  by a letter of 17 june 2009 to the iaiacap, the attorney general, referring to the applicant’s application to the court, revisited the above decision and ordered the iaiacap to conduct a formal investigation into the applicant’s complaint.43.  in their observations the government submitted that the attorney general had already informed the president of the iaiacap in a letter dated 5 december 2007 on the taking of statements from witnesses, that when a person complaining to the iaiacap was abroad, he or she should be asked to visit the iaiacap in person and provide a statement and that the government would pay the expenses for a complainant’s return to cyprus.he further informed the investigator that for safety purposes block 10 had been under renovation from october 2005 until october 2007. he provided the investigator with an undated document containing all the steps taken for the renovation of block 10. with reference to the conditions of detention, the document recorded the following (emphasis in the original): “conditions of detention based on european standards: cell size: in block 10 there are 36 cells measuring 5.4 sq.91.  in his statement to the iaiacap investigator on 15 june 2010 (see paragraph 51 above) the applicant stated the following with regards to the conditions of his detention: “the treatment i had in block 10 was good, i didn’t have any problems with the policemen, but the conditions were not good.

6.  on 27 june 2001 the obrenovac municipal court ordered a socially-owned company, holding - prva iskra ad barič (hereinafter “the debtor”), to pay the applicant specified amounts on account of compensation for expropriated real estate plus the costs of the civil proceedings.7.  on 18 march 2003, upon the applicant’s request to that effect, the obrenovac municipal court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor to pay the applicant the enforcement costs.in terms of redress, relying on the constitutional court act 2007, the applicant sought, inter alia, compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage suffered due to the impugned non-enforcement.specifically, on account of the pecuniary damage, the applicant requested the respective amounts awarded to her by the final judgment in question, whilst as regards the non‑pecuniary damage sustained she claimed 1,000,000 serbian dinars (approximately 9,500 euros (eur)).14.  on 21 may 2014 the constitutional court found, in the operative part of its ruling (u izreci), that the applicant had indeed suffered a violation of her right to a fair trial within a reasonable time, as well as a violation of her property rights and awarded her eur 1,000 in respect of the non-pecuniary damage in question.
64.  on 15 may 2009 the zagreb county court delivered a judgment finding that the applicant, in his capacity as a public official as defined under article 89(3) of the criminal code, had taken bribes (article 347 § 1 of the criminal code), facilitated bribe-taking (article 348 § 1 of the criminal code) and abused his power and authority (article 337 §§ 1, 3 and 4 of the criminal code) in connection with m.m.’s investment project in the zadar region, the privatisation of the hotels ž. and p. and the privatisation of the company b. the court sentenced him to eleven years’ imprisonment.moreover, article 35 of the constitution guarantees respect for the private life of every individual, and the court is obliged to act under the constitution ..., so if it provided the defence with the recordings concerning other individuals ... that would amount to breach of the above-cited provision of the constitution ...” 67.  as to the applicant’s plea of entrapment, the zagreb county court noted: “... this panel finds that [the evidence obtained by the use of informants] is not unlawful evidence because it was obtained on the basis of an investigating judge’s orders.... the offence of bribe-taking, which is the subject matter of these proceedings, is committed [just] by making a request for a gift or benefit, and since the witnesses contacted the state attorney after they had been asked to make a payment to the accused ... the plea of incitement cannot be accepted.” 73.  with respect to the complaint about the non-disclosure of evidence, the supreme court noted: “the argument that the rights of the defence were violated by the non-disclosure of 515 cd and 177 dvd recordings, which were the result of the secret surveillance operation, cannot be accepted ... ... it is undisputed that at the hearing held on 11 december 2008 the trial court established the exact number of recordings and found that 212 cd and twenty-seven dvd recordings had been submitted with the indictment, while it was found that the [special investigation] case file contained a further ninety-eight cd recordings concerning the secret surveillance of other persons who are not accused in the proceedings at issue.the trial court also rightly pointed to the provision of section 42(7) of the oscoc act, which provides that the material obtained by the use of secret surveillance shall be destroyed if, within the six-month time-limit, criminal proceedings have not been instituted against the persons under surveillance ... whether the state attorney, when he was making his selection of the secret surveillance material [to be submitted to the court], excluded certain evidence in favour of the accused ... is of no relevance to the lawfulness of the proceedings at issue.under the relevant provisions of the code of criminal procedure the state attorney adduces only relevant evidence concerning the substance of the charges, and therefore he is in a position to make a selection of the evidence.” 74.  as regards the applicant’s complaint of the erroneous legal qualification of his position, the supreme court noted that the applicant’s position in the fund had not been one of a “public official” but rather of a “responsible person” under article 89 §§ 6 and 7 of the criminal code.

6.  on 21 march 2008 the čačak municipal court ordered a socially-owned company, fabrika reznog alata čačak ad and its subsidiaries (hereinafter “the debtor”) to pay the applicants specified amounts on account of salary arrears plus the costs of the civil proceedings.7.  on 4 august 2008, upon the applicants’ request to that effect, the čačak municipal court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor to pay the enforcement costs.specifically, on account of the pecuniary damage, the applicants requested the respective amounts awarded to them by the final judgment in question, whilst as regards the non‑pecuniary damage sustained they claimed 2,000 euros (eur) each.14.  on 10 june 2016 the government submitted that the national bank of serbia informed the čačak first instance court, by its letter of 19 april 2016, that the final court judgment of 21 march 2008 had been partially enforced on 14 august 2008 and that the applicants had received the sum of 143.707,89 serbian dinars (rsd).lastly, the applicants’ representative submitted that the national bank of serbia had informed her in its letter of 16 august 2016 that the amount of rsd 143.707,89 was paid only to the second applicant.

the executive board sought the applicant’s suspension until the next session of the association’s general meeting (skupština) for reporting a member of the association to the police, falsely accusing him of the criminal offence of intimidation.the relevant part of that decision reads as follows: “section 26(1) of the associations act suggests that legal protection by way of civil action in the county court could be sought only if the general meeting or the other relevant body of the association had failed to examine a member’s report regarding irregularities in the implementation of the statute [of the association], or had failed to correct such irregularities.... since the plaintiff in his action does not seek [legal] protection envisaged in section 26(1) of the associations act, but asks [the court] to declare unlawful the defendant’s resolution to expel him, on which [issue] it is for the general meeting to make a final decision ... this case does not fall within the jurisdiction of the courts ...” 15.  the applicant then appealed against that decision to the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske).16.  by a decision of 2 april 2014 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance decision, reasoning as follows: “the first-instance court was correct in declaring the action inadmissible, because the case does not fall within the jurisdiction of the courts ... in particular, pursuant to section 26(1) of the associations act ... the conduct of associations is supervised by their members, and if a member finds irregularities in the implementation of the statute he or she is entitled to report it to the relevant body of the association designated in the statute or to the general meeting if there is no relevant body designated in the statute.furthermore, if the written report is not examined at the general meeting or by the relevant body of the association designated in the statute within thirty days of its submission, or if irregularities are not corrected, the member may bring a civil action in the county court within whose area of jurisdiction the registered office of the association is situated, with a view to protecting his or her rights as stipulated in the statute.

15.  on 22 november 2006 the sofia district court ordered that the child be removed from a.i.’s home and handed over to the first applicant on the basis of article 71 § 1 of the family code of 1985. on 4 january 2007 the first applicant, accompanied by a lawyer and several police officers, went to the village where a.i.(b)  police assistance for the transfer of the second applicant 26.  on 17 december 2009 the supreme administrative court quashed an earlier decision by the police to refuse to provide assistance for the transfer of the second applicant and ordered it to determine the best way to arrange it.on 7 november 2014 the social services reported to the bailiff that the support work which was to be carried out with the child had not started as the father had repeatedly failed to take the child to the social centre.63.  the fourth applicant turned to the child protection agency a number of times and the agency urged the mother to allow contact between the child and the fourth applicant, as set out in the court decision of 13 february 2012.the highest court involved, the stara zagora regional court, found more specifically that instead of pursuing a constructive dialogue with the child’s mother with a view to seeing the child, the fourth applicant had resorted to forced enforcement proceedings, which had been unsuitable in the circumstances and had meant the child had been scared to go with him as he had always been accompanied by strangers.
at the material time the first applicant was a member of one of the main opposition parties in the country, the popular front party of azerbaijan, and the second applicant was a member of an opposition group, nida.9.  on the day of the applicants’ arrest, administrative-offence reports on them (inzibati xəta haqqında protokol) were issued, which stated that they had committed an administrative offence under article 298.2 of the code of administrative offences (“the cao”): participation in a public assembly organised not in accordance with the law.members of the public were not allowed inside the courtroom, even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public.according to the transcript of the hearing in his case, he refused the assistance of the state-funded lawyer and decided to defend himself in person.19.  according to the transcript of the hearing concerning the first applicant, she stated that she had participated in the protest of 6 may 2014 and had rightfully used “improper language” in the course of the protest.
the court stated: “[the commission] established that there were documents in the state archives created by the state security bodies confirming that [the applicant] had collaborated with state security bodies in a conscious, secret, organised and continuous manner and that he had obtained favours when being promoted, as set out in sections 14 and 18 of [the lustration act] ... the commission correctly established that [the files in question] contained information provided by [the applicant], which had been used to restrict and violate the human rights and freedoms of other people on political and ideological grounds ... ” 12.  as regards the applicant’s complaints of mistaken identity, the court stated: “... the commission’s decision clearly established collaboration with security bodies by [the applicant], by determining his personal identification number, place of birth and the office that he had held.” 13.  as to his arguments that the commission had erred in finding “conscious, secret, organised and continuous collaboration” with state security bodies, the court held: “[the applicant] was entitled to obtain access to the documents attesting to his collaboration.in addition, the court considers that the above state security service documents on [the applicant’s] secret collaboration were drawn up on the basis of the rules and regulations of those bodies.” 14.  lastly, the court stated: “the court made its decision at a hearing held in private because the commission had correctly established the relevant facts [on the basis of written material] and [the applicant] had not submitted any evidence that led to different facts.” 15.  on 7 march 2014 the applicant appealed to the higher administrative court.it stated: “the fact verification commission only checks whether or not there was collaboration with the security services; there are no adversarial proceedings, the documents created and held by the [security services] are regarded as facts ...” 17.  section 13 of the 2008 lustration act provided that the name of the person concerned who had been identified by the lustration commission as a collaborator had to be published in the official gazette after final conclusion of the proceedings.25.  under section 29(1), any former holders of public office or of a position of public authority whom the commission found, after conducting the verification procedure, to have collaborated within the meaning of the act, were to be deprived of their right to exercise public office or hold positions of public authority during the validity of the law (ten years from the appointment of the lustration commission, section 42).28.  section 1 of the administrative disputes act states that for the purposes of judicial review a court decides in administrative-dispute proceedings on the lawfulness of decisions (“administrative acts”) by administrative authorities, the government and other state or public authorities (hereafter “public entities”) when, in the exercise of their public powers, they decide on the rights and obligations of individuals or legal entities in administrative matters.
the decision, based on section 98(1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973, provided that the applicant’s husband was to be compensated with a three‑room flat in a building which the municipality planned to construct.8.  by a supplementary decision of 1 september 1989, based on section 100 of the territorial and urban planning act, the mayor determined the exact location, size and other details in respect of the future flat offered in compensation, which was to measure 94 square metres.11.  in 2001 the applicant brought a tort action, claiming wrongful failure on the part of the sofia municipality to build and provide her with the flat due to her during the period from january 1993 to september 2001. in a final judgment of 6 march 2008 the supreme court of cassation, holding that the municipality was responsible for the failure to deliver the flat within a reasonable time-limit, awarded the applicant 10,000 bulgarian levs (bgn) in non-pecuniary damage and bgn 44,320 for loss of profit.12.  in 2009 the applicant brought a new tort action against the sofia municipality covering the period after october 2001. the action was dismissed in a final judgment of the supreme administrative court of 22 march 2013, on the ground that the applicant had had a special remedy at her disposal, namely the possibility provided for in section 9(1) of the transitional provisions of the territory planning act 2001 to claim monetary compensation for the expropriated property instead of compensation with a flat (see paragraph 16 below).13.  in 2013 the sofia municipality informed the applicant that the construction of the building where the flat due to her was to be located was to start in the near future.
(a)  interlocutory judgment of 17 february 2009 17.   on 17 february 2009, in an interlocutory judgment, the paris tribunal de grande instance stressed as follows: “where a diagnosis of gender identity disorder has been made following a thorough assessment and the person concerned has undergone irreversible physical changes for therapeutic purposes, it is appropriate to consider that, although the person’s new gender status is imperfect in that the chromosomal make-up is unchanged, he or she is closer, in terms of physical appearance, mindset and social integration, to the preferred gender than to the gender assigned at birth.” however, the court further found: “irrespective of the status of the authors of the medical certificates produced in support of the application, the need for a firm diagnosis means that a multi‑disciplinary expert assessment should be carried out in order to establish the applicant’s current state from a physiological, biological and psychological perspective and to investigate the persistence of the alleged disorder in his past.” the court appointed three experts – a psychiatrist, an endocrinologist and a gynaecologist – and requested them, after interviewing and examining the first applicant and consulting the medical certificates and operation reports submitted, to: “(a)  describe the applicant’s current physical state ... and the presence or absence of any external or internal genitalia of either sex; order, with the applicant’s consent, any samples and laboratory tests capable of establishing the biological and genetic characteristics of the applicant’s sex; state whether a mistake could have been made in the sex recorded on the birth certificate, or an organic or biological change could have occurred later; look for traces of possible surgery aimed at bringing about or completing a transformation of the genitalia or secondary sexual characteristics; state whether the patient has been treated with either medication or hormones; state whether the surgery or hormone treatment was carried out on account of pre-existing physical anomalies or because of the patient’s psychological state, leaving aside his deliberate intentions; (b)  describe [the first applicant’s] mental state and behaviour as regards his gender and, in so far as possible, indicate their origins and trace their development; report on any course of psychotherapy followed, specifying its duration and outcome; state whether the patient suffers from any mental disorder and, if so, specify the nature of that disorder; (c)  express a view on the possible existence of gender identity disorder, giving reasons for making or ruling out such a diagnosis; state whether, in the light of all the available individual medical data (physiological, biological and physical), the person concerned should be regarded as male or female.” 18.  the court ruled that the costs of the expert assessment should be met by the first applicant, and ordered him to deposit a sum of 1,524 euros (eur) for that purpose.after examining the documents submitted, without distorting them, and having noted, firstly, that the certificate describing surgery performed in thailand was very brief (being confined to a list of items of medical information and saying nothing about the effectiveness of the operation) and, secondly, that [the first applicant] refused in principle to undergo the expert assessment ordered by the first-instance court, the court of appeal was entitled to refuse the application for correction of the gender markers on the appellant’s birth certificate ...” 32.  the second applicant was born in 1958 and lives in le perreux‑sur‑marne.an expert assessment appears pointless since the appellant, who rejects the idea of having to undergo genital surgery, does not mention any plastic surgery performed in connection with the current course of hormone treatment, and has not produced any opinion by a psychiatrist capable of demonstrating the existence and persistence of the alleged disorder, although émile garçon’s birth certificate states that he has been married twice ... and divorced twice ...” 39.  the second applicant appealed on points of law against the judgment of 27 january 2011. he argued in particular that, in refusing his requests on the pretext that he had not demonstrated either the existence of “permanent physical or physiological change and hence the irreversible nature of the gender reassignment process”, or “the existence and persistence of the alleged disorder”, the court of appeal had breached article 8 of the convention, since the right to respect for private life implied the right for individuals to define their sexual identity and to have their civil-status documents amended to reflect their preferred gender identity, without having to demonstrate the existence of a gender identity disorder or gender dysphoria, or to undergo a prior process of irreversible gender reassignment.the judgment reiterated the reasoning of the judgment of 7 november 2008. the court stated as follows: “[a change of gender in civil-status documents may be granted only to] ‘genuine’ transgender persons, that is, to persons who have already undergone irreversible gender reassignment, and not to persons who merely claim to be ‘transgender’ on the grounds that they are regarded socially as belonging to the gender corresponding to their outward appearance, but who oppose any gender reassignment surgery or refuse to provide medical and surgical evidence of such reassignment having been carried out by means of medical treatment and surgery.” the court went on to find as follows: “granting s. nicot’s request would effectively amount to the creation by the courts of a ‘third gender’, namely persons of female appearance who nevertheless continue to have a male external sexual anatomy but can marry a man.given that [the third applicant] has not furnished intrinsic evidence of the irreversible nature of the gender reassignment process in his case, which cannot derive from the sole fact that he is seen by others as female, the dismissal of his claims by the court of appeal did not infringe the principles laid down under articles 8 and 14 of the convention ..., but rather struck a fair balance between the requirements of legal certainty and the inalienability of civil status on the one hand, and the protection of private life on the other ...” 53.  in november 2009 the high authority for health published a report entitled “medical treatment of gender identity disorders in france – situation and outlook”.
churches calculate the tax on the basis of the income tax attributable to the spouse liable to pay tax rather than on the basis of that spouse’s share of the total income.it is important to note that in case of a joint income tax assessment the spouses benefit from a special calculation method for the income tax (the so-called “income‑splitting”, “splitting-verfahren”) and furthermore from the progressive effect (steuerprogression) of the german tax system, which generally leads to a lower tax burden.as the spouses were jointly liable for income tax and the applicant’s wife’s income was below the minimum taxable amount, the wife’s special church fee was calculated as a proportion of her living expenses, which in turn were calculated on the basis of the spouses’ joint income (see paragraphs 12-14 above).34.  on 29 august 2005, 5 february 2006 and 26 june 2008 the competent tax office levied church tax on the third applicant for the years 2004 to 2006. as the applicants had opted for a joint tax assessment, the third applicant’s church tax was calculated with his income tax as a proportion of the income tax attributable to him, rather than in proportion to his share of the spouses’ total income (see paragraph 12 above).43.  the competent tax authority levied no church tax on the fifth applicant as she had no income, but on 2 february 2007 applied a special church fee of eur 3,600 for 2005 and on 27 june 2007 it charged her eur 1,860 for 2004. the amounts were calculated on the basis of the fifth applicant’s living expenses, which were calculated on the basis of her and her husband’s joint income.
the reports stated that the applicant had committed an administrative offence under article 298.2 (participation in a public assembly that had not been organised in accordance with the law) of the code of administrative offences (“the cao”).12.  a statement (ərizə) written by the applicant on 12 january 2013 at the police station and submitted to the court by the government showed that in the first case, the applicant had declared that he would defend himself in person.13.  a statement written by the applicant on 26 january 2013 at the police station and submitted to the court by the government showed that in the second case the applicant had declared that he did “not need a lawyer because of his financial [situation]”.18.  a statement signed by the applicant on 14 january 2013 and submitted to the court by the government showed that in the first case, the applicant had declared that he did not need legal assistance and would defend himself in person.20.  the record of the court hearing in the second case shows that in his oral submissions, the state-funded lawyer briefly stated that there had been elements of the administrative offence in the applicant’s actions, and asked the court to adopt a fair decision.
the criminal proceedings against the applicant in austria were suspended in accordance with article 412 of the code of criminal proceedings (hereinafter, the “ccp”) pending the outcome of the proceedings in the united states.while the first two complaints were withdrawn by the applicant, the third was dismissed by the vienna court of appeal (oberlandesgericht) on 5 november 2007. the applicant unsuccessfully requested his release also on 28 january, 8 may and 12 august 2008. the applicant’s complaints against the continuation of his pre-trial detention lodged on 7 february, 27 may and on 27 august 2008 were dismissed by the vienna court of appeal on 27 march, 24 june and 23 september 2008.17.  on 30 december 2008 the vienna court of appeal dismissed the objection of 1 september 2008, but granted the two objections of 21 july and 29 august 2008, holding that the refusal to grant the applicant access to his case file and to provide him with copies thereof constituted a violation of his rights.on 14 march 2011 the vienna court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal, holding that even though it was difficult to clarify the facts of the case after more than ten years, the applicant had significantly contributed to the length of the investigations by having absconded.on 11 may 2011 the regional court granted the objection concerning the expert, but dismissed the applicant’s complaint concerning the length of the proceedings, holding that it had been proportionate to the complexity of the case.
9.  by a decision of 24 september 1999 the bucharest county court allowed the action brought by the office of the mayor of bucharest on the ground that the document had not been in the file during the first set of proceedings and that it showed that the land claimed by the applicants was occupied by a marketplace.10.  by a decision of 29 january 2002 the bucharest court of appeal allowed an appeal by the applicants on the ground that the document invoked by the office of the mayor of bucharest was a document which did not comply with the requirements set out in article 322 § 5 of the rccp, since it had not existed at the time when the final decision of 9 april 1998 was delivered.furthermore, the court found that the domestic authorities had failed during the first set of proceedings to raise the issue of the legal situation of the land before the court without an objective reason and could have recovered the investment made on the land claimed by the applicants by bringing separate proceedings against the applicants and seeking recovery of the money.11.  by a final decision of 14 january 2003 the supreme court of justice allowed the appeal (recurs) lodged by the office of the mayor of bucharest on the ground that although the document had not existed during the proceedings which had ended by the final judgment of 9 april 1998, it concerned a pre-existing situation.lastly, it considered irrelevant the fact that the document relied on by the party seeking review had been obtained by means of the undertaking of research into other documents which had existed at the time of the judgment of 9 april 1998 and which attested to the same facts, but had not been brought before the court delivering the judgment in question.
24.  on 8 june 2009, in response to a complaint by the applicant about the length of the investigation, the chief prosecutor of the klaipėda city prosecutor’s office noted that “the investigation had not always been of sufficient intensity” (tyrimo intensyvumas ne visada buvo pakankamas) and that the prosecutor had been instructed to set a deadline for completing the investigation.the prosecutor also concluded that the workers had not been ordered by their employer to attach the metal platform to the reservoir tank because the construction manager, v.j.s., had not been at work on the day of the accident.the court further noted that attaching the platform to the reservoir tank had clearly been part of the construction work, so the employer had a duty to properly supervise the workers and to instruct them how to carry out that task safely – and by failing to do so, the applicant’s employer had acted contrary to the law.the forensic expert examined the case file and delivered a report on 17 february 2010. the report noted that there was insufficient information in the case file concerning the technical characteristics of the metal platform and the scaffolding, so the way the accident had happened could be established only in part.54.  on 4 june 2012 the applicant complained to the klaipėda regional court that the examination of the case before the district court had been so protracted that it had become time-barred, and asked the regional court to identify the reasons for that protraction.

consequently, on 26 june 2008 the administrative court closed the proceedings regarding the applicant’s complaint of 14 june 2007 about the plenary’s failure to decide (see paragraph 11 above), and awarded costs to the applicant.15.  on 21 april 2008 the applicant filed an objection against the committee’s division’s decision of 8 april 2008. on 15 july 2008 the plenary granted the objection and referred the case back to the committee’s division.on 17 december 2009 the administrative court quashed the plenary’s decision, holding that the committee’s division had not been competent to issue its decision of 8 april 2008 (see paragraph 14 above), as the case had been pending before the plenary after the administrative court had quashed the latter’s decision of 30 april 2002 (see paragraph 10 above).two days earlier, on 13 july 2010, in a decision received by the applicant on 20 july 2010, the plenary quashed the committee’s division’s decision of 8 april 2008 (see paragraph 14 above) and dismissed the applicant’s objection against the committee’s division’s decision of 5 february 2002 (see paragraph 9 above), confirming that the applicant was not entitled to an invalidity pension.18.  on 24 august 2010 the applicant complained to the administrative court about the plenary’s decision of 13 july 2010. on 22 february 2012 the administrative court dismissed the complaint as unfounded.
the application was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 31 july 2013, the day before the court extended the applicant’s detention until 6 october 2013. the court simultaneously refused the application for release, without hearing the applicant in person.to show that there was a risk of his reoffending, the court noted that prior to the opening of the investigations, the applicant had only been employed for a short period of five months, that he had not been living with his parents but probably with some friends, that on 3 may 2013 he had already been sentenced for the offence of larceny, and that currently he was under investigation in yet another criminal case on a charge of abduction of vehicle.31.  on 3 april 2014 the budapest high court dismissed the applicant’s application for release and extended his detention until 6 june 2014. while referring to the court’s case-law, the court maintained that the detention was still necessary because of the risk of his reoffending (article 129 § 2 (d) of the code of criminal procedure).however, noting the other pending case conducted against the applicant and his failed attempt to have secured a false alibi and, moreover, considering the “professional” nature of the crime and his unsettled personal circumstances, the court held that the most severe coercive measure should continue to be applied on account of the risk of his reoffending.giving the same reasons as previously, the court again stated that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged, a risk that he might abscond and obstruct the proceedings (article 129 § 2 (b) of the code of criminal procedure) and a risk that he would reoffend (article 129 § 2 (d)).
on the same day the investigator ordered forensic medical, ballistic and chemical trace examinations of the pistol and silencer, the bullets, the cartridges, the victim’s hair and nails, and the clothes that he had been wearing on 2 march 2005. report no.17.  on 4 march 2003 the prosecutor general’s office, the ministry of internal affairs (“the mia”) and the ministry of national security (“the mns”) issued a joint statement officially informing the public of the institution of criminal proceedings in connection with the murder of the applicant’s husband.however, relying on the cis convention on legal assistance and legal relations in civil, family and criminal matters of 22 january 1993 and the treaty between azerbaijan and georgia on legal assistance and legal relations in civil, family and criminal matters of 8 march 1996 (see paragraphs 66-70 below), the deputy prosecutor general stated in the same letter that the georgian authorities undertook to institute criminal proceedings against its two nationals at the request of the azerbaijani authorities in case of the transfer of the criminal case to the georgian authorities.52.  by a letter of 12 march 2008, signed by the head of the investigation department of the mns, the mns informed the lawyer that the applicant had been informed orally about the progress of the investigation.55.  on 4 july 2008 the applicant’s norwegian lawyer and the norwegian helsinki committee wrote to the prosecutor general’s office and the mns asking for the documents relating to the criminal investigation of the murder of the applicant’s husband.
thus, it was for the judge to examine the stage of the investigation, as well as the correctness of the facts established and the lawfulness of the procedural steps undertaken, and the persistence of the charges against the accused, falling short of making any findings on the criminal responsibility of the accused.29.  as to the non-disclosure of some of the material, it noted that while under san marino law an accused was granted the right to access and copy all the material in the investigation file and imposed on the judge a duty to inform the accused of the factual and legal circumstances surrounding the charges against him, the same procedural law also limited those rights for the sake of the proper administration of justice, while bearing in mind the procedural safeguards emanating from the right to a fair trial.52.  the seriousness of the elements on which the suspicion against the applicant was based (quadro indiziario), the facts and the means by which the crimes had taken place, as well as the dense network of personal relations, the involvement of family members, professionals, state representatives and government personnel who were still in service, led to the conclusion that there was a real risk that evidence, namely documentary evidence, would be tampered with and that pressure would be put on people who had knowledge of the events at issue.in so far as the applicant had claimed that there had been no proof of conspiracy or of the illicit origin of the funds, and thus that there had been no substantiation of the charge of money laundering, the court held that the original decision of 23 june 2014 had highlighted the existence of a general agreement with permanent effects (constituting the pactum sceleris) between representatives of the state and the business world, as well as the details of its aims and functionalities.64.  by a judgment of 15 october 2015 the third-instance judge confirmed the validity of the decisions of 23 april 2015 filed in the relevant registry on 29 april 2015 by the judge of criminal appeals and the decision of the inquiring judge of 9 march 2015. it reiterated its previous findings as to the various and detailed evidence which had been presented and concluded that the same applied in respect of the last two charges against the applicant, which had been the basis for the impugned decision of 9 march 2015. it noted that there existed a huge amount of data, some of which was convincing evidence (dati probanti), some highly indicative (fortemente indizianti), and some merely illustrative yet useful, which together formed an adequate framework of relevant and sufficient evidence on which to base precautionary measures.
in april 2006 the plungė district land service informed the applicant that she had to submit a written request to the authorities for the preparation of a document on the transfer of land and to actively choose a plot of land.18.  in november 2006 the plungė district land service informed the applicant about the procedure for the assessment of the value of land and the calculation methods used, and asked the applicant to agree with the assessment.the plungė district land service repeated that the document on a transfer of the land had already been prepared and the applicant had to sign it and indicate the area where she would like to receive a plot of land of equivalent value.moreover, the court held that the applicant had never changed the original wish to have the land returned in natura because she had refused to agree to the document on the transfer of land, which would have allowed her to have a plot of equivalent value returned to her.the court also held that the applicant had misinterpreted the provisions of the domestic law because she had required that she be provided with a plot of land of equivalent value and a preliminary agreement, and had stated that only then would she sign a document on the transfer of land.

8.  on 18 february 1999 the applicant filed a civil claim against the debtor company; on 26 april 2000 he filed a separate claim seeking reinstatement to a suitable position, as well as the outstanding salary payments and social benefits.9.  on 19 june 2003 the majdanpek municipal court (hereinafter “the municipal court”) ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the debtor company to reinstate the applicant to a post which corresponded to his professional qualifications and to pay him specified amounts on account of salary arrears and social insurance contributions, plus the costs of the civil proceedings.10.  on 16 february 2004, 9 march 2004, 18 and 19 october 2004, respectively upon the applicant’s requests to that effect, the municipal court accepted the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor to pay the applicant the enforcement costs.13.  on 8 april 2010 the central bank informed the zaječar commercial court of the suspension of the debtor company’s accounts for three years.15.  on 30 june 2010 the commercial court opened and closed the insolvency proceedings against the debtor company and that decision became final on 10 august 2010.

10.  on 13 january 2004 the riga city ziemeļu district court summoned the applicant to a divorce hearing by sending summons to her previous place of residence in riga – the apartment in which she used to live with her husband a.s. upon receiving the information from post authorities that the applicant did not live at the above address, on 27 january 2004 the applicant was summoned to the hearing scheduled for 1 march 2004 with a notice in the official gazette.14.  following a request by the applicant of 26 may 2004 the justice authority of the free and hanseatic city of hamburg (freie und hansestadt hamburg justizbehörde) on 27 july 2004 delivered a declaratory decision (feststellungsbescheid) stating that the requirements for legal recognition of the judgment of the riga city ziemeļu district court had not been met, as the divorced spouse had not been afforded an opportunity to present her case in the divorce proceedings.15.  following a prior request by the applicant, on 8 november 2004, the president of the supreme court submitted an application for supervisory review (protests) to the senate of the supreme court asking for the judgment of the riga city ziemeļu district court to be set aside and for the case to be adjudicated anew.besides, one should bear in mind that following his divorce form lydia heide friedel schmidt [a.s.] concluded a new marriage, which, according to section 64(2) of the civil law, could not be declared null and void, irrespective of whether the judgment of 6 april 2004 of the riga city ziemeļu district court would be quashed.” 17.  the parties differ on whether a.s. had been aware of the applicant’s place of residence and on whether the applicant had been aware of the divorce proceedings.the applicant maintained that even though she had been aware of a.s.’s desire to dissolve their marriage, she had only learned of the divorce proceedings following the death of a.s. 19.  on 3 november 2005 the applicant brought civil proceedings against a.a. claiming one half of the undivided share of the property that a.s. had acquired during their marriage.
in this connection the district court mainly relied on the trial statements of s.a., y.w.’s spouse, and l.c., his former colleague and the fact that the applicant was involved in court disputes with m.g., which showed that both she and a.g. had a strained relationship with the latter.in this respect, the judgment of the court of appeal referred to l.g.’s pre-trial statement of 29 january 2002, a.at.’s pre-trial statement of 18 february 2002, as well as the pre-trial statements of two neighbours, a.a. and a.b., made on 18 and 21 february 2002 respectively.26.  on 14 april 2009 the applicant lodged an application with the constitutional court challenging the compatibility with the constitution of certain provisions of the code of criminal procedure (hereafter, the ccp) allowing the court of cassation not to indicate reasons when declaring inadmissible an appeal on points of law.28.  on 11 august 2009 the applicant, based on the above decision of the constitutional court, requested the court of cassation to reopen the proceedings and to re-examine her appeal on points of law of 21 november 2008.in doing so, the court of cassation, inter alia, indicated that the criminal court of appeal’s conclusion concerning the applicant’s guilt was correct as it was based, among other things, on the witness statements of l.g.
12.  subsequently the qualifications commission of the bar of ukraine, at the time the highest authority in charge of the advocates’ qualifications and discipline, examined the applicant’s parents’ complaint concerning the procedure used in the appointment of l. the commission established that there was no evidence that l. had been appointed through a bar association, as required by law, in particular there was no order of the bar association or agreement with the client appointing l. it also established that there was no evidence that the investigator had issued a formal decision appointing l. as the applicant’s lawyer, as he had been required to do by law.24.  later on the same day the applicant repeated the above confessions in a formal questioning session in the presence of his lawyer, l. 25.  on the same day the applicant, unaccompanied by l., was taken to an identification parade, where y., a shop assistant who had been working on a night shift at a kiosk close to the scene of the crime on the night of the murder, picked the applicant out of a four-person line-up as the person she had seen by her kiosk shortly before d. had been killed.the court considered the applicant’s explanation for the presence of his fingerprint in the shop unconvincing since he had first mentioned the supposed visit to the shop on 15 february 2005 in the course of the retrial and had not previously mentioned that visit.55.  in the course of examination of the case against the applicant, on 14 june 2006, the applicant complained to the trial court about the beatings, handcuffing, stripping and the threats of prison rape he had allegedly been subjected to by the police.63.  on 14 march 2011 the toretsk prosecutor’s office wrote to the applicant’s father, again in response to his complaint, stating that the placing of adult arrestees in the same cell with the applicant, a minor, had been in breach of domestic law (section 8 of the pre-trial detention act) and had constituted a disciplinary infraction on the part of the police officers who had taken that decision.
9.  on the basis of the bank transfer of fees from the fiancée to the applicant in relation to the first set of criminal proceedings, the bochum public prosecution office also contacted the applicant’s bank.in both instances, the public prosecutor did not order the bank to submit the information, but pointed to the obligations of witnesses set out in the ccp and the possible consequences of non‑compliance (see paragraph 23 below).therefore, everyone who had access to the case file, such as the lawyers of the co‑accused, also had access to the applicant’s banking information, including the names of his clients who had transferred fees.the court found that the investigation was lawful, that the bank had provided the information voluntarily, that the documents could therefore only be returned to the bank and not to the applicant, and that the prohibition of seizure under article 97 of the ccp (see paragraph 28 below) was not applicable, since the information had not been in the applicant’s possession.it found that the decision was proportionate and that the safeguards were not applicable, in particular since the bank could not be considered a person assisting the applicant or a person involved in the professional activities of the applicant under article 53a of the ccp (see paragraph 27 below).
7.  according to the applicant, having received the writ of execution, he forwarded it to the commander of the military unit who partly executed the judgment (see paragraph 9 below).as the government submitted in their observations, the allowance for the period from 1 march 2003 until the date of the applicant’s reinstatement in military service as well as some additional payments due to the applicant under the judgment of 29 march 2005 had not been transferred to him.10.  as submitted by the applicant, despite his subsequent requests, the original copy of the writ of execution in respect of the judgment of 29 march 2005 was never returned to him by the military unit.11.  in 2005, 2006 and 2008 the applicant applied for an additional decision to be made in his civil case against the military unit which resulted in the judgment of 29 march 2005. he considered that an additional decision specifying the amounts to be paid to him under the judgment of 29 march 2005 would resolve his difficulties in claiming the outstanding amounts.in his application of 26 may 2006 he also asked the court to index‑link the delayed payments and claimed non-pecuniary damage for the delayed enforcement of the judgment of 29 march 2005. the military court rejected all of the applicant’s claims, explaining that he should have applied for an additional decision before the entry into force of the judgment of 29 march 2005.
8.  on 12 may 2008 the applicant association, acting through its lawyer, informed the mayor of the lesznowola commune (wójt gminy) about its intention to organise a demonstration on 19 may 2008. it indicated that the event would start at 7 a.m. and end at 10 a.m., and would include speeches by representatives of the applicant association.this authority concludes that the holding of a demonstration on this street during heavy traffic might put people’s health at risk.” 10.  on 14 may 2008 the board of directors of company x sent a letter to the applicant association referring to the demonstration planned for 19 may 2008. in the letter the applicant association was reminded that any demonstration organised on its premises would be illegal.the applicant association emphasised that the assemblies act invoked by the mayor provided for the banning of a demonstration only in extreme circumstances; the authority had failed to show that they existed in the instant case.14.  on 16 may 2008 the applicant association informed the mayor of the lesznowola commune about its intention to organise a demonstration at the same place on 26 may 2008. the demonstration was to last for a shorter time than the one previously planned, from 7 a.m. to 8.30 a.m. the applicant association assured the mayor that all public and school buses would be able to pass, as well as all emergency services vehicles.20.  on 1 september 2008 the applicant association informed the mayor of lesznowola about a demonstration planned for 2 october 2008. the time, venue and purpose of the demonstration were the same as in the two previous cases.
15.  on 29 august 2007 the prosecutor issued a refusal to open a criminal case against the law‑enforcement officers, finding, in accordance with article 24 § 1 (2) of the code of criminal procedure, that none of the elements of the crimes provided for in articles 286 and 302 of the criminal code (on abuse of powers and forced confessions respectively) had been present in respect of the actions of investigator n. or police officers s.i., k.l., s.a., sh., and k.n.nor had the court assessed the applicant’s medical record concerning the nose fracture, the allegation of the applicant having been kicked and having a footprint from a boot on his t‑shirt, the presence of a video surveillance camera at the police station which should have recorded the incident, or statements by b. that he had heard the applicant screaming at the police station.22.  on 24 april 2008 the investigative committee of the prosecutor’s office of the komi republic issued a new refusal to open a criminal case against the police officers and investigator n., finding, in accordance with article 24 § 1 (2) of the ccrp, that none of the elements of the crimes provided for in articles 130, 286 and 302 of the criminal code (on insulting behaviour, abuse of powers and forced confessions respectively) were present in their actions.the court also noted that the allegation regarding the applicant’s forced confession had been examined during the applicant’s criminal trial and had been dismissed as unfounded in the judgment of 24 april 2008. the court further noted that the trial court had examined and endorsed the refusal of 24 april 2008 to open a criminal case against the police officers.the applicant denied his guilt at trial, asserting that he had signed the “statement of surrender and confession” under physical pressure from the police officers and psychological pressure from investigator n. the trial court rejected the applicant’s arguments, relying on the refusal of 24 april 2008 to open a criminal case against the police officers and investigator n. the applicant’s “statement of surrender and confession” formed part of the evidence on which his conviction was based, and served as a mitigating circumstance.
that meant that it was for the defendants to show that the hospital had acted in accordance with professional standards and that the damage was not the result of a lack of diligence on the part of the doctor who had performed the surgery.relying on a detailed assessment of the expert reports obtained during the proceedings, the court found that on the facts of the case, the deterioration of the applicant’s health had been a result of complications in the treatment and not of medical malpractice.36.  on 17 march 2010 the applicant appealed against that judgment before the zagreb county court (županijski sud u zagrebu) alleging, inter alia, that the medical experts who had drafted the reports had a personal and professional conflict of interest in the proceedings, as they involved allegations of malpractice against their colleagues and the experts were financially dependent on the hospital system.38.  on 11 november 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske), reiterating her previous arguments concerning lack of impartiality on the part of the experts and the quality of the expert reports commissioned during the proceedings.she also reiterated her complaints as to the lack of impartiality of the medical experts, arguing that the relevant statistics showed that it had been impossible to establish her allegations of medical negligence on the basis of the expert reports commissioned from the domestic experts.
10.  on 25 april 2014 the applicant lodged an appeal, in which he argued that since incarceration his medical condition had been deteriorating constantly, that the zph doctors had themselves recommended that his prison sentence be suspended on medical grounds, and that dr b. could not give a proper opinion on his health since he was not an expert in neurology.she concluded that the applicant had not been suffering from any acute illness, that his chronic illness had improved, that he had been receiving good medical care at zph, and that it had appropriate staff to meet the needs of the applicant as regards the medical care his condition required.he further argued that the judge responsible for the execution of sentences had not addressed the contradictions between the findings the zph doctors had expressed in their opinion of 6 march 2014 and the reports of the medical experts commissioned by zagreb county court.in addition to the complaints put forward in his previous requests and appeals, the applicant also complained that during his eight months at zph he had not had proper access to sanitary facilities and had been obliged to ask the guards to let him out of the room each time he needed the toilet, a request which they sometimes had not answered in time.22.  on 18 march 2015 a zagreb county court judge responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the applicant’s request of 31 december 2014. the judge relied on previous expert opinions as well as on a further opinion of dr s., an expert in neuropsychiatry who confirmed that the applicant had not been suffering from any acute illness, that his medical condition had not worsened, and that zph had the appropriate capacity for his treatment in all respects.
7.  between 7.15 a.m. and 8.55 a.m. on 18 april 2009 the scene of the incident was examined by investigator p. from the investigating unit of the krasnoarmeyskiy district police department of volgograd with the participation of attesting witnesses, police officers, and the applicant, who lived in the same block of flats.according to the record of the examination of the scene of the incident, the applicant stated that he had physically assaulted k. and described the circumstances of the crime committed by him against k. at around 9.30 a.m. the applicant was brought to the police station of the krasnoarmeyskiy district of volgograd (увд по красноармейскому району г. волгограда), where operative police officers interviewed him about the circumstances of the crime.13.  the sizo operative unit carried out an inquiry into the incident and concluded in a report of 22 april 2009 ‒ approved by the acting head of the sizo ‒ that the applicant’s injuries had been inflicted by police officers from the krasnoarmeyskiy district police department at about 11 a.m. on 18 april 2009 during the applicant’s interview.14.  on 28 april 2009 the applicant was examined as an accused in the presence of lawyer d. the applicant stated that when examined as a suspect on 18 april 2009 he had given statements – concerning the origin of his injuries and also his brother’s involvement in the crime – as demanded by the police officers who had ill-treated him, as he had still been in physical pain and was under the influence of threats from them, as well as threats from investigator ye.18.  between 9 may 2009 and 16 june 2010 investigators from the krasnoarmeyskiy district investigative committee issued eight refusals to initiate criminal proceedings into the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment, finding, in accordance with article 24 § 1 (2) of the code of criminal procedure, that none of the elements of the offences provided for in articles 285 and 286 of the criminal code (on abuse of powers) were present in respect of the police officers’ actions.
28.  on 14 january 2013 the court of appeal, when dismissing an appeal by the applicant, emphasised that the case had been referred to the first‑instance court for examination on the merits and at that stage of the proceedings the maximum length of detention was not established either in domestic law or in the convention or the court’s case-law.lastly the court of appeal noted that the maximum length of detention during the examination of the case before the first-instance court was not established either in domestic law or in the convention, so the necessity of extending detention had to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.in the applicant’s case, the court considered that the scope of the case (twenty-seven defendants and, at that time, eighty-two volumes of case-file material) and the complexity of the investigation justified the applicant’s continued detention.the court considered that the circumstances of the applicant’s case – such as the number, nature and seriousness of the charges against him, as well as the fact that proceeds of crime had allegedly been his main source of income ‑ required prioritising the protection of the public interest over the applicant’s individual liberty.41.  from the transfer of the case to the vilnius regional court for examination on the merits on 3 december 2010 (see paragraph 17 above) to the applicant’s conviction in separate criminal proceedings on 22 may 2014 (see paragraph 38 above), a total of fifty-seven hearings were scheduled on a monthly or nearly monthly basis, and twenty-six of those hearings were adjourned: (a)  from 3 december 2010 to 31 march 2011 two hearings were scheduled but both were adjourned; (b)  from 1 april 2011 to 22 june 2011 six hearings were held; (c)  from 23 june 2011 to 7 december 2011 five hearings were scheduled but all were adjourned; (d)  from 8 december 2011 to 14 june 2012 twelve hearings were scheduled and nine of them were held; (e)  from 15 june 2012 to 3 october 2012 one hearing was scheduled but it was adjourned; (f)  from 4 october 2012 to 29 november 2012 five hearings were scheduled and four of them were held; (g)  from 30 november 2012 to 3 march 2013 two hearings were scheduled but both were adjourned; (h)  on 4 and 25 of march 2013 two hearings were scheduled and both were held; (i)  from 26 march 2013 to 6 october 2013 six hearings were scheduled but all were adjourned; (j)  from 7 october 2013 to 25 november 2013 six hearings were scheduled and five of them were held; (k)  from 26 november 2013 to 16 february 2014 four hearings were scheduled but all were adjourned; (l)  from 17 february 2014 to 22 may 2014 six hearings were scheduled and five of them were held.
13.  by the summer of 2011 a model of a prosthetic leg had been developed for the applicant, but he was unable to use it without the “prosthesis-orthopaedic assistance” needed to adjust it.18.  ten days later an ngo, the committee for civil rights, complained to the lyskovo prosecutor of the poor quality of the applicant’s medical treatment and the authorities’ failure to give him a prosthetic leg.on 8 october 2012 he received a letter from the federal service for the execution of sentences in the nizhniy novgorod region, informing him that on 2 february 2009 a medical board had only prescribed him a cane.22.  on 3 december 2012, during his stay in the hospital, the following entry was made in the applicant’s medical file: “prosthetics refusal record we, the undersigned, have made the present record to state that [the applicant] has refused prosthetics of the left limb.” (the document was signed by the deputy head and two surgeons of the prison hospital.)25.  on 10 december 2013 the applicant was transported to the premises of the nizhniy novgorod state orthopedic service, where he was given the prosthetic leg and afforded the necessary prosthesis-orthopaedic assistance.
it does not appear from the material in the case-file that the prosecutors asked the applicant’s relatives for her contact information in greece or to inform her that she had to appear before them.the reason relied upon by the prosecutors was that the applicant had absconded from prosecution when she left the country on 1 october 2008, in spite of her having given a written undertaking to appear when summoned.on an unspecified date the applicant’s representative lodged a habeas corpus application with the botanica district court in which it was argued, inter alia, that the applicant had not been aware of the criminal proceedings against her, that she had never been summoned to appear before the prosecutor’s office and that she had not been informed that she could not leave the country.14.  on 18 september 2010 the botanica district court rejected the applicant’s habeas corpus application relying, inter alia, on the fact that the applicant had formally undertaken to appear before the prosecuting authorities and courts and later failed to abide by the undertaking.15.  in july 2011, after the communication of the present case to the government, the moldovan authorities applied to interpol for an international arrest warrant for the applicant.

33.  on 29 july 2005 the state attorney’s office issued a document concerning enquiries into the killings of civilians between 1991 and 1995. the document was addressed to the county state attorney’s offices, which were required to examine all of the information collected to date on the killings of civilians during that period and to concentrate their activities on identifying the perpetrators and gathering the relevant evidence in order to initiate criminal proceedings.34.  on 9 october 2008 the state attorney’s office issued an instruction for implementation of the criminal code and the code of criminal procedure to the county state attorney’s offices, in which it stated that an inspection of their work had indicated two main problems: possible partiality of the persons involved in the pending proceedings as regards the ethnicity of the victims or the perpetrators; and the problem of trials in absentia.on the same day đ.b., head of the sisak police department in 1991 and 1992, v.m., police commander at the border territory of sisak and banovina in 1991 and 1992 and deputy of sisak police department, and d.b., a member of the “wolves” unit of the croatian army, were arrested.was found guilty of war crimes against the civilian population in that he, in his capacity as “the commander of police forces in the broader area of sisak and banovina” and “deputy head of the sisak police”, had allowed the killings of persons of serbian origin and had failed to undertake adequate measures to prevent such killings.the relevant part of the judgment concerning the applicant’s close relative reads: “on 23 september 1991 at about 7.30 p.m. four members of the sisak reserve police, wearing camouflage uniforms and grey uniforms and armed with automatic guns, arrived in a white volkswagen van bearing rijeka licence plates at the house at janko rupčić 8 in novo selo, which had been damaged the previous day by unidentified persons before using explosives.

it first gave an account of the parties’ submissions and the evidence relied upon, including the medical statement of february 2008, and then stated the following reasons: “the medical and other evidence in the case does not demonstrate that the applicant has been exposed to any such harmful influences in his work which could, with a high degree of probability, have caused his problems.as concerns the lack of an oral hearing, the chancellor of justice noted that the social insurance office and the county administrative court had held an oral hearing and consequently, in accordance with the court’s case-law, a less strict standard applied to the requirement to hold a hearing before the appellate court.thus, in view of the character of the case and the fact that the applicant had been given the opportunity to finalise his submissions in writing and the court had had access to substantial written evidence, the chancellor of justice concluded that there had been no breach of the convention in this respect.it had further accounted for the considerations and conclusions drawn from the evidence submitted by the parties, namely, that the investigation in the case did not demonstrate that the applicant had been exposed to any such harmful influences in his work which, with a high degree of probability, could have caused his problems.while the chancellor noted that it would have been preferable, for pedagogical reasons, for the court to have given clearer grounds for why the applicant’s evidence had not been sufficient, she concluded that the reasoning was not so deficient that the applicant’s right to a fair trial under article 6 of the convention had been infringed.
to the hospital had arrived at 2.45 p.m. and that the delay in his transfer had been due to the fact that the car had broken down on its way to the hospital.20.  despite the court’s explicit request to the government to submit copies of all the documents relating to the criminal investigation concerning m.m.’s death, the government failed to provide the court with a copy of chemical analysis report no.he complained, in particular, of the inconsistency between the conclusions of the handwriting report dated 6 april 2007 and the forensic expert opinion dated 25 april 2007. he also argued that the investigator and the first-instance court had failed to examine photographs of m.m.30.  on 7 may 2008 a prosecutor at the garadagh district prosecutor’s office again refused to institute criminal proceedings, using wording that was almost identical to the decisions of 26 april 2007 and 7 january 2008. the prosecutor found that it had been m.m.’s fault that the fire had broken out and that he had died as a result of his burns.31.  despite the court’s explicit request to the government to submit copies of all the documents relating to the criminal investigation concerning m.m.’s death, the government failed to provide the court with a copy of a.m.’s statement, submitting that the case file had been destroyed.
15.  by a judgment of 5 march 2012 the district court found that both disputed statements had been defamatory and ordered the applicants to pay 200,000 icelandic krónur (isk) (approximately 1,600 euros (eur)) to a in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, plus interest, isk 200,000 for the cost of publishing the judgment and isk 500,000 (approximately 4,200 eur) for a’s legal costs before the district court.it states that freedom of expression may only be restricted by law in the interests of public order or the security of the state, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights or reputation of others, if such restrictions are deemed necessary and in agreement with democratic traditions.19.  as to the reasoning, the supreme court stated: “... the aforementioned email from [the police prosecutor] can only be understood as meaning that no investigation had been instigated on account of the three reports [to the police] which are referred to in the email.with these comments, [and] with reference to the district court’s reasoning, the supreme court confirms the district court’s decision on declaring the statements null and void and confirms the publication of the judgment in the next issue of dv and the next online edition of dv after the delivery of this judgment.when examining the coverage and the publication of pictures of [the company] and its representatives in the printed issue of dv and in the online edition of [dv], [a’s] reputation was attacked, at a time when there were no grounds for it ...” 20.  by letter of 31 may 2013 the special prosecutor notified another company representative that “the investigation” into the complaints against him and a had been closed and the case had been dismissed.
6.  the second applicant and two other individuals were the heirs of a.s. in 1999 they asked the riga regional court to recognise their title to 30 ha of forest in jurmala (hereinafter “the contested property”) which had allegedly belonged to a.s. and was nationalised in 1940. they also asked the court to recognise their right to receive a plot of land of the same value in jurmala, as it had not been possible to establish the precise boundaries of the inherited land.14.  on 27 december 2002 the title to the four plots of land was entered in the land register, and on 8 and 9 january 2003 the second applicant and the other two claimants sold their respective plots to the fifth applicant, the limited liability company bulduru muiža, the owner and director of which at the material time was the second applicant.15.  on 24 october 2003 the president of the civil division of the senate of the supreme court lodged an application for supervisory review with regard to the judgment adopted on 7 may 1999 by the riga regional court, arguing that there was a lack of evidence to corroborate that a.s. had owned the property before 1940. as information received from the state archive had suggested, the contested property had consisted of undivided shares and therefore it could not be concluded that a.s. had been the sole purchaser of 30 ha of a forest.the court also observed that after the second applicant had sold the contested property to the fifth applicant, the owner of which was the second applicant himself, all the transactions involving the contested property (see paragraphs 19-22 above) had been concluded after the senate of the supreme court had revoked the final judgment in the initial proceedings.with respect to the property claim brought by the prosecutor general’s office, the senate noted that even if the state’s property rights had not been infringed, that did not prevent the court from finding that the second applicant and the two other claimants in the first set of proceedings had had no rights to the contested property.
7.  on 23 february 2005 the applicant company was granted a licence by the national television and radio commission (“the ntrc”) permitting it to broadcast in gyumri, the second largest town in armenia, and the surrounding area.10.  the srs’s report was based, inter alia, on: a)  documents requested from and subsequently submitted by gr.a., the head of the ntrc; b)  statements by the heads of companies and individual businessmen that they had placed advertisements on gala tv but had not received any documents acknowledging payment to the applicant company for such services.13.  having received no payment from the applicant company as regards the amounts stated in its report of 12 november 2007, on 26 november 2007 the srs brought a claim with the commercial court to oblige the applicant company to pay amd 25,212,800 (approximately eur 50,000) in tax debt and to freeze its bank accounts and other assets in the amount of the alleged tax shortfall.14.  on 27 november 2007 the commercial court admitted the case to its proceedings and at the same time dismissed the application to freeze the applicant company’s bank accounts.20.  on the same day the applicant company’s lawyer also asked the administrative court to summon, inter alia, the heads of the relevant companies and the businessmen, namely a.j., s.a., s.m., h.p., g.s., g.a.
6.  the background to the case, including the transdniestrian armed conflict of 1991-1992 and the subsequent events, is set out in ilaşcu and others v. moldova and russia ([gc], no.8.  in the meantime the applicant complained to the authorities of the republic of moldova about the seizure of his van and merchandise.9.  on 21 july 1992 the presidents of the russian federation and the republic of moldova signed an agreement in moscow to put an end to the military conflict in the transdniestrian region of moldova.under the agreement, a security zone was created between the conflicting parties and a joint control commission (hereinafter “the jcc”) was set up to monitor the implementation of the agreement in the security zone.10.  reports by inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations, the relevant domestic law and practice of the republic of moldova, and other pertinent documents were summarised in mozer v. the republic of moldova and russia ([gc], no.

the reports in question demonstrate that the special investigative methods used during the proactive investigation met the conditions of proportionality and subsidiarity.” ... 22.  the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of 24 june 2010. that appeal was dismissed by judgment of the court of cassation on 21 september 2010. relying on article 6 of the convention, the applicant complained that the criminal file contained neither the report on the basis of which the public prosecutor had instigated a proactive investigation on 10 may 2006 nor the documents relating to that proactive investigation.... 27.  as regards the applicant’s request for a face-to-face meeting with the undercover agents, the court ruled as follows: “having regard to the procedure followed, to the proceedings relating to the special investigative methods implemented in the indictments division from the judicial investigation to the hearing stage, to the evidence before us, to the fact that two undercover agents drew up a report and that their results were compared, to the fact that the defendants were able to call witnesses and therefore, in particular at the request of the [applicant] and the second defendant, witnesses were heard in connection with the [applicant’s] statements on the undercover agents, and to the fact that the court and the defendants were able to compare the reports on the evidence gathered by the undercover agents with such objective facts as the items discovered during the searches (e.g. the card), the conversation between the undercover agent billy and the [applicant], sms messages (e.g. between the [applicant] and billy) and telephone conversations (e.g. the conversation with the third defendant), the court considers it unnecessary for the establishment of the truth, the exercise of the rights of the defence and the safeguard on a fair trial for the undercover agents to be heard.the defendants have an opportunity at the hearing to put forward their pleas concerning the recovery of the debit indicator and to contradict the undercover agent’s version.” 28.  the court replied to the applicant’s plea that he had been unable to verify whether an undercover agent had been engaged in incitement to crime in the present case as follows: “in the present case the undercover agent only acted in the framework of the offence mentioned in point c of the indictment.as before the court of appeal, he alleged that there had been a breach of the right to a fair trial, the rights of the defence and the principle of adversarial proceedings, complaining more specifically of the use by the trial courts of evidence gathered against him even though that evidence transpired from the confidential case file, which had been brought to the attention of the defence neither during the judicial investigation nor during the investigation into the merits of the case.that restriction of the right to adversarial proceedings is exceptional throughout the proceedings and is counterbalanced by the fact that the lawfulness of the investigative methods implemented is overseen by an independent and impartial tribunal, in this case the indictments division, which has discretionary power to ascertain that the content of the criminal file, including the implementation report and the [reports] on the proactive investigation, correspond to the evidence in the confidential file.
), as applicable at the relevant time, the president of the supreme court automatically held the office of the president of the judicial council.9.  the accusation was that the applicant had committed what was classified as a “serious disciplinary offence” by failing to comply with his duties, such as abstaining from behaviour which might cast doubt on the respectability of his judicial office, abiding by the principles of judicial ethics and enhancing the good reputation of the judiciary.in particular, reference was made to the fact that the applicant (i) had filed a criminal complaint accusing the president of the supreme court of abuse of authority, and (ii) had publicly stated that the distribution of cases at the supreme court had been modified with a view to allowing its president to influence the outcome of proceedings.13.  as to the applicant’s submission to the judicial council, its president responded to it in a letter of 27 january 2010 informing the applicant that the law did not allow for decisions of the council to be challenged by means of appeals to the council and that its decisions were reviewable by administrative tribunals.17.  according to a communication from the judicial council dated 6 august 2016, submitted and relied on by the government, the applicant had addressed various submissions to the council, but had never requested it to lift his temporary suspension, pursuant to section 22(5) of the act (as applicable at the relevant time – see paragraph 24 below).
in a final decision of 5 december 2003, the court of appeal took into account the fact that, as noted in the court decision convicting the applicant, he had committed the crimes in cold blood (šaltakraujiškai), those crimes had had particularly grave consequences for society, and the applicant had two prior convictions.that being so, on the basis of the applicant’s character reports which lukiškės prison administration had drawn up for the purpose of possible transfer, the courts observed that in 2003 and 2008 he had received disciplinary punishments and had been placed for ten and fifteen days in a punishment cell, having been found in possession of a mobile phone, which was forbidden under the prison regulations.lastly, it was also pertinent that throughout his imprisonment the prison administration had assessed the applicant’s behaviour only as “satisfactory” (patenkinamai); he had not been assessed positively (teigiamai) until 2011. the courts thus held that it was not yet possible to conclude that the applicant had really changed and that therefore it was safe to make the conditions of serving his sentence less strict by transferring him to a correctional home.in a final decision in that regard, the court of appeal upheld the decision of the lower court, holding that the maintenance of the life sentence for aggravated murder was substantiated and corresponded to the basic principles for imposition of a penalty taking into account the established circumstances, the gravity of the offence and the personality of the perpetrator.44.  in 2015 the applicant asked the vilnius regional administrative court to refer to the constitutional court the question whether article 158 of the code for the execution of sentences, which prohibits life prisoners’ release on parole, was in compliance with article 29 of the constitution, which prohibits discrimination, and with article 14 of the european convention on human rights, as well as article 1 of its protocol no 12.
their agreement, which was approved by the szolnok district court, placed the daughter with her mother and granted the applicant contact every other weekend, during the school holidays, easter sunday, whit monday, the first holiday following christmas eve and three weeks during the summer holidays.the parties’ attempt to stabilise the relationship between the applicant and his daughter during the suspension of the custody proceedings were unsuccessful and the szolnok district court ordered that any meetings between them take place at a child protection centre.13.  in a judgment of 10 june 2008 the szolnok district court reduced the applicant’s contact with his daughter to every first and third saturday of the month from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. it held that the previously agreed form of contact was unlikely to be implemented and would only lead to further proceedings before the guardianship authority, which would be to the detriment of the child.the court established that since the court decision of 19 november 2008, no contact had taken place between the applicant and his daughter and, despite a request by the applicant, the guardianship authority had taken no steps to implement the judgment on the grounds that he had made no efforts to resolve the conflict with his daughter.20.  the applicant lodged a number of requests seeking to end his obligation to pay child allowance, which were finally accepted by the budapest iv and xv district court on 10 october 2012 and on appeal by the budapest high court on 3 september 2013. nonetheless, an additional request by him for the reimbursement of the child allowance he had already paid was dismissed at both levels of jurisdiction.
15.  on 2 june 2008 the slavonski brod bureau rejected the applicant’s claim, finding that it had been lodged outside the time-limit from the termination of his employment on 23 january 2007, as provided by section 31 of the job placement and unemployment insurance act (hereinafter “the job placement act”).it also noted that the applicant himself had informed the slavonski brod bureau of the outcome of the labour dispute, and had communicated with one of its officials on 27 march 2008 and 2 april 2008. he had also been informed of the consequences of the slavonski brod county court judgment setting 23 january 2007 as the day of the termination of his employment.18.  in an administrative claim the applicant argued that he had only learned about the day of the termination of his employment after receiving the slavonski brod county court’s judgment in march 2008, and that the time-limit for lodging the unemployment benefit claim should have been calculated from that date.21.  on 21 november 2008 the slavonski brod bureau found that the applicant had not been due unemployment benefit from 21 november 2000 to 31 march 2008. given that the applicant had already reimbursed part of the unduly received sum, it ordered him to reimburse the rest within 15 days of receipt of the decision at issue.22.  on 16 july 2013 the central bureau upheld the decision of the slavonski brod bureau, save in the part concerning the start of the deadline for the applicant having to pay back the money.
6.  the background to the case, including the transdniestrian armed conflict of 1991-1992 and the subsequent events, is set out in ilaşcu and others v. moldova and russia ([gc], no.7.  on 21 january 2005 the applicant was arrested by the authorities of the break-away “moldavian republic of transdniestria” (the “mrt”) on charges of robbery.8.  during the criminal proceedings, two and a half years after the robbery, the victim of the robbery was asked to identify the applicant from a picture.however, the prison guards refused to allow her to do so on the grounds that the application was not in russian and that it had to be authorised first by the prison authorities.14.  it appears from the material in the case file and from the parties’ submissions that the applicant never informed the authorities of moldova about his detention in the “mrt” or about the criminal proceedings against him.
the court held as follows: “on the basis of [the submitted documents] it appears that [the applicant] is the head of the department of pharmacology at the [yaroslavl state medical academy], so a person with organisational/executive functions; the witnesses in the case are students at the above [academy], who had been taking or were to take pharmacology exams.all of the above, as well as the position which the applicant had taken in the proceedings, gave the court grounds to believe that, if released, he might exert pressure on witnesses (the students at the medical academy), destroy evidence or otherwise interfere with the proceedings.the court found unconvincing the applicant’s argument to the effect that the students had already taken their pharmacology exams and were on summer holidays, since this did not exclude the risk of the applicant’s meeting them outside the academy.21.  on 18 may, 15 june and 29 june 2009 respectively, the investigator again refused the applicant’s requests, relying on the ongoing investigation and the risk of the family visits obstructing the establishment of the truth.28.  in view of the repeated violations of the applicant’s rights, the yaroslavl regional prosecutor’s office sent the head of the investigating department an information letter on the inadmissibility of the practice of limiting the constitutional rights of defendants and on the need to examine the issue of imposing disciplinary sanctions on the investigator in charge of the applicant’s case.
in particular, the ministry of foreign affairs of ukraine informed the applicant that it had contacted its counterpart in moldova, which had informed it that moldova could not secure the applicant’s transfer to a ukrainian prison because it did not have control over the territory of the “mrt”.in a letter to the applicant’s mother, the “mrt” authorities stated that they would only transfer the applicant to a ukrainian prison after the conclusion of a treaty between ukraine and the “mrt” which would make the transfer of prisoners possible.10.  on several occasions the applicant’s representative also contacted the moldovan authorities, enquiring about the status of the transdniestrian region and, on at least two occasions, asking them for assistance with the question of the applicant’s transfer to a ukrainian prison.in a letter of 25 april 2003 the prosecutor general’s office of moldova informed the applicant’s representative that it had contacted the prosecuting authorities of the “mrt” and requested the necessary documents to have the applicant transferred to a ukrainian prison.in another letter sent to the applicant’s representative by the office of the president of the republic of moldova, the lawyer was informed that the moldovan authorities were unable to bring about the applicant’s transfer to a ukrainian prison while the transdniestrian conflict remained unsettled.
10.  during his detention the first applicant met on several occasions with representatives of the “mrt” secret services, including the chief of the secret services, and was led to believe that his family might suffer if he refused to cooperate with them.11.  the second applicant could only visit the first applicant on a limited number of occasions during his detention and lawyers representing the first applicant in the proceedings before the court were denied access to him on the grounds that they were not members of the “transdniestrian bar association”.in particular, the problem of his detention in the “mrt” was raised by the moldovan authorities with the european union and the united states authorities in april 2010 in brussels.the moldovan delegation distributed a circular letter during the april 2010 session of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe and raised the first applicant’s situation during meetings of the committee of ministers of the council of europe in january and february 2011. the first applicant’s situation was also raised by the moldovan authorities in their discussions with the osce representatives in chisinau, and a criminal investigation was initiated by the moldovan prosecutor’s office in respect of the applicant’s detention in the “mrt”.13.  the moldovan government also awarded financial assistance to the first applicant’s family during the period of the first applicant’s detention in the “mrt” and transferred to them ownership of a flat in chisinau worth 53,000 euros (eur) after the first applicant’s release from detention.
she was released at 4.40 p.m. on the same day after a court had found that her detention had been abusive and had ordered her release.7.  in the meantime, during her detention, the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment by the police.after release, the applicant went to a hospital, where she was diagnosed with concussion and multiple bruises on her head and neck.8.  on an unspecified date, the applicant initiated civil proceedings against the state, claiming compensation for unlawful detention and ill‑treatment.9.  by a final judgment of 9 august 2012, the supreme court of justice found a breach of the applicant’s rights, as guaranteed by articles 3 and 5 of the convention, on account of her unlawful detention and ill-treatment on 22 february 2002. the supreme court also found a breach of the applicant’s rights, as guaranteed by articles 6 and 13 of the convention, on account of the length and ineffectiveness of the criminal investigation conducted into the applicant’s complaints of abusive actions on the part of the police.
709 dated 27 january 2010 concluded that the coloured elements used in the writing of the note in question and of the pen found at the scene of the crime had the same chemical characteristics.died ... and the agents of the prosecuting authorities went to the scene of the crime, but it was not possible for them to inspect the scene of the crime, given the foggy weather conditions in the mountainous area.in order to reconstruct the conditions in which the incident took place, the scene of the crime should again be inspected ...” 23.  on 11 january 2010 the investigator visited the “a” military post and inspected the scene of the crime.he complained of the ineffectiveness of the criminal investigation, pointing out that, taking into consideration that there had been a national holiday in the country from 20 to 28 march 2010, it had been impossible to carry out a new investigation between 19 and 29 march 2010. the applicant also argued that the investigator should have questioned z.b.’s parents and relatives – not the two soldiers in question – in order to establish whether z.b.despite the court’s explicit request to the government that they submit copies of all the documents relating to the criminal proceedings concerning z.b.’s death, the government failed to provide the court with a copy of the decision of 21 april 2010 of the military prosecutor of the republic of azerbaijan.
6.  on 29 may 2008 the head of the national security service issued an order withdrawing the first applicant’s residence permit, ordering his expulsion and imposing a ten-year ban on his re‑entering bulgaria on the ground that his presence in the country represented a “serious threat to national security”.it stated that the first applicant was a member of a “russian criminal group” implicated in money laundering, extortion, smuggling, illegal arms deals and the financing of “terrorist groups” on the territory of the russian federation.it said further that the first applicant had lowered bulgaria’s international reputation, by “implicating the country in the financing of terrorist organisations, transnational criminality, corruption and drug trafficking”.8.  on 12 june 2008 the first applicant applied for judicial review of the order of 29 may 2008. he denied the allegations against him and stated that his family resided in bulgaria and that the measures against him breached his convention rights.furthermore, it dismissed his arguments relating to his family life, considering that “any restriction of the rights under the convention is justified [when based] on national security considerations, in cases where foreign citizens’ behaviour threatens the national security and the public order of the state where they reside.” 10.  the first applicant was expelled on 24 april 2009. it is unclear whether the second and third applicants remained in bulgaria after that.
8.  according to the applicant’s statements, at the time, when she lodged the present application, her family was routinely disturbed in its daily life by the sight of funeral processions and the sound of people mourning by the graves.12.  on an unspecified date in 2001 the applicant received authorisation from the municipality to bury her son in the old cemetery in yamna (“the old cemetery”) in exchange for a promise not to contest the location of the new cemetery.17.  on 23 june 2003 the acting chief sanitary officer of the ivano‑frankivsk region sent a letter to the mayor of yaremche, demanding that he take urgent measures to bring the new cemetery in yamna into conformity with the applicable law.18.  on 24 july 2003 the yaremche court found that the bailiffs’ service had failed to act to enforce the judgment of 16 january 2003, but dismissed the applicant’s claim for non-pecuniary damages arising from the bailiffs’ inaction.19.  on 26 august 2003 the enforcement proceedings concerning the judgment of 16 january 2003 were terminated on the grounds that enforcement was impossible because the executive committee members refused to vote to proscribe the burials.
24.  on 17 april 2012 the director of the lublin remand centre examined his complaint and found that the search had been performed in accordance with the law and that the applicant had not been debased or humiliated.25.  on 29 april 2012 the applicant complained about another strip search, which had taken place on 28 april 2012. his complaint was examined on 29 june 2012 by the director of the lublin remand centre, who found that the search had been carried out in accordance with the law.the relevant part of the decision read: “the strip search you were subjected to was carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions and with respect for your personal dignity.” 33.  on 3 november 2012 the applicant received a visit from members of his family and was allowed to have direct contact with them.34.  on 3 november 2012 the applicant complained to the central board of the prison service about the way the strip search of 3 november 2012 had been conducted.37.  the complaint of 7 november 2012 was dismissed on 20 november 2012. the decision, issued by the deputy director of the lublin remand centre, said that the “applicant refused to undergo a strip search and only agreed to comply when the chief duty officer was called”.
i came to the realisation that the best way to approach [it] would be to file a request with the mayor of the district in order to clarify the issue, even though i had already informed the current local mayor and mayor of the tomaszów mazowiecki commune (wójt) of the allegations.the local mayor of jadwigów, z.m., whose term in office was concluded on the election of the current local mayor, ms j. g., received grants for the benefit of the village from the commune and accepted payments from the lease of the village shop.[signatures of three residents] i, other signatories of this request for a petition and all the residents believe that, thanks to the mayor of the district, they will receive a full and plausible explanation of the facts described above.” 9.  the document was sent to the district mayor before local elections which took place on 21 november 2010 (wybory samorządowe).for violating his reputation by forwarding to the mayor of tomaszów district a document on [7 october] 2010 entitled “petition”, which contained false allegations that the local mayor, z.m., arbitrarily managed funds for the benefit of the village; that he took, as local mayor, the payments under the lease of the village shop; and a statement that the community hall had not been available to the residents for the past [ten] years.” 13.  in the course of the proceedings the court examined a statement made at the village meeting on 10 february 2011 at which six residents of jadwigów confirmed that they had all been instigators of the enquiry in october 2010 which had resulted in the applicant’s document to the district mayor.the court also found that the village shop was located in the building owned by the vfb, which also hosted the community hall, and that the rent under the lease was paid to the vfb through an intermediary, its treasurer.
the wording of the decision first outlined the facts, as established by the investigation (see paragraphs 7-12 above), and concluded that the police officers had employed their service weapons in the light of the exigencies of the situation for the purpose of repelling a life-threatening attack on police officer h.gev.37.  on 12 september 2007 the lori regional court, relying on the facts, as established by the investigation, examined the complaint and decided to dismiss it, finding that the use of firearms by the police officers had been justified as they had opened fire to prevent, and protect themselves from, seyran ayvazyan’s unlawful violent actions.this in itself was sufficient grounds for rejecting the appeal; however, the court of cassation found it necessary – taking into account the fact that (a) both courts had examined the merits of the case and had reached findings on the merits, and (b) it was called upon to ensure uniform application of the law – to express a number of legal positions on the matter, which could provide guidance to lower courts in similar cases.lastly, certain investigative measures taken in the course of the criminal proceedings had been aimed at obtaining evidence concerning the circumstances of seyran ayvazyan’s death, including the inspections of the crime scene, of seyran ayvazyan’s body and of his clothes, the autopsy, the forensic examination of his clothes and the interviews with the police officers who had shot at seyran ayvazyan or witnessed the shootings.nevertheless, the court of cassation decided to dismiss the appeal on points of law on the ground that neither the lori regional court nor the criminal court of appeal had had temporal competence to examine the complaint against the decision of 3 october 2006.
following the media coverage and the discussion at the supervisory board’s meeting, the landesholding management board (the second applicant and the third applicant) commissioned lawyers and legal experts and asked them to confirm the appropriateness and reasonability of the claim for fees.conceded on 11 july 2012 that the findings of the official expert, f.s., were correct inasmuch as his services to the negotiation process had not corresponded to a fee of eur 6 million but only to a fee of eur 300,000. he further stated that, in his view, the second applicant and the third applicant had known at the relevant time that his fee was inappropriate and unreasonable.65.  on 11 march 2014 the supreme court dismissed the applicants’ pleas of nullity and the appeals of the second applicant and of the public prosecutor, but partly granted the appeals of the first applicant, the third applicant and d.b.66.  with regard to the alleged violation of article 6 of the convention, the supreme court found that article 126 § 4 of the ccp should in general ensure that two different official experts were not appointed in the preliminary proceedings and the trial, as this would result in delays in the proceedings.in the event of a dispute between the public prosecutor and the accused about the amount of the expert’s fees, it was up to the court to fix the amount and to pay the expert.
6.  on 15 january 1968 the second applicant, together with the antecedents of the other applicants, bought from the then existing local agricultural co-operative a plot of land situated on the outskirts of sofia measuring 953 square metres.they stated that the plot, once the property of their antecedents, had been collectivised in the years after 1945, but had been returned to them within the context of the process of the restitution of agricultural land by a decision of the relevant body, the local land commission, dated 27 december 1999. they claimed that under section 10(13) of the agricultural land act (see paragraph 13 below), the fact that the second applicant and the remaining applicants’ antecedents had purchased the land in 1968 could not be held against them.and ms k.s., on 5 november 2009 the sofia city court overturned that ruling, allowed the rei vindicatio claim and ordered the applicants to surrender possession of the plot.it found in particular that the land commission’s decision of 27 december 1999 was sufficient to render the claimants the owners of the disputed land.it pointed out that of the two rival claims to the same plot the law – namely section 10(13) of the agricultural land act – gave priority to the one based on restitution, and thus had the effect of rendering devoid of any legal force the contract under which the second applicant and the remaining applicants’ predecessors had bought the plot.
he had ripped the handbags from some of the victims; grabbed one of the women from behind, holding her mouth and dragging her to the ground; hit another one on the head and pushed his knee into her back so that she would fall down; and had also beaten some of them.the criminal court considered as mitigating factors that the applicant had no previous criminal record, that he had confessed to his crimes and that he had shown willingness to afford redress to the victim.15.  on 11 december 2007 the administrative court set aside the vienna security authority’s decision of 16 march 2007 for lack of jurisdiction and held that the independent administrative panel (unabhängiger verwaltungssenat – hereinafter, “the iap”) was the competent authority to examine the appeal.the iap further took into consideration that the applicant had only been 14 and 15 years old at the time of the offences, and therefore had still been in the process of reaching maturity.the serious nature of the offences and the resulting public interest in his expulsion therefore outweighed the applicant’s interest in remaining in the country.
52.  between late october and early november 2004, the inspectorate general of the cppo questioned a number of potential witnesses to the first applicant’s alleged ill-treatment: p.b., the investigator in the applicant’s case; m.s., a ministry of the interior camera operator who had recorded the applicant’s confirmation of his initial confession at the crime scene; the public defence lawyer who had been assigned to the applicant after his arrest and first interview; g.b., the judge who had ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention on 16 may 2004; two relatives of the first applicant who had attended the above-mentioned hearing; and the doctor from prison no.72.  on 21 february 2007 the tbilisi regional court ruled that the following pieces of evidence were inadmissible owing to significant procedural shortcomings in the way they had been obtained: (i)  the first applicant’s confession at his first interview on 13 may 2004 (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above); (ii)  the record of 25 february 2004 of the woman and her son handing in the psm pistol at the police station (see paragraph 8 above); (iii)  the record of 13 may 2004 of the first applicant identifying the psm pistol (see paragraph 14 above).75.  the court found that the charge of attempted murder had been proved by the following items of direct evidence, which it considered to have been obtained without any major irregularities: (i)  the written record of the first applicant’s confession given during the reconstruction at the scene of the crime on 13 may 2004 (see paragraph 12 above); (ii)  the record of his identification by the member of parliament on the same day (see paragraph 13 above); (iii)  the member of parliament’s statements concerning the private talk he had had with the first applicant on 13 may 2004 (see paragraph 13 above).in the trial court’s opinion, the same evidence as used against the first applicant had proven the charge of attempted murder against the second applicant (see the preceding paragraph): (i)  the written record of the first applicant’s confession during the reconstruction at the scene of the crime on 13 may 2004; and (ii)  the member of parliament’s statements concerning the private talk he had had with the first applicant on 13 may 2004.he specifically complained that while the trial court judges had confirmed his guilt by reference to the record of the confirmation of the first applicant’s confession during the reconstruction at the scene of the crime on 13 may 2004, that specific item of evidence had clearly been tainted by the ill-treatment the first applicant had suffered at the hands of the police.
7.  on 29 may 2008 the head of the national security service issued an order withdrawing the first applicant’s residence permit, ordering his expulsion and imposing a ten-year ban on his re‑entering bulgaria, on the ground that his presence in the country represented a “serious threat to national security”.it was stated, for example, that in 2006 the applicant and another person had attempted to smuggle into bulgaria a “highly toxic substance”, and that, also in 2006, he had threatened the seller of an expensive property in varna forcing him to choose as a buyer a person close to the applicant.in particular, the first applicant presented certificates issued by the bulgarian and the russian authorities stating that he had no convictions in the two countries and explained that in february 2008 he had travelled to russia, where, as he claimed, he would have been arrested had he indeed been searched by the authorities of that country.in addition, in his written submissions the first applicant’s representative pointed out that the allegations made in the proposal were not substantiated by any evidence, and that they could not justify a conclusion that the applicant represented a threat to national security.thus, in its view “it should be concluded that the presence and the activity of the [first applicant] amount to a serious threat to national security and to the international prestige of the republic of bulgaria.” 12.  in a decision of 29 may 2008 the head of the ministry of internal affairs’ migration directorate ordered the first applicant’s detention pending expulsion.
28.  on 11 february 2010, following the publication of 4 february 2010, mrs bettencourt brought urgent proceedings against the applicants in the paris tribunal de grande instance claiming a manifestly unlawful nuisance under articles 808 and 809 of the code of civil procedure ... she asked the urgent-applications judge to find that the reproduction of procedural documents from the file of the preliminary investigation initiated by the nanterre public prosecutor breached section 38(1) of the law of 29 july 1881 on freedom of the press (“section 38”, ...), which prohibited the publication of documents from a criminal case file before they had been read out in open court, and article 9 of the civil code, guaranteeing the right to respect for private life ... she requested that a court-ordered notice be published in le point, on pain of a coercive fine, and that the applicants be ordered to pay her, by way of an advance, compensation for her non-pecuniary damage, on account of her portrayal as an individual with diminished intellectual faculties who had been duped.the judge went on to explain as follows: “... the impugned restriction cannot be compared to the case of disclosure of professional secrets or of secrets from the preliminary or judicial investigation, on account of the possession by a journalist of documents covered by secrecy and used in publications imparting information to the general public, in so far as the journalist, who is not bound [by those secrets], is required to possess such documents in order to justify the veracity of the facts reported or the seriousness of his investigation, but also to use them in compliance with the applicable legislation.” 33.  all of the claims submitted by mrs bettencourt alleging a breach of her privacy were dismissed on the ground that such a breach had not been sufficiently established, having regard to the general public’s right to be informed, and interest in being informed, of current affairs or events in the general interest: “... the claimant has not relied on any specific breaches of her private life which would go beyond the information that it is permitted to mention in connection with the criminal case before the court of nanterre, as le point did not, in particular, provide details about any health problems she may have.” 34.  the applicants appealed.in their grounds of appeal they argued, under article 10 of the convention, that they had a duty to inform the public about a case pending before the courts which had been revived after a private prosecution, following its discontinuance by the public prosecutor, and which had given rise to wide media coverage especially on account of the personality and wealth of mrs bettencourt; that the judgment of the court of appeal had found against them solely for publishing the statement extracts and not on account of their content; that there had been no impairment of the interests protected by section 38(1) because mrs bettencourt was not the defendant in the proceedings; that there was a manifest contradiction in the court of appeal’s position, as it had declared mrs bettencourt’s action admissible on the basis of the damage sustained, while taking the view that she had not been portrayed as a weak and manipulated woman in terms of her right to respect for her private life.it gave the following reasons for its decision: “... the judgment observes that long extracts were published from the statements taken during the preliminary investigation ..., in which [mrs bettencourt] was portrayed as a manipulated and weak woman; proceeding with a correct application of article 10 of the convention ..., the court of appeal was able, without contradicting itself, to conclude from that publication, since the documents drawn up by the police during an investigation are procedural documents within the meaning of section 38 of the law of 29 july 1881, that [mrs bettencourt] was justified in claiming, solely on the basis of that publication, that she had sustained personal damage ...” 38.  on 11 february 2010 b. brought urgent proceedings against the applicants in the paris tribunal de grande instance following the publication of 4 february 2010, arguing that it had caused him a manifestly unlawful nuisance, infringing both his copyright to the photographs illustrating the article and his defence rights, including his right to be presumed innocent.if one were to accept, in those circumstances, that these two bodies of text should be examined by this court only on the basis of the strict-liability offence under section 38 of the freedom of the press act, that would lead, as the respondents rightly argue, to preventing them from initiating the debate that is warranted by the journalist’s work, within which the impugned extracts are merely one element; and they would be deprived, in the present case, of the defences made available by law to persons who are prosecuted for defamation or for a breach of the right to be presumed innocent, in other words precluding them from proving the veracity of the allegations or, at least, the journalist’s good faith, and from submitting argument to the effect that the impugned texts do not contain any final conclusions expressing a biased view that the person in question is definitely guilty.
7.  on 6 november 2006 the head of the ministry of the interior’s national security service issued an order withdrawing the applicant’s residence permit, ordering his expulsion and imposing a ten-year ban on his re-entering bulgaria, on the ground that his presence in the country represented a “serious threat to national security”.10.  through his lawyer, the applicant submitted an appeal to the bulgarian minister of the interior against the order of 6 november 2006. the appeal was dismissed on 22 december 2006, the minister pointing out, in particular, that he considered irrelevant the applicant’s argument that he had settled in bulgaria with his family.13.  in a decision of 30 october 2007 the supreme administrative court held that it was competent to examine the application, with reference to the court’s judgment in the case of al‑nashif v. bulgaria (no.14.  the judicial proceedings ended on 19 march 2009 with a final judgment of the supreme administrative court, which upheld the order of 6 november 2006. after enumerating the applicant’s alleged unlawful activities described in proposal no.furthermore, it dismissed the applicant’s arguments relating to his family and private life, stating: “any restriction of the rights under the convention is justified [when based] on national security considerations, in cases where foreign citizens’ behaviour threatens the national security and the public order of the state where they reside.”
12.  on 22 february 2002 the investigator in the case requested an opinion from psychiatrists on a number of questions, namely: (i)  whether the applicant was suffering from a psychiatric condition; (ii)  whether the applicant was sane at the time of the commission of the acts he was accused of and at the time of the assessment; (iii)  if the experts established that the applicant had been suffering from a psychiatric condition or a temporary disruption of his mental capacities at the time of commission of the act, whether he had been conscious of the meaning of his actions and whether he could control them; and (iv)  whether the applicant was in need of compulsory psychiatric treatment.13.  on 25 february 2002 the investigating prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant for the murder of k. and joined them with the criminal case concerning the kidnapping and murder of s. it appears from the applicant’s submissions that on the same day he was given the procedural status of an accused and was allowed for the first time to consult a lawyer in connection with the charges related to the attack on k. article 142 of the code of criminal procedure required that procedural rights had to be explained to a person who acquired the status of an accused, including the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer.in convicting the applicant of k.’s robbery and murder the trial court relied in particular on: (i)  the applicant’s initial confessions; (ii)  the crime scene report, which showed that the layout of the victim’s flat, the placement of furniture and the position of her body matched the applicant’s confessions; (iii)  medical evidence that the victim’s clothing and injuries matched the applicant’s confessions; (iv)  the statement of ms o.k., the victim’s friend, who said she had asked the victim to place an advertisement for the purchase of a flat on her behalf; (v)  the testimony of ms v.s., the victim’s neighbour, who stated at the trial that she had run a sausage business from the victim’s block of flats and that she had had a conflict with the victim over that matter; (vi)  the testimony of the victim’s son and daughter-in-law that relations between the victim and the daughter-in-law had been tense; (vii)  evidence from an expert to the effect that it could not be ruled out that the victim’s injuries had been caused by a knife found at the applicant’s home.moreover, the applicant’s supposed statements to the experts were inadmissible because they were marred by the same problems as the confessions that had been obtained in breach of his convention rights; (ii)  as to the other evidence, in particular the crime scene examination report and the witness evidence, it only had evidentiary value as corroboration for the applicant’s statements, but as those statements had to be ruled inadmissible to give effect to the first shabelnik judgment (cited above), the other witness evidence could also not be used to support a finding of the applicant’s guilt; (iii)  certain circumstances, such as the fact that no traces of the applicant’s presence had been found in k.’s flat, pointed to the applicant being innocent of the murder.29.  in support of its findings the supreme court also referred to material and circumstances on which the trial court had not explicitly relied: (i) the fact that “in the course of psychiatric assessment [the applicant], told the experts about [k.’s murder] under the circumstances established by the [trial] court”; (ii) the applicant’s admission in court that he had visited the victim’s flat; and (iii) the testimony of ms g., the victim’s neighbour, that she had seen the applicant in the victim’s block of flats.

considering that the applicant had breached the terms of his probation by committing a new offence, the court ordered the suspended sentence to be activated and increased the total length of the sentence by one year.8.  on 11 december 2001 the presidium of the omsk regional court acknowledged that the 1995 judgment had been unlawful in the part relating to the increase of the final sentence in connection with the prior conviction that had already been spent.the length of the sentence was varied to six years’ imprisonment, calculated from 2 january 1995 which was the date of the applicant’s arrest.11.  the applicant also tried to initiate criminal proceedings against judge b. who had given the judgment of 29 may 1995. his criminal-law complaint was rejected on the ground that the limitation period had expired.on 20 december 2005 the tsentralniy district court in omsk rejected his claim, finding that paragraph 1 of article 1070 did not apply because the applicant had been found guilty rather than acquitted and that the special condition of applicability of paragraph 2 – the criminal conviction of the judge – was not fulfilled.
the expert found that a few days after the incident the applicant’s doctor had detected a fracture in the applicant’s nose, without any displacement of the bone (nosies kaulo lūžiai be dislokacijos), and that the applicant had been granted sick leave from work for four days.the court considered that the charges had been proven by victim and witness testimony, the confessions of the accused, and the video recording from the petrol station’s camera.the klaipėda regional court held that the district court had not based its judgment on circumstances examined at the hearing but solely on the description of the charges in the indictment.however, on 28 june 2012 the klaipėda regional court dismissed their appeal, finding that the legal classification of charges was the prerogative of the prosecutor and that the code of criminal procedure did not provide for any possibility to continue criminal proceedings after the expiry of the statute of limitations.it found that the district court had erred in refusing to award the applicant pecuniary damages related to the legal costs which he had incurred in the criminal proceedings, and granted him ltl 5,000 (approximately eur 1,448) under that head, thereby increasing the total amount of pecuniary damages to ltl 5,124.45 (approximately eur 1,484).
5.  on 25 march 1996 the applicant brought a compensation claim for damages suffered as a consequence of an expropriation of his property against the municipality of bar and one of the local primary schools before the court of first instance (osnovni sud) in bar.6.  on 11 april 1996 the applicant’s representative informed the court of first instance that he had initiated a separate set of proceedings to determine the value of the above-mentioned damages.the court of first instance suspended the above mentioned civil proceedings pending the final resolution of this matter.8.  on 2 february 2004 the applicant instituted proceedings before the court of first instance in bar, against his neighbour, seeking a demarcation between their two plots of land.10.  on 14 september 2004 the applicant and the respondent reached a friendly settlement which was approved by the court of first instance on the same day.
according to the applicants, the care assistant, who was specially trained and had taken care of the first applicant for many years, was the only person with whom the latter felt secure when he needed to go out of his home, in particular to go to his office, as this involved the assistant carrying him and installing him in a car.while the parties have not specified the grounds for this arrest, it is very likely that it was on the basis of the ministry of the interior act, which allowed, inter alia, the detention for up to twenty-four hours of a person suspected of having committed an offence, and that it was related to the investigation against the first applicant.12.  the first applicant remained in the car in front of the police station until about 7.30 p.m. after that he was brought in front of the building of the blagoevgrad regional court, which was to hold a hearing to examine an application by the prosecution to place him under house arrest.14.  the blagoevgrad regional court’s decision to place the first applicant under house arrest was upheld on appeal by the sofia court of appeal on 14 april 2011. before taking its decision, that court heard evidence from, among others, a.z., who stated that she was the first applicant’s sister and a neurologist and gave evidence concerning the applicant’s state of health.24.  on 21 june 2011 the first applicant was released from house arrest, by a decision of the sofia court of appeal, which noted in particular his grave state of health and the fact that much of the evidence in the investigation against him had already been collected.
and the state real estate registry, seeking to annul e.t.’s title in respect of the first floor and the adjacent land, and to oblige her to demolish the buildings constructed without the permission of the authorities and to restore the stone wall that she had destroyed.19.  on 11 april 2006 the applicant lodged a civil claim against the kentron division of the state real estate registry, the deja and e.t., seeking to oblige the kentron division of the real estate registry to comply with the requirements of the judgment of the court of appeal of 22 august 2003 and the decision of 22 october 2004 concerning its clarification, to evict e.t.24.  by a letter of 25 december 2008 the minister of justice informed the applicant’s lawyer that the kentron division of the state real estate registry had justified the non-registration of the applicant’s title in respect of his property by pointing to the fact that the constructions situated therein had not been demolished because the deja did not have the appropriate technical equipment and workforce at its disposal.25.  it appears that until 2010 other measures were initiated by the deja, such as obliging the kentron division of the state real estate registry to perform the registration of the applicant’s title, in accordance with the judgments in his favour, and setting new time-limits for e.t.27.  following a complaint lodged by the applicant, on 3 july 2007 the district court annulled the decision of the general prosecutor’s office to refuse to institute criminal proceedings, on the grounds that the investigator had not taken proper action to verify whether the bailiffs had carried out their duties properly with a view to securing the enforcement of the above-mentioned judicial acts in favour of the applicant.
he stated that the jurors could take account of ms l.’s standing in society and in the business community, the nature of the libel (the insinuations that she had betrayed husband and family and that she had misused public funds), the mode and extent of publication (carried repeatedly in a widely-read daily newspaper), the absence of an apology, and the fact that the applicant company pleaded the defences of justification and fair comment throughout the trial.he observed to counsel: “i do find myself in difficulties because of the supreme court’s ruling [in the de rossa case] in that i can’t even indicate to a jury upper and lower in the most general terms, which i would like to be able to do because i think it would save a lot of trouble and i can’t do it because of the decision of the supreme court.” he concluded the exchange with counsel on this matter as follows: “i did think that i had traversed the question of damages and, each successive case i do, i get more long-winded about it because i started with very short charges and i used to be very surprised, one way or another, at the amounts juries brought in.” 19.  on the first issue the jury found that the newspaper had alleged an extra-marital affair between the plaintiff and mr c. on the second issue, it found that the meaning of the article was not defamatory.she stated: “[t]he position in irish law is that an appellate court will be slow to interfere with the verdict of a jury on the assessment of damages but nevertheless awards by juries are subject to scrutiny and if an award is so disproportionate in the circumstances of the case having regard to the respective rights of freedom of expression on the one hand and on the other hand the requirement under the constitution to protect the good name of every citizen that no reasonable jury would have made such an award then the award will be set aside on appeal.” 26.  she reviewed the terms used by the trial judge in his charge to the jury.even accepting that this case is one that comes towards the higher end of the scale, i am satisfied that the award made by the jury in this case was excessive and must be set aside.” 33.  she continued: “i am conscious of the firm instructions of ms. l to her legal representatives that in the event that this court came to the conclusion that the amount of the award was excessive that the court should in those circumstances remit the matter to the high court for assessment by a jury again.whilst i understand those to be her instructions i am satisfied that in the context of this case it would be desirable for all parties to bring an end to the litigation between the parties and in those circumstances it seems to me that the approach to be taken by the court should be to set aside the verdict of the jury on damages and to substitute a sum in the figure of €1,250,000 for damages.” 34.  the other, partly-dissenting judgment was given by mckechnie j. he stated that the issue was whether the award was reasonable and fair and bore a due correspondence with the injury suffered, which was essentially a matter of proportionality.
7.  the trial commenced before the kurzeme regional court (kurzemes apgabaltiesa) on 16 april 2003 and lasted until 16 july 2003. during that period at least ten court hearings were held in the presence of the applicant and his defence council.testified that they had never before met the applicant, and that p.b., who had died in the meantime, had been the instigator of some of the crimes.9.  on 7 may 2003 a.d. submitted a written request to the first-instance court for it to disregard his pre-trial statements as he had been ill-treated and tortured during the pre-trial investigation in order to force him to incriminate his co-accused, including the applicant.15.  on 25 october 2004 the criminal cases chamber of the supreme court, referring to article 442(7) of the code of criminal procedure (kriminālprocesa kodekss), declined to examine the appeal lodged by a.v.it noted that the applicant had repeatedly failed to attend the appeal hearings and that “in the criminal case at hand only the accused could maintain the appeals lodged by their lawyers”.
telephone conversations with the latter were recorded on 8 april, 22 and 27 may, 7 october 2005. four pages of transcripts of those recordings were subsequently included in the evidence in the criminal case material against the applicant (see paragraph 7 above).12.  according to a document (uzziņa) prepared by the supreme court on 27 june 2012 and addressed to the government, on 26 november 2004 an operational measure – the interception of the applicant’s telephone conversations – had been authorised until 26 january 2005. the document was based on “the supreme court’s register of special proceedings (lietvedība) relating to classified state secrets for the year 2004, volume 11, entry no 2‑4249s of 26 november 2004”.transcripts of the telephone conversations that had been of relevance for the criminal proceedings had been sent to the relevant authority (procesa virzītājs) and would be assessed in the context of those criminal proceedings.16.  on 21 december 2007 the applicant lodged another complaint with the prosecutor’s office concerning the fact that his telephone conversations with his lawyer had been intercepted and that the recordings of those conversations had been played back at a court hearing.18.  on 15 january 2008 the applicant appealed against the refusal to institute criminal proceedings and also complained that the reply of 3 january 2008 had not provided an answer to his request for evaluation of the lawfulness of i.k.’s actions and his suitability for the position of prosecutor.
10.  on 7 june 2005 the warsaw district court ordered the applicant’s detention on remand in accordance with articles 249 § 1 and 258 § 1 (1) and (2) of the code of criminal procedure (“the ccp”) (see paragraphs 25 and 26 below).the court held that in view of the applicant’s parents’ and his sister’s  testimonies there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he was charged.11.  an appeal lodged by the applicant was dismissed by the warsaw regional court on 20 september 2005. the court mainly referred to the fact that the applicant had still to undergo a psychiatric assessment.19.  following an appeal by the applicant, the judgment was quashed (in its part concerning possession of drugs) by the warsaw regional court on 9 august 2007. the proceedings were subsequently discontinued by the warsaw district court on 6 november 2007. the court found that the prohibited act committed by the applicant had not constituted an offence because of its insignificant social consequences (znikoma szkodliwość społeczna czynu).it further noted that in the present case there had been no breach of procedural provisions of the ccp since the detention on remand had been applied mainly in view of the applicant’s repeated refusal to comply with the courts’ orders.
12.  on an unspecified date in 2004 the solicitor general requested that the appeal commission of the government, acting as a second-instance body (комисија на влада на република македонија за решавање во управна постапка во втор степен од областа на денационализацијата – the appeal commission), either annul (поништи), declare null and void (огласи за ништовно) or quash through a supervisory-review procedure (укине по право на надзор) the restitution decision of 1 september 2003. the solicitor general argued that the association had submitted documentary evidence that contradicted the facts established by the restitution commission in that the land had been in use by the association and that compensation had been paid to the applicant’s predecessor.relying on section 8 of the restitution act, the appeal commission stated that: “from all admitted evidence in the proceedings it can be established that the undeveloped building land was appropriated from the [applicant’s] predecessor, that compensation was paid to the latter, and that the land in question is developed building land with playing fields and other leisure and recreational facilities, which are an integral part of camp e. the [appeal commission] established that in the present case the final restitution order was based on a wrong application of the law, which was preceded by erroneous and incomplete establishment of the facts.” 16.  on 14 august 2007 the applicant lodged an administrative action, arguing that the restitution commission, in its decision of 1 september 2003, had established the facts correctly.it referred to section 267 of the general administrative proceedings act, sections 8(1) and 10 of the restitution act, sections 1 and 2 of the protection of lakes ohrid, prespa and dojran act, as well as sections 2, 69(4) and 70 of the waters act (see paragraphs 39, 40, and 42-44 below) and relied on the fact that the land in question was part of the shoreline.in relation to this, the court emphasises that this provision does not concern only the factual, but also the legal impossibility of enforcement ... ... in view of the above-cited statutory provisions, it is undisputed that lake ohrid and its shore are ... of general interest (добро од општ интерес), which is relevant, in the court’s view, for the restitution proceedings, within the meaning of the restitution act.34.  according to a document from the land registry dated 3 september 2010, the historical records of the plot of land show that the association was granted use of the plot as of 9 march 1966. the state had at the time remained the owner of the plot, which continued to be the case until the day the document was issued.
9.  on 28 february 2006 the ministry of health issued a decision on the registration of the private health institution dr marija karanfilova’s specialist psychiatric practice (приватна здравствена установа – специјалистичка ординација по невропсихијатрија „д-р марија каранфилова„ – “the new practice”) at the same address as the previous practice.18.  the applicant company submitted in reply that the re-registration of the practice had been carried out in compliance with the inspectorate’s orders and that the fund had been aware of the changes.it also argued that the fund had implicitly recognised the legal continuity of the two entities as it had accepted reports submitted by the new practice under the contract of 2004 and had given notice of the termination of the contract to the new practice.23.  on 7 july 2006 the new practice lodged a civil claim against the fund for the payment of an undetermined sum for failing to adhere to the terms of the contract of 2004. after the new practice turned itself into the applicant company (see paragraph 14 above) the latter continued the proceedings as the claimant.the first-instance court relied in its reasoning on the difference in the tax numbers between the original practice that had been party to the contract with the fund in 2004 and the applicant company.
they challenged the compatibility of section 4 of the law on protection of the morality and health of children in the ryazan oblast with the provisions of the constitution, in particular with the principle of equal treatment and the freedom of expression enshrined in articles 19 and 29 of the constitution, and also the provisions of article 55 § 3, setting out the conditions under which the constitutionally guaranteed rights and freedoms may be restricted.... given that it is bound up with the investigation into the factual circumstances of the case, the assessment of whether the appellant’s actions with regard to the targeted and unchecked dissemination of generally accessible information were capable of causing harm to the health and moral and spiritual development of minors, including creating a distorted impression of the social equivalence of traditional and non-traditional marital relations, does not come within the competence of the constitutional court of the russian federation; nor does verification of the lawfulness and validity of the judicial decisions issued in the appellant’s case.” 23.  on 29 june 2013 the code of administrative offences of the russian federation was amended, introducing in article 6.21 administrative liability for the promotion of non-traditional sexual relations among minors.25.  on 23 september 2014 the constitutional court examined the complaint on the merits and dismissed it, for the following reasons: “... citizens’ enjoyment of the right to disseminate information concerning the question of an individual’s sexual self-determination ought not to infringe the rights and freedoms of others; in regulating of this right by means of legislation, it is necessary to ensure that a balance is struck between the values protected by the constitution.consequently, bearing in mind the sensitive nature of such questions, since they belong to the sphere of individual autonomy, and without encroaching on its very essence, the state is entitled to introduce, on the basis of the above-mentioned requirements of the constitution of the russian federation, specific restrictions on activities linked with the dissemination of such information if it becomes aggressive [and] importuning in nature and is capable of causing harm to the rights and legal interests of others, primarily minors, and is offensive in form.the fact that this ban does not extend to situations concerning the promotion of immoral conduct in the context of traditional sexual relationships, which may also require state regulation, including through [the existence of] administrative offences, is not grounds for finding that the given norm is incompatible with the constitution of the russian federation from the perspective of infringing the principles of equality as applied to the protection of constitutional values, which ensure the uninterrupted replacement of generations ... the imposition on minors of a set of social values which differ from those that are generally accepted in russian society, and which are not shared by and indeed frequently perceived as unacceptable by parents – who bear primary responsibility for their children’s development and upbringing and are required to provide for their health and their physical, psychological, spiritual and moral development – ... may result in the child’s social estrangement and prevent his or her development within the family, especially if one considers that equality of rights as set out in the constitution, which also presupposes equality of rights irrespective of sexual orientation, does not yet guarantee that persons with a different sexual orientation are actually regarded in equal terms by public opinion; this situation may entail objective difficulties when trying to avoid negative attitudes from individual members of society towards those persons on a day-to-day level.
they had not been sure whether they had reached ethiopian territory until soldiers who spoke amharic had apprehended them at around 3 a.m. when informed by the interviewer that his account in relation to his departure might not be considered credible, which would result in the conclusion that he had left the country legally, the applicant said that he could not give more details about the departure because he did not know the area well and had been following the person with whom he had fled.20.  the state secretariat for migration pointed out that the applicant had stated in the first hearing that he had been detained for a period of one year and three months, from june 2012 to september 2013, whereas in the second hearing he had said that he had been detained for seven months, from march to october 2013. it added that the applicant had also contradicted himself a number of times in the second hearing in relation to the commencement of his military training and the end of his schooling.23.  with regard to the alleged discrepancies relating to his schooling, the applicant submitted that he had difficulties with dates concerning the duration of his schooling and his age when he had started and left school, but emphasised that he had consistently stated that he had left school after eighth grade, having failed the exams to move on to secondary school, and referred to a report by easo regarding the national examination at the end of eighth grade (see paragraph 49 below).in relation to the conditions of detention, he argued that the account he had given to the asylum authorities very much reflected his personal experiences: he had stated that the prison had been dirty, that it had been very hot, that detainees had had lice, that there had been fixed meal times, and that he had been taken outside in the mornings and evenings to relieve himself.it noted that it was not apparent why the applicant’s age – he was 24 years old at the time of his interviews – or level of education should lead to different conclusions as to the credibility of his account, and considered that his two statements concerning the end of his schooling, either in 2005/2006 or 2007/2008, could not be reconciled with each other or with his student identity card, which indicated that he was a student in 2010. the court also considered that the applicant’s statements regarding the time and content of his military training lacked substance.
the photograph of the child had been placed on the booklet by mr p., who had been engaged by that company to prepare the layout of the booklet and who had found the photograph of the applicant’s son on the internet.mr p., who had been engaged by the company for the preparation of the layout of the booklet, had found the photograph on the internet and placed it on the cover page of the booklet.21.  it appears from the record of the court hearings that the applicant’s representative, g., submitted to the court that it had been established that the photograph of the applicant’s son had been used on the booklet without his parent’s consent, contrary to the requirements of article 152.1 of the civil code.25.  in an appeal against the judgment of 20 june 2008 the applicant submitted, in particular, that in taking its decision the district court had not applied the provisions of article 152.1 of the civil code of the russian federation concerning the protection of one’s image or the provisions of article 8 of the convention.regarding the applicant’s argument about the district court’s failure to examine her claims under article 152.1 of the civil code, the regional court held that the court had taken a decision on the claims as they had been submitted by the applicant, in accordance with article 196 § 3 of the code of civil procedure (see relevant domestic law and practice below).
the secretary of state, having considered the particulars of your client’s case, is satisfied that the presumption in favour of release is outweighed by the seriousness of the offence, risk of harm to the public, and risk of absconding and that your client’s detention is justified and lawful.30.  on 14 january 2011 the applicant submitted his application for permission to apply for judicial review, in which he challenged his continuing detention on the grounds that it was contrary to the secretary of state’s published policy on the detention of persons suffering from serious mental illness (“the mental health concession”); that it was contrary to the secretary of state’s published policy on the detention of persons who had been victims of torture (“the torture concession”); and that it was contrary to the principles set down in r v. durham prison governor ex parte hardial singh [1984] 1 wlr 704 (“the hardial singh principles”).32.  on 8 february 2011 the secretary of state refused the applicant’s second asylum claim and made a deportation order pursuant to section 32(5) of the united kingdom borders act 2007. the applicant’s appeal was dismissed on 7 april 2011. on 4 may he was refused permission to appeal against that decision.34.  with regard to the torture concession, the judge noted that the alleged torture which had happened some eleven years previously and which was said to be the cause or part cause of the mental illness the claimant was suffering from could have no bearing on the reasonableness or otherwise of the current detention.in particular, he noted that there was no evidence to suggest that his mental illness could not be satisfactorily managed in detention; that there was no independent evidence that he had been tortured because his scarring was only consistent with an assault by zanu-pf supporters which did not amount to torture, and there was no scarring consistent with his allegations of ill-treatment at the police station; and finally, that there was nothing to indicate the applicant’s prospects of removal at the relevant time were nil or that efforts did not take place to effect his removal.
the proceedings are currently pending before the higher administrative court, awaiting a decision on an appeal by the applicant of 26 january 2016 against a judgment of the administrative court.7.  on 3 july 2014 the applicant applied to the supreme court for a ruling that the length of the restitution proceedings had been excessive, to award him compensation and set a three-month time-limit for the court dealing with his case to decide on his restitution claim.between 25 august and 21 december 2015, the ministry of justice of the respondent state asked, on three occasions, that the relevant ministry in serbia serve the supreme court’s decision on the applicant.by a letter of 28 december 2015 (received on 10 march 2016), the ministry of justice of serbia informed the relevant ministry of the respondent state about the date of service of the supreme court’s decision to the applicant.it endorsed the findings of the first-instance panel regarding the complexity of the case and that no delays were attributable to the applicant, found that the proceedings had lasted for ten years, five months and twelve days and set compensation at the equivalent of eur 1,050.
6.  on 17 january 2008 he attended a rally organised by a basque agricultural trade union and by the gfam (a mutual-benefit land alliance), the “lurra”, on the occasion of a meeting of the technical committee of the land use and rural settlement corporation (safer) in the pyrénées-atlantiques département.the applicant pointed out that he had refrained from appealing in order to calm the situation and in the framework of a friendly settlement of the dispute that had been the cause of the rally.relying, in particular, on the 16 september 2010 decision of the constitutional council (see paragraph 16 below), it held that “the provisions of national law applied [to the applicant] were such as to reconcile respect for private life and the protection of public order in a manner that was neither manifestly unbalanced nor in breach of the requirements of article 8 of the convention”.in connection with the substantive aspect of the offence, the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s plea that a sample had already been taken from his headgear during his police custody and that he was entitled to refuse further sampling, given that there had been no dna profiling the first time.13.  by judgment of 28 september 2011, the court of cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as follows: “... the court of appeal responded adequately and cogently to the main points of the pleadings submitted to it, and characterised all the substantive and purposive aspects of the offence of refusing to undergo a biological test, of which it found the defendant guilty, in full compliance with the provisions of article 8 of the convention.”

this proposal is unacceptable, all the more so because it concerns a person who lacks the professional and moral qualities for such a position.” 11.  the letter continued as follows: “according to our information (našim informacijama), the lady in question (1)  stated in an interview published in ‘nin’[6], commenting on the destruction of mosques in brčko, that muslims were not a people (muslimani nisu narod), that they did not possess culture and that, accordingly, destroying mosques could not be seen as destruction of cultural monuments, (2)  as an employee of the bd radio demonstratively tore to pieces on the radio’s premises (demonstrativno kidala) the calendar showing the schedule of religious services during the month of ramadan, (3)  on the radio’s premises covered the coat of arms of bosnia and herzegovina with the coat of arms of the republika srpska, (4)  as an editor of the cultural programme on the bd radio banned the broadcasting of sevdalinka[7] arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value.the relevant part of the judgment reads as follows: “it is clear that the defendants’ letter was addressed personally (upućeno na ruke) to the governor, to the president of the assembly and to the supervisor for brčko district ... and it was not sent to the media ... the court established that the aim of the letter was to bring the attention of the authorities to (these) issues and to enable them to draw certain conclusions on verification of that information, and not to publish unverified information.was the author of the statement published in the newspaper was untrue, the court stated: “... on the basis of s.c.’s statement [the court establishes] that at the meeting that preceded the preparation of the letter a distinguished member of a [respondent] had informed those attending the meeting that the appellant had given a statement to the newspaper, whose contents were identical to the contents of the letter.), [the court] established that the appellant had put an invitation card, which bore the coat of arms of republika srpska, in the corner of the coat of arms of bosnia and herzegovina ...” 28.  in conclusion, the court stated: “by the letter sent to the office of high representative bd - international supervisor of the bd, the president of the bd’s assembly and the governor of the bd, the respondents damaged the plaintiff’s reputation and honour in the place in which she lives and works.45.  in view of the above, the constitutional court considers that the interference with the appellants’ right to freedom of expression was ‘necessary in a democratic society’ and that, therefore, there has been no violation of article ii/3.h) of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina or article 10 of the european convention.” 35.  according to the minutes of a meeting of the management board of the bd’s radio station dated 9 may 2003, there were two candidates for the post of the radio’s director, one of whom was m.s.
complained that the applicant had attempted to persuade people that constanţa city was divided between two gangs, “m.’s men and those who were against m.”, and that he himself had at one point been familiar with certain persons from the underworld (“persoane interlope”), namely with the v. clan, who had allegedly been at the origin of the violent incident in august 2006. he considered that the applicant’s imagination had proved to be “diabolical and of an infinite malice”, as her remarks had gone beyond what was permitted not only by freedom of speech, but also by professional deontology.the court further noted that in answering the questions of a.g., the host of the show, the applicant had provided an objective explanation for her opinion; in support of her opinion, she had submitted before the court excerpts of articles from the local press, as well as from a publication issued by several investigative journalists on the topic of public integrity, a project implemented by transparency international romania, in which the name of the mayor, r.m., was connected to several ongoing criminal investigations.15.  the county court considered that the conclusion of the television show, as drawn by a.g., was based essentially on the applicant’s statements, namely that the city was “torn between the underworld clans, in which the offenders retaliate against the mayor” (see paragraph 8 above), and that the same conclusion would have been drawn by anyone else who had watched the show.20.  while drawing a clear distinction between opinions and information, the court held that that the applicant had not put forward any argument or explanation to support her allegation that what she had expressed in the show were her opinions, and not factual elements: “by setting herself up as a connoisseur of what was going on in the local area, she had presented to the public, in the form of undeniable truth, some information that was not true”.22.  the court considered the amount of damages to be paid by the applicant to be fully justified, in view of the fact that the defamatory statements had been broadcast in prime time on a national television channel, and that the amount had been reduced by the appeal court to one quarter of the full amount claimed by r.m.
it also took some time to determine the parties who were actually to be sued in the proceedings in view of multiple deaths among the original defendants and various transactions made in respect of the property in question.it also awarded just satisfaction in respect of non‑pecuniary damage in the amount of eur 300 to the applicants listed under points 1 to 17 and eur 500 to those listed under points 18 to 28 and to the deceased predecessor of the applicants listed under points 29 to 32 of the appendix.the constitutional court noted inter alia that the district court had failed to proceed with the matter between 1995 and 2009. it also observed some of the applicants’ lack of interest in those proceedings.12.  on 22 november 2011 the district court delivered a judgment on the merits of the case, which was not served on the parties to the proceedings until seven months after its delivery.it found no further undue delays in the proceedings before the district court after the constitutional judgment of 27 april 2010. it noted the delay of seven months which the district court had taken to serve its judgment on the parties.
5.  in disputes between the applicants and the domestic pension authorities, the first‑instance courts ruled in their favour, ordering increases of their pensions based on the rise in the average wages in the country since their retirement.7.  under domestic law (see paragraph 18 below), when an appeal arrived at the court of appeal, a judge rapporteur of that court, if he or she believed that it complied with the necessary formal requirements, had to issue a ruling opening appeal proceedings (“the ruling”) and send it to the applicants together with a copy of the appeal.9.  on various dates set out in the appendix, the court of appeal quashed the judgments in the applicants’ favour, dismissing their claims for pension increases holding that the domestic law did not require the pensions to be increased in case of rise in the average wages in the country following retirement.11.  according to the applicants, the domestic courts did not send them either (i) a copy of the defendants’ appeals or (ii) a copy of the rulings opening appeal proceedings in their cases.13.  it can be seen from the material before the court that: (i)  the first to third and sixth applicants’ domestic case files contain copies of either the rulings opening appeal proceedings in their cases or notification letters from the court clerks addressed to them informing them of the upcoming examination of their cases in camera and referring to the fact that a judge’s ruling and a copy of the appeal were enclosed with the letter; (ii)  the notification letters addressed to the first and second applicants contain a note to the effect that they were intended to be sent by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt; (iii)  the third applicant’s case file also contains a copy of a letter from the first-instance court informing her that her case file with an appeal had been sent to the court of appeal; (iv)  the fourth applicant’s case file does not contain a ruling or notification letter; (v)  none of the case files contain any postal documents or registers of sent correspondence showing that the documents in (i) to (iii) above had been sent or delivered to the applicants.
9.  the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske) alleging, inter alia, that she had not had a fair hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal because judge d.p.10.  on 14 september 2011 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as unfounded and upheld the second-instance judgment.in such doubt as to exclude his participation in the adoption of the appeal judgment.” 11.  in a constitutional complaint of 29 june 2012 the applicant argued that even though n.p.had not participated at the hearings held in the proceedings at issue, there were no indications that he had not been otherwise involved in the case.he had been in a relationship of subordination (employer-employee) to the opposing party’s legal representative and the law office concerned had employed only a very small number of people.
given that only three years and twenty-four days had passed since the applicant’s conviction, and taking into account the nature of the applicant’s criminaloffence – misappropriation of property for non-existent legal services – as well as the specifics of the professional practice of an advocate, it was reasonable to conclude that the applicant had not regained high moral character within such a short time frame, to meet the requirements set out in articles 7 § 4 and 8 § 4 of the law on the bar (see paragraph 21 below).nonetheless, taking into account the fact that she had committed the criminal offence in the course of her professional practice and that her professional practice had been aimed at committing crimes, of which there were more than thirty counts, it was reasonable to conclude that the applicant’s behaviour did not meet the criteria set out in article 8 (4) of the law on the bar.in the present case, despite four years having passed since the date the crime had been committed, there was still no sufficient basis to conclude that the applicant was of high moral character within the meaning of article 8 (4) of the law on the bar.20.  the supreme court then held that the expiry of a conviction for a minor intentional crime, as it was indicated in article 8 (1) of the law on the bar, was only one of the criteria when considering the question of a person’s reputation.on the facts of the applicant’s case, the court of appeal therefore had been correct in finding that the applicant had not proven that she had regained high moral character, in particular given the nature of the criminal acts she had committed.
the presiding judge instructed the jury to disregard the counsel’s statement as referring to the applicant’s character.on 8 march 2005 the court refused to appoint a lawyer referring to the relevant legal provisions that did not provide for a right to have a state-appointed lawyer before the appeal court.the court noted that the applicant had not been provided with legal assistance in the appeal proceedings and remitted the matter for fresh consideration to the appeal court.the court also dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant’s complaint about the alleged ineffectiveness of the legal assistance provided by counsel sh.lastly, the court took into account that, prior to the jury verdict, the applicant had not complained about the quality of the defence provided by sh.
17.  in a letter of 4 september 2007 to the bar association the chief prosecutor of šiauliai region wrote that the applicant lived in the city of šiauliai and that in the course of his work as a trainee advocate he had interaction with the same investigators, prosecutors and judges with whom he had worked before committing his crimes and with those who had later investigated his crimes or examined his case in court.21.  the court of honour also held on the same day that the applicant had breached the code of ethics and imposed the disciplinary measure of ordering his removal from the list of trainee advocates, on the basis of articles 13 § 1 and 54 § 2 of the law on the bar (see paragraph 34 below).furthermore, j.k., the advocate who had been the president of the court of honour, had been questioned as a witness by the vilnius regional court and had testified that he had not been biased against the applicant; he had only had an opinion about the particular actions performed by the applicant.according to the applicant, the president of the court of honour had clearly acknowledged to the vilnius regional court that anyone who had disclosed a prior conviction had been admitted to the bar and that the applicant would also have been admitted if he had done the same.28.  as to the merits of the complaint, the vilnius regional court had been correct in its interpretation of the law on the bar and of established court practice in looking at the applicant’s crimes, their manner and scale not only in the light of the law on the bar, but also taking into account the rules for advocates’ professional ethics.
... it therefore appears from the aforementioned ruling of the court of justice of the european communities that the concept of journalism must, as such, be interpreted broadly within the meaning of article 9 of the directive, that, on the other hand, the protection of privacy can be derogated from only in so far as it is strictly necessary, and that this task of reconciliation of the two fundamental rights is the task of the member states.when regard is also had to the foregoing comments on the narrow interpretation of section 2(4) of the personal data act and the fact that a strict literal interpretation of that provision would result in a situation incompatible with the purpose of the act as regards protection of personal data, the processing of personal data with a view to publishing them in the veropörssi newspaper, and as far as the contents of this publication itself are concerned, was not conducted for journalistic purposes within the meaning of the personal data act.... having regard to sections 2(5) and 32 of the personal data act and article 9 of the data protection directive, as interpreted by the court of justice of the european communities in its preliminary ruling, the collection of personal data prior to its publication in the veropörssi newspaper and its processing in the background file of satakunnan markkinapörssi oy cannot as such be regarded as contrary to the regulations concerning the protection of personal data, provided that, inter alia, the data have been protected properly.having regard to the preliminary ruling of the court of justice of the european communities and its effect on the interpretation of section 2(4) of the personal data act, as well as all that has been said above about the processing of personal data in the veropörssi newspaper, the handover to satamedia oy of personal data collected in the background file of satakunnan markkinapörssi oy, even though they were published in the veropörssi newspaper, cannot be regarded as processing of personal data for journalistic purposes within the meaning of personal data act.the assessment would be the same if the company processed, on the basis of a request by an individual, the personal data of another individual by using some other mode of transmission.” 23.  pursuant to the above-mentioned judgment of the supreme administrative court, on 26 november 2009 the data protection board prohibited the first applicant company from processing taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in 2002 and from forwarding that information to an sms service.
9.  in october 2014 the applicant lodged a complaint with the constitutional court under article 127 of the constitution, contesting the length of the proceedings before the district court.ús 172/20150), on the grounds that, prior to lodging his constitutional complaint, the applicant had failed to exhaust ordinary remedies, in particular lodging a complaint with the president of the district court under the courts act (law no.the constitutional court further stated that only in cases where the length of proceedings was prima facie excessive at the time of lodging a constitutional complaint was it not necessary to lodge a complaint with the president of a court, and therefore the applicant should have lodged a complaint with the president of the district court.12.  subsequently, the district court scheduled a hearing for 16 march 2016. on that date the district court delivered a judgment by which it granted the applicant’s claim in part and dismissed the remainder of the claim.however, in their submissions to the court the parties failed to specify the exact date when the judgment was served on the applicant, and they did not provide appropriate evidence to confirm this.
in a report drawn up several days later, the social worker in charge of the applicant’s group said that there was no evidence of such an incident as no other inmate had confirmed the applicant’s allegations, and the applicant had not requested a medical examination.the government said the delay was because the applicant’s symptoms had not suggested that he had a medical condition that required urgent attention and because it took time to organise a medical examination outside the prison.on appeal by the applicant, the varna regional prosecutor’s office upheld that decision in august 2012. the applicant appealed further and, on 10 october 2012, the varna appellate prosecutor’s office quashed the refusal to open criminal proceedings against mr k.i., but upheld the refusal to open proceedings against prison staff.relevant reports of the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 39.  a delegation of the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (“the cpt”) visited bulgaria between 18 and 29 october 2010. the visit included a visit to varna prison.in this context, the report completed by the doctor should contain, in addition to a detailed description of injuries observed, any allegations made by the prisoner concerned and the doctor’s conclusions as to the consistency between those allegations and the objective medical findings.

the son said that on the morning of 8 august 1995 some members of the croatian army had come to their house and asked for the keys of a golf vehicle parked in the courtyard but that his grandmother had shouted at them.19.  on 9 january 2013 the first applicant asked the president’s office, the state attorney, the karlovac county state attorney, the ministry of justice and the state attorney’s department of war crimes to identify the perpetrators of the killing of his mother and grandmother.it stated that documents about the croatian army units present in veljun in the material period (those documents have not been submitted to the court by the government) showed that on 7 august 1995 at 10.30 a.m. veljun had been liberated by members of the 143rd domobran regiment of ogulin (143. domobranska pukovnija ogulin), under the command of captain (satnik) n.n.on 7 august 1995 at about noon the armoured battalion of the “tigers” first guards brigade (oklopna bojna 1. gardijske brigade “tigrovi”) under the command of captain lj.u., as well as the second infantry battalion of the first guards brigade (2. pješačka bojna 1. gardijske brigade) under the command of major a.k., had arrived.n.n., the commander of the second battalion of the 143rd domobran regiment, said that they had entered veljun on the morning of 8 august 1995. at the same time the first guards brigade under the command of i.k.

the applicant stated that had he not done so, the police officers would have killed him as they had killed a certain m., whom the police had suspected of being the applicant’s accomplice, during his questioning in the same police station on 18 march 2004. as was later found by the trial court, m. had died in the course of a robbery he had committed together with the applicant (see paragraph 54 below).32.  subsequently, the applicant was detained partly on the basis of the decision of the town court of 24 december 2004 and the decisions of the odesa regional court of appeal (“the appeal court”) of 3 june 2005 and 10 january 2006 returning the case for additional investigation, and partly on the basis of the decisions of the appeal court of 4 march, 29 july and 2 november 2005 and 10 march 2006 repeatedly extending the maximum period of his pre-trial detention.[his] statements contained information about the way the victim had been stabbed ... which was later confirmed by a forensic expert ... and which was not present in the statements of [his accomplice] ... [o]n 15 june 2004, immediately after that information was received, the police officers searched the lake which [mr sadkov and his accomplice] had indicated and found a knife, which, according to the experts’ report, could have been used to inflict the injuries of the victim ...” 37.  subsequently, the applicant took part in a number of investigative procedures, notably crime reconstructions and witness confrontations.53.  as regards the charge of murder, the court relied principally on the statements of one of the applicant’s accomplices and the applicant’s self‑incriminating statements made at the pre-trial stage, in particular during his interview on 15 june 2004 and during subsequent questioning, having noted that the applicant had been assisted by a lawyer when he had made those statements (see paragraphs 36 and 38 above).71.  in their reply to the court’s letter of 5 december 2005, the government also stated that pursuant to the ccrp the applicant had the right to study the case file and to make copies of documents after the completion of the investigation against him.

18.  on 29 july 2005 the state attorney’s office issued a document concerning enquiries into the killings of civilians between 1991 and 1995. the document was addressed to the county state attorney’s office, which were required to examine all the information collected to date on the killings of civilians during that period and to concentrate their activities on identifying the perpetrators and gathering the relevant evidence in order to initiate criminal proceedings.23.  on 9 october 2008 the state attorney’s office issued an instruction to the county state attorney’s offices concerning implementation of the criminal code and the code of criminal procedure, in which it indicated that an inspection of their work had indicated two main problems: possible partiality on the part of the individuals involved in the pending proceedings as regards the ethnicity of the victims or the perpetrators; and the problem of trials in absentia.on the same day đ.b., head of the sisak police in 1991 and 1992, v.m., police commander at the border territory of sisak and banovina in 1991 and 1992 and deputy head of the sisak police, and d.b., a member of the wolves, a reserve unit of the sisak police, were arrested.was found guilty of war crimes against the civilian population in that, in his capacity as “commander of police forces in the broader area of sisak and banovina” and “deputy head of the sisak police”, he had allowed the killings of individuals of serb ethnicity and had failed to take adequate measures to prevent such killings.the relevant part of the judgment concerning the applicant’s sons and former husband reads: “on the afternoon of 25 august 1991 a number of members of the ‘wolves’ unit of the sisak police forcibly abducted n.t.
the defendants further argued that the applicant had acted in bad faith – he had not appealed against the execution writ or the results of the public auction, and he had submitted his claim at the very end of the time-limit because he had been waiting for the market price of the apartment to increase.therefore, they argued that the applicant could not claim damages corresponding to the market price of the apartment at the time of the submission of the claim, but only the price for which the apartment had been sold at the public auction – ltl 3,390 (see paragraph 7 above).the court also noted that the applicant had submitted his claim three years after the sale and on the last day permitted by the time-limit, when the market price of housing was several times higher than in 2004. therefore, his claim for damages corresponding to the market price of the apartment at the time of the submission of the claim could be regarded as an attempt at unjust enrichment (vertintinas kaip siekimas nepagrįstai praturtėti).the court held that the bailiff had acted in violation of domestic law, firstly by failing to direct the enforcement against the applicant’s land, but also by selling his apartment at a public auction even though his debt had been less than ltl 3,000. the court considered that the bailiff had failed to respect the balance between the interests of the debtor (the applicant) and the creditor.however, the court considered that, in line with “the nature of the obligation and the principles of equity, reasonableness and good faith” (pagal prievolės esmę, atsižvelgiant į teisingumo, protingumo ir sąžiningumo kriterijus), the amount of damages in the applicant’s case had to be assessed at the moment of the unlawful act, that is, the sale of the apartment.
25.  the investigator ordered that measures be undertaken to establish the whereabouts of f. during the investigation v. denied the allegations and submitted that she had been a victim of domestic violence, that she had been threatened and beaten by the applicant, and that this had prompted her to run away with the child on 20 september 2011; she also submitted that she had moved to the village of bezdryk, where her grandfather lived, and that she had had no sexual relations with f., her uncle.28.  the experts found that the child had not been suffering from any mental illness at the time of the events or at the time of the examination; that she had not shown any tendency to fantasise; and that she was able to remember the circumstances of the events at issue and to give truthful statements in that regard.37.  in determining the place of the child’s residence, the court first established that until 20 september 2011 the child had lived with both parents and her paternal grandparents in the applicant’s flat and that all of them had participated in the upbringing of the child; the paternal grandparents had taken care of the child when both parents had been abroad for six months in 2009; when v. had been abroad for six months over 2010 and 2011 she had transferred money earned by her to the applicant to cover the needs of the family.40.  the court dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant’s allegation that the mother was negligent with the child and that she might have exercised physical violence against the child: in contrast to the results of the medical examination of 2 december 2011 documenting the injuries on the child’s body (see paragraph 15 above), the staff of the bezdryk child-minding centre had signed a certificate stating that on 1 december 2011 the child had had no injuries; furthermore, the police had refused to institute criminal investigation in respect of the child’s injuries (see paragraph 19 above).41.  relying on the united nations declaration of the rights of the child of 1959 the united nations convention on the rights of the child and article 161 of the family code, the court found that the facts did not disclose any exceptional circumstances which could justify the separation of the child from her mother.
12.  on 17 june he lodged an appeal with the supreme court against the decision of 10 june 2011. judge m.r., acting as a single judge of the osijek county court, declared it inadmissible on 27 june 2011 on the grounds that it was not amenable to further appeal.16.  on 15 july 2011 the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) declared the constitutional complaint about the decision of 10 june 2011 inadmissible, on the grounds that on 8 july 2011 a new decision extending the applicant’s detention had been adopted.the documents in the case file show that the claimant was finally acquitted of the charge [sic] that he had committed the criminal offence against the values protected by international law – abuse of illegal drugs, described and punishable under article 173 § 2 of the criminal code in conjunction with section 41 of the criminal code amendments act (official gazette no.kv-138/2011-3 of 26 may 2011 (pages 16 and 17 of the case file) shows that the claimant had already been finally convicted by the donji miholjac municipal court of the criminal offence of abuse of illegal drugs under article 173 § 1 of the criminal code, that is to say for an offence of the same type but in its basic form.when assessing the adequate amount of [just] satisfaction, the court has taken into account all the circumstances of this case: that the claimant was indicted for the criminal offence of abuse of illegal drugs, described and punishable under article 173(2) of the criminal code in conjunction with section 41 of the criminal code amendments act; was deprived of his personal liberty for 393 days; [and] that the proceedings ended by the osijek county court’s judgment no.
15.  in a final judgment of 19 december 2007 the court of appeal upheld the applicant’s conviction for threatening and insulting conduct, but reduced the sentence to 265 day-fines, amounting to a total of eur 530. it held that there was no need for a fresh assessment of the facts because the applicant had not succeeded in challenging the validity of the assessment conducted by the court of first instance.19.  in a judgment of 5 july 2011 the court declared admissible the complaint under article 6 § 1 of the convention and found a violation of that provision, holding as follows: “... 33.  the court notes that in the present case the court of appeal was invited to determine several questions relating to the facts of the case and to the person of the applicant.34.  the court takes the view that that question could not have been settled by the court of appeal without a direct assessment of the applicant’s personal testimony, particularly since the judgment of the matosinhos district court had departed slightly from the conclusions of the psychiatric report without setting out the reasons for such a departure, as required under domestic law ... the court of appeal’s re-examination of that question should therefore have comprised a full rehearing of the applicant ... 35.  those factors are sufficient for the court to conclude that in the instant case a public hearing should have been held before the appellate court.on the other hand, it considers it appropriate to award the applicant eur 2,400 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.” 21.  on 5 july 2012 the portuguese government submitted an action plan to the committee of ministers concerning the execution of the court’s judgment of 5 july 2011. they confirmed that the amount awarded to the applicant had been paid to her on 14 december 2011. as regards the general measures, the government pointed out that the prime minister’s office had proposed amending the code of criminal procedure to allow hearings to be held in any court of appeal determining the issue of guilt or the sentence in respect of an accused person.for that reason, being aware that it is not always possible to secure a retrial or the reopening of proceedings under the applicable domestic law, as in the present case, the european court decided to require the portuguese state to compensate the applicant in respect of non-pecuniary damage, and thus to afford redress not for the unfairness of the conviction, which has not been established, but for a serious defect in the conduct of the proceedings which infringed the applicant’s defence rights ... for the above reasons, the applicant’s argument in support of her application to be granted a review is not substantiated.
15.  on 11 october 2011 the ministry ordered the police to produce a new assessment of the background check on the applicant, on the grounds that the report of 22 february 2011 (see paragraph 9 above) had not been substantiated with the relevant evidence.19.  on 14 april 2012 the applicant asked the police to disclose the relevant reports containing the allegations against him, in particular the identity of those who had seen him under the influence of alcohol and the date and place when that had happened.the relevant part of the administrative court’s decision reads: “by examining the classified file of the defendant the court ... established that the police officer’s conduct, while searching for and collecting information from citizens, ... was in accordance with the by-law on the conduct of the police in the procedure for issuing a licence for the procurement of weapons to a natural person ... and, based on data and information collected from interviewed citizens, found that the plaintiff is prone to common and excessive alcohol abuse, which indicates a possibility of weapons abuse.... consequently, the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant wrongly applied the substantive law, is unfounded, while the plaintiff’s objection that the medical certificate is sufficient evidence showing that the defendant wrongly determined the facts of the case was not accepted by this court because the medical fitness for possessing and carrying weapons which is established through a certificate of medical fitness is only a special requirement for the weapons acquisition permit to natural persons within the meaning of section 10 paragraph 3(1) of the weapons act, while the defendant acting in accordance with the [above-cited] by-law ... established that the plaintiff does not meet the requirement of section article 10(5) of the weapons act, as one of the general requirements which natural persons need to meet in order to be issued a firearms licence.” 25.  the applicant challenged this decision before the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske), complaining that he had been denied access to the evidence containing allegations against him and that therefore he had been left without any opportunity to challenge those allegations.the constitutional court held that since the applicant had had access to the police reports on his background check, which contained details for dismissing his request (see bakırcı the reports referred to in paragraphs 9 and 16 above), the fact that further details on which those report had been based, including personal details about individuals who had provided information to the police, had not been disclosed to him did not infringe any of his rights.
10.  the municipal councils of the three municipalities belonging to the police district – the municipal council of pepinster on 23 june 2008, dison on 26 june 2008 and verviers on 30 june 2008 – enacted the following provisions of the consolidated by-laws of the vesdre police district, which differed, moreover, from the original proposal.she argued that the provision in question expressly targeted the islamic veil, which she wore, and that the resulting ban constituted an interference with her rights guaranteed by articles 8, 9 and 10 of the convention and discrimination in breach of article 14 of the convention.in any event, even supposing that the aim could be regarded as legitimate, the applicant maintained that the means were disproportionate in the absence of public disorder or threat of public disorder and thus of a pressing social need.12.  the auditeur at the conseil d’état delivered a detailed 26-page report in which he concluded that in his opinion the applicant’s above-mentioned submission was well founded because public safety could not serve as a basis for a ban on wearing the full-face veil in all places generally open to the public, as no specific public disorder was associated with it as such.213.849 of 15 june 2011, the conseil d’état, refusing to follow the opinion of the auditeur, dismissed the application for annulment of the provision ... .

7.  the second applicant attended the demonstration of 2 april 2011. the first and third applicants attended the demonstration of 17 april 2011. according to the first applicant, he also intended to participate in the demonstration of 20 october 2012.9.  the bcea refused to authorise those demonstrations at the places indicated by the organisers and proposed a different location on the outskirts of baku – the grounds of a driving school situated in the 20th residential area of the sabail district.12.  according to the fourth applicant, prior to the rally of 18 october 2011, on 9 october 2011, he and the other organisers gave notice to the relevant authority, the goychay district executive authority (“the gdea”).18.  according to the first and third applicants, after being arrested during the dispersal of the demonstration of 17 april 2011 and brought to a police station, they were subjected to ill-treatment by the deputy chief of the nasimi district police office, police officer s.n.21.  the applicants raised their ill-treatment complaints during the administrative proceedings following their arrest on 17 april 2011. namely, in their appeals against the first-instance court’s decisions the applicants complained that they had been ill-treated during their police custody, and requested the baku court of appeal to order a forensic examination of their injuries, to question particular witnesses and to obtain the review of the medical records drawn up at their check-in to a detention facility where they had served their sentence.

7.  on 1 july 1996 the applicant asked the kardzhali municipal council (“the municipal council”) to sell to her the first floor of the shopping centre under the preferential privatisation procedure for tenants of state- and municipally-owned property as provided for in section 35 (1) of the transformation and privatisation of state and municipally-owned enterprises act (закон за преобразуване и приватизация на държавни и общински предприятия) (“the privatisation act”).on 20 february 2004 the kardzhali regional court quashed the council’s refusal and instructed it to open a privatisation procedure under which it would offer the applicant the option to buy the first floor of the shopping centre under preferential conditions, in accordance with the privatisation act.the applicant’s challenge to the municipality’s tacit refusal was dismissed as inadmissible by the kardzhali administrative court on 7 october 2009. the court found that the municipality’s failure to sell to her the entirety of the property, as decided in the final judgment of 18 february 2005 in the applicant’s favour (see paragraph 8 above), did not constitute a new refusal to initiate a privatisation procedure; rather, it represented a failure on the part of the authorities in question to comply with the said final judgment ordering the start of that privatisation procedure.16.  the sofia administrative court rejected her claim on 10 november 2008. the court found in particular that the applicant had not proved her claim in respect of the pecuniary damages she had sought, given that there had been no certainty that, had the municipality made an offer, she would have actually paid the price for the property and thus completed the deal.that part was identified as consisting of two separate units, which she claimed were due to her on the basis of the final judgment of 18 february 2005. in response to a request made by the applicant on 21 june 2013 to be offered to buy the remaining part of the shopping centre’s first floor, the municipal council decided in december 2013, on the advice of the municipal council’s counsel, as well as on the basis of various expert reports, to offer her the option to buy the remaining part of the shopping centre’s first floor.
9.  with respect to the applicant, the court established that on 31 march 1999 at a customs control point he had acted contrary to the applicable regulations in the processing of documentation for the importation of the used semi-trailer.14.  the court relied on a set of documentary evidence attesting to the fact that the documentation for the semi-trailer in question had been processed by the applicant and that the semi-trailer had not entered the customs territory.25.  the appellate court referred to the evidence of witness e.a., i.e., that the semi-trailer had not been at the customs warehouse and the customs officer could not have inspected it.however, it deemed that the applicant’s contention – that a customs broker and not a customs officer had been responsible for the truthfulness of the information – indicated that, in fact, the applicant had not verified anything.he insisted that the evidence attested to the fact that he had verified the power of attorney and had compared the bank accounts indicated in the payment orders.
.... of the nafplio three‑member court of appeal by which he was convicted of ... to a total sentence of ... requesting that the decision under appeal be set aside and that he be acquitted from the charge for the reasons he will cite before the appeal court.” 8.  under the above paragraph there was an empty space and then followed the phrases: “he appoints as his representative the lawyer practising in nafplio ...(name).9.  the registrar completed the pre-printed form with the applicant’s personal data, the number of the decision against which he wished to lodge the appeal, the sentence that was imposed to him and the name of the applicant’s representative.the president of the appeal court did not agree with the majority of the panel, expressing the view that from the phrase “...for the reasons he will cite before the appeal court”, one could easily infer that the applicant was complaining about erroneous assessment of the evidence by the court of first instance.the applicant submitted that it was standard practice in all appeal courts for the defendants to be given a pre-printed form which included the phrase: “because the court of first instance did not assess correctly the facts of the case and declared the defendant guilty of an act he did not commit and for the reasons he will cite before the appeal court”.12.  the court of cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as unfounded on the grounds that the content of the appeal was the applicant’s responsibility, as distinct from the formalities which were the responsibility of the registrar (decision no.
it was noted in the description of the facts in the bill of indictment that in 2002 the applicant had sold a flat and that with part of the money had bought several one hundred dollar bills from a person on the street.he admitted that he was uncertain whether the counterfeit notes found in the applicant’s home by the police had been the ones the applicant had acquired in 2002.finding in addition that he had been aware at the time of obtaining those notes that they had been counterfeit (the key evidence in that regard had been a statement by the applicant made in a telephone conversation with another person on 9 january 2007), the regional court found him guilty of that charge.14.  in an appeal on points of law lodged with the supreme court of cassation, the applicant stated in particular the following: “the two lower instances established unconditionally that [the applicant] had bought the five counterfeit dollar bank notes in the spring of 2002 with money given to him by his brother.there can only be guesses ... and a conviction cannot be based on guesses.” 15.  in a final judgment of 24 november 2008 the supreme court of cassation upheld the court of appeal’s judgment, failing to comment on the applicant’s argument that it had not been shown that he had acquired the counterfeit bank notes after 26 march 2005.
(α)  air pollution 19.  an expert examination dated 28 october 2002 and carried out by the expertise and special research centre at the ministry of justice concluded as follows: “as the “tboelectrocentrali” plant does not have a [buffer] zone and is immediately adjacent to a residential building, the plant’s chimneys must be equipped with appropriate filters and other equipment to protect the population from the hazardous gases.” 20.  on 17 january 2003 the institute of environmental protection (“the iep”) at the ministry of environment issued an expert opinion on the air pollution and noise levels in the residential area concerned.it noted that while the plant’s equipment responsible for the emission of toxic substances stood idle, it was impossible to determine the real pollution situation with which the residents had had to cope for years and noted that “the results were considerably minimised compared to the possible real picture.” 21.  the expert opinion disclosed that the plant’s technical compliance document was defective as it did not reveal all the chemical substances known to be emitted into the atmosphere in the course of natural gas burning.22.  with regard to the air pollution and the possible impact upon the residents of the building, the expert opinion concluded as follows: “considering the fact that the plant does not have a [buffer] zone and is immediately adjacent to a residential building ..., taking into account the direction of the wind, a whole bouquet of emissions is reaching into the homes ... negatively affecting the population living in the adjacent area.” 23.  the opinion specified that even where individual hazardous substances were considered to be within the acceptable margin, it was necessary to consider the combined impact of various substances upon the health of the population as the combined toxicity might go beyond the acceptable limits.the panel considered it “possible that the asthenic syndrome and neurasthenia ... [had been] caused by the prolonged and combined effect of being exposed to harmful factors.” it added that “taking into account the circumstances of the case, the worsening of the health conditions of the persons examined [had not been] excluded.” (iii)  regional court’s findings 31.  on 12 march 2004 the tbilisi regional court dismissed the claims of the applicants and another claimant, but partially allowed the claims of two other claimants (“the successful claimants”) with respect to the noise pollution emitted by the plant’s generators.that is to say, despite the claimants’ numerous requests and complaints, [the authorities concerned] failed to take specific measures to ensure an environment safe enough for the claimants’ health.” 32.  furthermore, acknowledging that the plant was responsible for the infiltration of water into the foundations of the building, the court ordered it to halt the leakage and make the necessary repairs to the ruptured walls.
8.  on 8 august 2008 the town court examined the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of 11 june 2008. the court heard the case in the applicant’s absence.in the operative part of the judgment, the court advised the applicant of his right to appeal against the judgment adopted by the town court.13.  on 20 august 2009 the acting head of the novozybkov customs post of the bryansk customs office discontinued the enforcement proceedings in respect of the decision of 11 june 2008. he noted that the applicant was a foreign national and had no assets or known place of residence in the russian federation and that it was impossible to enforce the decision of 11 june 2008 on account of the expiry of the relevant time-limit.according to the documents submitted by the government, the court decided to hear the case in the applicant’s absence given that he had been duly notified of the hearing and chose not to attend.according to the authorities, there was archeological and construction work going on in triumfalnaya square and the march, according to the indicated route, would “disrupt the normal functioning of the city’s infrastructure and traffic [and] infringe the rights and interests of people who would not take part [in the rally and the march]”.
8.  according to the latest information available to the court, judgments became final as specified in the table below and either were enforced with a delay or have remained unenforced.the relevant details in respect of the judgments are listed in the appendix.9.  the applicants on several occasions applied to different russian authorities seeking to accelerate the enforcement of the judicial awards in their favour.73303/11 challenged lawfulness of his dismissal from military service alleging, in particular, that the judicial award in his favour of 28 may 2007 had not been complied with.by the final judgment of 12 may 2011 the moscow garrison military court rejected his action and established, inter alia, that the judgment of 28 may 2007 had been enforced in full on 25 march 2010.
the main problems which came to light during the monitoring exercise were: the situation of the applicant’s eldest son, who was not receiving therapy for his condition; the behaviour of m.g., who was unpredictable and eccentric and motivated by a paranoid delusion that she was a victim of plotting and persecution by the court and state institutions in general, and who gave the impression that she was suffering mentally; and m.g.’s relationship with the children, in particular, her attempts to involve the children in judicial proceedings and seek “allies” in them against the father, who she represented as cruel, dangerous and violent, all of which was harming the psychological well-being of the children.47.  following the applicant’s application, on 30 october 2012 the dzerzhinskiy district court decided that, pending the resolution of the proceedings, the applicant should be able to have contact with the children at the schools they attended, in the presence of and with the active involvement of a psychologist, for one hour a week with each child: on wednesdays after classes from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. with the elder son; on fridays after classes from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. with the second son; on mondays after classes from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. with the daughter; and on tuesdays after classes from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. with the younger son.67.  recognition of a judicial decision may nevertheless be refused in any of the following circumstances: (1) if the defendant did not participate in the proceedings because he had not been duly notified of the institution of the proceedings and the date of the hearing; (2) if there is a final decision by the courts of the contracting party addressed in the proceedings between the same parties which is based on the same facts and has the same purpose; (3) if proceedings between the same parties, based on the same facts and having the same purpose, are ongoing before the courts of the contracting party addressed, provided that those proceedings were the first to be instituted; or (4) if, in accordance with international treaties ratified by both contracting parties, the courts of the contracting party addressed have exclusive jurisdiction over the case (article 25 § 1).73.  enforcement of a foreign court judgment may be refused in any of the following circumstances: (1) if the judgment is not final or enforceable in accordance with the domestic law of the state in which it was issued; (2) if the defendant was deprived of an opportunity to participate in the proceedings because he was not duly notified of the time and place of the hearing; (3) if russian courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the case; (4) if there is a final judgment by russian courts in the proceedings between the same parties, based on the same facts and having the same purpose, or if the proceedings between the same parties, based on the same facts and having the same purpose, are ongoing before russian courts, provided that the proceedings before the russian courts were the first to be instituted; (5) if enforcement of the judgment may be detrimental to russian sovereignty or national security, or if it is manifestly incompatible with russian public order; (6) the time-limit for applying for enforcement has expired and has not been extended by a russian court at the plaintiff’s request (article 412).78.  by its ruling of 30 november 2012, 29-p the constitutional court of the russian federation interpreted article 333 § 2 of the code of civil procedure, as in force at the material time, as implying that: (a) the participants in the proceedings should be informed about the lodging of a private complaint against the decision of a first-instance court, and they should be provided with an opportunity to acquaint themselves with the contents of the private complaint and – if the private complaint is examined in the absence of an oral hearing – to submit to the appeal court in writing their position as regards the private complaint; (b)  the participants in the proceedings should be informed about the time and place of the examination by the appeal court in an oral hearing of a private complaint against the decision of a first-instance court where the appeal court, taking into account the nature and complexity of the procedural issue under examination and the arguments set out in the private complaint, arrives at the conclusion that it is necessary for the proper administration of justice to provide the participants in the proceedings with an opportunity to make oral submissions as to their position before the appeal court.

pending approval of her new application, she continued to receive a monthly disability allowance in the amount of huf 89,925 (approximately eur 300) on the strength of the fact that on the day the new law entered into force, she had been in receipt of a disability benefit.11.  in application of the relevant rules, the applicant’s rehabilitation allowance was established at 45 per cent of the minimum wage, that is, in the amount of huf 41,850 (approximately eur 140), by a decision of the budapest governmental office (directorate of pension insurance) given on 19 september 2012 and effective as of 1 december 2012.since the minor difference in the scores did not alter the calculation of the allowance, the national rehabilitation and social authority upheld the first-instance decision on 17 january 2013.having obtained fresh medical assessments and the opinion of the national forensic body, the court was satisfied that the applicant’s state of health was at 54 per cent (her locomotor, digestive and endocrinological conditions were calculated cumulatively as per the method prescribed in annex 1 to decree no.it observed in particular that the lower courts had found that the applicant’s state of health (for the purposes of the application of rules of disability benefits) had improved and that the applicant had challenged that finding.
5.  the applicant, who was born in 1992, was detained at the gaziantep prison at the time when the application was lodged.8.  on the same day the applicant’s police statement was taken at the anti-terror branch of the mersin security directorate, in the presence of his lawyer.the police read out the transcripts of the telephone conversations and asked the applicant to comment on them.11.  on 26 march 2012 the mersin assize court dismissed the objection on the basis of the case file, without holding a hearing.12.  on 20 april 2012 the mersin magistrates’ court ex officio examined the applicant’s detention on remand on the basis of the case-file and decided to extend it.
dr b. responded to the generally positive tenor of dr l.’s opinion and found that the stabilisation process was rather a reaction to the “enemy” institution, namely the prison, in which the applicant was being held, and was not to be considered real or rendering the applicant capable of surviving the challenges of daily life outside prison.in line with the argumentation of the expert opinions of dr b. and dr l., the court held that in the light of the gravity of the underlying criminal offences, there was a danger that an unprepared release would overwhelm the applicant and could have unpredictable consequences.in the light of the gravity of the underlying offence, the statements obtained from the various prison services as well as the recent expert opinions, the regional court concluded that the applicant still presented a danger to society.as the applicant refused to be examined by any expert, the court held another hearing on 23 april 2012. on that occasion, the presiding judge reproached the applicant with the fact that he could not expect to be granted privileges if he did not collaborate with the experts and the authorities.based on the information on file, the latest expert opinion of dr b. of 3 march 2010 and the information from the director of the prison, it concluded that the danger emanating from the applicant still persisted and therefore his application for release had to be dismissed.
in substantiating the imposition of a non-custodial preventive measure, the decision stated that the applicant had a permanent residence, was not obstructing the examination of the case and that, if he remained at large, he would not abscond or obstruct the investigation.9.  it appears that, during the investigation of the case, the head of vardashen prison gave a statement confirming that r.k. had sustained bodily injuries, while the head of the prison medical unit stated that he had provided medical treatment to r.k. and made a corresponding entry in the medical register.13.  on the same day the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan granted the application on the grounds that the imputed offence was a grave one and that if the applicant remained at large, he could abscond, obstruct the examination of the case and influence the witnesses.in substantiating the application, the investigator referred to the nature and gravity of the imputed offence and said that there were sufficient grounds to assume that, if released, the applicant could abscond or obstruct the examination of the case.17.  on 4 april 2008 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan granted the application and extended the applicant’s detention to 7 july 2008. in doing so, the district court indicated the same reasons as those given in the application.
8.  on the same date the regional court examined and granted the investigator’s application, ordering the applicant’s detention for a period of two months, namely until 23 september 2011. it found that the motion was substantiated, since the applicant partially admitted his guilt and the case materials provided sufficient grounds for believing that he might abscond and obstruct the investigation, having regard to the nature and degree of dangerousness of the offence in question.9.  on an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal seeking to cancel the detention order and claiming that the investigating authority had not obtained any materials or evidence to substantiate the reasons for which it had sought to detain him and that they failed to take into account the applicant’s personality.10.  on 11 august 2011 the court of appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that the applicant’s detention was based on a reasonable suspicion, and found the grounds invoked by the regional court in justification of detention to be sufficient.the regional court found that the applicant’s detention was ordered by its decision of 13 september 2011. it also noted that the existing materials of the case were sufficient to conclude that the applicant’s detention was justified.22.  on 4 june 2012 the regional court dismissed the applicant’s motion having regard to the dangerousness and nature of the alleged offence and the fact that the applicant might abscond and obstruct the investigation.
6.  at the material time the first applicant was a member of the youth committee of an opposition party, the popular front party of azerbaijan (azərbaycan xalq cəbhəsi partiyası – “the pfpa”), and the second applicant was a chairman of a youth organisation called azad genclik.13.  the bcea refused to authorise the demonstration of 20 october 2012 at the site indicated by the organisers and proposed another location on the outskirts of baku  the grounds of a driving school situated in the 20th habitable area of the sabail district.29.  on an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal with the baku court of appeal, presenting his version of the events surrounding his arrest, and arguing that he had been arrested in connection with the demonstration scheduled for 11 march 2011. the applicant also complained that the hearing before the first-instance court had not been fair.34.  as mentioned above, the demonstration of 11 march 2011 was attended by the second applicant, the demonstration of 20 october 2012 by both applicants, and the demonstration of 17 november 2012 by the first applicant.the second applicant was assisted by a lawyer of his own choosing during the appellate-court proceedings related to his participation in the demonstration of 20 october 2012, but he was not represented by a lawyer during the appellate-court proceedings related to his participation in the demonstration of 11 march 2011.
the relevant part of the judgment reads as follows: “... this appellate court finds that although the first-instance court failed to take into account all the facts emerging from the first-instance proceedings which meant [the plaintiff’s] claim had to be dismissed, the decision on dismissing the claim as unfounded is in any event correct, therefore the first-instance judgment is upheld by application of section 373a of the civil procedure act.therefore the first-instance decision is upheld on the basis of section 373a of the civil procedure act ...” 14.  on 5 december 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske), challenging the lower courts’ judgments.15.  on 14 may 2013 the supreme court declared the applicant’s appeal on points of law inadmissible on the grounds that the appellate court in fact had not applied section 373a of the civil procedure act, and that therefore his appeal on points of law could not be allowed.the relevant part of the decision reads as follows: “the first-instance court and the appellate court found that the plaintiff had not been dismissed because of his inability to work caused by the work-related injury, but that his employment had been terminated by dismissal due to redundancy and that therefore there was no causal link between his dismissal and the granting of the disability pension, so his claim for damages ... was dismissed as unfounded.therefore, in this court’s assessment, the requirements for the application of section 373a of the civil procedure act were not met, given that the appellate court did not establish, in the manner prescribed by section 373a of the civil procedure act, a different set of facts to the one established by the first-instance court, but based its decision on the same facts.” 16.  the applicant subsequently complained to the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) about the supreme court’s decision on his appeal on points of law.
6.  the first and the second applicants participated in a demonstration organised by the opposition on 20 october 2012. prior to that assembly, on 15 october 2012, the organisers gave notice to the relevant authority, the baku city executive authority (“the bcea”).the bcea refused to authorise the holding of the demonstration at the place indicated by the organisers and proposed a different location on the outskirts of baku – the grounds of a driving school situated in the 20th residential area of the sabail district.the demonstration of 12 january was aimed at protesting about the deaths of soldiers in the army, while the demonstration of 26 january 2013 condemned the use of force by the police against the participants of previous demonstrations.10.  the circumstances related to the dispersal of the demonstration of 20 october 2012, the first and second applicants’ arrests and custody, and subsequent administrative proceedings against them are similar to those in gafgaz mammadov v. azerbaijan (no.11.  the circumstances related to the dispersal of the demonstrations of 12 january, 26 january and 30 april 2013, the second and third applicants’ arrests and custody, and the subsequent administrative proceedings against them are similar to those in bayramov v. azerbaijan ([committee] nos.
5.  on an unspecified date the applicant, while being on the wanted list after having breached his undertaking not to leave the place of his residence, was arrested on the charges of violent acts against a public official (article 318 § 1 of the criminal code of the russian federation).on 18 may 2010 the severodvinsk town court of the arkhangelsk region authorised his detention.6.  on 2 september 2010 the applicant asked the town court to apply a non-custodial restraint measure to him.the town court dismissed the motion for release, having referred, in particular, to the applicant’s criminal record, which included two convictions for having mounted threats of violence against a judge, an offence under article 296 of the criminal code, and for contempt of court, punishable under article 297 of the criminal code.8.  on 12 october 2010 the arkhangelsk regional court upheld the decision of the town court of 2 september 2010. with reference to its discretional powers under article 379 of the code of criminal procedure of the russian federation the appeal court rejected the applicant’s leave to appear, and held the hearing in his absence.
8.  on 8 march 2015 a court ordered his pre-trial detention, which was further extended on several occasions, in particular on 24 august and 25 november 2015. the applicant appealed against the extension orders on 26 august and 26 november 2015 respectively.in iz-77/6 the applicant has around 3 square metres (sq.m) of personal space, the cell is extremely hot in the summer and extremely damp in the winter, it lacks natural light and fresh air, while access to potable water and hot water is restricted.the conditions of the applicants’ transfer to and from the court building were identical to those described by the applicant in case no.15.  on 13 december 2016 the applicant’s lawyer disclosed the terms of the government’s declaration to the media stating that the russian government and the court had “entered into an agreement under which russia [would] pay a compensation” of six thousand euro to the applicant, that “russia ha[d] acknowledged” the violations and that the applicant was “thinking over the offer but [would] most likely accept it”.the lawyer’s statements were published, in particular, on the websites of the vedomosti and kommersant newspapers and on the website of the ria novosti news agency.
33.  the appeal hearing opened on 28 september 2006. among other things, the applicant’s counsel objected to the refusal, in the proceedings at first instance, to allow the defence an unconditional exemption that would allow the applicant and his counsel to communicate unimpeded; to the hearing of unnamed witnesses under heavy disguise, in a closed box that partially hid them from view and with the use of voice distortion, even though they were the applicant’s former direct colleagues; to the withholding of evidence by the witnesses, based on their duty of secrecy as aivd staff members; and to the withholding of documentary evidence requested by the defence.things are different where it concerns the question whether the right of the defence to question witnesses is materially impaired, it being relevant, in the opinion of the court of appeal, whether the statement of that particular witness is used in evidence.” and “the interests of state security, which the 2002 intelligence and security services act and articles 98 and following of the criminal code are intended to protect, stand in the way of granting a complete exemption from the duty of secrecy as desired by the defence.this means that the situation in which the suspect finds himself in the present criminal case leaves only the avenue left by section 86(1) of the said act.” and “the advocate general has given the undertaking, at the court of appeal’s hearing of 2 september 2006, that [the applicant] shall not be prosecuted if a violation of the duty of secrecy by [the applicant] is justified by reliance on article 6 of the convention, with due regard to the demands of proportionality and subsidiarity inherent pertaining to a legal defence (strafuitsluitingsgrond).the conditions attached to the exemption aforementioned, all of which concern the interest of state security in relation to the interests of the defence in the present criminal proceedings, do not appear unreasonable to the court of appeal within the framework of the interests of state security and in the court of appeal’s opinion have done no relevant harm to the interests of the defence.” and “the court of appeal can only answer the question whether the information in issue is to be considered ‘state secret’ or as information relating to state security by referring to the texts, as contained in the file, of [the documents concerned], to the extent that these documents have been added to the file in censored form as appendices to the aivd’s official record of 15 march 2005, [an uncensored e-mail relevant to one of the charges] and the explanations to these documents given by the aivd, especially as contained in the said official record of the head of the aivd of 10 february 2005 and the official record of the acting head of the aivd of 28 december 2006, which latter report has been verified by the national public prosecutor for counter-terrorism (landelijke officier van justitie terrorismebestrijding) as appears from the latter’s official report of 29 december 2006. the court of appeal considers itself sufficiently able to determine the nature and character of this information on the basis of these documents, considered in context....” the supreme court went on to find that the compensatory measures had been sufficient in the circumstances: the possibility had been offered to hear aivd officials as witnesses without disclosing their identities, and the court of appeal had been sufficiently informed by the information contained in the case file – the uncensored parts of documents, the official explanatory documents submitted by the aivd, and the checking of the aivd position by the national public prosecutor for counter-terrorism – to make a proper assessment as to whether the documents in issue were properly classified state secret.
it established, inter alia, the following facts: (i)  that the applicant had suffered since 1995 from a physical deficiency which had given her an overall permanent degree of disability of 73% and that the disability had resulted from the left pudendal nerve being cut; (ii)  after being discharged from hospital, the applicant had complained of pain associated with insensitivity in the part of the body which had been operated on and which had become swollen; (iii)  the left pudendal nerve had been injured during the operation, which had caused the pain from which the applicant was suffering, the loss of sensitivity and the swelling in the vaginal area; (iv)  the applicant had suffered from a decrease in vaginal sensitivity due to the partial lesion to the left pudendal nerve.16.  on 9 october 2014 the supreme administrative court upheld the first-instance judgment on the merits but reduced, inter alia, the amount that had been awarded for the services of the maid from eur 16,000 to eur 6,000 and the compensation for non-pecuniary damage from eur 80,000 to eur 50,000. the relevant part of the judgment on those points reads as follows: “... with respect to damages related to the charges for the maid ... [the plaintiff] could not show the amount paid under that head.indeed, (1) it has not been established that the plaintiff had lost her capacity to take care of domestic tasks, (2) professional activity outside the home is one thing while domestic work is another, and (3) considering the age of her children, she [the plaintiff] probably only needed to take care of her husband; this leads us to the conclusion that she did not need to hire a full-time maid ... lastly, as regards non-pecuniary damage, it is important to set an amount which compensates the plaintiff for her pain and loss of sensation and swelling in the vaginal area, and for the difficulty sitting and walking, which causes her distress and prevents her from going about her everyday life, forcing her to use sanitary towels on a daily basis to conceal urinary and faecal incontinence and which has limited her sexual activity, making her feel diminished as a woman.iv- in view of the factual basis of the judgment and having regard to the fact that ‘in the absence of unlikely and unexpected occurrences doctors would have cured the plaintiff’s illness and she could have returned to her normal life’, the decision setting the amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damage should not have taken account of the plaintiff’s pain and symptoms of depression prior to the surgical intervention as if they had worsened.that would be to set compensation for non-pecuniary damage on the basis of the fact that the plaintiff would have been cured if the pudendal nerve had not been injured.” 18.  on 4 november 2014 the applicant applied to the supreme administrative court to join the attorney general’s appeal of 29 october 2014, arguing that the judgment of 9 october 2014 should be declared null and void in the part concerning the amount of non-pecuniary damage she had been awarded.
11.  on 11 june 2012 the district court prolonged the applicant’s detention by five months (until 1 january 2013) on the grounds that the investigation was not finished, that further charges had been brought against him since may 2012, and that the criminal charges had been reclassified as a crime of terrorism and the acquisition and possession of firearms.16.  the regional court observed that in the course of the appellate proceedings, on 24 october 2013, the applicant had submitted a report by two certified experts concluding that he had long been suffering from a mental schizotypal disorder preventing him from understanding the illegal nature of his behaviour and from controlling it (“the second expert report”).19. after the verdict was quashed on appeal and remitted to the district court for re-examination, the applicant, assisted by his lawyer, applied for release on 23 december 2013. he referred to his mental disorder as established in the second expert report of 24 october 2013. he added that he had been seeing a psychiatrist since the age of 14 and needed medicine on a daily basis to prevent suicidal thoughts.22.  the government’s observations show that on the same date the district court sent a letter to the director of the detention centre in košice where the applicant was being held, asking for information about the applicant’s state of health.31.  taking into account the supreme court’s judgment and its legal interpretation of the crime in question, the district court once again found the applicant guilty of, inter alia, the criminal offence of endangering public safety, the illegal acquisition, possession and trafficking of firearms, the making of serious threats, extortion, and attempted bodily harm and sentenced him to twenty-three years and six months in prison on 29 september 2016. it also ordered protective supervision lasting thirty-six months.

as the material in the file and testimonies indicate, the police acted lawfully with the aim of ensuring public order and public safety, because the entrepreneurs were blocking access to the market for employees and had not reacted to lawful orders from the police to stop these actions ... the court adopts a critical attitude in respect of the testimony of d., who tried to help her colleague avoid responsibility for the offence, because this testimony is refuted by the other evidence ...” 23.  by a decision of 13 august 2009, in respect of mr khripunov, the district court held: “p., a witness, stated before the appeal court ‘on 7 august 2009 ... people in plain clothes and the police arrived at the market and, following orders from the chief officer of the sovetskiy police station, started to arrest entrepreneurs without explaining the reasons for such arrests.[the defendant] was also arrested, while showing no resistance or disobedience to any specific orders ...’ the fact that [the defendant] committed the offence is confirmed by: – the record of the administrative offence stating ‘after his violation of the procedure for organising and managing public events, while being arrested, he disobeyed the lawful order of a police officer, grabbed his uniform and tried to escape ...’; – written statements from [three passers-by] who, while passing through the market area, saw some fifty people chanting slogans and calling for the dismissal of the mayor and the governor and for violations of the public order.the court dismisses the defence’s argument that [the defendant] lawfully participated in a gathering requiring no prior authorisation, because the police’s actions were lawful and aimed to secure public order and public safety, since the entrepreneurs were blocking the market employees’ access to the building ... the court adopts a critical attitude in respect of the testimony of p., who is the defendant’s colleague and wants to help him, because this testimony is refuted by the bulk of the other evidence.” 24.  an appeal decision in similar terms was issued in respect of mr khavantsev.the record does not specify what type of public event was being held, which above-mentioned procedure was violated, or what orders relating to maintaining public order during a public event were not complied with by the defendant.” in respect of ms suprunova, the appeal court held as follows: “the record of the administrative offence indicates that on 7 august 2009 the defendant violated the procedure relating to the organisation and management of demonstrations, meetings and gatherings, [and that] during her arrest she resisted the lawful order of a police officer and grabbed his uniform and tried to escape ... the record does not indicate what type of public event was being held, which applicable procedure the defendant allegedly violated, what orders relating to maintaining public order during such an event were issued to the defendant by the police, or which of those orders was not complied with.” in respect of ms zakharova, the appeal court held as follows: “neither the record of the administrative offence nor the first-instance judgment refers to specific facts and actions forming part of the offence imputed to the defendant, namely disobeying the lawful order of a police officer ... or the specific order given to her which she failed to comply with.the deficiencies of the record make it impossible to establish the defendant’s liability for an administrative offence, and the record must be returned to the [police].” in respect of ms khavantseva and ms garkavets, the appeal court held as follows: “neither the record of the administrative offence nor the justice of the peace’s judgment specifies how the defendant violated public order, or which specific order was given by the police in this connection but not complied with by her.” 40.  it appears that the files were then returned to the police for the documents to be amended.
such an appointment was eventually revoked in september 2014 on the grounds that the centre for legal aid had appointed a lawyer for the applicant in june 2014. the district court also joined the present case file to another set of proceedings for several months.8.  on 13 may 2015 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s complaint about a violation of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time in the proceedings held before the district court as manifestly ill-founded.it concluded that the district court proceeded with the matter actively and properly, apart from a few minor exceptions, such as the joining of a case file to another set of proceedings, changing of the judge and a procedural error made during one of the hearings.in particular, the constitutional court took into account the fact that the applicant had complained of excessive delays with the president of the district court and challenged them further on appeal on each occasion.in the absence of any further information from the parties, it appears that the proceedings are still pending and no judgment on the merits has been delivered by the district court.
17.  on 6 december 2010 the applicant complained to the prosecutor of novosibirsk region about the failure of the medical authorities to duly apply for his transfer to the prison hospital.by a letter of 28 december 2010 the prosecutor supported the applicant’s allegations, noting that a prison official had already been disciplined for the failure to submit the applicant’s complete medical file to gaaza prison hospital.the prosecutor ordered the detention authorities to apply for the applicant’s admission to the prison hospital.20.  in the meantime, the applicant brought a tort action with the toguchinskiy district court of novosibirsk region, complaining about the authorities’ failure to provide him with effective medical assistance, in particular, the required spine surgery.as regards the subject of the claim, the alleged failure to perform spine surgery, the court noted that the authorities had already asked for a surgery quota to be allocated to the applicant.
on the same day the trial court convicted the applicant of illegal purchase and possession of drugs, an offence under article 309 § 2 of the criminal code, and sentenced him to two years and six months’ imprisonment.8.  the applicant appealed, arguing that his admissions before the trial court had related only to the facts and not to the legal classification of the offence, which he maintained was erroneous.for this reason, his acts should have been classified not under article 309 of the criminal code as drug possession but rather under article 320 of the criminal code, namely breach of the rules related to the purchase and circulation of drugs and analogous products.the court stated that the applicant had admitted the circumstances of the offence and the trial court had then proceeded under article 349 § 3 of the ccp.the court held that, because of the applicant’s admission and the procedure used at the trial under article 394 § 2 of the ccp (see paragraph 14 below), the decision was not amenable to appeal on the grounds invoked by the applicant.
8.  on 7 november 2006 the court suspended the proceedings and on 9 november 2007 it declared the proceedings’ interruption as the claimant had not taken the initiative of continuing the proceedings against the defendant’s heirs.10.  after having faced some difficulties in summoning the heirs, the court managed to summon all of them and on 13 june 2009 the defendant’s heirs, including the applicant, were admitted as parties to the proceedings.12.  on an unknown date one of the claimant’s heirs, a.o., applied for leave to continue the proceedings with her and the other claimant’s heir as parties.21.  on 14 january 2014 the court adopted a decision with regard to the factual basis (resposta à matéria de facto) and on 13 march 2014 it delivered its decision in which it ordered the applicant to vacate the house and to pay rent arrears.23.  as the applicant had not complied with the 13 march 2014 decision (see paragraph 21 above), on 19 january 2015 the claimant instituted enforcement proceedings against her before the santarém court.
4.  on 18 january 2007 the moscow city authorities, the ministry of the defence of the russian federation and a private construction company signed an investment contract for the construction of a number of residential buildings in moscow.9.  on an unspecified date city authorities asked the district court to re‑open the cases concerning the flats privatised by the tenants who sold them to the applicants in 2011. the authorities claimed that the flats owned by the applicants were the city’s property.the district court granted the request, quashed the earlier judgments allowing the privatisation of the flats and re-examined the cases.it granted the city’s claims in full invalidating the decisions of the ministry of the defence in respect of the flats and ordering the applicants’ eviction.however, it ruled that the cases fell under one of the two exceptions to the protection of a bona fide purchaser’s title, which required that precedence be given to the city of moscow given that the flats had left the city’s possession against the latter’s will.
10.  on 12 december 2003, relying on expert reports which had indicated that the applicants’ land had been fenced off by the university, the küçükçekmece civil court of first instance awarded the first applicant 97,125,000,000 turkish liras (trl) and the second applicant 37,837,500,000 trl by way of compensation for de facto expropriation.in its respective judgments, the first-instance court held in particular that the land at issue had been under the effective control of the university and that access to the land was restricted due to the fences that had been built around the land.11.  on 22 june 2004 the fifth civil division of the court of cassation quashed the judgments of the küçükçekmece civil court of first instance, holding that the land in question had not been controlled or used effectively by the university.12.  on 24 september 2004 both applicants requested the rectification of the respective decisions dated 22 june 2004. in their petitions, they drew the attention of the fifth civil division of the court of cassation to its previous decisions, dated 28 september 1999 and 31 march 2003, in which it had held that neighbouring plots of land in the same area had been de facto expropriated by the university because the latter had built fences around the land and because of the annotations made in the land registry records.13.  on 12 april 2005 the fifth civil division of the court of cassation rejected the applicants’ requests for rectification of the decisions of 22 june 2004. however, it did not express any reason as to why it had reached a different conclusion from its previous decisions dated 28 september 1999 and 31 march 2003.
in the instant case it has been shown, through the written documents included in the file, that the employer conducted the disciplinary investigation in respect of the applicant by twice summoning him in writing to explain himself [and] specifying the subject, date, time and place of the interview, and that the applicant had the opportunity to submit arguments in his defence regarding his alleged acts, as is clear from the two explanatory notices included in the file (see copies on sheets 89 and 91).the fact that the provisions containing the requirement to interview the suspect (învinuitul) in a case of alleged misconduct and to examine the arguments submitted in that person’s defence prior to the decision on a sanction are couched in imperative terms highlights the legislature’s intention to make respect for the rights of the defence a prerequisite for the validity of the decision on the sanction.30.  the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal in a judgment of 17 june 2008, the relevant parts of which read: “the first-instance court has rightly concluded that the internet is a tool made available to employees by the employer for professional use, and that the employer is entitled to set rules for the use of this tool, by laying down prohibitions and provisions which employees must observe when using the internet in the workplace; it is clear that personal use may be refused, and the employees in the present case were duly informed of this in a notice issued on 26 june 2007 in accordance with the provisions of the internal regulations, in which they were instructed to observe working hours, to be present at the workplace [during those hours and] to make effective use of working time.in view of the fact that the employer has the right and the duty to ensure the smooth running of the company and, to that end, [is entitled] to supervise how its employees perform their professional tasks, and the fact [that it] enjoys disciplinary powers which it may legitimately use and which [authorised it in the present case] to monitor and transcribe the communications on yahoo messenger which the employee denied having exchanged for personal purposes, after he and his colleagues had been warned that company resources should not be used for such purposes, it cannot be maintained that this legitimate aim could have been achieved by any other means than by breaching the secrecy of his correspondence, or that a fair balance was not struck between the need to protect [the employee’s] privacy and the employer’s right to supervise the operation of its business.on 9 may 2012 the directorate for investigating organised crime and terrorism (diicot) of the prosecutor’s office attached to the supreme court of cassation and justice ruled that there was no case to answer, on the grounds that the company was the owner of the computer system and the internet connection and could therefore monitor its employees’ internet activity and use the information stored on the server, and in view of the prohibition on personal use of the it systems, as a result of which the monitoring had been foreseeable.
11.  following the decision of 17 september 2004, on 11 october 2004 the insolvency administrator for beranka ad (stečajni upravnik) lodged a request with the real estate office in berane seeking that the registration of the fiduciary transfer of property to the applicant be erased.on 6 february 2007 the administrative court quashed the decision of the real estate department in podgorica and remitted case to the real estate department in berane.21.  on 8 july 2008, upon an appeal by the applicant, the administrative court quashed the decision of the ministry and remitted the case to the real estate department in berane for reconsideration.22.  on 2 october 2008 the real estate department in berane ordered the removal of the applicant’s rights on beranka ad’s property from the public register.on 30 november 2012 the administrative court rendered a decision in the applicant’s favour and ordered the ministry of finance to reconsider on the applicant’s prior objection.

just like the regional court, it based its decision on a medical expert opinion drawn up previously by psychotherapy expert b. and psychologist s. expert b. had examined the applicant on four occasions between february and september 2005. s. had performed psychological tests with the applicant in march 2005. both experts had issued their common written medical report on 15 september 2005 and had supplemented it with a further medical statement answering the questions of counsel representing the applicant on 20 april 2006. the original report was moreover based on the examination of the applicant’s prison files and a large number of investigation files, as well as on an interview with one of his fellow prison inmates.17.  on 2 september 2008 the federal constitutional court declined to consider the constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant against the regional court’s and the court of appeal’s decision on the execution of the preventive detention order (file no.28.  on 16 june 2010 the federal constitutional court declined to consider the applicant’s constitutional complaint against the decisions of the berlin regional court and the berlin court of appeal, in which the applicant had alleged breaches of his constitutional rights to liberty and to a fair trial (file no.1.  the proceedings concerning the applicant’s request to be granted escorted short-term leave for external psychological treatment 29.  on 24 march 2010, upon the applicant’s appeal, the berlin court of appeal, in a separate decision, quashed the prison authorities’ and the regional court’s decision refusing the applicant short-term leave to continue his psychotherapy treatment with so.33.  the court, endorsing the findings in a new external psychiatric expert opinion issued by p., held that although the probability that the applicant would reoffend at liberty was still high, it would be possible to release the applicant on probation after a preliminary period of about one year if the pre-operational phase was mastered by the applicant without further problems.
moreover, the applicant’s mother and stepfather were considered to be relatively old (having been born in 1962 and 1955, respectively) to serve as foster parents to a small child, and the applicant’s mother had recently been ill. furthermore, the applicant’s mother had not made visiting the applicant’s younger son her priority.10.  in its reasoning regarding the issue of the choice of foster home, the board firstly noted that it was accepted that the applicant’s mother and stepfather had been generally approved as foster parents in connection with the care order in respect of the older son in 2010, but that this issue had to be assessed in view of the current situation, taking into account the best interest of the younger son x. on the specific question as to whether it would be in his best interest to be placed with them, the board stated the following: “the board sees that there are many positive sides to a placement within the family network, which justifies that such a placement be considered.the board further remarks that the grandmother had not arranged with the child welfare service in [the municipality] that [the applicant] and [x] were to move in with her and [the applicant’s older son].the reason is the uncertainty relating to the boy’s vulnerability and the strain that another foster child would entail, regardless of whether or not this child has special needs, the grandmother’s and her husband’s age and certain difficulties regarding cooperation.” 11.  on the basis of the above, the board arrived at the conclusion that x should not be placed with his grandmother and her husband.15.   turning next to the question of whether he could be placed with the applicant’s mother and stepfather, the city court observed that they had been approved as foster parents when the applicant’s older son had been placed with them in 2010. it further noted that there were advantages to a child moving to a foster home comprising family members.
and because i respect his efforts to defeat these patterns, i will give him a well-meant advice: he should check the properties owned by the people accusing me of having committed an offence while doing my work.” 11.  questioned about a finding by the commission that a “bad psychological atmosphere” existed at the sofia district public prosecutor’s office while it was headed by him, the applicant stated further: “the inspection might be right, if by ‘bad psychological atmosphere’ they mean my intolerance towards those prosecutors ..., who performed their duties in a sloppy manner, or attended meetings with the lawyers of criminals to decide on the outcome of cases.they found the following statements particularly offensive: “i have tried to defeat the mafia present in the prosecution services”; “the unhealthiest elements in the prosecution service”; “many pieces of trash came to the surface ...crushing me now”; as well as his allegedly calling one of them “prosecutor rushvetchiyski”.20.  the regional court reasoned as follows: “it is a fact that the accused uttered the expressions indicated in the private criminal prosecution – “mafia in the prosecution services”, “rushvetchiyski”, “the unhealthiest elements in the prosecution service” and “many pieces of trash came to the surface ...crushing me now”.it is also a fact that the expressions were uttered in an interview, which was published and disseminated through the mass media – the trud newspaper ..., in its issue of 12 october 2006. it is a fact that the complainants ... were named in their capacity as public officials – being prosecutors at the sofia district public prosecutor’s office – and in relation to their official duties.” ... “it has been established that the complainants were aware of those statements, on the basis of the testimony [of the witnesses], as well as on the basis of the article in trud published on 16 october 2006, and presented in the case, which contained ... their response to the interview of 12 october 2006 ....” “it can be seen from the testimony [of the witnesses] that after reading the interview given by the accused ...the complainants felt that their honour and dignity had been harmed, which caused a feeling of humiliation ...” “the accused’s explanations show that he was aware that the incriminatory expressions were offensive and humiliating to those to whom they were addressed [and] the manner in which he disseminated them [shows] that he aimed to make them public and that they reach the complainants ...” “the accused’s claim in his defence, endorsed by the district court, that the incriminatory expressions were not directed specifically at the complainants ..., cannot be accepted by the appeal court.the fact that [the statements] may have been directed against two other [prosecutors whose names were mentioned in the interview], and that those people may have decided not to prosecute the accused for harming their honour and dignity, does not alter the fact that the accused’s criminal liability in respect of the two complainants must be engaged.” 21.  the applicant paid in the amounts indicated in paragraph 19 above on 7 august 2008. the total amount paid, including interest and the fees charged by the enforcement official, was bgn 14,826 (the equivalent of about eur 7,565).

7.  on 13 november 2002 the regional court rejected the applicant’s claim filed in the name of the company, holding that the applicant had no locus standi because he could not dispose of the company’s assets as long as the insolvency proceedings were still pending.9.  on 17 september 2003 the regional court held a new hearing regarding the company’s claim, in which the parties agreed to suspend the proceedings, pending the outcome of other proceedings, apparently including the claim lodged in the applicant’s name.in the latter request the applicant asked the court of appeal to set a time-limit for the delivery of the expert reports by the end of july 2005 and for the regional court to hold a hearing for the purpose of questioning further witnesses and discussing the expert reports by 12 october 2005.12.  on 11 august 2005 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s request under section 91, finding that the regional court had not been dilatory; it also stated that the requested time-limits were unrealistic and that the applicant’s request itself had caused further delays.14.  on 29 june 2006 the regional court held another hearing to discuss the expert reports; eventually the court decided to submit the file to the public prosecutor to examine whether criminal investigations should be instituted against unknown offenders ex-officio and the proceedings stayed until such proceedings were terminated.
7.  on 2 august 1991 the applicant lodged a claim for spousal maintenance with the döbling district court (hereinafter “the district court”) and requested an interim order (einstweilige verfügung) for provisional maintenance pending the conclusion of the main proceedings.20.  on 14 october 2003 the district court lifted the ban on the pay-out of money from t.g.’s pension fund and his redundancy money, but dismissed the liquidator’s request to lift the order of provisional maintenance payments.her representative informed the court that she would be fit for questioning as of march 2006. on 24 april 2006 a hearing was held and the proceedings subsequently adjourned in order to obtain the statement of witnesses by means of letters of request from the zürich district court.28.  on 11 may 2009 the applicant asked the district court to suspend the proceedings concerning maintenance payments as from the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened (see paragraph 19 above).35.  on 28 december 2011 the applicant filed a fresh maintenance claim with the salzburg district court (bezirksgericht) against the liquidator as he had refused to acknowledge the applicant’s claim in the insolvency proceedings.
8.  the applicant submitted that throughout his detention in łowicz prison he had been held in overcrowded cells in which the space per person had been below the polish statutory minimum standard of 3 sq.m. 9.  the domestic courts established, without giving any further details, that the applicant had been detained in overcrowded cells during various unspecified periods from 27 january 2007 to 19 april 2009. the overcrowding led to many quarrels between the prisoners as the tables did not have enough space for everybody.12.  on 12 may 2009 the applicant, represented by a legal aid lawyer, brought a civil action over an infringement of his personal rights on account of the inadequate living conditions in łowicz prison from 27 january 2007 to 19 april 2009. the applicant argued that he had been detained in overcrowded cells with space that was below the statutory minimum.the domestic court found that the applicant had been detained in overcrowded cells from 27 january 2007 to 19 april 2009. moreover, he had been detained in a solitary confinement cell as a disciplinary punishment for fourteen days.14.  on 1 march 2013 the łódź court of appeal (sąd apelacyjny) amended the above judgment, increased the compensation to pln 7,000 (approximately eur 1,750) and dismissed the remainder of the action.
10.  the district court did not allow the appeal of 8 december 2010 relating to the applicant’s detention and referred it to the regional court, which dismissed it on 15 december 2010, finding that there continued to be a risk of the applicant absconding.12.  on 28 january 2011 the düsseldorf chief public prosecutor’s office (generalstaatsanwaltschaft – “the prosecution authorities”) submitted written observations to the court of appeal, requesting the dismissal of the applicant’s appeal of 5 january 2011.18.  on 25 february 2011 the court of appeal dismissed the request for a subsequent hearing as inadmissible, finding that the applicant’s right to be heard had not been violated, that the prosecution authorities’ observations of 28 january 2011 had not contained any facts unknown to him and there had therefore been no need to serve them on him.prior to the decision of 25 february 2011, the observations of the prosecution authorities relating to the request for a subsequent hearing had not been served on the applicant, who had thus had no opportunity to reply to them.he alleged, in particular, that his right to be heard, as guaranteed by article 103 § 1 of the basic law (grundgesetz), had been violated, because the court of appeal had taken its decisions of 3 and 25 february 2011 without giving him the opportunity to reply to the observations of the prosecution authorities.
8.  on 6 october 2000 the claimant brought a civil action before the buje municipal court (općinski sud u bujama) against the novigrad municipality (hereinafter “the defendant”), seeking that the data concerning the size of certain plots of land be corrected in the land register of that court.9.  meanwhile, on 27 december 1999, the applicant and the claimant had concluded a purchase agreement in respect of the plots of land that surrounded the residential buildings the claimant had built and that were the subject of the proceedings instituted on 6 october 2000.in its reasoning it stated, inter alia, that at the moment of the delineation of the disputed parcels the claimant had not had any right to the property at issue and therefore by its correction the claimant would have become an owner of the property which he had never been given for permanent use.it held, inter alia, that the value of the claim was the one established at the hearing on 14 june 2001, namely hrk 105,000, because the claimant had increased the value before the defendant had begun litigation on the merits.18.  on 14 october 2011 the supreme court declared the applicant’s appeal on points of law inadmissible ratione valoris, considering that the value of the claim did not reach the statutory threshold of hrk 100,000. it held, contrary to the lower courts’ findings, that the value of the claim was the one indicated in the civil action because the claimant would have been allowed to alter that value only if it had also amended its claim at the same time.
on 24 august 2005 the head of the surgical unit wrote to the prison hospital’s acting head doctor, informing her that the applicant needed to be examined by a urological oncologist at the national centre for oncology (“the nco”).5. the authorities refused a request for his return to the prison hospital sent by his lawyer to the director of the prisons department of the ministry of justice, the prison governor and other authorities.the lawyer asked the court of appeal to order an expert report to reassess his client’s state of health, determine whether the prison hospital was able to provide him with the necessary treatment and whether the conditions of his detention could have a negative impact on his health.29.  on 28 march 2008 the court, acting under rule 39 of the rules of court, indicated to the government that the applicant should be placed in the prison hospital, where he could be provided with adequate medical treatment for his cancer and chronic hcv.in reply to his request, by a letter of 8 may 2008, the head of social services at the prisons department asked the applicant to substantiate his request and explain the reasons for his dissatisfaction with the prison hospital.
the gendarmes returned to the scene of the incident at 12.50 a.m. on 28 september 2007 and awaited the hozat public prosecutor and the crime‑scene investigators, who arrived in a helicopter at 8.45 a.m. 9.  the hozat public prosecutor prepared his report on his visit to the area on 28 september 2007. the gendarmes who were guarding the area showed the prosecutor the exact place where the soldiers from the 51st motorised infantry brigade had taken cover the previous day and told the prosecutor what they had been told by the soldiers.in this connection they pointed out, in particular, that the prosecutor’s examination of the scene of the incident (see paragraphs 9-11 above) had not been conducted in an impartial manner because the prosecutor had been accompanied by a number of soldiers and that the family’s requests to visit and examine the place with the attendance of all the parties had been unreasonably rejected.i have also heard that the persons in question were working both for the state and for the pkk and that one of them was a militiaman.” 40.  on 26 december 2008 the elazığ military prosecutor decided to close the investigation and not to bring criminal proceedings against the soldiers for the killing of the applicants’ relative bülent karataş or for the injury caused to the tenth applicant.42.  the military prosecutor’s decision recorded that another statement had apparently been taken from the tenth applicant in his capacity as a “suspect”, by the prosecutor on 9 november 2007 before he was brought before the hozat magistrates’ court (see paragraphs 26-27 above) in which he had apparently told the prosecutor that he and bülent karataş had gone to the area on the evening of 26 september 2007 and not on the morning of 27 september 2007. he had also stated that when the soldiers opened fire, he and bülent karataş had been on the road and the soldiers had been below the road down by the river bed.54.  the objection was rejected by the malatya military court on 23 march 2009. in the opinion of the military court, the decision to classify the investigation file as confidential two days after the incident was a justifiable action and in accordance with the applicable procedure because there had been ongoing military operations against terrorist organisations in the area at the time and allowing access to the investigation file could have facilitated the terrorists’ escape and led to destruction of the evidence.
an additional ct scan of o.’s neck, lungs, abdomen and pelvic area was performed on 29 september 2009. the mri scan and the ct scan of 29 september 2009, taken together, indicated a leptomeningeal pathological process involving the cranial nerves, a probable meningeal metastatic process and probable multiple metastases in the liver and other organs of the abdominal cavity.according to the report of the expert committee’s meeting of 25 march 2010 at which the applicant was also present, the expert committee gave oral answers to the applicant’s questions regarding the possible radiation of o. during his previous treatment; the decision not to offer chemotherapy to o.; and the alleged late detection of pneumonia.in addition, the expert committee’s decision contained written answers to the applicant, stating that o. had not suffered from a stroke; that the deterioration in his health had not been caused by the administration of specific medication or the withdrawal thereof, but rather by the metastatic developments in his brain; and that based on the medical records, o. had not been starved, nor had his mechanical ventilation been stopped before his death.the prosecutor posed ten questions to the forensic medical experts addressing, inter alia, o.’s diagnoses; the adequacy of the treatment with respect to his state of health (including the tracheotomy); the restraining of o. to the bed; the administration of medicine on 12 october 2009 and whether this could have caused o.’s breathing to stop; the decision to cease the administration of medicine and food on 13 october 2009; the assertion that o. was brain-dead; and the decision to stop mechanical ventilation.24.  following the termination of the criminal proceedings, the office of the prosecutor general dismissed complaints lodged by the applicant regarding the refusal to initiate additional criminal proceedings against the chief inspector of the health board’s supervisory department, against the experts of the estonian forensic science institute who had drawn up the forensic medical report during the original criminal proceedings (this refusal was later upheld by the court of appeal), against two prosecutors and the judge of the court of appeal.
7.  in january 1990, a few years after she had applied to the interior ministry for a disability pension, ms t.g., the applicant’s mother, was granted an entitlement to the monthly payment of the pension together with a special allowance on account of her partial blindness.12.  as the decision was not enforced by the relevant authorities, on 14 june 2004 the applicant served a payment order (atto di precetto) on the national social security agency (istituto nazionale della previdenza sociale – inps) for eur 30,364.38, representing the sum claimed, with interest and taking account of the re-evaluation.14.  on 25 may 2005 the applicant lodged an appeal with the “pinto” division of the rome court of appeal, complaining about the excessive length of the proceedings.89/2001 (the “pinto act”), the “final domestic decision” to be taken into account was that of the enforcement judge of 25 january 2005. in consequence, she argued, the six-month deadline for lodging the claim for just satisfaction ought to run from that date.15.  on 18 may 2006 the court of appeal declared the appeal inadmissible as out of time, taking the view that the final domestic decision to be taken into consideration was that delivered by the naples district court in the proceedings on the merits, a decision which had become final on 25 january 2004.
drew up a record of the applicant’s arrest, which stated that the applicant had been arrested on that day in the military police department on suspicion of beating up and murdering a.h. on the same day he asked the public defender’s office to grant the applicant a defence lawyer, who was assigned the next day.14.  the applicant contested the facts as reflected in the materials of the case file, and alleged that in reality he was taken to the kapan military police department on 1 may 2006 and was held there until 3 may 2006. thereafter, he was taken to the disciplinary isolation facility of the military police department, where he was held until 20 may 2006. throughout the whole period he was subjected to severe beatings and torture by military police officers and investigators, who hit him in the soft parts of the body, as well as the “invisible” parts, including the soles of the feet, forcing him to confess to the murder.of the military prosecutor’s office... having examined the materials of criminal case ... assigned to me ... during the investigation of the criminal case [concerning the death of a.h.] the accused [applicant] lodged a complaint with ... the general prosecutor of armenia, which [was] received by the military prosecutor’s office.therefore, the fact is that during the period in which ... [the applicant] and [r.h.] stayed in the military police department, no violence against them by the officers of the above department has been substantiated during the investigation of the criminal case [concerning the death of a.h. hence], there is no evidence of a crime.40.  following the ruling of the constitutional court, on 20 january 2010 the applicant lodged a new appeal on points of law against the judgment of 12 november 2008, claiming, inter alia, that neither the investigative authorities nor the courts had taken into account the fact that he and r.h. had been beaten and tortured by the military police.
the sentencing judge addressed him in the following terms: “this case has been a copy-book example of how people in your position are able to continue to operate outside the law by the use of interchangeable street names, preying upon the most vulnerable addicts and by the indiscriminate use of fear and violence to ensure that no-one informs the police of your criminal activities ... your evidence to the jury was that you were the main man for drugs in swindon ... your nickname of ‘bruiser’ ensured that when the ‘workers’ as you called those who sold drugs on your behalf, ‘messed up’ it was your policy, to use your own words, of ‘roughing them up a little bit’.it noted that he had a long history of offending, beginning at the age of twelve; that he had received fair warning from the secretary of state in 2006 that any further offending would not be tolerated; that notwithstanding that warning and the subsequent assurances given to the secretary of state that he was turning his life around, he was already engaged in drug dealing; that his criminal behaviour had not only continued but had also escalated; that whilst serving his most recent sentence, he had received sixteen adjudications, the majority of them for violence and disobedience; that his problems with dyslexia could not be used as an excuse to justify his poor behaviour and repeat offending; and that whilst the majority of his offending had occurred when he was a child, his most recent and most serious had occurred after he had attained his majority.in particular, she noted that the applicant had entered into a relationship in the full knowledge of the intention to deport him; that both the applicant and his partner should have been fully aware of the implications of conceiving a child in those circumstances; that no valid reason had been given to explain the applicant’s failure to make submissions regarding his relationship at either the upper tribunal hearing in april 2012 or the court of appeal hearing on 30 october 2012; that if the applicant’s partner wished to continue the family unit in nigeria, suitable medication would be available in that country to treat their son’s bronchiolitis condition; that there was no evidence of any exceptional, compelling or compassionate factors; and that deportation remained a proportionate response to the applicant’s serious criminal offending.therefore, having carefully considered the issue of proportionality, including “section 55 [of the borders, citizenship and immigration act 2009 – see paragraph 60 below] and the best interests of the appellant’s child”, the tribunal concluded that the secretary of state had a legitimate interest in maintaining appropriate immigration control and social order within the united kingdom, and that the interests in effecting the applicant’s deportation were not outweighed by his article 8 rights.following the supreme court judgment in r (on the application of cart) v. the upper tribunal; r (on the application of mr (pakistan)) v. the upper tribunal (immigration & asylum chamber) and secretary of state for the home department [2011] uksc 28, the administrative court could only review decisions of the upper tribunal if the “second appeal” test was satisfied; that is, if the appeal raised an important point of principle, or there was another compelling reason to allow it to succeed.
10.  by 21 october 1999 the investigating judge had (a) questioned two suspects who were available to the authorities at the time, as well as thirty other individuals in relation to the incident, including the eleventh applicant; (b) requested that some other witnesses be questioned by the relevant authorities in serbia; and (c) asked for the autopsy reports, an expert opinion on the capacity of the boat and a report on the weather conditions on the night of the incident.16.  on 14 april 2004 the supreme state prosecutor (vrhovni državni tužilac) in podgorica instructed the state prosecutor in bar to specify the indictment in terms of the facts and legal classification of the criminal offences, after which the court in bar would declare that it lacked competence to deal with the case and would transfer it to the high court in podgorica (hereinafter “the high court”), as the competent court to deal with it.during that hearing and the subsequent two hearings four defendants and several witnesses were heard again, and a number of written documents were read out, including the indictment, the defendants’ earlier statements and witness statements from 1999, 2003 and 2012, reports by the kotor and budva police directorates (odjeljenja bezbjednosti), as well as information provided by the radio and television of montenegro and the bar public information centre.by 18 december 2013 three hearings had been held, during which one expert witness was heard, and a number of other pieces of documentary evidence were read out, such as an earlier statement of another expert witness, earlier statements of other witnesses from 1999, 2003 and 2004, including the statements of the eleventh applicant, autopsy reports and reports from the port of bar of 1995 and 1998 relating to the boat.40.  on 15 june 2011 the president of the high court requested the ministry of justice to appoint a permanent court interpreter for romani as soon as possible, stressing that one of the reasons for the criminal proceedings in question having “lasted too long” had been the absence of an adequate interpreter for romani.
in the course of that investigation the intelligence service provided the authority with other information, dated 21 march 2006, classified “restricted” and annexed to the security file (bezpečnostní spis) under number 77. on the basis of that information the authority revoked the security clearance on 5 september 2006. there were two unrelated reasons for that decision: firstly, the applicant had failed to indicate, as he should have done when applying for security clearance, that he held directorships in a number of companies and accounts in foreign banks; and secondly, the applicant was considered to pose a national security risk, within the meaning of section 14(3)(d) of law no.it found that the approach taken by the authority, which had not disclosed to the applicant the contents of the information on the basis of which the security clearance had been revoked, had not been illegal as disclosure of such information was prohibited by law.it went on to observe that, owing to the special nature of proceedings where classified information was concerned, not all the applicant’s procedural rights could be guaranteed but that the non-disclosure of the exact reasons underlying the decision to revoke security clearance was counterbalanced by the guarantee that the administrative courts had unlimited access to the classified documents.77, contained specific, comprehensive and detailed information concerning the conduct and lifestyle of the applicant on the basis of which the court was satisfied in the present case as to its relevance for determining whether the applicant posed a national security risk.22.  on 16 march 2011 the prosecution service lodged a bill of indictment against the applicant and 51 other persons on charges of influencing the award of public contracts at the ministry of defence from 2005 to 2007. the applicant was indicted for participation in organised crime (účast na zločinném spolčení); aiding and abetting abuse of public power (pomoc k trestnému činu zneužívání pravomoci veřejného činitele); complicity in illegally influencing public tendering and public procurement procedures (pomoc k trestnému činu pletich při veřejné soutěži a veřejné dražbě); and aiding and abetting breaches of binding rules governing economic relations (pomoc k trestnému činu porušování závazných pravidel hospodářského styku).
9.  prior to the start of the hearing, the presiding judge informed the photojournalists orally that the defendant’s face would have to be made unidentifiable “in the usual manner” before any images of him were published.10.  according to the applicant companies, the presiding judge had indicated at the beginning of the hearing on 11 january 2011 that anyone who failed to comply with this order no longer needed to show himself at the regional court of potsdam and apply for permission to take photos of future proceedings.11.  the government contested the applicant companies’ assertions that the presiding judge had threatened not only to bar journalists from taking photographs during the proceedings against the defendant, but also from future proceedings before the potsdam regional court.the only media representatives who were permitted to take photographs and make video-recordings of s. were those who had previously registered with the court and given an assurance that prior to the publication or forwarding of the material, the face of s. would be disguised by a technical process, for example by pixelisation, so that it would only be possible to use the images in such a form.15.  the presiding judge stated in his reasons that he had to balance the public interest in being informed and the personality rights of s. he acknowledged that the crime at issue was very different from “usual crimes” and that permitting only pictures that disguised s. impaired the public’s ability to be informed.
the second report specified that six wounds had perforated t.t.’s lungs and re-confirmed that “all the wounds had been inflicted with some sharp object/objects and, taken together, were life-threatening.” concerning the question of whether the injuries were inflicted on the victim with one or several weapons, the nfb expert stated: “in order to answer that question it is necessary to convene a panel of forensic‑medical experts, and additionally to have the clothes as well as the object/objects possibly used to inflict the injuries presented, if available.” 13.  the expert testified during the proceedings before the first-instance court that the discrepancy between the first and the second nfb reports concerning the number of wounds inflicted on the victim had been caused by the poor quality of the photocopied material relied on during the first nfb expert examination.4. in view of the convicted g. kuparadze’s statement, how possible is it that the [victim’s] injuries described in the [forensic reports], given the mechanism used to inflict them, were inflicted by two different persons if one of them had been holding [the victim]?” 18.  the part of the report entitled “circumstances of the case” contained excerpts from the applicant’s criminal case file with the following concluding paragraph: “given that the [first-instance] court accepted the [victim’s] statements and dismissed the statements given by the convicted g. kuparadze and [the witness], that the statements given by the [victim] and the convicted g. kuparadze essentially contradict each other, that there is no eyewitness in the case except for [the witness], as well as the fact that the weapon of the crime is missing, the lawyer commissioned the alternative expert examination to determine the truth regarding the case and in order to receive answers to his questions.” this was followed by a more detailed account and an assessment of the matter.furthermore, the concluding part of the expert examination [report] is presumptive, speculative and based on probability which, in the first place, is beyond the expert’s competence as provided for in articles 365 [and] 374 of the code of criminal procedure, [and] no evidentiary value may be attributed to speculative findings, in accordance with article 371 (6) [of the code].” 25.  as regards the second alternative forensic report, the court noted the following: “the court cannot accept the findings of the [second alternative forensic report] as they are also speculative.without referring to a concrete scientific study, the [report] analyses and rejects the victim’s statement and relies on the statement of the accused.” 26.  the appellate court also reasoned that the applicant’s argument that two unidentified men had beaten the victim while stabbing him was not confirmed in view of the absence of any physical signs of beating in the relevant forensic medical report.without responding to the applicant’s arguments that the lower courts’ dismissal of the alternative forensic reports had been erroneous and arbitrary, and that the main argument of the defence had been left without an appropriate answer, the court reproduced the relevant provision of the criminal procedure code, holding that “the case [was] not important for the development of the law and coherent judicial practice, the [contested] decision [did] not differ from the supreme court’s existing practice in such matters, and the appellate court [had] not committed any major procedural flaws during its examination which could have significantly affected its outcome.” 28.  on 16 november 2006 the applicant, aged fourteen at the time, was remanded in custody and placed in a cell together with adult female inmates in tbilisi prison no.
contrary to the outcome of the main proceedings under the brussels iia regulation and the hague convention, the regional court therefore considered the obligation under article 11 (4) of the brussels iia regulation to be applicable in that the district court would have to ask the french authorities to use safeguards to ensure that the return of the children was in their best interests, such as not to return them to the applicant in person while the suspicion of abuse against him remained.it further held that it was for the applicant to apply to the competent authorities in france for temporary care for his children in a child protection institution, and that it was not for the austrian courts to establish contact between him and the children under article 11 (4) of the brussels iia regulation since the establishment of contact for the purposes of the enforcement of a return order fell within the competence of the authorities of the state from which the children had been abducted.the regional court also considered that the applicant’s conduct was not in the children’s best interests either, since the enforcement of the decision of 7 january 2009 and c.b.’s criminal conviction appeared to be more important to him than their well-being, and he did not even realise the seriousness of the burden to which he would expose his children if they were forced to return to him after not having seen him for more than six years.regarding the aca’s requests for safeguards to secure the protection of the children, the fca pointed out at the beginning of the enforcement proceedings that there were no obstacles impeding the children’s return to their father as the competent french judge had already determined that their main residence was at his home; thus, the french youth welfare office would not be notified of the children’s return to france.however, in the event of her return to france together with her children, the public prosecutor would be prepared to withdraw her from the fpr on the grounds that the children’s return would make it possible for the applicant to see his children, so that the objective of the arrest warrant would then also be achieved.
6.  on 26 march 1996 m.’s husband sold the flat to a. the transaction and a.’s title to the flat were duly registered by the state authorities.10.  on an unspecified date the housing department of grozny lodged a civil action against a. and the first applicant seeking the invalidation of the purchase of the flat by a. and claiming the title to the flat.13.  on 18 june 2010 the leninskiy district court of grozniy granted the second applicant’s claim and removed the flat from the data base listing the flats in respect of which the former owners received compensation from the state.17.  according to the government, on 15 november the supreme court of the chechen republic quashed the judgment of 28 june 2011 on appeal and remitted the matter for fresh consideration.the court also invalidated the flat purchase agreements between (1) m.’s husband and a. and (2) the second applicant and a., recognised that the flat was the property of the town of grozniy and ordered the applicants’ eviction.
7.  on 28 october 2010 t. sold the flat to m. the transaction and m.’s title to the flat were registered by the state registration authorities.the transaction and the applicant’s title to the flat were registered by the state registration authorities.9.  on an unspecified date the housing foundation of the republic of bashkortostan brought a civil claim seeking, inter alia, the invalidation of the applicant’s title to the flat and eviction.the court refused to recognise that the applicant had purchased the flat in good faith for her failure to check the authenticity of the judgment of 30 september 2010. it further took into account that m. had sold the flat to the applicant for 180,000 russian roubles (rub) while she had bought it for rub 190,000.14.  according to the government, the eviction order was not enforced and the applicant continues to reside in the flat.
5.  in 1997 the maribor unit of the surveying and mapping authority (hereinafter the “maribor unit”) issued several decisions concerning the delimitation of real estate belonging to the applicant and to company d., and ordering changes in respect of the use of land.6.  on 28 september 2000 the ministry for the environment and spatial planning (hereinafter the “ministry”) granted the applicant’s appeal in part and annulled a decision issued on 12 february 1997 while it dismissed the appeal concerning two decisions issued on 31 january 1997.7.  on 23 november 2000 the applicant challenged the aforementioned decision of the ministry in the part dismissing his appeal by instituting proceedings before the administrative court.8.  on 6 november 2003 the administrative court granted the applicant’s appeal, annulled the challenged part of the decision of 28 september 2000 (see paragraph 6 above) and referred the case back to the ministry who, in turn, referred it to the maribor unit.11.  on 10 july 2015, referring to section 25 of the 2006 act, which regulates the domestic settlement proceedings in cases where an application to an international court had been lodged before the 2006 act entered into force (see paragraph 14 below), the state attorney’s office sent the applicant a settlement offer.

has written about this in his book ‘it has sunk ... the truth about the kursk hidden by prosecutor general u.’).” 16.  after the publication of the two articles, v.k., the chief forensic expert of the russian ministry of defence, a.e., the head of an investigative group within the chief military prosecutor’s office in charge of the kursk investigation, a.s., the chief military prosecutor of russia, and the chief military prosecutor’s office of russia as a legal entity lodged civil actions for defamation against the applicants with the basmannyy district court of moscow (“the district court”).23.  in so far as relevant, the district court’s judgment read as follows: “... assessing the impugned statements, the court considers that they contain affirmations that v.k., a.e., a.s. and investigators of the chief military prosecutor’s office broke the russian law which was in force and committed an abuse of public office, and that such statements tarnish the honour, dignity and business reputation of v.k., a.e., [and] a.s., as well as the business reputation of the chief military prosecutor’s office as an agency performing, in the name of the russian federation, state functions of supervision with regard to respect for the constitution of russia and laws in force within the russian territory.... contains the following text: “i think that the final decision not to find commanders of the northern navy criminally liable was taken by ..., a.s. and ...” in view of the above, comparing the impugned statements of the article ... and the text of the book, the court considers that the meaning of the phrase “to take a decision not to find [somebody] criminally liable” is not equivalent to the phrase “to take a decision to help [somebody] escape criminal responsibility”.under section 49 of ... the mass media act, a journalist must verify the truthfulness of the information he communicates, and section 57 of the act sets out an exhaustive list of grounds for absolving an editorial department, an editor-in-chief, or a journalist of responsibility for disseminating untruthful statements that tarnish the honour and dignity of individuals and organisations ... the court cannot accept as grounds to dismiss the [defamation] action the defendants’ arguments that the impugned statements are opinions, value judgments that could not be retracted under article 152 of the civil code, for the following reasons.therefore, expression by a journalist of his opinion on any topic, or the publication of an opinion by another person does not give grounds to absolve [the journalist] of responsibility where damage has been unlawfully inflicted on the values protected by the constitution and the civil code of russia, [such as] honour, dignity and the business reputation of an individual.” 24.  the applicants appealed, arguing in particular that the information contained in the impugned articles amounted to value judgments, and that the articles had reflected the opinions of r.k. and b.k., opinions expressed in the former’s application to the court and the latter’s book.
he added that he had intended to convey to the readers the position of the leaders of one of the parties to the military conflict in the chechen republic as he had considered that, in the light of the continuing tragedy in the northern caucasus and terrorist threat, citizens should be entitled to have an idea of that position first hand rather than having the situation presented to them by russia’s mass media, which only reflected the point of view of the authorities of russia.in a report on the linguistic expert examination of the first article, she pointed out that the text contained statements in the affirmative to the effect that “the tragedy in the dubrovka [theatre] and the war in chechnya [were] beneficial for vladimir putin”, that “the cessation of war and a peace agreement with the leaders of the [chechen republic of ichkeria meant] the loss of power for v. putin”, and that “until v. putin [guided] the state, blood [would] continue to flow in chechnya and russia”.22.  the other report of 18 february 2005 concerned a linguistic expert examination of the second article and stated that the following statements were aimed at inciting racial, ethnic and social hostility, associated with violence: “...the 1944 deportation was the ninth large-scale act of genocide by the military and political authorities of imperial russia...” “the very first deportation of the chechens was carried out by russia as early as in 1792...” “more than a quarter of a million innocent civilians have already died in the [chechen republic of ichkeria] (the cri) during the latest continuing russian-chechen war...” “...the international community ... has not the slightest desire to react in any way to this criminal madness by the bloody kremlin regime...” “...the 60th anniversary of the deportation ... many chechens marked ... in extremely harsh conditions of unmotivated mass murders, extrajudicial executions, groundless detentions, severe ‘clear-up’ operations, tortures, kidnappings, disappearances and ‘residential’ checks by russia’s invaders and their accomplices, who have been committing excesses in the territory of the cri for the past five years...” “today, just as 60 years ago, the new global russia’s terror has become our national tragedy.its inexorable millstones are grinding the gene pool of the unique and original chechen people...” “...we invite independent experts from the united nations and the european union to monitor the situation with their own eyes, so that the groundless and defamatory attacks on the chechens by russia’s propagandists... can no longer distort the real picture in the chechen republic of ichkeria...” “there is no doubt that the kremlin is today the centre of international terrorism, and [the kremlin] selected chechnya and the chechens as targets for testing terrorist methods which are being developed by the [federal security service]...” “it would be naive to believe that the present regime in russia would be too shy to use its terrorist experience in the international arena to solve its political and other problems...” “an example of this is the treacherous and cowardly terrorist attack by russia’s special services in the state of qatar, which prematurely took the life of ... zelimkhan yandarbiyev...” “...you have become witnesses to one of the numerous terrorist methods used by the state party of russia, notably taking hostages from the civilian population...” “we would therefore like to believe that the chechen people have a right to hope that you will soon recognise the war which the putin regime imposed on chechnya as genocide...” “the bright day is near when the sacred chechen soil will be completely cleansed of the countless hordes of russia’s invaders and their accomplices...” 23.  the report stated that in all those statements the author of the article was directly pointing out that it was russia and its invaders, military and political authorities, special services and state party who were carrying out “genocide”, “unmotivated mass murders, extrajudicial executions, groundless detentions, severe ‘clear-up’ operations, tortures, kidnappings, disappearances and ‘residential’ checks”, and that it was they who were “committing excesses”.25.  t. also considered it necessary to note that the article contained a number of statements with contemptuous, angry stylistic connotations expressing a distinctly negative assessment of the actions of russia’s servicemen and governance of the military and political authorities of russia, such as “this criminal madness by the [bloody] kremlin regime”, “russia’s invaders and their accomplices, who have been committing excesses in the territory of the cri for the past five years”, “the kremlin is today the centre of international terrorism” and “the putin regime”.
23.  at a hearing on 25 november 2015 before the smolninskiy district court of st petersburg, the applicant’s doctor supported the application, stating that she was very ill, was in constant, severe pain, and that the prison hospital had no drugs to treat her.24.  a representative of the detention authorities left the issue to the court’s discretion, only making positive comments about the applicant’s work while in detention and about her character.25.  the prosecutor in the case objected to the applicant’s release, stating that the detention facility could provide her with the requisite treatment.26.  the court dismissed the application, finding that the treatment she would receive in the prison hospital was similar to what she would get in a civilian one.on the same day the court indicated to the government, under rule 39, that the applicant should immediately be given access to the entire range of medication available for cancer patients in accordance with russian laws, including appropriate pain relief drugs.
11.  on 14 december 2006 the applicant applied to the zaječar commercial court for enforcement of the court’s decision of 8 february 2005, by which the applicant’s claims were recognised.the zaječar commercial court, however, declined its jurisdiction ratione materiae and transferred the case file to the bor municipal court.in its reasoning, the court stated that the commercial court’s decision of 8 february 2005 was not suitable for execution.13.  on 23 november 2007 the zaječar district court upheld the first instance court’s decision, stating that the debtor had been subject to the pending insolvency proceedings.it found that the applicant had failed to properly seize the constitutional court, having lodged her appeal against “the wrong” decision.
9.  in a judgment of 27 march 2012, the bucharest court of first instance dismissed his first application on the grounds that a stay of execution of sentence provided for by article 453 § 1 b) of the ccp for convicted mothers up to their child’s first birthday had to be interpreted strictly and that the applicant could not seek application of that provision by analogy.it also found that the financial and family difficulties referred to by the applicant did not fall within the category of special circumstances required by article 453 § 1 c) of the ccp to allow a deferral of sentence, especially as they had existed prior to his placement in detention.10.  on appeal by the applicant, the bucharest county court upheld the judgment of the court of first instance in a judgment of 7 may 2012.11.  in a judgment of 13 june 2012, the bucharest court of first instance dismissed the second application lodged by the applicant under article 453 § 1 c) of the ccp on the grounds that the statutory conditions were not satisfied.12.  the applicant was detained in a number of different prisons, including the bucharest police detention facility (from 1 to 13 december 2011), bucharest‑rahova prison (from 13 to 19 december 2011, 21 december 2011 to 9 january 2012 and 17 january 2012 to 30 january 2013), mărgineni prison (from 9 to 17 january 2012) and giurgiu prison (from 30 january to 25 february 2013 and from 11 march to 26 september 2013).
this decision was upheld by the county court on 19 february 2009, but on 19 june 2009 the bucharest court of appeal quashed this latter decision and remitted the case to the county court, as it considered that the lower courts should have heard evidence from the applicant and relied on the psychological reports.12.  upon an appeal on points of law lodged by d.d., on 7 april 2010 the bucharest court of appeal remitted the case to the county court and ordered that court to obtain an expert examination of the applicant by the forensic medicine institute.15.  when sentencing d.d., the court took into account the undue length of the criminal proceedings and that there had been significant periods of inactivity by the authorities involved, in particular by the investigators and the forensic medicine institute.19.  the court further considered that in so far as both the prosecutor and the applicant had limited their initial appeals to solely the criminal aspects of the district court’s decision of 9 june 2008, the county court had been right in not awarding damages on its own initiative.the relevant part of the decision reads as follows: “in so far as the prosecutor’s office and the injured party argued that the [county court] should have examined the award of damages on its own initiative because the injured party was a minor, it is to be observed from the content of the decision under review that both the prosecutor’s office and the injured party had expressly limited their appeals to the criminal aspects of the case.
12.  in june 2012 the applicant instituted proceedings before the minnesota 4th judicial district family court (“the minnesota district court”), seeking dissolution of the marriage and sole custody of m. in the course of the proceedings s. agreed to the dissolution of marriage.13.  in july 2012 the applicant spent a holiday in ukraine with s. and m. 14.  on 14 august 2012 the applicant asked the ministry of justice of ukraine to order the return of m. from ukraine to the usa in accordance with the hague convention of 25 october 1980 on the civil aspects of international child abduction (“the hague convention” – see paragraph 37 below).23.  on 13 august 2013 the municipal centre of social services for family, children and youth of chernihiv issued a certificate stating their psychiatrist’s opinion that m. was “well settled in ukraine and, having regard to the strong bond between the child and the mother and the need to avoid causing the child psychological trauma, it would be inappropriate to remove the child to the other place of residence”.25.  on 20 november 2013 the higher specialised court of ukraine for civil and criminal matters (“the cassation court”) quashed the decision of 14 august 2013 (see paragraph 24 above) and upheld the desnyansky district court’s decisions of 19 june and 2 july 2013 (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above), noting that they were well substantiated and had been adopted in compliance with the requirements of the hague convention.in particular, there had been no clear stance on the question of whether or not the removal or retention of the child had been wrongful, and ‒ if that were the case ‒ at what moment it started to be wrongful, nor as to whether or not the father had consented to or subsequently acquiesced as regards the child’s retention, nor whether facts existed demonstrating that the child was settled in his current environment.
in addition, the judge dismissed t.s.’s objection that the applicant’s claim was time-barred, holding that the time-limit set by article 1817 § 1 was unconstitutional insofar as the limitation thus imposed on the possibility of investigating an individual’s paternity at all times constituted an unjustified and disproportionate restriction of the right of a son to know who his father was.appealed to the constitutional court, to which he submitted the question of the constitutionality of article 1817 § 1 of the civil code, pursuant to article 70 § 1 (a) of the law of the constitutional court.he argued that the time-limit established under article 1817 § 1 of the civil code for the institution of paternity proceedings was not compatible with the constitution and that the right to one’s identity should prevail over the rights of the alleged parent.23.  on 28 january 2014 the second applicant challenged the decision of the porto court of appeal before the supreme court of justice and asked it to rule that the referred time-limit was unconstitutional.24.  by a judgment of 27 may 2014 the supreme court of justice quashed the judgment of the porto court of appeal and held that the ten‑year time-limit established under article 1817 § 1 of the civil code was unconstitutional.
4.  in a dispute between the applicant and the domestic pension authorities, on 18 february 2011 the kryviy rih dovgyntsivskyy district court ruled in his favour, ordering an increase of his pension based on the rise in the average wages in the country since his retirement.on 29 february 2012 he wrote to the court of appeal, requesting to be informed about the date of the hearing of his case.8.  it can be seen from the material before the court that the applicant’s domestic case file contains copies of the ruling of the court of appeal’s judge (date illegible) opening appeal proceedings in his case and a notification letter dated february 2012 from the court clerk informing him of the upcoming examination of his case in camera on 26 june 2012 and stating that the judge’s ruling and a copy of the appeal were enclosed with the letter.the government alleged that the above documents had been sent to the applicant, while the applicant alleged that they had not.9.  on 26 june 2012 the court of appeal, in a final decision not amenable to appeal, quashed the first-instance court’s judgment, dismissing the applicant’s claim for a pension increase and holding that the domestic law did not require the pensions to be increased in case of rise in the average wages in the country following retirement.
the dormitory was mainly inhabited by the students and the staff of the lipetsk metallurgy college (“the college”).they argued in particular that the privatisation of the dormitory had taken place in violation of the legislation and that the company could not be declared as a sole owner of the property.it relied on the order of the college’s director and a lease agreement concluded in 2008 between the company and the college in respect of the dormitory.12.  on 12 may 2011 the oktyabrskiy district court of lipetsk quashed the judgment of 19 april 2010. the court found in particular that the documents presented by the company might have had significant impact on the outcome of the case and thus they constituted “newly discovered circumstances”.13.  on 31 august 2011 as a result of the fresh consideration of the case the oktyabrskiy district court of lipetsk rejected the applicants’ claims and ordered reversal of execution of the judgment of 19 april 2010. this judgment was upheld on 26 october 2011 by the lipetsk regional court.

6.  on 14 april 2010 the applicant notified the police that he planned to organise a demonstration from 2 to 7 p.m. on 17 april 2010 in front of the venyige street prison in budapest, in order to draw attention to the “situation of political prisoners”.7.  on 16 april 2010 the head of the budapest police department banned the demonstration on the grounds that traffic could not be diverted to alternative routes (section 8(1) of the assembly act).it noted that in assessing whether or not traffic could be diverted to other routes, the authority had reckoned on the participation of some 200 demonstrators, as per the applicant’s notification, and that – after having obtained the opinion of a traffic expert – it had established that lawful parking and traffic circulation in the neighbourhood would become impossible should the event take place.the court agreed with the police’s decision in that although the right to assembly was a constitutional fundamental right, it was not absolute and must not give rise to a violation of the fundamental rights of others, and could therefore be restricted.the court was satisfied that the decision had been lawful as the police had adequately established the facts, complied with the procedural rules and applied clear assessment criteria, and the assessment of the evidence had been logical.
5.  on 15 october 2001 the applicant brought a civil action against a private person in the čakovec municipal court (općinski sud u čakovcu) seeking that a contract for lifelong maintenance (ugovor o doživotnom uzdržavanju) be declared null and void, that certain entries in the land register be altered, and that certain property be included in his deceased father’s estate.at the first hearing of the trial, the applicant indicated the value of the claim at 101,000 croatian kunas (hrk).on 19 april 2006 the supreme court accepted the applicant’s appeal on points of law, examined it on the merits and quashed the decisions of the lower courts and ordered a fresh consideration of the case.on 21 september 2011 the supreme court declared the applicant’s appeal on points of law inadmissible ratione valoris because it fell below the threshold of 100,000 croatian kunas, given that the applicant’s civil action had included three separate claims lodged on different factual and legal bases – therefore, the amount of the claim had to be divided into three.the supreme court did not provide any reasoning as to why it had accepted as admissible the applicant’s previous appeal on points of law and decided on the merits.
8.  on 18 october 2005 the kyiv commercial court of appeal quashed the first-instance court’s judgment and rejected the claim, mainly on the grounds that the applicant company had failed to prove the loss of profit it had claimed.9.  on 21 february 2006 the higher commercial court reversed the ruling of the court of appeal and upheld the judgment of the first instance court.the higher court held that because the defendant’s inaction prevented the applicant company from operating its business as from 2001, the first instance court was correct in accepting the information about the applicant company’s gross income for 1999 and 2000.10.  on 6 june 2006 the supreme court quashed the ruling of the higher commercial court and upheld the ruling of the court of appeal.asked to comment, the government responded on 18 january 2016 that they “do not object against the applicant’s request as to the payment to its sole shareholder the awarded compensation and, thus, leave this question on the court’s discretion”.
