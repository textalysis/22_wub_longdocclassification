Rumors that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are allegedly on the verge of divorce have been circulating as early as a few weeks into their marriage.New reports claimed that there is a new woman involved in Jennifer Aniston and Justin Therouxs alleged rocky relationship and its none other than Jens close friend, Chelsea Handler.Is the former "Friends" star jealous because her new husband and her pal are getting too close?"But Justin Theroux has forbidden her from having any more naked romps in his house while he is out of town," the report continued."It bugged him to come home and find Chelsea there and the house a mess, but he bit his tongue.But now that he and Jen are married, he is establishing some ground rules, chief among them is that Chelsea is no longer welcome in their guest room," the report said.It has been previously reported that the newly weds are allegedly having problems over Jennifer Aniston being jealous because of Justins purported closeness with his "The Leftovers" co-star, Margaret Qualley.The newlyweds friends are hoping that the couple work out their differences especially since the couple is allegedly in the process of adopting a baby.

MAINZ, Germany — At least 17 ISIS militants have arrived in Europe concealed as refugees, according to Germany’s domestic intelligence service.Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of the BfV agency, said in an interview with the daily FAZ newspaper over the weekend that most of them are already in prison or dead."The total includes two suspects who died in the Paris terror attacks, according to the report.Last year, Germany alone welcomed more than 1.1 million migrants, mostly from Syria and Afghanistan.In an interview with NBC News earlier this year, Maassen said that ISIS was trying to "send a political, not an operational signal" by capitalizing on the migrant crisis.It wanted to show .that it is capable of smuggling terrorists to Europe concealed as refugees and that every refugee can be a terrorist," the intellgence chief added.His agencys annual security report published last week notes that Europe is faced with a new dimension of [Islamist] terror," stating that it has to be assumed that ISIS is planning further attacks in Europe, including Germany.
In August outspoken Missouri State Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal called for the assassination of President Trump.Maria Chappelle-Nadal was removed from her committee assignments the next week.Republicans are Nazis.Democrat Maria Chappelle Nadal defended her decision to compare President Trump to Hitler in an interview on Thursday afternoon… AND she played the race card.FOX 2 reported: The St. Louis Post-Dispatch interviewed Chappelle-Nadal about the tweet.She tells the newspaper that, I have a First Amendment right to share my opinion, and if a meme is offensive to people, they should look at the First Amendment again, she said.Maria is the future of the Democrat Party — constant insults and pure insanity.Sponsored Sponsored

Print Close Top Hillary Clinton aides were upset a Muslim man was publicly named as the shooter in a 2015 massacre that left 14 people dead, and a longtime Clinton confidant even expressed regret that the terrorist wasn’t a white man, according to purported emails released by WikiLeaks on Sunday.The emails were part of a trove of messages stolen from the gmail account of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, who has had a long association with the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.The email chain began on Dec. 2, when digital operative Matt Ortega forwarded a tweet from MSNBC host Christopher Hayes that named one of the shooters in the San Bernardino, Calif., attack as Sayeed Farook.Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, gunned down 14 people and injured 22 in a terror attack during a holiday party at the Inland Regional Center on Dec. 2.The attackers pledged their allegiance to ISIS before dying in a shootout with police later in the day.But Podesta’s written lament of the shooter’s ethnicity underscores a long-running aversion in the Clinton campaign – and many in the Democratic party at large – to associating terrorist acts with any aspect of the Islamic religion.In a 154-page debate prep book that was developed two months after the San Bernardino attacks, and also unearthed in the WikiLeaks document dump, topic 47 is devoted to Should we call this Islamic terrorism?But in the wake of the Orlando nightclub terror attack in June, and amid more Trump prodding, Clinton relented somewhat.
The alternate strategy of derailing the new administration before it really gets started hasn’t succeeded either, despite serial efforts to sue over election results, alter the Electoral College vote, boycott the inauguration, delay the confirmation of appointments, demand recusals, promise Trump’s impeachment or removal through the 25th Amendment, and file suit under the Emoluments Clause.But apparently progressives find that centrist remedy worse than the malady of losing elections — given that during the Obama tenure, more than 1,0 state and local offices were lost to Republicans, in addition to majorities in the House and Senate, and a majority of governorships and legislatures.One nagging problem with the progressive case against Trump for purported Russian collusion and obstruction of justice was that members of the Obama administration had more exposure to those allegations than did the political newcomer Trump.Last year, then-FBI Director James Comey testified that not only did former Attorney General Loretta Lynch improperly meet in secret with Bill Clinton during an investigation of Hillary Clinton, but that Lynch had asked Comey to downplay the investigation into Hillary’s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state.Last month, in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey admitted that he asked a friend to leak notes about Comey’s earlier conversation with Trump in hopes of forcing the nomination of a special investigator to lead the Russia investigation — perhaps a successful gambit, given that Comey’s friend, former FBI Director Robert Mueller, was soon appointed to that role.As far as alleged Russian collusion, there had long been conservative accusations that Bill and Hillary Clinton used Hillary’s status as secretary of state to leverage honoraria for Bill and donations to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for concessions to Russian interests.Meanwhile, the House Intelligence Committee is still investigating whether top Obama administration officials wrongfully used the power of foreign-intelligence collection to conduct surveillance of Americans — particularly members of the Trump campaign.Rather, the lesson is that progressives should have offered alternative political visions that might have won back the American people rather than attempting to terminate the Trump presidency on charges to which the progressive side was far more vulnerable.
There are many more, including Trump’s club trying to welch on a $1 million hole-in-one payout (out of all of Trump’s bad qualities, his steadfast refusal to pay people what he owes them, while bragging about it, is the most enraging), along with the old bit about Trump blithely ignoring local ordinances so he could put a big, dipshit flagpole up at the Mar-A-Lago club, with his lawyers stating—with a straight face—that a smaller flag would fail to appropriately express the magnitude of Donald J.

The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the President of the United States of America following a shooting on Sunday evening in which at least 58 people were killed, and over 500 others were injured.In a statement, The Queen said: Prince Philip and I were saddened to learn of the terrible attack in Las Vegas.Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the families and those who have been injured.The incident, which is now the worst mass shooting in recent American history, happened on Sunday evening and is said to have been perpetrated by a 64-year-old man named as Stephen Paddock.Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards a festival which was being attended by 22,0 people.It is not known what the motive for the attack was.President Donald Trump described the attack as pure evil and praised the emergency services saying that their speed saved lives.Sponsored
MADISON – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the White House announced the Keystone XL Pipeline will be exempt from President Trump’s executive order requiring construction projects to be built with American steel.President Trump has repeatedly vowed to build construction projects with American steel as a way to support manufactures and create jobs here at home—even going as far as making it one of his first signed executive orders, Rep. Pocan said.But now, he has decided that a major construction project will not abide from his own Buy America plan.House Republicans have already shown their hand by opposing provisions to permanently require American steel be used in our country’s infrastructure projects.If President Trump is concerned with livelihood of American workers, he should take steps to ensure the Buy America Act is strongly and meaningfully enforced.Unfortunately, the President’s talk about ‘Buy America’ is proving to be just another broken promise to the American people.Previously, Rep. Pocan sent a letter to the Trump transition team asking the President to enforce and expand the Buy America Act, and also highlighting Congressional Republican leadership’s opposition to requirements that American tax dollars go to companies that employ American workers.To date, Rep. Pocan did not receive a response from the transition team, nor have White House officials responded in any capacity.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders described the president as reiterating in the meeting with GOP senators the administration’s view that any action on DACA must come with action on the presidents immigration reform principles, which were released last year.These include a physical border wall on the southern border; interior enforcement, which includes more ICE and Border Patrol agents; as well as a crackdown on sanctuary cities; and reforms to our legal immigration system, like ending chain migration and the visa lottery program in favor of a merit-based immigration system, Sanders said at Thursday’s press briefing.Next week, the president is inviting a bipartisan group of senators to the White House to discuss next steps on responsible immigration reform and to continue that discussion, she added.Chain migration is a phrase used to describe a feature of immigration law that allows immigrants to sponsor their relatives to come to the U.S. Family reunification is responsible for more than two-thirds of legal immigration annually, while less than 10 percent come for primarily employment-based reasons.The immigration hawks at Numbers USA have launched a six-figure ad campaign to inform the public and to help the phrase "chain migration" take its place in the political lexicon alongside "amnesty."While Congress debates yet another amnesty, we want to help Americans visualize how the presence of chain migration categories means that amnesties are never limited to the people receiving them but instead open up lifetime work permits to millions more of their extended family and in-laws, Beck said in a statement.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., for example, was part of the Gang of Eight and is a co-sponsor of the Democrats’ preferred bill for resolving the status of DACA.Many immigrant communities and their advocates also oppose the change, arguing that it is already too difficult to immigrate to the U.S. and, this is, itself, a driver of illegal immigration.
In October 2017, a rumor spread that former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick — who National Football League teams have refused to sign since his 2016 silent protest during the national anthem — had said he would be willing to stand during the national anthem if he was signed by a team.The Daily Wire web site wrote: According to a breaking news report from the Associated Press, former San Francisco 49ers second string quarterback Colin Kaepernick now says that he’ll stand during the national anthem if an NFL team suddenly decides to give him a job: BREAKING: Quarterback Colin Kaepernick tells CBS he’ll stand during national anthem if given chance to play football in NFL again.The sports web site Bleacher Report similarly reported: Free-agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who remains unsigned after sitting or kneeling during the national anthem throughout the 2016 season, said he plans to stand if signed by an NFL team.However, as of press time, the Daily Wire’s article retained its original, inaccurate headline QB Colin Kaepernick Now Says He’ll Stand for the National Anthem If He’s Signed to a Team.During that segment, La Canfora described the player’s determination to return to an NFL team, and claimed: He’s not planning on kneeling, he’s going to donate all his jersey sales, and he’s planning on standing for the anthem, if given the opportunity.However, a day later Colin Kaepernick appeared to allude to the inaccuracy of that account, in this tweet: A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.NFL Today deleted a video of La Canfora’s claims from its Twitter account, and La Canfora himself posted a series of tweets clarifying that he had not, in fact, discussed the possibility of standing for the national anthem in his conversation with Kaepernick.What he would do during the Anthem I do not know It was not the first time that a news organization reported Kaepernick’s purported willingness to stand during the anthem.
In a recent investigation, the FBI found that more than 80 people have fallen victim to the new tactics in California, Minnesota, Idaho and Texas.An FBI spokeswoman for the Kansas City offices said she was not aware of any instances that have occurred in Kansas or Missouri where the FBI was involved.The scam works this way: The potential victim answers a call and hears a woman screaming, Help me!The victim might blurt out a name, like Mary, asking her if she’s OK. At that point, the caller will tell the victim that Mary has been kidnapped and she will be harmed if ransom isn’t paid quickly.The amount is typically less than $2,0 because of legal restrictions for wiring larger amounts across the border, the FBI said.The charges are the first federal indictment in a virtual kidnapping case, the FBI said.Robert A. Cronkleton: 816-234-4261, @cronkb How to avoid falling victim If you receive a call from someone demanding ransom for an alleged kidnap victim, the FBI suggests: Hang up the phone.Listen to the voice of the alleged victim if they do speak.
The editor-in-chief of the ultra-conservative, Steve Bannon-run news outlet Breitbart admitted during a radio broadcast Friday morning that his teams defense of defeated Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore was a bid to protect President Donald Trump from the potential fallout from the various accusations of sexual misconduct against him.During Friday mornings broadcast of the SiriusXM Patriot stations "Breitbart News Daily" program, host and editor-in-chief Alex Marlow stated in no uncertain terms that Moore was a "horrible," "terrible" candidate, though the media propertys allegiance to Trump left him with "no option" but to defend his positions and his alleged behavior.Marlow continued to cast doubt on the credibility of Moores accusers, but reinforced the notion that, at the end of the day, his publications support of the Alabama candidate was not about the contender himself.Working hard to deny the many claims of sexual misconduct against him, forward the candidates bizarre, often unconstitutional positions and cast aspersions on his opponents — first GOP primary candidate Luther Strange and then Democratic contender and eventual victor Doug Jones — Breitbart became a sort of mouthpiece for the Moore campaign, even when the campaign could barely speak on its own behalf.Indeed, Breitbart leader and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon directly campaigned for Moore, framing the candidate as a Trumpian, anti-establishment vanguard of a new ultra-conservative takeover of Congress (even though the president backed Strange in the primaries).As if it needs to be said, the cynicism of a news outlet backing a candidate it knows to be a poor politician — and perhaps an even worse person — for the benefit of another potentially equally compromised figure is titanic.But then again, there has never been anything idealistic or pure about Breitbarts support of the president or, indeed, the presidents support of the hard-right racial, political and cultural agenda that publication and its followers espouse.With that as the power exchange active in both conservative politics and conservative media, it only stands to reason that a "terrible," "horrible" candidate such as Moore would go so far and create so much noise standing on their shoulders.

CNNs Don Lemon called President Trump a liar, petty, and devoid of the facts after he held a rally Tuesday night in Phoenix."Hes unhinged, its embarrassing and I dont mean for us, the media because he went after us, but for the country," Lemon said."His speech was without thought, it was without reason, it was devoid of facts, it was devoid of wisdom.Someone who came out on stage and lied directly the American people and left things out that he said in an attempt to rewrite history, especially when it comes to Charlottesville.Hes unhinged, its embarrassing and I dont mean for us, the media because he went after us, but for the country.A man who is so petty that he has to go after people who he deems to be his enemy, like an imaginary friend of a 6-year-old.His speech was without thought, it was without reason, it was devoid of facts, it was devoid of wisdom.A man clearly wounded by the rational people who are abandoning him in droves, meaning those business people and the people in Washington now who are questioning his fitness for office and whether he is stable.

The mayor of the second largest city in Worcester is working hand in hand with a guy who admittedly is trying to foment communist revolution, and targeted black churches because he believed they were vulnerable.In addition he writes for the People’s World, covering local New York City and state issues, as well as events at the United Nations.According to his bio on there, his plan is to support people like Mayor Petty, because this is generally what communists do: The Communist Party can exercise a leadership role by helping to show the importance of electing or defending Democrats as part of an overall strategy on the road towards socialism.Red Danny was pumped when Obama won, and as the chairman of the Communist Party of New York, he gave the following statement, claiming that this was the biggest continuation of that revolutionary spirit: Where he expressed how bad he thinks the collapse of communism has been for the Russian people: Soviet Union obviously had problems, but now there are drugs, poverty, and unemployment.Here’s the best part – he voted for his buddy Red Danny to be appointed to the Library Board on May 31 when he thought no one was looking: The City Council Tuesday night elected Daniel M. Margolis of 15 Rugby St. to the Worcester Public Library Board of Directors.Mr. Margolis was one of three candidates who sought to fill a vacancy on the library for for a term that expires on Dec. 31, 2019.Even though he’s got her back till the cows come home: This is the state of the city right now.People like Etel Haxhiaj get appointed to the CAC under Petty’s watch, and deny ANYONE who supports Turtleboy Sports a job they are overly qualified for on city boards.
President Trump issued a stern warning to John McCain after the Senator bashed the Commander-in-Chief’s unabashed nationalism.Speaking at an award ceremony in Philadelphia Monday night, McCain warned against  spurious nationalism and the dangers of the U.S. abdicating its global leadership responsibilities.To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain ‘the last best hope of Earth’ for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history, John McCain said at the National Constitution Center.After last night’s speech by Senator McCain, where the Senior lawmaker ripped President Trump’s nationalistic agenda, Corker says he loved the speech — so much so that he gave the ailing military veteran a ‘big hug,’ on the Senate floor.Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) on Tuesday praised the speech Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) gave a day earlier, in which the Arizona Republican blasted half-baked, spurious nationalism.The pieces that I saw, I loved, and I gave him a big hug on the [Senate] floor, Corker told reporters when asked about the speech, according to CNN.During the address, he said that we live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil and called Americans the custodians of those ideals at home, and their champion abroad.Sponsored Sponsored
Police in Dubai reopened streets near one of the worlds tallest residential skyscrapers after firefighters successfully extinguished a Friday blaze, forcing residents to evacuate in the middle of night.A skyscraper in the United Arab Emirates burst into flames Thursday when the Torch Tower in the Dubai Marina began blazing in the night sky.The Dubai Media Office confirmed the UAE’s Civil Defence is fighting the inferno raging at the tower.Some Twitter users on Thursday voiced shock at the fire burning at the Torch, which is the world’s fifth largest residential building at 1,105 ft. tall.Civil Defence officials told the Sun that they had successfully evacuated the Torch while fire fighters tried stopping the blaze.The Sun reported that the 2015 fire at the same building was quickly brought under control, resulting in no fatalities and seven people receiving treatment for smoke inhalation.A Dubai Police spokesperson told the Gulf News that the fire broke out on the tower’s ninth floor before spreading four floors higher.The Torch is expected to be the 32nd tallest building in the world, according to the Skyscraper Centre.

Good conversation with @BarackObama Wise words, &amp; much appreciated 5ulp So what were the "wise words" in said "good conversation?"According to The Washington Times, Griffin said President Obama spoke to him about "protecting myself."Griffin and Obama both were in the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. for the NCAA Tournament matchup between Syracuse and Marquette.Obamas concerns are in lock-step with Washington Redskins coach Mike Shanahan, who spoke of the need for Griffin to protect himself better following a spectacular rookie season that ended with a wrecked knee.The evolution of the NFL: Take a look at how the NFL has evolved from its humble roots, and the efforts being made to ensure it continues to grow.As for Obama, this isnt the first time hes given safety advice to a prominent NFC East quarterback.At a fundraiser in Oakland last year, Obama had a message for Michael Vick during a conversation with former Eagles cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha.This is the same Obama who said in December that if he had a son, hes not sure hed let him play football.
At the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, thousands of great Americans are represented by priceless family heirlooms, donated to help them museum to share their experiences.The tin box is the only one like it at the National African American Museum of History and Culture.They fill vast silences in the record, said Paul Gardullo, a curator at the museum.Her father, the late Lt. Col. Woodrow Wilson Crockett, was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the first group of black military personnel to fight in World War II.And they get back to the same… situation, that they left.And sharing that important history to future generations keeps people like Rosemary Crockett and Elaine Thomspon giving what’s left of a story that should never be forgotten.For people who look at some of these artifacts or even these very painful times and say, ‘slavery is over, we should move forward, why do we have to keep talking about it,’ what do you say to that?The National Museum of African American History and Culture will open to the public on Saturday, Sept. 24.
Money is the goal, and it doesn’t matter who or what is being transported; if there is money to be made, you’d better believe that they will go to whatever lengths they can to cash in.This was on the minds of officials who recently stopped a large truck carrying freight at the Chinese border.What they found was deeply disturbing, to say the least… Crossing from one country to another, even without a great deal of cargo, can be an extremely difficult process.There’s seemingly no end to what criminals are willing to do… jm3 / Flickr Border officials are well aware of the potential criminal activity that they could encounter.Nonetheless, the authorities wanted to take a closer look to be sure that nothing fishy was going on… HM Revenue &amp; Customs / Flickr Police ordered the cargo to be unloaded and inspected to ensure it wasn’t anything illegal.There was a lot to go through, but they needed to be certain there wasn’t anything unlawful slipping into the country.They weren’t sure if they’d find anything, but they had a hunch… When the police finally uncovered what was being transported, they were horrified.He wasn’t the only one involved, however, and police wanted to get to the bottom of this operation… Victor / Flickr Most people probably wouldn’t believe what terrifying items that the border patrol officials finally uncovered in the back of the truck.
During a press conference, Las Vegas Metro Police under Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters that the department is still unclear on shooter Stephen Paddocks motivation for the attack he perpetrated earlier this week.The girlfriend of the man behind a recent mass shooting in Las Vegas told investigators he displayed mental health symptoms before the attack, according to NBC News.NBC News on Friday reported that one former FBI official briefed on the matter confirmed that Marilou Danley recently made the remark about Stephen Paddock.NBC News’s sources said Paddock may have been in mental or physical anguish before committing the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history last Sunday.The sources added, however, that the FBI has not yet identified what motivated Paddock to open fire upon an outdoor concert.The FBI also does not believe Paddock’s mental health had eroded to a point that would have triggered him to begin his rampage, according to NBC’s sources.One of the former FBI officials said that investigators are additionally scrutinizing about six media devices Paddock left behind.Responding police found Paddock dead inside his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.

In an interview with Fancast in 2010, Elisabeth said (via The Huffington Post), "I am not ultra-ultra-conservative on every issue.I actually support gay marriage."She reiterated that stance on The View in July 2011, calling demonstrations against same-sex marriage "uncalled for and tasteless," adding, "If you think anything is killing heterosexual marriage, the only thing thats killing heterosexual marriage is heterosexual marriage."
Liberals have used Hurricane Harvey to their advantage in almost everything: climate change, abortions and now DACA.ABC’s Martha Raddatz exploited the hurricane in a desperate argument to keep DACA.It ain’t gonna work, sister!The American people have spoken, and we want Obama’s Dreamers out of here, PERIOD!For that matter, fake Republicans (like Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio) who want these illegal alien anchor babies to stay also need to shut their yap, because they’re directly going against the will of the American people.We are concerned for the future of AMERICAN children, not illegal alien anchor babies.They’ve got to go back!Watch the video:
Members of law enforcement stage near the area where a suspect in a series of bombing attacks in Austin blew himself up as authorities closed in, Wednesday, March 21, 2018, in Round Rock, Texas.(AP Gay) People have been quick to point out how a bombing in Austin, Texas is reported in the wider media.Police said today that the suspect linked with a series of deadly parcel bombs targeting Austin, Texas, is dead.The blasts that began in Austin earlier this - involved package bombs and a tripwire and all said to be related.The Austin bomber, a 24 year old white male (therefore not classified as a terrorist ) will no longer TERRORIZE Austin residents.#AustinBombing— Brian Krassenstein🐬 (@krassenstein) March 21, 2018 Imagine if the Austin bomber was a Mexican or Muslim.When the Austin Police chief announce that the bombing suspect was found, Trump would had been calling for a ban of immigrants or the immediate building of his stupid wall.But no, he was a 24 year old white male so it’s just another passing news story not a 24/7 tool to fear-monger against minorities— ♻️ Christopher Zullo (@ChrisJZullo) March 21, 2018 Austin bomber was a 24 year old white male.
The chronic weakness of their regime has been further exposed by the triumph of a US presidential candidate who does not share their devotion to open borders, the destruction of national identities and the march of globalisation.The Eurocrats and their Remain cheerleaders in Britain were only too thrilled when President Obama arrogantly warned that, in the event of Brexit, we would have to get to the back of the queue for any future trade deal with the US.It is the EU that will have to get to the back of the queue.The deepening sense of alarm in Brussels was reflected in the decision by the EU’s foreign affairs chief, Italian socialist Federica Mogherini, to summon all the foreign ministers of the member states to a special dinner last night to discuss the implications of Trump’s election.With his gift for the original phrase, he urged EU bosses stop wallowing in their collective whinge-o-rama and come to terms with the democratic verdict of the American people.EU leaders are too deep in their dogma to properly respond to Trumps presidency Yet, in truth, the EU politicians are so manically attached to their federalist dogma that they would not dream of adopting a pragmatic, flexible response to Trump.In the wake of Trump’s victory the head of Nato Jens Stoltenberg said that we face the greatest challenges to our security in a generation.The filthy migrant squatter camps in France and the predatory sex attacks in Germany are the twin symbols of the nightmare that Brussels has inflicted on the continent.
ET: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell held a press conference on Wednesday and spoke about how the NFL wants players to stand during the national anthem.Goodell steered clear of directly addressing the tweet Donald Trump sent out on Wednesday about the NFLs decision not to force players to stand.Goodell: "were focusing on what we should be doing as the NFL," in response to more questions about Trumps Tweets — Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) October 18, 2017 Additionally, Goodell said he wants the league to "stay out of politics" and talked about how he hopes that there will eventually be "zero" players kneeling during the anthem.Just a week after saying a one-game suspension would have scared Colin Kaepernick from kneeling in protest of the national anthem ever again (ROFL), hes back on Twitter clapping at the NFL for not bringing the hammer down on players who are still protesting.The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017 "The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem," Trump tweeted.If Trump was so concerned about players protesting the national anthem—which, again is a part of the First Amendment—why doesnt he stop the police from murdering black people?If Trumps so concerned about people openly resisting the tradition of bigging up America before playing a game, why doesnt he go to the root of the problem?
"If the president were to do that," he said, "and we have a Republican majority in the United States Senate, why, we have a number of options that we dont now have to remind him to read Article I of the Constitution."Before the election, then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell complained that Obamas decision to delay his executive amnesty until after the election was a ploy to prevent Americans from "hold(ing) his party accountable in the November elections."McConnells spokesman at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Brad Dayspring, predicted that Obamas amnesty threat would drive voters to "elect a new Senate (that) will stand up to the president."To gin up votes, "Republican insiders" told the Washington Examiner last fall that "the results of the midterm elections" would determine how "aggressive" the GOP would be in fighting Obamas amnesty.The media have blamed the GOP for every failure of Republicans and Democrats to reach an agreement since the Hoover administration.Tell voters what the media wont: that Obamas "amnesty" will give illegal aliens Social Security cards and three years of back-payments through the Earned Income Tax Credit, even though they never paid taxes in the first place.Contrary to hysterical claims by the media and George Will, the government wont shut down if the Democrats filibuster goes on forever.Nearly all DHS employees are deemed "essential" personnel who are required to stay on the job even if the departments budget doesnt pass -- the Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard.
On Friday, Trump held a rally in Alabama and gave his true thoughts about the mostly African American NFL players, who take a knee in protest of the mass murders and injustices of Black people by police.Trump then called the players ‘sons of bitches’ while urging the NFL team owners to fire them: Trump wishes NFL owners would tell anthem protesters "get that son of a bitch off the field right now" pic.twitter.4EH3lNoY — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) September 23, 2017 Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he’s fired.He’s gonna say, ‘That guy disrespects our flag, he’s fired.’ And that owner, they don’t know it.Diddy’ Combs has taken to social media and declared a virtual war against the racially motivated antics by the president of the United States.Repost this to the world Not only did Combs make a plea to the world to spread the message about Trump, he also extended a word of advice for ALL NFL players to take a stand on Sunday: Public Reacts To Trump’s NFL Comments &amp; Calls For NFL Players To #TakeAKnee Many people have taken to social media to call out Trump after his NFL comments and to urge NFL players to ALL take a knee come Sunday: Racism.#TakeAKnee pic.twitter.com/0aONI66gJF — NYCLU (@NYCLU) September 23, 2017 ** Whys it OK for our President to #TakeAKnee to Vladimir Putin, but not for a Football player to do so in peaceful protest?— Ed Krassenstein (@EdKrassen) September 23, 2017 ** If you are still on the fence, remember this: Trump attacked Colin Kaepernick with more conviction than he has NAZIS #TakeAKnee — The NFL Boycott (@TheNFLBoycott) September 23, 2017 Trump’s Contradictions As is usually the case, Trump has yet again contradicted himself.

The Economists argument, the point is Trumps tough talk is encouraging and emboldening the street gang MS-13.Let me ask you a question: What is the status of illegal immigration in the country today versus when Trump was inaugurated?Well, since the middle of 2015, hes been talkin tough on it, and hes been tellin people were going to build a wall -- and hes been telling people that if they come in illegally, were going to track them down and were going to deport them.The point is Donald Trump has been talking tough on illegal immigration, and what has happened?The number of people trying to get into the country illegally is way, way down.Now if you listen to the left, Donald Trumps tough talk on illegal immigration should have them pouring over the border.Just the enforcement of existing law -- the promise to enforce existing law, the threat to enforce existing law, the commitment to build the wall, the tough talk, the committed talk on the policy -- is actually working.It is causing there to be a massive, major reduction in the numbers of people attempting to get into the country illegally.
Joe Arpaio, the 85-year-old disgraced former Arizona sheriff who recently announced his candidacy for a Senate seat in the same state, spewed the false and racist assertion on CNN that former President Barack Obamas birth certificate is fabricated and that he wasnt born in the United States.Of course, President Donald Trump endlessly promulgated the debunked conspiracy for years, even accrediting Arpaio, and only recently said in 2016 that he believed Obama was truly born in Hawaii and not Kenya.— Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 18, 2012 Always remember, I was the one who got Obama to release his birth certificate, or whatever that was!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2014 The president pardoned Arpaio on Aug. 25 — a Friday night, when most of the nations attention had been focused on the arrival of Hurricane Harvey."Arpaio’s life and career, which began at the age of 18 when he enlisted in the military after the outbreak of the Korean War, exemplify selfless public service," the statement said."Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio continued his life’s work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration.Arpaio has a long and well documented history of abusive and racist law enforcement tactics and violated a court order "to temporarily cease making immigration-related arrests after he was sued for racial profiling."Arpaio announced a bid for Sen. Jeff Flakes Arizona Senate seat and is the perfect fit for the presidents hardline immigration agenda and widespread federal crackdowns.

He added that the suspects broke into the home through the front door over the weekend, but said he was not sure exactly how they gained entry.The investigation into the events and the motive behind the Las Vegas shooting last Sunday night is in flux.Last week a press conference was held jointly by the FBI and the local Sheriff in Las Vegas concerning the recent murder of at least 59 people in that city.This directly contradicts with the earlier report that the security guard found the room of the killer and stopped him from shooting on the crowd.The FBI’s lack of transparency along with the corrupt and criminal acts by former FBI Directors lead all of America to begin forming conspiracy theories and to further lose trust in the FBI.Newsmax reports: Paddock shot the unarmed Campos in the leg as he was moving toward the room outside in the hallway, The Daily Beast reported being told by Dave Hickey, president of the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America.[…] Campos had taken an elevator to the 32nd floor of the hotel because the stairway door had been blocked, The Daily Beast said, and when Campos got to the door where he suspected Paddock was barricaded, he was met with gunfire through the door.Schuck was on a higher level of the Las Vegas hotel on Oct. 1 when he got a call to look at a fire exit door that wouldn’t open on the 32nd floor.
Opinion Donald Trump’s words hit the headlines again with reports, first in The Washington Post, that he railed Thursday against immigrants from shithole countries, such as Haiti, El Salvador and in Africa, and called for taking more people from Norway, which is nearly 90 percent white.But this isn’t the America that many of us cherish – the nation of immigrants, of the Statue of Liberty.Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, tweeted that the president’s comments are further proof that his Make America Great Again agenda is really a Make America White Again agenda.The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used, the president tweeted.This is beyond the daily drama and craziness coming out of this White House, and is already hurting the nation’s standing around the globe.We all need to stop pretending that there are no consequences when the most powerful person in the world espouses racist views and gives a wink and a nod to the darkest elements in our society, Feinstein said in perhaps her toughest statement yet on Trump.If the president can’t control himself and lead this country with the authority, dignity and leadership it requires, then he shouldn’t be the president.Related stories from Sacramento Bee Trump denies shithole comment but Illinois senator confirms the remarks Trump denies ‘shithole countries’ comment and says Haiti slurs were ‘made up by Dems’ Trump asks why US should accept immigrants from ‘s-hole countries’, sources say Yet the sad truth is that all of this may actually solidify Trump’s support among some in his base – the one-third of Americans who apparently will stand by him no matter what he does or says, no matter how outrageous or unfair or damaging.
The order to dismiss the lawsuit was filed Friday, the same day a jury of 12 acquitted Mateen’s widow Noor Salman, who was charged with aiding and abetting a foreign terror organization and obstruction of justice.Family members of nine victims and four survivors of the nightclub shooting sued Twitter, Facebook and Google on December 19, 2016, claiming that the online platforms aided and abetted and conspired with the Islamic State, an international terrorist organization, to commit the June 12, 2016 attack.The lawsuit alleged that the companies knew that ISIS members and its official news outlets use numerous accounts on the social media platforms to publish the organization’s messages and to recruit and ‘radicalize’ persons such as Mateen.They argued that because Mateen was able to access videos of beheadings and other jihadist material through their platforms, they contributed to his self-radicalization.But the Michigan court ruled that the Orlando shooting was not directly committed by ISIS, nor did the companies do anything to support Mateen.U.S. District Judge David M. Lawson wrote in his dismissal that there is no definitive evidence suggesting that the material Mateen saw online directly led to the attack, other than that the principles espoused in them motivated Mateen to carry out the dreadful act.The only conduct involved with the attacks that is described with any particularity is Mateen’s, Lawson wrote, which suggests that he planned and conducted the shooting in isolation, when he ‘self-radicalized’ by perusing Internet postings, and then acted on his self-informed radical sentiments.During the Salman trial in Orlando, prosecutors released Mateen’s web activity in the weeks leading up to the attack, including Google and Twitter searches related to ISIS, terrorism, and FBI surveillance.
Democratic politicians have been brainwashed by political hacks like me to begin all of their statements about guns by declaring support for the Second Amendment and a deep affinity for the cultures of hunters and sportsmen—even if they themselves have never fired weapons.We call them gun safety proposals instead of gun control measures because pollsters and consultants divined that gun safety would be less alarming to gun voters, and that gun voters were to be coddled at all cost.The government can track purchases of allergy medicines that can be used to make methamphetamine, and fertilizers that can be used to make bombs, like the one used in Oklahoma City in 1994, but not deadly assault weapons.Requiring that guns use smart-gun technology, which would dramatically reduce accidental deaths, particularly among children, who, according to a 2016 study, are dying accidental deaths at the hands of guns at the rate of one every other day.But Pelosi was right, and I would like to see more Democrats find her courage, because the alternative is to surrender our ideals, and the moral high ground, for no discernible upside.After all, he calls for a national gun buyback program similar to Australia’s but fails to inform his readers that the buyback was simply a more palatable gun confiscation program masquerading as choice.Then again, this is the guy who says this, followed by claiming, Republicans currently control every branch of government and the NRA is still producing agitprop aimed at convincing gun owners that liberal Democrats and radical leftists are going to come after their guns.The entire post is nothing more than a paper dedicated to trying to convince Democrats that the answer to guns is to move even more to the left on guns, to stop pretending that they don’t want all the guns, yet he has the nerve to blame the NRA for producing videos?
In April 2017, the St. George Gazette web site published an article positing that President Trump had signed an executive order forcing NBC’s popular and long-running Saturday Night Live sketch comedy TV program off the air: Today President Donald Trump made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency by signing Executive Order 14838, which cancels the television show Saturday Night Live, or SNL.Under the new order, it is now illegal for any private or federally funded agency to air or show footage of the popular television show in any format.During the press conference today, Trump explained that his decision was based on a personal belief that the show is divisive and contrary to America’s deepest held values.Saturday Night Live is the definition of fake news and that is why it is now gone forever, Trump told reporters.I’ve never found the show to be humorous and I don’t know how it stayed on the air as long as it did, but I made sure to put an end to that today.I know some actions that I take are questioned by those who don’t want or understand freedom; these are people who hate America, but I know my true supporters are with me on this decision to cancel SNL, just like all my other brilliant ideas.There was no truth to this story (the premise of which would clearly constitute a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech).This item originated with the St. George Gazette, one of many fake news web sites which masquerade as the online arms of (non-existent) newspapers.
There are not many newspapers that have published positive views on Donald Trump, but the GOP nominee rejected the praise of this one outright.The Crusader, the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan, leapt to defend Trump in its quarterly issue with a front-page banner headline, Make America Great Again.In an interview with the Washington Post, Robb embraced Trump’s campaign, but he denied that his opinion piece amounted to a formal endorsement Overall, we do like his nationalist views and his words about shutting down the border to illegal aliens.The paper quotes Trump’s slogan and features a large photo of Trump wearing the hat, but it does read more like an essay on the nationalist strain of the GOP nominee’s campaign slogan than a traditional endorsement.While Trump wants to make America great again, we have to ask ourselves, ‘What made America great in the first place?’ the article continues.The Trump campaign was quick to denounce the publication, issuing this statement Tuesday night: Mr. Trump and the campaign denounces hate in any form.This publication is repulsive and their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign.White nationalist and former Klansman David Duke announced his support for Trump in February, and initially, Trump was slow to reject it when asked about it by CNN, saying he didn’t know anything about him.
Kiessling filed objections last Friday against Ross’ decision to award custody to the parent who’s believed to have raped the lady whose identity must be kept confidential because of the nature of the crime.An assistant prosecutor on this, Eric Scott, told me she had granted her consent, which was a lie — she has never been asked to do this and certainly never signed anything In granting parental rights to Mirasolo, Ross has prevented the woman from fleeing the presence of her alleged attacker.And in a bizarre and some would say ironic turn of events, the rape victim may, in fact, go to jail if she does not comply with the court’s demands.For anyone who may be wondering about the details of the alleged rape, the lawyer provided a glimpse into the kind of horrific and violent torture the rape victim allegedly endured.She, her 13-year-old sister and a friend all slipped out of their house one night to meet a boy and the boy’s older friend, Mirasolo, showed up and asked if they wanted to go for a ride…They thought they were going to McDonald’s or somewhere…Instead, he tossed their cellphones away, drove to Detroit where he stole gas from a station and then drove back to Sanilac County, where he kept them captive for two days in a vacant house near a relative, finally releasing the older sister in a park.Instead of prosecuting Mirasolo to the fullest extent of the law, he was offered a plea deal for being a first-time offender and was back on the streets after less than 7 months in jail.Barbara Yockey, Mirasolo’s attorney did not indicate her client had any intention of being a parent to the child who happens to be the product of a reportedly brutal rape.The woman was ordered to return to the state where she was raped and forced to live within two hours drive of the perpetrator (100 miles).
The expenses incurred by United States presidents and their families on vacation trips and other travel away from the White House are an evergreen topic of partisan debate, given that much of those, including the requisite round-the-clock Secret Service protection and use of military aircraft for travel, are footed by the federal government.In that vein, an Internet meme loosed on social media nine months into Donald Trump’s presidency made the claim that taxpayer expenditures on vacations, golf, and personal security for the president, First Lady Melania Trump, and their youngest son Barron had thus far averaged more than $16 million per month, as compared to an average of about $1 million per month for travel by President Obama and immediate family during Obama’s entire eight years in office.This is the text: As of October 14, 2017 Taxpayer dollars spend on vacations, golf and personal security while not at the White house for Barack, Michelle, Malia and Sasha $98,0,0.00 over 8 years or $1,020,833.33 per month Taxpayer dollars spend on vacations, golf and personal security while not at the White house for Donald, Melania and Barron $147,0,0.00 over 9 months or $16,3,3.33 per month Not a peep from Conservatives.In early August 2017, CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller toted up how many days Trump had spent away from the White House versus the number of days Obama spent offsite and found that Trump’s total, at all or part of 41 days away from Washington, was nearly twice Obama’s, at all or part of 21 days away (although George W. Bush had them both beat at 61 days away).Although it’s too soon as of October 2017, just nine months into his presidency, to render even a semi-complete portrait of the Trump family’s travel expenses (such details are rarely released except in response to Freedom of Information Act inquiries, and sometimes not even then), preliminary indications are that Trump’s past criticisms of Obama will come back to haunt him.Looking at the information we do have, the Obama family’s travel expenses during the entire eight years of his presidency totaled approximately $106 million, according to the most recent FOIA numbers released by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, who kept close tabs on Obama’s spending.Focusing just on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago trips, of which there were seven between Inauguration Day and mid-August 2017, an attempt at a more comprehensive estimate by the progressive watchdog group Center for American Progress Action Fund settled on a cost of roughly $3 million per trip — a total of $21 million for all of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago stays through August, amounting to $2.6 million per month).Although there isn’t yet enough information to work up a detailed comparison of the Trump family’s travel expenses versus the Obama family’s, it seems a near certainty, barring a dramatic change in lifestyle, that the Trumps’ expenses will continue to outpace the Obamas’ by a healthy margin, although nowhere approaching the $15 million-a-month disparity alleged by Internet sources.
Damon New York Times Donald Trump has virtually stopped trying to win this election by any conventional metric and is instead stacking logs of grievance on the funeral pyre with the great anticipation of setting it ablaze if current polls turn out to be predictive.There is something calamitous in the air that surrounds the campaign, a hostile fatalism that bespeaks a man convinced that the end is near and aiming his anger at all within reach.It’s as if the man is on a mission to demonstrate to voters the staggering magnitude of his social vulgarity and emotional ineptitude.The coarseness of your character has been put on full display, and now the electorate has come to cash the check you wrote.He is a ball of contradictions that together form a bully, a man who has built a menacing wall around the hollow of his self.America has a habit of romanticizing the playboy as much as the cowboy, but there is often something untoward about the playboy, unseemly, predatory and broken.And he seems constitutionally incapable of processing the idea that wealth is not completely immunizing, that some rules are universally applicable, that common decency is required of more than just common folks.When you have a political party that takes as its mission to prevent government from working instead of to make government work, a party that conflates the ill effects of a changing economy with the changing complexion of the country and is still struck by fever over the election of President Obama, Trump is a natural, predictable endpoint.
Only 9% of America Chose Trumpand Clinton as the Nominees By ALICIA PARLAPIANO and ADAM PEARCE While Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton will represent the entire country, the Americans who selected them are a small part of it.103 million of them are children, noncitizens or ineligible felons, and they do not have the right to vote.Based on the share of eligible adults who voted in the 2012 general election.An additional 73 million did not vote in the primaries this year, but will most likely vote in the general election.A small percentage of people vote in primaries but not in general elections, and they are also not included.The remaining 60 million people voted in the primaries: about 30 million each for Republicans and Democrats.Just 14 percent of eligible adults — 9 percent of the whole nation — voted for either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton.The overall shares were about the same in 2008, the last cycle without an incumbent president running.
Web hosting company GoDaddy on Monday tweeted that it has given the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, 24 hours to find another internet service provider.A GoDaddy spokesman told the New York Daily News that the Daily Stormer violated its terms of service by posting a blog deriding a woman killed in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday.Given this latest article comes on the immediate heels of a violent attack, we believe this type of article could incite additional violence, which violates our terms of service, GoDaddy spokesman Dan Race said in an email to the Daily News.Some Twitter users on Monday praised GoDaddy for taking a stand against the Daily Stormer following Anglin’s controversial blog.Other people on the social media platform criticized GoDaddy for hosting the Daily Stormer for as long as it did before Monday’s announcement.The hacking collective Anonymous also took credit Monday for targeting the Daily Stormer following Anglin’s blog.This site is now under the control of Anonymous, a post on the Daily Stormer’s front page said.The post did not mention GoDaddy’s message to the Daily Stormer, and the article about Heyer was not taken down.
TIL: Police departments will literally do anything to get us to stop killing each other on the road, even succumbing to meme culture… — Big Uzi Vert (@BlvckGrip) August 21, 2017 The NSW Police Force is Australia’s oldest and largest police organization, and serves a population of seven million citizens in New South Wales.Also, they’re apparently into browsing Reddit, because they just used the Man Looking at Woman meme to promote safer driving… app-facebook about a year ago 11K 1.7K 718 Keep your eyes on the road #yourhappinessisrighthere This isn’t the first time a police department has tried to promote public safety via hip means, and it surely won’t be the last.But are memes an effective way to get people to stop texting and driving?Probably not, because until they finally start using that tax money to hire legitimate graphic designers who up their font game, we’re going to continue to refuse to care about our safety on the road.What do you think of the NSW Police Force using the Man Looking at Woman meme to promote road safety?Do you think this is a good way to get people to be more conscious of their driving habits?Let us know on Twitter @Smosh!
Abedin announced that she was separating from Weiner in August, but the investigation eventually led to the discovery of a laptop containing thousands of emails potentially relating to the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server.In early October, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal’s Devlin Barrett, agents investigating Anthony Weiner notified McCabe that a laptop had been discovered that could contain emails pertinent to the separate investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server.JASON CHAFFETZ The GOP chairman of the House Oversight Committee has been closely tracking the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of private email servers as secretary of state.Terry McAuliffe, a former top aide to the Clintons, reportedly recruited McCabe for the seat in an effort to tip the balance of the state Senate.While she was recruited around the time that The New York Times broke the Clinton emails story, the FBI didn’t launch its investigation into it until July 2015 and Andrew McCabe wasn’t promoted to his current role until earlier this year.Huma Abedin The emails being reviewed by the FBI were found on laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner in the course of a separate investigation into Huma Abedin’s now-estranged husband, Anthony Weiner.Abedin was said to be surprised by the emails on the computer, and during her interview with the FBI, she said she had given up all relevant electronic devices used for emails relating to her work for Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state.When the Clintons were short of money after they left the White House burdened by legal debt, it was McAuliffe who secured the loan with $1.35 million of his own money, the New York Times’ Adam Nagourney reported at the time (they paid him back soon after).
While Kimmel has spent a lot of the week calling out President Donald Trump and the NRA, this time he decided to take his attacks to a whole new level.Kimmel tweeted: Dear crazies: it is fascinating that 500 innocent people get shot and your anger is directed at me.Think about that Kimmel calling gun owners crazies backfired on the celebrity big time: Its fascinating that Stephen Paddock shot over 500 people and you are blaming guns and politicians.Im a longtime fan jimmy, sometimes it seems like you are talking down to us and or lecturing.Oh sweetie, it might be a good idea to do some research prior to assigning blame to the wrong people.A DISNEY SHAREHOLDER WHO IS ABOUT TO START COMPLAINING ABOUT YOU.Its crazy to hop on your platform to cudgel &amp; shame innocent people for an act by a madman, then call them crazy when they get mad at you.But it appears that fans would appreciate it he stayed out politics and stuck to comedy.
Its hard to stay away from strong opinions surrounding the election, even from those not allowed to vote.Jimmy Kimmel, megaphone for children everywhere, took to the streets to ask some kids about their feelings on President-elect Trump.One kid showed us his "angry face."One kid thinks hes going to be "HUUUUUGE!"One Canadian kid is less than thrilled about a potential mass exodus to his home country, but will welcome Snoop Dogg with open arms.One kid thinks he looks "like a dope."One kid thinks he might murder her mom.optimism, right?
Donald Trumps campaign manager Kellyanne Conway reacted to Trumps debate performance and the fact he held a press availability with four women who have accused the Clintons of misconduct."These women want to be heard," Conway said of Kathleen Willey, Kathy Shelton, Juanita Broaddrick and Paula Corbin Jones."Im really proud of Donald Trump for raising it in exactly the right way," she told Megyn Kelly on The Kelly File, " How does Hillary Clinton treat these women after the fact?"Conway was referring to Clintons statement that alleged victims of sexual assault "deserve to be heard"."Juanita Broaddrick in the pre-debate press availability said Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton attacked me.Clinton, then Hillary Rodham, represented the accused rapist of then-12-year old Shelton, and reportedly laughed about the case after the suspect was vindicated.Willey and Jones have accused Bill Clinton of assault and have insinuated that Hillary Clinton enabled him and attacked them.Regarding Trumps vulgar recorded discussion with Billy Bush, Conway said it was "disgusting [and] offensive, and Im not going to excuse what he said."
As the world marks the 100th anniversary of the 1917 Russian revolution, America should take note of our own communist revolution – the eight years of the Obama presidency and his leadership of the global anti-Trump resistance.National security reporter Bill Gertz said, The directive, according to officials familiar with its contents, outlined how the administration would seek to support the Muslim Brotherhood around the world despite the Islamist supremacist organization providing the ideological underpinning for jihadist terrorism for both al Qaeda and its successor, the Islamic State.He explains that, without the support offered by the Soviet bloc and the Arab world, international terrorism would revert to its earlier, localized manifestations before the 1960s and would hardly dominate the global scene.On the 100th anniversary of the Virgin Mary Fatima revelations about Russia’s threat to world peace, we also learn from Dr. Paul Kengor’s new book that the Soviets were behind the May 13, 1981, attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II.The book, A Pope and a President: John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, and the Extraordinary Untold Story of the 20th Century, says Reagan’s CIA director Bill Casey confirmed the Soviet role, in the face of official CIA resistance to the finding.Until the reality of Obama’s communist support is examined and the secret role of Russia in global conflict exposed, the former president and America’s enemies will have the upper hand.And the fact that the president and Ambassador Haley at the U.N. have managed to convince China that even if you’re in a competition with us, you will not profit by having a nuclear war on your border and they joined us with Russia – it’s a big deal – in the tightest sanctions package against North Korea in history, that tells you how big a problem North Korea is.Some May 19 members committed acts of violence and terrorism, such as the 1981 Nanuet Brinks robbery and murders, the bombing of South African offices in 1981, and the U.S. Capital bombing in 1983, notes Gilbert.
