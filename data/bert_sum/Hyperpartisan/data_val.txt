Rumors that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are allegedly on the verge of divorce have been circulating as early as a few weeks into their marriage. New reports claimed that there is a new woman involved in Jennifer Aniston and Justin Therouxs alleged rocky relationship and its none other than Jens close friend, Chelsea Handler. Is the former "Friends" star jealous because her new husband and her pal are getting too close? A source claimed that Justin allegedly cant stand Chelsea and her antics. " Recently, Justin came home to find Chelsea cooking breakfast in their kitchen . completely naked," Celeb Dirty Laundry reported. " Chelsea hates wearing clothes, and she documents her naked adventures on social media all the time." " But Justin Theroux has forbidden her from having any more naked romps in his house while he is out of town," the report continued. According to an insider, Chelsea Handler was allegedly just trying to be funny. Unfortunately, Justin Theroux wasnt laughing. Apparently, Theroux confronted Aniston about her friend and how she irritates him. " Chelsea thought it was hilarious, but Justin was really annoyed. Apparently Jen got in the habit of inviting Chelsea over for boozy girls nights whenever he was away filming," OK! It bugged him to come home and find Chelsea there and the house a mess, but he bit his tongue. But now that he and Jen are married, he is establishing some ground rules, chief among them is that Chelsea is no longer welcome in their guest room," the report said. It has been previously reported that the newly weds are allegedly having problems over Jennifer Aniston being jealous because of Justins purported closeness with his "The Leftovers" co-star, Margaret Qualley. The newlyweds friends are hoping that the couple work out their differences especially since the couple is allegedly in the process of adopting a baby.

MAINZ, Germany — At least 17 ISIS militants have arrived in Europe concealed as refugees, according to Germany’s domestic intelligence service. Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of the BfV agency, said in an interview with the daily FAZ newspaper over the weekend that most of them are already in prison or dead." The total includes two suspects who died in the Paris terror attacks, according to the report. Last year, Germany alone welcomed more than 1.1 million migrants, mostly from Syria and Afghanistan. In an interview with NBC News earlier this year, Maassen said that ISIS was trying to "send a political, not an operational signal" by capitalizing on the migrant crisis. that it is capable of smuggling terrorists to Europe concealed as refugees and that every refugee can be a terrorist," the intellgence chief added. His agencys annual security report published last week notes that Europe is faced with a new dimension of [Islamist] terror," stating that it has to be assumed that ISIS is planning further attacks in Europe, including Germany.

On Thursday Chappelle-Nadal compared Trump to Hitler. Democrat Maria Chappelle Nadal defended her decision to compare President Trump to Hitler in an interview on Thursday afternoon… AND she played the race card. FOX 2 reported: The St. Louis Post-Dispatch interviewed Chappelle-Nadal about the tweet. She tells the newspaper that, I have a First Amendment right to share my opinion, and if a meme is offensive to people, they should look at the First Amendment again, she said. Then ask yourself why you have different qualifications for a black woman of Puerto Rican descent than other people putting up a meme with no words.

From flickr.com: made in china {MID-167067} made in china ( Image by twicepix) Permission Details DMCA Article originally published in LaborPress By Robert Weiner and Ben Lasky After deferring to China for Korea and seeing no results, President Trumps return to disciplining China over trade crimes is the right position. On Aug. 14, President Trump authorized a probe on Chinas trade practices, with a focus on intellectual property theft as well as theft of American technologies. Add to the mix: devalued currency, refusal to sell fair quantities of American-made products, unbelievably low worker wages, lead and other poisons in dog food and baby food, plagiarized health and cancer research, deficient tires. Trump has now come back around to the correct view. The President slipped off the wagon for a while. He pressed on the point that the U.S. needed China to help deter a nuclear North Korea. However, dozens of missile tests later, with Kim Jong Un even closer to a long-range nuclear weapon, Trump now realizes that China only used the North Korea bait to give themselves more trade freedom against us. It is time to call the Chinese government out. The U.S. economy is weakened by Chinese intellectual property theft, counterfeit goods, and deficient products competing with American brands. China was unwilling to help make North Korea release Otto Warmbier early enough to get him medical help. In an interview on CNN Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) the Senate Democratic Leader, told Trump how to handle China: "You say, you cant push America around anymore, which theyve been able to do for administration after administration. The President should say, Youre not dealing with North Korea the way you should be." Instead, China is giving us a victory here and there-- they will now import beef from us. Apparently we can sell cows to China, but not cars. Schumer criticized Trump for at first reversing course. Schumer said of Trump and his team, "Now they say they (China) arent manipulating their currency. The way to get China to help with North Korea is be tougher with them on trade." I felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power [over] North Korea." Of course China has leverage over North Korea. China will help regardless because its in Chinas own interest to do so. Not allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. has been a Democratic issue for over forty years, from Dick Gephardt to Bernie Sanders, and it became a key one for Trump too-- a rare area of campaign agreement. The presidents promise to stand up to China was one of the major reasons he won the election. China should not get a free ride because we want their help with North Korea. In 2015, the FBI released a survey of 165 anonymous companies, half of which reported they had been victims of economic espionage. Are they buying us by Americans enjoying a $30 "Rolex" from a Times Square vendor? Simply put, Chinas illegal actions are costing American jobs. The U.S. has military might and is willing to use it.

Print Close Top Hillary Clinton aides were upset a Muslim man was publicly named as the shooter in a 2015 massacre that left 14 people dead, and a longtime Clinton confidant even expressed regret that the terrorist wasn’t a white man, according to purported emails released by WikiLeaks on Sunday. The emails were part of a trove of messages stolen from the gmail account of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, who has had a long association with the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. The email chain began on Dec. 2, when digital operative Matt Ortega forwarded a tweet from MSNBC host Christopher Hayes that named one of the shooters in the San Bernardino, Calif., attack as Sayeed Farook. Consultant Karen Finney forwarded the email to Podesta, commenting, Damn. Podesta responded: Better if a guy named Sayeed Farouk [sic] was reporting that a guy named Christopher Hayes was the shooter. Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, gunned down 14 people and injured 22 in a terror attack during a holiday party at the Inland Regional Center on Dec. 2. The attackers pledged their allegiance to ISIS before dying in a shootout with police later in the day. But Podesta’s written lament of the shooter’s ethnicity underscores a long-running aversion in the Clinton campaign – and many in the Democratic party at large – to associating terrorist acts with any aspect of the Islamic religion. In a 154-page debate prep book that was developed two months after the San Bernardino attacks, and also unearthed in the WikiLeaks document dump, topic 47 is devoted to Should we call this Islamic terrorism? Nowhere in the suggested seven-point answer does Islamic terrorism make an appearance. Instead, it’s suggested that Clinton call the enemy radical jihadists. Now, of course there are those who twist Islam to justify mass murder, point three begins. But we can’t buy into the same narrative that these barbaric, radical jihadists use to recruit new followers. Declaring war on Islam or demonizing the Muslim-American community is not only counter to our values – it plays right into the terrorists’ hands. Point seven states: Radical jihadists underestimate us. We won’t turn on each other or turn on our principles. We will keep our country safe and strong, free and tolerant. And we will defeat those who threaten us. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made a concerted effort to note that Clinton and President Obama don’t use Trump’s preferred descriptive term, Radical Islamic terrorism. Obama held a lengthy press conference earlier this year to specifically address why he refused to link Islam and terrorism. But in the wake of the Orlando nightclub terror attack in June, and amid more Trump prodding, Clinton relented somewhat. Whether you call it radical jihadism or radical Islamism, I’m happy to say either, she said at the time. The latest email release was the ninth day this month that emails from Podestas account were revealed on WikiLeaks. So far, about 12,0 of 50,0 alleged emails have been released. /2016/10/16/wikileaks-podesta-lamented-that-muslim-not-white-man-named-as-killer-in-2015-massacre.html
Jul 1, 2017 at 3:15 PM The progressive strategy of investigating President Donald Trump nonstop for Russian collusion or obstruction of justice or witness tampering so far has produced no substantial evidence of wrongdoing. The alternate strategy of derailing the new administration before it really gets started hasn’t succeeded either, despite serial efforts to sue over election results, alter the Electoral College vote, boycott the inauguration, delay the confirmation of appointments, demand recusals, promise Trump’s impeachment or removal through the 25th Amendment, and file suit under the Emoluments Clause. A third strategy of portraying Trump as a veritable monster likewise so far has failed in four special elections for House seats. Apparently progressives have accepted the idea that Barack Obama’s formula of twice winning the Electoral College is not yet transferable to other progressive candidates such as Hillary Clinton. And they probably have concluded that Obama’s progressive political agenda proved unpopular with voters by 2010 and had to be implemented by ad hoc executive orders — presidential prerogatives now utilized by Donald Trump to overturn the ones Obama issued. A fourth potential pathway to power would be a return to Bill Clinton’s pragmatic agendas of the 1990s. But apparently progressives find that centrist remedy worse than the malady of losing elections — given that during the Obama tenure, more than 1,0 state and local offices were lost to Republicans, in addition to majorities in the House and Senate, and a majority of governorships and legislatures. Trump acts as if he is a Nietzschean figure, assuming that anything that does not destroy him only makes him stronger. And now, slowly, his accusers are becoming the accused. One nagging problem with the progressive case against Trump for purported Russian collusion and obstruction of justice was that members of the Obama administration had more exposure to those allegations than did the political newcomer Trump. Last year, then-FBI Director James Comey testified that not only did former Attorney General Loretta Lynch improperly meet in secret with Bill Clinton during an investigation of Hillary Clinton, but that Lynch had asked Comey to downplay the investigation into Hillary’s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. Comey confessed that he had reluctantly agreed to Lynch’s request. Last month, in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey admitted that he asked a friend to leak notes about Comey’s earlier conversation with Trump in hopes of forcing the nomination of a special investigator to lead the Russia investigation — perhaps a successful gambit, given that Comey’s friend, former FBI Director Robert Mueller, was soon appointed to that role. Comey also wrongly dismissed Hillary Clinton’s email problems because of a perceived lack of criminal intent — a supposedly mitigating circumstance that legally should have had no bearing on things. As far as alleged Russian collusion, there had long been conservative accusations that Bill and Hillary Clinton used Hillary’s status as secretary of state to leverage honoraria for Bill and donations to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for concessions to Russian interests. Moreover, Russian tampering efforts had been going on for months before the 2016 election, but without any retaliatory measures from the Obama administration, which knew about Russia’s meddling. In an inadvertent hot-mic request in 2012, Obama asked outgoing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to urge Russian President Vladimir Putin to give me space during Obama’s re-election campaign, so that after his assumed success, Obama could reciprocate with more flexibility on Russian issues. In the present highly charged climate, would that be seen as a form of Russian collusion? Meanwhile, the House Intelligence Committee is still investigating whether top Obama administration officials wrongfully used the power of foreign-intelligence collection to conduct surveillance of Americans — particularly members of the Trump campaign. The point is not whether the Clintons, James Comey, Barack Obama or members of the Obama administration can be proven to have engaged in illegal or unscrupulous behavior. Rather, the lesson is that progressives should have offered alternative political visions that might have won back the American people rather than attempting to terminate the Trump presidency on charges to which the progressive side was far more vulnerable. Now that Trump is emerging from successful House special elections and has fended off six months of media attacks, celebrity invective and progressive efforts to abort his tenure, he seems to be going back on the offensive. Currently, House and Senate investigations are doing to Democrats what has been done Trump. So far these probes seem to have better chances to prove alleged wrongdoing. What does all this political back-and-forth mean? Democrats struck preemptively to take out Trump before he unwound the Obama legacy. The return volley is being launched at a time when an energized Trump is gaining momentum on health care and tax reform, and an improving economy. In sum, to thwart a new president’s policies, it is probably wiser to offer alternative agendas instead of trying to destroy him before he has even entered office.

There are many more, including Trump’s club trying to welch on a $1 million hole-in-one payout (out of all of Trump’s bad qualities, his steadfast refusal to pay people what he owes them, while bragging about it, is the most enraging), along with the old bit about Trump blithely ignoring local ordinances so he could put a big, dipshit flagpole up at the Mar-A-Lago club, with his lawyers stating—with a straight face—that a smaller flag would fail to appropriately express the magnitude of Donald J. Trump’s . . . Trump is a liar and a crook, and he commits abominable acts at such a frenetic pace that they get lost in the fury surrounding whatever horrible thing he does next. Remember when Trump said he would get rid of food regulations? Regardless, in the end, people are still gonna vote for this man.

I am preaching to the sad little choir in my soul here. Because while Trump is a miserable bastard, YOU are the people who have handed him the bullhorn. YOU are the people willing to embarrass this nation and put it on the brink of economic ruin all because you wanna throw an electoral hissy fit. YOU are the people who want to revolutionize the way America does business by voting for its worst businessman, a disgusting neon pig who only makes money when he causes problems for other people instead of solving them.

From flickr.com: Money {MID-161793} Money ( Image by 401(K) 2013) Permission Details DMCA No Pill Can Stop Tinnitus, But This 1 Weird Trick Can The walls are closing in on Congress. Terrifying walls of water from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which, when the damage is totaled, could rise to a half trillion dollars. The Walls of War: The multi-trillion dollar ongoing cost of Afghanistan, Iraq and other interventions. The crumbling walls of the U.S. infrastructure, which need at least $3 trillion to be repaired or replaced. A wall of 11 million undocumented immigrants, whose deportation could easily cost $200 billion. The planned wall at the Mexican border, which some estimates place at $67 billion. Then there is the Wall of All, the $20 trillion national debt. At moments of crisis in our nation, in addition to invoking the assistance of Higher powers, we can call upon the Constitution for guidance. Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution contains a long-forgotten provision, "the coinage clause," which empowered Congress "to coin (create) Money." The ability to create money to meet the needs of the nation is a sovereign power, which enables a nation to have control of its own destiny. The same article indicates the Founders anticipated having to borrow money on the full faith and credit of the United States. Enter the Funding Act of 1790, which assumed and paid off the debt of the colonies and retired the financial obligations of the newly created states now united. This was a powerful, object lesson in debt retirement, relevant today. It is abundantly clear from a plain reading of the coinage clause that the Founders never intended that the only way the government was to be funded was to borrow money. The needs of the nation were to come from a system of not borrowing wherein money was a neutral value of exchange connecting resources, people and needs, without debt attached. In 1913, the passage of the Federal Reserve Act ceded the constitutional power to create money (and control of our national destiny), to the Federal Reserve, a quasi-private central bank. At this fateful point, the only way money could be brought into being was to borrow it, whereby money became equated with debt. The money system transited from public control to private control, and there it has remained. Instead of following the path set forth by the Founders to create money directly, our government became obliged to borrow from private banks, which assumed the sovereign power to create money from nothing and then loan it to the government, turning on its head the intention of the Founders. As a member of Congress, I came to the conclusion that while the debate over taxation was interesting, it was wholly insufficient. One must first study how money is created, before one can sensibly have a discussion of how it is to be taxed. With the help of staff, I spent a full five years working with legislative counsel to come up with a way to realign with the founding principles, to reclaim and to re-establish for our nation the sovereign power to create money. The vehicle was H.R. 2990, the National Emergency Employment Defense (NEED Act), which articulates why the current debate over the debt ceiling should lead directly to a debate about monetary policy, and the origins of the debt-based economic system. This system has been a source of financial instability where the banks ability to create money out of nothing has become a financial liability for the American taxpayers. But there is always money to bail out the banks. Let us take the opportunity afforded in the debate over the debt ceiling to regain control of our sovereignty and our national destiny. Let us return to first principles, and reclaim the constitutional power to coin and create United States money and spend it into circulation to meet the needs of the nation and reduce taxes. Two hundred and thirty years ago this month, delegates from 13 states gathered in a constitutional convention, which set the stage for ratification. Let us summon that same revolutionary spirit and its wisdom to guide us in the days ahead.

The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the President of the United States of America following a shooting on Sunday evening in which at least 58 people were killed, and over 500 others were injured. In a statement, The Queen said: Prince Philip and I were saddened to learn of the terrible attack in Las Vegas. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the families and those who have been injured. The incident, which is now the worst mass shooting in recent American history, happened on Sunday evening and is said to have been perpetrated by a 64-year-old man named as Stephen Paddock. Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards a festival which was being attended by 22,0 people. It is not known what the motive for the attack was. However, investigators have said that there is no evidence the 64-year-old was linked to any international terrorist group. President Donald Trump described the attack as pure evil and praised the emergency services saying that their speed saved lives. It is understood Mr Trump will be visiting Las Vegas later this week. More information will be added to this page as it becomes available.
MADISON – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the White House announced the Keystone XL Pipeline will be exempt from President Trump’s executive order requiring construction projects to be built with American steel. President Trump has repeatedly vowed to build construction projects with American steel as a way to support manufactures and create jobs here at home—even going as far as making it one of his first signed executive orders, Rep. Pocan said. But now, he has decided that a major construction project will not abide from his own Buy America plan. House Republicans have already shown their hand by opposing provisions to permanently require American steel be used in our country’s infrastructure projects. If President Trump is concerned with livelihood of American workers, he should take steps to ensure the Buy America Act is strongly and meaningfully enforced. Unfortunately, the President’s talk about ‘Buy America’ is proving to be just another broken promise to the American people. Previously, Rep. Pocan sent a letter to the Trump transition team asking the President to enforce and expand the Buy America Act, and also highlighting Congressional Republican leadership’s opposition to requirements that American tax dollars go to companies that employ American workers. To date, Rep. Pocan did not receive a response from the transition team, nor have White House officials responded in any capacity.
President Trump has said that any legislation touching the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program must include a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. ( Under President Trump, it might be two: chain migration. Our current immigration system fails Americans, Trump said at the White House on Thursday Chain migration is a total disaster, which threatens our security and our economy and provides a gateway for terrorism. DACA protects undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as minors from deportation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in September that the program would be phased out for these reasons. It must give our immigration officers the resources they need to stop illegal immigration and also to stop visa overstays. And, crucially, the legislation must end chain migration. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders described the president as reiterating in the meeting with GOP senators the administration’s view that any action on DACA must come with action on the presidents immigration reform principles, which were released last year. Chain migration is a phrase used to describe a feature of immigration law that allows immigrants to sponsor their relatives to come to the U.S. Family reunification is responsible for more than two-thirds of legal immigration annually, while less than 10 percent come for primarily employment-based reasons. Immigration restrictionist argue this produces a mismatch between immigrant skill levels and the U.S. labor force, at the expense of American workers and recent immigrants. endorsed by Trump in August, would cut immigration in half in part by limiting family-based immigrant sponsorship to spouses and minor children. They would like to see something like this provision be part of any DACA deal. Look, if you give amnesty to one or two million illegal immigrants who were brought here through no fault of their own, as kids, you’re going to have at least a couple negative effects, Cotton said on Fox News. And one of those negative effects is you’re going to have a whole new chain of chain migration. The way to control for that negative effect is to stop chain migration. The group’s president, Roy Beck, uses the words together. While Congress debates yet another amnesty, we want to help Americans visualize how the presence of chain migration categories means that amnesties are never limited to the people receiving them but instead open up lifetime work permits to millions more of their extended family and in-laws, Beck said in a statement. Many of the Republicans negotiating with Senate Democrats on a DACA fix favor more expansive immigration policies than Trump. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., for example, was part of the Gang of Eight and is a co-sponsor of the Democrats’ preferred bill for resolving the status of DACA. Social conservatives helped beat back a 1990s attempt to reduce immigration in part by limiting chain migration on the grounds that family reunification was a pro-family policy. Many immigrant communities and their advocates also oppose the change, arguing that it is already too difficult to immigrate to the U.S. and, this is, itself, a driver of illegal immigration. But Graham suggested Thursday that Trump could succeed where Obama and Bush failed if lawmakers were willing to compromise. Theres a bill to be had, he said at the White House. If you want it bad enough, well get it and it will be good for the country. But Ive never been more optimistic about an immigration reform proposal making it to the presidents desk right now. has been a persistent critic of Trump on immigration, among other issues, and asked for a place at the table on DACA negotiations when the administration was lobbying him on tax reform. If POTUS wants to protect these kids, we want to help him keep that promise. Trump has held to these positions even after his split Steve Bannon, who pushed for immigration restrictions when he was working at the White House and has published numerous articles on the subject on his media site Breitbart. We must BUILD THE WALL, stop illegal immigration, end chain migration [and] cancel the visa lottery, Trump tweeted Thursday evening. The current system is unsafe [and] unfair to the great people of our country — time for change!
In October 2017, Colin Kaepernick told a CBS reporter he would stand for the national atnthem if he were signed by an NFL team. In October 2017, a rumor spread that former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick — who National Football League teams have refused to sign since his 2016 silent protest during the national anthem — had said he would be willing to stand during the national anthem if he was signed by a team. Kaepernick was the first NFL player to sit, and then kneel, during the anthem, in protest against police brutality and racial injustice. The Daily Wire web site wrote: According to a breaking news report from the Associated Press, former San Francisco 49ers second string quarterback Colin Kaepernick now says that he’ll stand during the national anthem if an NFL team suddenly decides to give him a job: BREAKING: Quarterback Colin Kaepernick tells CBS he’ll stand during national anthem if given chance to play football in NFL again. According to CBS News, which sat down with the out-of-work NFLer for several hours, Kaepernick is actively looking for work, and is willing to abdicate his year-long national anthem protest, if only an NFL team would deign to allow him to warm their bench. The sports web site Bleacher Report similarly reported: Free-agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who remains unsigned after sitting or kneeling during the national anthem throughout the 2016 season, said he plans to stand if signed by an NFL team. Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports revealed Kaepernick’s intentions Sunday. These reports (and others) were ultimately based on claims made by CBS reporter Jason La Canfora, who has since resiled from these claims. The Daily Wire’s story has been updated to reflect that, and the Associated Press has deleted its tweet. However, as of press time, the Daily Wire’s article retained its original, inaccurate headline QB Colin Kaepernick Now Says He’ll Stand for the National Anthem If He’s Signed to a Team. As of press time, the Bleacher Report has not yet updated its story. On 7 October 2017, CBS reporter Jason La Canfora appeared on the show NFL Today and summarized a conversation he had had with Kaepernick. During that segment, La Canfora described the player’s determination to return to an NFL team, and claimed: He’s not planning on kneeling, he’s going to donate all his jersey sales, and he’s planning on standing for the anthem, if given the opportunity. However, a day later Colin Kaepernick appeared to allude to the inaccuracy of that account, in this tweet: A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on. Kaepernick’s girlfriend, radio presenter Nessa Diab, directly refuted La Canfora’s claims: The reports that Colin will stand for the anthem are completely false! NFL Today deleted a video of La Canfora’s claims from its Twitter account, and La Canfora himself posted a series of tweets clarifying that he had not, in fact, discussed the possibility of standing for the national anthem in his conversation with Kaepernick. Wanted to clarify one thing regarding @Kaepernick7. When I was asked about his whether or not he would sit or stand for anthem … Standing for Anthem wasn’t something that I spoke to Colin about sat. I relayed what had been reported about him standing in the future… Reports about @Kaepernick7 standing for anthem had not been refuted. However, I cant say if they are true or not. Colin and I didn’t discuss Colin would have to address any future demonstrations. I didn’t ask him if he would sit or stand. Our chat primarily about his will to play I know @Kaepernick7 is fully committed to playing football and helping those in need. What he would do during the Anthem I do not know It was not the first time that a news organization reported Kaepernick’s purported willingness to stand during the anthem. In March 2017, Adam Schefter wrote an article headlined Colin Kaepernick to stand during national anthem next season, in which he cited anonymous sources: Quarterback Colin Kaepernick will stand during the national anthem next season, sources told ESPN on Thursday. Kaepernick no longer wants his method of protest to detract from the positive change he believes has been created, sources told ESPN. Schefter did not quote Kaepernick himself in the article or offer verifiable proof. We could not find any evidence to corroborate Schefter’s claim.

The FBI is advising people to hang up if they receive a call from a woman screaming for help. A decades-old virtual kidnapping scam is placing more U.S. residents at risk of becoming potential victims, the FBI warned on its website. The scheme takes many forms, but basically callers trick victims into paying ransoms to free family or friends who have been kidnapped. The virtual abductors coerce victims to pay a ransom before victims can find out that no one has been kidnapped. The FBI had been tracking virtual kidnapping calls primarily from prisons in Mexico between 2013 and 2015. The callers targeted individuals who spoke Spanish, the FBI said. Most of the victims were from the Los Angeles and Houston areas. The FBI issued the warning because kidnappers have widened their pool of potential victims by no longer targeting only specific individuals and Spanish speakers. The callers also are cold-calling numbers in various cities. In a recent investigation, the FBI found that more than 80 people have fallen victim to the new tactics in California, Minnesota, Idaho and Texas. Those victims paid more than $87,0 in ransom. An FBI spokeswoman for the Kansas City offices said she was not aware of any instances that have occurred in Kansas or Missouri where the FBI was involved. The scam works this way: The potential victim answers a call and hears a woman screaming, Help me! The victim might blurt out a name, like Mary, asking her if she’s OK. At that point, the caller will tell the victim that Mary has been kidnapped and she will be harmed if ransom isn’t paid quickly. The scam is successful when victims don’t know the whereabouts of their loved ones. The scammers typically demand that the ransoms are wired to Mexico. The amount is typically less than $2,0 because of legal restrictions for wiring larger amounts across the border, the FBI said. However, two victims in Houston were coerced to pay larger ransoms by making money drops. A federal grand jury charged a 34-year-old Houston woman in July with 10 counts, including wire fraud and money laundering, for her involvement in the scam. The charges are the first federal indictment in a virtual kidnapping case, the FBI said. Robert A. Cronkleton: 816-234-4261, @cronkb How to avoid falling victim If you receive a call from someone demanding ransom for an alleged kidnap victim, the FBI suggests: Hang up the phone. Don’t call out your loved one’s name if you do respond to call. Request to speak with the alleged victim. Ask questions only the alleged victim would know. Listen to the voice of the alleged victim if they do speak. Try to contact the alleged victim on the phone, text or social media. If you believe a real kidnapping has taken place, call 911.
The editor-in-chief of the ultra-conservative, Steve Bannon-run news outlet Breitbart admitted during a radio broadcast Friday morning that his teams defense of defeated Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore was a bid to protect President Donald Trump from the potential fallout from the various accusations of sexual misconduct against him. During Friday mornings broadcast of the SiriusXM Patriot stations "Breitbart News Daily" program, host and editor-in-chief Alex Marlow stated in no uncertain terms that Moore was a "horrible," "terrible" candidate, though the media propertys allegiance to Trump left him with "no option" but to defend his positions and his alleged behavior. Multiple women have alleged that both the president and Moore either harassed or assaulted them in their years before taking elected office. " There was no option to throw Judge [Roy] Moore under the bus," said Marlow. " If you set the standard that Roy Moore, who was accused of abusing five women . . . If you make that the standard, the left is going to use it to take out President Trump." Marlow continued to cast doubt on the credibility of Moores accusers, but reinforced the notion that, at the end of the day, his publications support of the Alabama candidate was not about the contender himself. " There was never any reason to cave unless you have a . . . unless you would like President Trump to get removed from office," he continued. " And if not even removed from office, at least have massive distractions from his agenda so that we never accomplish anything for the remainder of the presidents term." Marlow added that "much of the Republican Party" would like to see the presidents leadership derailed on those terms. " Much of the Republican Party does not see that as a negative," he said. When youve got a race when youve got a horrible candidate. Lets not — you guys are being too polite about Roy Moore — he was a terrible candidate," he said. " His message did not resonate, he had all the baggage, he had the scandal. When hed run for statewide office hed only won in very tight races or relatively tight, considering hes the Republican. Roy Moore was not a good candidate at all." Throughout the contentious 2017 Alabama special election to replace Jeff Sessions, whom Trump nominated for Attorney General shortly after he won the presidency, Breitbart was one of Moores more active, vociferous defenders. Working hard to deny the many claims of sexual misconduct against him, forward the candidates bizarre, often unconstitutional positions and cast aspersions on his opponents — first GOP primary candidate Luther Strange and then Democratic contender and eventual victor Doug Jones — Breitbart became a sort of mouthpiece for the Moore campaign, even when the campaign could barely speak on its own behalf. Indeed, Breitbart leader and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon directly campaigned for Moore, framing the candidate as a Trumpian, anti-establishment vanguard of a new ultra-conservative takeover of Congress (even though the president backed Strange in the primaries). It seems now that even Bannons underlings knew Moore was a poor choice for Bannons planned conservative insurrection, an effort that now appears dead in the water. As if it needs to be said, the cynicism of a news outlet backing a candidate it knows to be a poor politician — and perhaps an even worse person — for the benefit of another potentially equally compromised figure is titanic. But then again, there has never been anything idealistic or pure about Breitbarts support of the president or, indeed, the presidents support of the hard-right racial, political and cultural agenda that publication and its followers espouse. They are all "useful idiots" for each other. With that as the power exchange active in both conservative politics and conservative media, it only stands to reason that a "terrible," "horrible" candidate such as Moore would go so far and create so much noise standing on their shoulders.
Both candidates are pretty popular among trick or treaters this year. Display and Costume in Seattle sold out of Donald Trump masks a few days ago. They only have a few Hillary Clinton masks left. KING 5’s Ted Land visited the packed store on Sunday as last-minute shoppers looked for political costumes.
CNNs Don Lemon called President Trump a liar, petty, and devoid of the facts after he held a rally Tuesday night in Phoenix. Lemon also questioned Trumps fitness for office and if he is "stable." " Hes unhinged, its embarrassing and I dont mean for us, the media because he went after us, but for the country," Lemon said. " His speech was without thought, it was without reason, it was devoid of facts, it was devoid of wisdom. DON LEMON, CNN: Well, what do you say to that? Im just going to speak from the heart here. What we have witnessed is a total eclipse of the facts. Someone who came out on stage and lied directly the American people and left things out that he said in an attempt to rewrite history, especially when it comes to Charlottesville. Hes unhinged, its embarrassing and I dont mean for us, the media because he went after us, but for the country. This is who we elected president of the United States. A man who is so petty that he has to go after people who he deems to be his enemy, like an imaginary friend of a 6-year-old. His speech was without thought, it was without reason, it was devoid of facts, it was devoid of wisdom. He was like a child blaming a sibling on something else. He certainly opened up the race wound from Charlottesville. A man clearly wounded by the rational people who are abandoning him in droves, meaning those business people and the people in Washington now who are questioning his fitness for office and whether he is stable. A man backed into a corner it seems by circumstances beyond his control and beyond his understanding. If you watch that speech as an American, you had to be thinking what in the world is going on? This is the person we elected as president of the United States? This petty, this small, a person who is supposed to pull the country together?
President Trump’s approval ratings continue to lag behind those of past presidents at the same point in their first terms. In the video above, see why his approval rating is lower than even President Ford’s.

A new undercover video shows New York Times audience strategy editor Nick Dudich bragging about his anti-Trump bias and his history as a former antifa member. Conservative activist group Project Veritas released the video on Tuesday, showing Dudich joking about being objective, before saying: No, I’m not. Dudich emphasized his influence within the Times newsroom, saying that his imprint is on every video we do. The editor also claimed to be a former antifa member who frequently assaulted alleged neo-Nazis. Yeah, I used to be an antifa punk once upon a time, Dudich says, referring to the militant far-left movement that has repeatedly attacked conservatives and Trump supporters.
Why Did Mayor Petty Hire Well Known Communist Dan Margolis To Run His Campaign Smear Team And Serve On The Library Board? Email us at Turtleboysports@gmail.com for more information. The mayor of the second largest city in Worcester is working hand in hand with a guy who admittedly is trying to foment communist revolution, and targeted black churches because he believed they were vulnerable. Check out his Wiki page: Dan Margolis was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1976. In 2006 he was chair of the New York State Communist Party USA. He joined the Communist Party USA in 2001. Communism only appeals to people in impoverished areas where they have given up and believe capitalism has failed them. It’s why he wants to make Worcester a sanctuary city – so we can lose $59 million in federal funding. Life has gotten worse for the Russian people. Actually, now Communist Parties are voted back to power by the people in such places like Moldova, Belarus, and Chech Republic. Boris Yeltsin once stood on a tank and protected the legitimate government from armed communists trying to stage a coups. Naturally Dan is not a fan of Boris Yeltsin. Just a Google away for any responsible leader. Joe knows exactly who Red Danny is but he employs him on his campaign team anyway because he’s a useful idiot. He knows that Red Danny has his own blog where he makes up lies about Turtleboy Sports raping girls and blah, blah, blah. There’s a good chance he actually HIRED Dan to write his silly little blogs. The same businesses that Mayor Moron claims he wants to attract and keep in the city. Here’s the best part – he voted for his buddy Red Danny to be appointed to the Library Board on May 31 when he thought no one was looking: The City Council Tuesday night elected Daniel M. Margolis of 15 Rugby St. to the Worcester Public Library Board of Directors. Mr. Margolis was one of three candidates who sought to fill a vacancy on the library for for a term that expires on Dec. 31, 2019. Mr. Margolis received six votes, followed by Edward R. Carr who received four votes and Paul DePalo who received one vote. Edward R. Carr has a PhD and is a professor at Clark. They knew EXACTLY who they were voting for. People like Red Danny are allowed to serve in our government – an admitted, openly communist revolutionary. People like Etel Haxhiaj get appointed to the CAC under Petty’s watch, and deny ANYONE who supports Turtleboy Sports a job they are overly qualified for on city boards. Make no doubt about it – Petty is the mastermind here. Red Danny, Etel, Mosaic – these are just his goons. Because Petty does a great job of convincing everyone he’s this nice guy because he doesn’t get his hands dirty. He just outsources to labor to nudniks with nothing to lose like Red Danny. This is what a vote for Mayor Moron is a vote for in November. We urge you to support the following local businesses.
President Trump issued a stern warning to John McCain after the Senator bashed the Commander-in-Chief’s unabashed nationalism. People have to careful, because at some point I fight back, Trump told WMAL radio host Chris Plante. But at some point I fight back, and it won’t be pretty. McCain responded to Trump’s comments moments later, saying that he has faced far greater challenges than this, according to CNN. Speaking at an award ceremony in Philadelphia Monday night, McCain warned against  spurious nationalism and the dangers of the U.S. abdicating its global leadership responsibilities. To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain ‘the last best hope of Earth’ for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history, John McCain said at the National Constitution Center. Senator Bob Corker is relishing his lame-duck status, using it as an opportunity to bash President Trump without fear of political retribution. After last night’s speech by Senator McCain, where the Senior lawmaker ripped President Trump’s nationalistic agenda, Corker says he loved the speech — so much so that he gave the ailing military veteran a ‘big hug,’ on the Senate floor. on Tuesday praised the speech Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) gave a day earlier, in which the Arizona Republican blasted half-baked, spurious nationalism. The pieces that I saw, I loved, and I gave him a big hug on the [Senate] floor, Corker told reporters when asked about the speech, according to CNN. McCain delivered the emotional speech Monday evening after receiving the National Constitution Center’s Liberty Medal. During the address, he said that we live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil and called Americans the custodians of those ideals at home, and their champion abroad.
Police in Dubai reopened streets near one of the worlds tallest residential skyscrapers after firefighters successfully extinguished a Friday blaze, forcing residents to evacuate in the middle of night. No injuries have been reported, but a few people were treated for smoke inhalation. This isnt the first time the 86-story building caught fire, having done so just 2.5 years earlier. The cause of Fridays fire wasnt immediately known, but, in the past, infernos in Dubai have been linked with highly flammable building cladding. " You never think its going to happen to you. I had cash in there, furniture, paintings. . Many things that are very valuable to me." The Associated Press contributed to this report. A skyscraper in the United Arab Emirates burst into flames Thursday when the Torch Tower in the Dubai Marina began blazing in the night sky. Flames began racing up the 86-story building, which is a popular residence for expats living in the UAE’s largest city. Footage of the conflagration circulating on social media shows firefighters frantically trying to stop it from spreading. The Dubai Media Office confirmed the UAE’s Civil Defence is fighting the inferno raging at the tower. Firefighting squads from four Civil Defence stations have been deployed to bring the fire under control, a spokesman said. Some Twitter users on Thursday voiced shock at the fire burning at the Torch, which is the world’s fifth largest residential building at 1,105 ft. Other people on the social media platform noted that hundreds of people evacuated the same building during a February 2015 fire. People across multiple social media outlets ranging from Facebook to Instagram, meanwhile, shared video footage of the rare event. Civil Defence officials told the Sun that they had successfully evacuated the Torch while fire fighters tried stopping the blaze. The Sun reported that the 2015 fire at the same building was quickly brought under control, resulting in no fatalities and seven people receiving treatment for smoke inhalation. A Dubai Police spokesperson told the Gulf News that the fire broke out on the tower’s ninth floor before spreading four floors higher. The BBC reported that the Torch boasts 676 apartments, with a two-bedroom flat starting at more than $500,0. Residents at the property also have access to an eight-story garage, according to the BBC, and a swimming pool which overlooks Dubai’s waterfront. The Torch is expected to be the 32nd tallest building in the world, according to the Skyscraper Centre. The Associated Press contributed to this report.
And now a twitpic featuring a photo of the two most powerful men in Washington, D.C. Good conversation with @BarackObama Wise words, &amp; much appreciated 5ulp So what were the "wise words" in said "good conversation?" According to The Washington Times, Griffin said President Obama spoke to him about "protecting myself." Griffin and Obama both were in the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. for the NCAA Tournament matchup between Syracuse and Marquette. Obamas concerns are in lock-step with Washington Redskins coach Mike Shanahan, who spoke of the need for Griffin to protect himself better following a spectacular rookie season that ended with a wrecked knee. The evolution of the NFL: Take a look at how the NFL has evolved from its humble roots, and the efforts being made to ensure it continues to grow. As for Obama, this isnt the first time hes given safety advice to a prominent NFC East quarterback. At a fundraiser in Oakland last year, Obama had a message for Michael Vick during a conversation with former Eagles cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha. " This is the same Obama who said in December that if he had a son, hes not sure hed let him play football. Its safe to say any football being played on White House grounds is of the two-hand touch variety.
At the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, thousands of great Americans are represented by priceless family heirlooms, donated to help them museum to share their experiences. Among them is the freedom paper donated by 83-year-old Elaine Thompson. It belonged to her great, great, great grandfather, Joseph Trammell of Loudon County, Virginia, reports CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan. You can pick up this and touch it and know that it was in his hands. Trammell protected his freedom using a tin box, knowing the paper held his only proof that he was no longer someone’s property. As long as he had this, they could not enslave him, Thompson said. His freedom paper, Thompson said, offers an image of who Joseph Trammel was during a time when photos were rare. He was five-feet-seven-inches tall in height, with several marks on his body. The one thing I was curious about is about the scars that they mention. Probably he was beaten at some point, Thompson said. The tin box is the only one like it at the National African American Museum of History and Culture. During our interview, founding director Lonnie Bunch came by to personally show his appreciation. It means a lot to me, it really does, Bunch told Thompson. Nearly 40,0 items were donated – more than any other Smithsonian museum – including pictures, clothing furniture, jewelry and more. They fill vast silences in the record, said Paul Gardullo, a curator at the museum. These are things that are irreplaceable and priceless, Gardullo said. But many of these cherished keepsakes have a way of churning up old wounds. Rosemary Crockett donated her father’s jacket. My dad flew 149 missions during World War II. Fifty missions were the norm, Crockett said. Now, white guys were going home after 50 missions. Woodrow Wilson Crockett, was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the first group of black military personnel to fight in World War II. When they came back from overseas, they came off the Liberty ship. And there was a sign saying ‘White this way, colored that way,’ Rosemary recalled. And sharing that important history to future generations keeps people like Rosemary Crockett and Elaine Thomspon giving what’s left of a story that should never be forgotten. For people who look at some of these artifacts or even these very painful times and say, ‘slavery is over, we should move forward, why do we have to keep talking about it,’ what do you say to that? The past is never over because it influences what people do later on, Thompson said. People continue to donate personal items. Curators here said they’re already making plans for this museum to evolve, just like history. The National Museum of African American History and Culture will open to the public on Saturday, Sept. 24.
When it comes to illegal smuggling, criminals will try to push anything for a profit. Money is the goal, and it doesn’t matter who or what is being transported; if there is money to be made, you’d better believe that they will go to whatever lengths they can to cash in. Unfortunately, much of the time, living things are the cargo. In certain areas of the world, particular species sell for extraordinary prices on the black market, as immoral as it may seem to traffic them. This was on the minds of officials who recently stopped a large truck carrying freight at the Chinese border. After becoming suspicious about what was on board, they decided to take a look inside. What they found was deeply disturbing, to say the least… Crossing from one country to another, even without a great deal of cargo, can be an extremely difficult process. After all, border crossing almost always warrants a thorough investigation. Few know this more than illegal smugglers. TheMuuj / Flickr Each and every day, literally tons of products are shipped from place to place in huge cargo trucks. Most of the time, they’re perfectly legal items traveling from warehouse to warehouse. Sometimes, however, these trucks contain illegal freight, such as narcotics. These drugs can be molded into various shapes resembling actual legitimate items to throw off the police. There’s seemingly no end to what criminals are willing to do… jm3 / Flickr Border officials are well aware of the potential criminal activity that they could encounter. That’s why they’re well-trained to handle any situation of the sort that may arise. Still, the strange things they uncover might surprise you. Times Asi / Flickr In one instance, a large cargo truck was stopped by officials at the Chinese border. The paperwork that the driver gave to border patrol was slightly inaccurate, which instantly raised suspicions. Pixabay When officials peered into the back of the truck, it initially seemed like everything checked out. Nonetheless, the authorities wanted to take a closer look to be sure that nothing fishy was going on… HM Revenue &amp; Customs / Flickr Police ordered the cargo to be unloaded and inspected to ensure it wasn’t anything illegal. There was a lot to go through, but they needed to be certain there wasn’t anything unlawful slipping into the country. CGTN / Youtube It took a large team of workers to help figure out exactly what was going on. Every individual on duty was required to examine each one of the boxes extremely closely. They weren’t sure if they’d find anything, but they had a hunch… When the police finally uncovered what was being transported, they were horrified. Needless to say, the driver was immediately arrested. It’s a good thing that they put a stop to this before it was too late! Find out what they discovered in the video below… (Warning: may be disturbing to some viewers.) The illegal transporting of animals needs to stop. Hopefully, authorities will continue to crack down on this practice so we can put an end to it once and for all. Share this alarming story with your friends below.
Las Vegas Metro Police hold a press conference to discuss the . During a press conference, Las Vegas Metro Police under Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters that the department is still unclear on shooter Stephen Paddocks motivation for the attack he perpetrated earlier this week. Lombardo also asked anyone with more information about the attack to come forward. He said that he believed that someone must have seen something that was out of place, whether it was suspicious activity, or someone who seemed to be acting strangely. The girlfriend of the man behind a recent mass shooting in Las Vegas told investigators he displayed mental health symptoms before the attack, according to NBC News. NBC News on Friday reported that one former FBI official briefed on the matter confirmed that Marilou Danley recently made the remark about Stephen Paddock. [ Danley] said he would lie in bed, just moaning and screaming, ‘Oh, my God,’ another former FBI official aware of the situation said. NBC News’s sources said Paddock may have been in mental or physical anguish before committing the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history last Sunday. Accusations of fake news are everywhere lately. How well can you tell apart the actual fake headlines from the real ones in this quiz? The sources added, however, that the FBI has not yet identified what motivated Paddock to open fire upon an outdoor concert. The FBI also does not believe Paddock’s mental health had eroded to a point that would have triggered him to begin his rampage, according to NBC’s sources. Federal and state law enforcement officials additionally confirmed to NBC News that Paddock had been prescribed an anti-anxiety medication called Valium. Some Twitter users on Friday speculated about Danley and her reported remarks to investigators about her boyfriend. One of the former FBI officials said that investigators are additionally scrutinizing about six media devices Paddock left behind. The search includes an inquiry into Paddock’s web browsing history before he began shooting at a country music event last weekend. Responding police found Paddock dead inside his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. The shooting killed at least 58 people and wounded more than 527 others, sparking renewed national debate over gun control.

Liberals have used Hurricane Harvey to their advantage in almost everything: climate change, abortions and now DACA. ABC’s Martha Raddatz exploited the hurricane in a desperate argument to keep DACA. The American people have spoken, and we want Obama’s Dreamers out of here, PERIOD! For that matter, fake Republicans (like Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio) who want these illegal alien anchor babies to stay also need to shut their yap, because they’re directly going against the will of the American people. We are concerned for the future of AMERICAN children, not illegal alien anchor babies.
Members of law enforcement stage near the area where a suspect in a series of bombing attacks in Austin blew himself up as authorities closed in, Wednesday, March 21, 2018, in Round Rock, Texas. ( AP Gay) People have been quick to point out how a bombing in Austin, Texas is reported in the wider media. Police said today that the suspect linked with a series of deadly parcel bombs targeting Austin, Texas, is dead. The suspect was killed after detonating a device when officers approached his car. Four bomb attacks took place in Austin, the state capital, and one in Schertz. The blasts that began in Austin earlier this - involved package bombs and a tripwire and all said to be related. The bombings killed two people and left the Texas capital terrorised with fear for 19 days. The Austin bomber, a 24 year old white male (therefore not classified as a terrorist ) will no longer TERRORIZE Austin residents. # AustinBombing— Brian Krassenstein🐬 (@krassenstein) March 21, 2018 Imagine if the Austin bomber was a Mexican or Muslim. When the Austin Police chief announce that the bombing suspect was found, Trump would had been calling for a ban of immigrants or the immediate building of his stupid wall. AustinBombing— Ed Krassenstein 💎 (@EdKrassen) March 21, 2018 Bombings have barely made the news. Black people murdered by a white male, no surprise that the media isn’t interested. # AustinBombing— cheat_codes (@closeweek) March 21, 2018 Could you imagine what Donald Trump, Republicans and Fox News would have been saying if the #AustinBombing terrorist was Muslim, Black or Latino? But no, he was a 24 year old white male so it’s just another passing news story not a 24/7 tool to fear-monger against minorities— ♻️ Christopher Zullo (@ChrisJZullo) March 21, 2018 Austin bomber was a 24 year old white male. I am sure he will be described as a sick individual instead of terrorist. # AustinBombing #DomesticTerrorism— Naturalclone (@naturalclone) March 21, 2018 #AustinBombing.24 year old white male suspect killed after detonating last bomb as police closed in. Or, as the rest of the world sees it, American Terrorist kills himself with own device. If you still believe terrorists are only Muslims with a backpack, I truly pity you.— ❄ (@gnomes_77) March 21, 2018 Some were a little blunt than others. This shit is fucking terrorism, stop being fucking dumb. but no it can’t possibly be terrorism if they’re not a muslim. #
Their ideological vanities are under threat as never before. The chronic weakness of their regime has been further exposed by the triumph of a US presidential candidate who does not share their devotion to open borders, the destruction of national identities and the march of globalisation. Ever since the referendum, the Brussels elite has comforted itself with the illusion that Britain outside the EU will be left hopelessly isolated. The Eurocrats and their Remain cheerleaders in Britain were only too thrilled when President Obama arrogantly warned that, in the event of Brexit, we would have to get to the back of the queue for any future trade deal with the US. He is far closer to Britain than to Brussels. It is the EU that will have to get to the back of the queue. As one European diplomat admitted at the weekend: We would never have held a similar dinner if Hillary Clinton had been elected. Sensibly our own Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson refused to attend this self-indulgent feast of grief. On the contrary, they will just use Trump’s success to push for more central power, more integration, more unity. The EU should treat his election as a wake-up call to take charge of our own destiny, says Guy Verhofstadt, the Belgian federalist fanatic. The EU will this week discuss plans to impose a European defence strategy, complete with its own EU army and military headquarters. It is precisely that kind of federalist megalomania which shows why Brussels is such a threat to the stability and peace of Europe, a far greater menace than Trump ever could be. Ever since Trump first became a contender for the US presidency there has been a fashionable narrative which paints him as a dangerous, ignorant clown who could blow up the western world with his reckless inexperience. But the real risks actually come from smug globalisers such as Hillary Clinton and the EU federalists with their contempt for national sovereignty at home and abroad. The president-elect has a chance of establishing peace with Russia It was the EU, filled with an imperialist ambition to expand its territory, that provoked an incendiary confrontation with Russia over Ukraine, whereas Trump wants co-operation with Putin. Similarly, the western policy of trying to bring down President Assad of Syria with the help of Islamic extremist rebels has only prolonged the civil war there. It will be no surprise if the war ends once Trump takes office, enabling Putin and Assad to crush the rebels. In the wake of Trump’s victory the head of Nato Jens Stoltenberg said that we face the greatest challenges to our security in a generation. It is because the pathetic, supine ruling classes of Europe have allowed our enemies to flourish in our midst. They are destroying our civilisation from within. Through their fixation with free movement they have promoted the import of Islamic extremism and terrorism on an epic scale, while their ruthlessly imposed doctrine of cultural diversity has meant continual appeasement of Muslim militancy. Trump wants to challenge the jihadists: figures such as Mogherini, a Communist in her youth, just want to surrender to them. Islam is a victim and belongs in Europe, she proclaims. The EU brought chaos upon Europe, not Donald Trump EU policy, not Trump, has brought squalor, social breakdown, organised misogyny and financial chaos to Europe. The filthy migrant squatter camps in France and the predatory sex attacks in Germany are the twin symbols of the nightmare that Brussels has inflicted on the continent. By condemning patriotism, undermining solidarity and slashing military spending, Europe’s politicians have left the member states defenceless. Trump has a mandate from the American people. Unelected and unaccountable, EU President Jean-Claude Juncker and his crew have no such democratic legitimacy. Juncker sneered last week that we need to teach the President-elect what Europe is and how it works. The entire EU project has been a catastrophic failure.
Image via Getty UPDATED 10/18/17, 2:45 p.m. ET: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell held a press conference on Wednesday and spoke about how the NFL wants players to stand during the national anthem. However, he also reemphasized that the league will not try to force players to stand at this point. " We just had two days of conversation of which this was a fair amount of dialogue and I think we all see this the same way," Goodell said. " Our focus is on the opportunity we have to make our communities better through these efforts with our players. We’ll deal with these issues as they come up." Goodell steered clear of directly addressing the tweet Donald Trump sent out on Wednesday about the NFLs decision not to force players to stand. Goodell: "were focusing on what we should be doing as the NFL," in response to more questions about Trumps Tweets — Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) October 18, 2017 Additionally, Goodell said he wants the league to "stay out of politics" and talked about how he hopes that there will eventually be "zero" players kneeling during the anthem. As per usual, Donald Trumps using his personal Twitter account to spew garbage takes about shit he doesnt truly understand. Just a week after saying a one-game suspension would have scared Colin Kaepernick from kneeling in protest of the national anthem ever again (ROFL), hes back on Twitter clapping at the NFL for not bringing the hammer down on players who are still protesting. The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017 "The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem," Trump tweeted. " This is no doubt in response to the NFL saying they would not prohibit players from protesting the anthem late last week. If Trump was so concerned about players protesting the national anthem—which, again is a part of the First Amendment—why doesnt he stop the police from murdering black people? You know, what these fucking protests are actually about. If Trumps so concerned about people openly resisting the tradition of bigging up America before playing a game, why doesnt he go to the root of the problem? Oh right, because while he spews a hatred for "fake news," he has no problem feeding the fuckery.
Now that a federal judge has held Obamas illegal "executive amnesty" unconstitutional, perhaps U.S. senators will remember that they swore to uphold the Constitution, too. Back when they needed our votes before the last election, Republicans were hairy-chested warriors, vowing to block Obamas unconstitutional "executive amnesty" -- if only voters gave them a Senate majority. The resulting Republican landslide suggested some opposition to amnesty. And Brat did it by an astonishing 55.5 percent to 45.5 percent. Again, the voters seemed to be expressing disquiet with amnesty. was denouncing Obamas executive amnesty. " 1 most important problem facing the nation. In other words, Obamacare is more popular than amnesty. Thats like losing a popularity contest to Ted Bundy. Since at least 2006, voters have insistently told pollsters they dont want amnesty. Seemingly bulletproof Republican congressmen have lost their seats over amnesty. President Bush lost the entire House of Representatives over amnesty. What else do we have to do to convince you we dont want amnesty, Republicans? Before the election, then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell complained that Obamas decision to delay his executive amnesty until after the election was a ploy to prevent Americans from "hold(ing) his party accountable in the November elections." But voters went ahead and held Obama accountable! Now McConnell is Senate majority leader -- and he claims his hands are tied. When do you start standing up to the president? To gin up votes, "Republican insiders" told the Washington Examiner last fall that "the results of the midterm elections" would determine how "aggressive" the GOP would be in fighting Obamas amnesty. Voters gave you a blow-out victory, Republicans. Wheres that promised aggression on amnesty? Republicans and George Will tell us they cant stand up to Obamas executive amnesty because the media are unfair. The media have blamed the GOP for every failure of Republicans and Democrats to reach an agreement since the Hoover administration. Instead of submitting to the medias blackmail, my suggestion is, take their gun away. Contrary to hysterical claims by the media and George Will, the government wont shut down if the Democrats filibuster goes on forever. Nearly all DHS employees are deemed "essential" personnel who are required to stay on the job even if the departments budget doesnt pass -- the Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard. Approximately 200,0 of DHSs 230,0 employees are required to keep working through what the media will hysterically call a "government shutdown." Why dont Republicans spend all their airtime attacking the media for lying about what Obamas amnesty does and what the Democrats are doing? Its hard to avoid concluding that Republicans arent trying to make the right arguments. In fact, it kind of looks like theyre intentionally throwing the fight on amnesty.

Many of you have probably heard Donald Trump’s ignorant comments about NFL players protesting injustices against African Americans by now. But in case you haven’t, we’ll get right to it. On Friday, Trump held a rally in Alabama and gave his true thoughts about the mostly African American NFL players, who take a knee in protest of the mass murders and injustices of Black people by police. Trump then called the players ‘sons of bitches’ while urging the NFL team owners to fire them: Trump wishes NFL owners would tell anthem protesters "get that son of a bitch off the field right now" pic.twitter. 4EH3lNoY — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) September 23, 2017 Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he’s fired. He’s gonna say, ‘That guy disrespects our flag, he’s fired.’ They’ll be the most popular person, for a week. They’ll be the most popular person in this country.

Its a British magazine that focuses on economic matters. Its also a journal of opinion disguised, and my memory is that The Economist -- and Im talking 20 years ago, now, 25 years. It used to be approved reading by the intellectual right. My memory was that it was valuable here and there. Look at this: The Economist explains how Donald Trump may be making life easier for MS-13, the street gang. The Economists argument, the point is Trumps tough talk is encouraging and emboldening the street gang MS-13. Tough talk at the North Korean lunatic dictator? Now Trump is doing the same thing -- hes talking tough on MS-13 -- and whats happening? Let me ask you a question: What is the status of illegal immigration in the country today versus when Trump was inaugurated? In fact, lets just measure it year over year. Illegal immigration is way down, is it not? I mean, its down by a factor of millions, is it not? Have we had any significant changes in the law? Has there been any comprehensive or otherwise immigration reform or new legislation? There hasnt been any substantive change whatsoever. How has Donald Trump been approaching the issue? Well, since the middle of 2015, hes been talkin tough on it, and hes been tellin people were going to build a wall -- and hes been telling people that if they come in illegally, were going to track them down and were going to deport them. Hes been telling people if theyre here illegally and we find them were going to deport them. The point is Donald Trump has been talking tough on illegal immigration, and what has happened? The number of people trying to get into the country illegally is way, way down. Now if you listen to the left, Donald Trumps tough talk on illegal immigration should have them pouring over the border. Donald Trumps tough talk on illegal immigration should be making these illegal immigrants and their coyotes and their supporters twice or three times as committed to get in here. Just the enforcement of existing law -- the promise to enforce existing law, the threat to enforce existing law, the commitment to build the wall, the tough talk, the committed talk on the policy -- is actually working. It is causing there to be a massive, major reduction in the numbers of people attempting to get into the country illegally. Theres documented evidence that tough talk is working. Same thing with MS-13, according to The Economist. Donald Trump is making life for these gang members easier and easier. Hes talking tough and hes just helping them recruit more members.
Joe Arpaio, the 85-year-old disgraced former Arizona sheriff who recently announced his candidacy for a Senate seat in the same state, spewed the false and racist assertion on CNN that former President Barack Obamas birth certificate is fabricated and that he wasnt born in the United States. " No doubt about it," Arpaio told CNNs Chris Cuomo after being asked if the birth certificate was a phony. " I’m not going to go into all the detail, but yes, it’s a phony document." Of course, President Donald Trump endlessly promulgated the debunked conspiracy for years, even accrediting Arpaio, and only recently said in 2016 that he believed Obama was truly born in Hawaii and not Kenya. An extremely credible source has called my office and told me that @BarackObamas birth certificate is a fraud. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 6, 2012 Congratulations to @RealSheriffJoe on his successful Cold Case Posse investigation which claims @BarackObamas birth certificate is fake — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 18, 2012 Always remember, I was the one who got Obama to release his birth certificate, or whatever that was! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2014 The president pardoned Arpaio on Aug. 25 — a Friday night, when most of the nations attention had been focused on the arrival of Hurricane Harvey. In his pardon, Trump praised Arpaio as a lifelong public servant who enforced the rule of law. " Arpaio’s life and career, which began at the age of 18 when he enlisted in the military after the outbreak of the Korean War, exemplify selfless public service," the statement said. " Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio continued his life’s work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration. Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now 85 years old, and after more than fifty years of admirable service to our Nation, he is worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon." The former Maricopa County sheriff was convicted of criminal contempt of court in July, after a judge found that Arpaio had violated court orders to stop detaining undocumented immigrants, as Salon has previously reported. Arpaio has a long and well documented history of abusive and racist law enforcement tactics and violated a court order "to temporarily cease making immigration-related arrests after he was sued for racial profiling." We’ve sued Joe Arpaio for denying women prisoners access to abortion, for victimizing people with disabilities, and for racially profiling Latinos. ACLU (@ACLU) January 9, 2018 Coincidentally, Trump has repeatedly praised himself as the law and order candidate, while often demonstrating the opposite. Arpaio announced a bid for Sen. Jeff Flakes Arizona Senate seat and is the perfect fit for the presidents hardline immigration agenda and widespread federal crackdowns.
Justice Department began investigation of police departments patterns, practices after 2015 death of Freddie Gray The U.S. Justice Department unloaded on Baltimores police department Wednesday, accusing officers of routinely targeting African Americans. Federal and local officials are now demanding change.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Officials are calling it animal cruelty like theyve never seen before. As Hurricane Irma’s outer bands inch closer to Florida, animal control officers said they are hustling to rescue abandoned animals. RELATED: Florida preps for storm as Hurricane Irma | Football games in Florida canceled ahead of Hurricane Irma | Florida air travel shuts down ahead of Hurricane Irma | This is what Hurricane Irma looks like from space And these arent pets who are just being left inside, Director of Animal Care Diane Suave said. They are left in a yard, in a pen they cannot escape from or tethered to trees or poles, she said. Palm Beach County Animal Care reports animal control officers have rescued 49 dogs and two cats in the last 48 hours. Even a tiny bit of sand can hurt an animal when it’s traveling through 100-plus mph winds, Sauve said. Animal control officers were slowly pulled off the road at 2:30 p.m. Saturday. Sauve said once winds reach a sustained 35 mph, no officers will be permitted to rescue animals. We are asking the public, if it is safe, consider sheltering any animals you see left outside, she said. Both Sauve and State Attorney Dave Aronberg said they promise to prosecute anyone who left their animals outside to fend for themselves during Hurricane Irma. This is a prime example of animal cruelty, Aronberg said. We will find you, and we will prosecute you. Sauve said officials will use every paper trail imaginable to track down animal cruelty offenders. We will not stand for it here in Palm Beach County.

There was a break-in at Stephen Paddock’s Reno home on Sunday. Local police say they were called to the home by a neighbor who says they saw the lights on. RT reported: FBI agents returned to search a house in Reno owned by Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock after local police told them that someone had broken into the home over the weekend. Reno police officer Tim Broadway told The Associated Press, Nobody really saw anything, just a light was on with nobody in the residence. Broadway said officers discovered that someone had broken into the house and he immediately contacted the FBI. Police are not aware of any damages or anything that was stolen. There are no suspects at this time or any descriptions of a suspect. According to KOLOtv investigators searched Paddock’s Reno home on October 3rd and found firearms. At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Investigators said they found five handguns, two shotguns and a plethora of ammunition and electronics. The house is being treated as a potential crime scene. At least some of the guns found on Paddock’s properties had been bought at the Cabela’s store in Verdi. Is this why the investigation is such a mess? To date no motive is provided by the FBI and local police. Last week a press conference was held jointly by the FBI and the local Sheriff in Las Vegas concerning the recent murder of at least 59 people in that city. The Sheriff appeared transparent in the information he supplied. But the major question that everyone wanted to know was – why did the killer do it? Monday we found out that the killer shot the security guardbefore he fired on the crowd of people. This directly contradicts with the earlier report that the security guard found the room of the killer and stopped him from shooting on the crowd. As a result many more questions are raised like – Why the change in story? Why did the killer ever stop shooting on the crowd if the security guard did not stop him? The FBI’s lack of transparency along with the corrupt and criminal acts by former FBI Directors lead all of America to begin forming conspiracy theories and to further lose trust in the FBI. In a significant timeline change, Sheriff Lombardo reveals Mandalay Bay security guard, Jesus Campos, was shot BEFORE the Las Vegas attack started. Las Vegas sheriff says Mandalay Bay security guard was shot 6 minutes before first shots were fired at crowd., Newsmax reports: Paddock shot the unarmed Campos in the leg as he was moving toward the room outside in the hallway, The Daily Beast reported being told by Dave Hickey, president of the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America. […] Police said the suspect fired some 200 rounds at them as they approached the room, The Daily Beast noted. In another wild turn, Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino worker says he dodged bullets before Paddock shot at the Las Vegas concert crowd. I could feel them (bullets) pass right behind my head, engineer Stephen Schuck told NBC News’ Today on Wednesday. That’s the same floor where Paddock would fire on a concert 1,200 feet below, killing at least 58 people. Why is the information only coming out now? How has this hotel employee only spoke at now?
Let’s face facts: Our president holds racist views. But those who have been paying attention already suspected the darkness in Trump’s heart. Todays top news by email The local news you need to start your day Recaptcha requires verification. protected by reCAPTCHA Privacy - Terms Privacy - Terms It should have been obvious from the despicable things he said about Mexican immigrants. It should have been clear from his anti-Muslim rants. It seeped through in his reaction to the deadly march in Charlottesville, Va., putting white supremacists on the same level as civil rights demonstrators. And now it’s emerging again in the debate over Dreamers and Salvadorans who have been protected from deportation. Trump says he wants an $18 billion wall on the border with Mexico, and an end to the visa lottery and chain migration. His entire immigration policy seems to have the goalof reducing immigration from non-white countries and somehow boosting immigration from Europe. Trump says he wants to put America First in all matters. But this isn’t the America that many of us cherish – the nation of immigrants, of the Statue of Liberty. Advocacy groups for immigrants condemned what Trump reportedly said, and Democrats plan to introduce a censure resolutionnext week. Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, tweeted that the president’s comments are further proof that his Make America Great Again agenda is really a Make America White Again agenda. The White House issued a statementthat didn’t deny his slur, but defended his stand on immigration. Early Friday, Trump, who never apologizes for anything, offered a denial in a series of tweets, though it’s difficult to take him at his word given his track record of lies. The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used, the president tweeted. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made – a big setback for DACA! Later Friday, Trump signed the proclamation for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Reading prepared remarks, he called the civil rights icon a great American hero who preached racial equality. He refused to answer questions about the uproar, including whether he was racist. To say the scene was jarring doesn’t begin to capture how bizarre it was. This is beyond the daily drama and craziness coming out of this White House, and is already hurting the nation’s standing around the globe. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said Trump’s vile comments only make the jobs of Americans stationed all over the world harder – soldiers, diplomats and businesses. We all need to stop pretending that there are no consequences when the most powerful person in the world espouses racist views and gives a wink and a nod to the darkest elements in our society, Feinstein said in perhaps her toughest statement yet on Trump. If the president can’t control himself and lead this country with the authority, dignity and leadership it requires, then he shouldn’t be the president. There’s no room for racism in the Oval Office. For me, however, the conclusion is inescapable. And he very well could be a full-on racist. But it would be even worse if we ignore it.

A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit families of Pulse victims filed against several social media companies alleging they didn’t do enough to stop ISIS propaganda that radicalized gunman Omar Mateen. The order to dismiss the lawsuit was filed Friday, the same day a jury of 12 acquitted Mateen’s widow Noor Salman, who was charged with aiding and abetting a foreign terror organization and obstruction of justice. Family members of nine victims and four survivors of the nightclub shooting sued Twitter, Facebook and Google on December 19, 2016, claiming that the online platforms aided and abetted and conspired with the Islamic State, an international terrorist organization, to commit the June 12, 2016 attack. The lawsuit alleged that the companies knew that ISIS members and its official news outlets use numerous accounts on the social media platforms to publish the organization’s messages and to recruit and ‘radicalize’ persons such as Mateen. They argued that because Mateen was able to access videos of beheadings and other jihadist material through their platforms, they contributed to his self-radicalization. But the Michigan court ruled that the Orlando shooting was not directly committed by ISIS, nor did the companies do anything to support Mateen. U.S. District Judge David M. Lawson wrote in his dismissal that there is no definitive evidence suggesting that the material Mateen saw online directly led to the attack, other than that the principles espoused in them motivated Mateen to carry out the dreadful act. The only conduct involved with the attacks that is described with any particularity is Mateen’s, Lawson wrote, which suggests that he planned and conducted the shooting in isolation, when he ‘self-radicalized’ by perusing Internet postings, and then acted on his self-informed radical sentiments. During the Salman trial in Orlando, prosecutors released Mateen’s web activity in the weeks leading up to the attack, including Google and Twitter searches related to ISIS, terrorism, and FBI surveillance. bpadro@orlandosentinel.com or 407-232-0202 or follow me on Twitter @BiancaJoanie
When the discussion of gun control rears its ugly head, some well-meaning proponent of common sense gun measures invariably tells us that no one wants to take our guns. They swear that they only want the bad guns. Maybe they’ll say, No one needs an assault rifle but if you mention bans on bolt action guns or handguns, they start backing up with their hands in supplication. No one wants to do anything about those, he’ll say. Democratic politicians have been brainwashed by political hacks like me to begin all of their statements about guns by declaring support for the Second Amendment and a deep affinity for the cultures of hunters and sportsmen—even if they themselves have never fired weapons. We call them gun safety proposals instead of gun control measures because pollsters and consultants divined that gun safety would be less alarming to gun voters, and that gun voters were to be coddled at all cost. The Democratic gun control strategy fails because it is defined by this poverty of ambition—the determination never to look beyond fear of political repercussions. Universal background checks and a ban on high-capacity magazines are good ideas and we should seize the opportunity to enact them if it presents itself. But they won’t come anywhere close to making gun violence in America a tolerable problem. We are nibbling around the edges instead of proposing bold, meaningful solutions such as: A national gun registry, so law-enforcement officials can know when someone is compiling an arsenal. The government can track purchases of allergy medicines that can be used to make methamphetamine, and fertilizers that can be used to make bombs, like the one used in Oklahoma City in 1994, but not deadly assault weapons. Tracking and limiting purchases of ammunition. Requiring that guns use smart-gun technology, which would dramatically reduce accidental deaths, particularly among children, who, according to a 2016 study, are dying accidental deaths at the hands of guns at the rate of one every other day. A national gun buyback program similar to the one Australia instituted after a mass shooting that killed 35 people. There hasn’t been another one since, These proposals are essentially omitted from the national conversation largely because Democrats are scared that the NRA will spin them disingenuously to inflame gun owners. Again, Democrats presume their hand is the weaker of the two. Democrats were concerned that Pelosi had handed the NRA a political cudgel the group would brandish against every one of them. But Pelosi was right, and I would like to see more Democrats find her courage, because the alternative is to surrender our ideals, and the moral high ground, for no discernible upside. Written by former Obama staffer Dan Pfeiffer who seems absolutely in love with gun control. After all, he calls for a national gun buyback program similar to Australia’s but fails to inform his readers that the buyback was simply a more palatable gun confiscation program masquerading as choice. Then again, this is the guy who says this, followed by claiming, Republicans currently control every branch of government and the NRA is still producing agitprop aimed at convincing gun owners that liberal Democrats and radical leftists are going to come after their guns. He says this without a hint of irony at the fact that he is telling Democrats to come after our guns. The entire post is nothing more than a paper dedicated to trying to convince Democrats that the answer to guns is to move even more to the left on guns, to stop pretending that they don’t want all the guns, yet he has the nerve to blame the NRA for producing videos? It should be noted that the video he chose is the one where Dana Loesch calls out the leftist media for lying. It actually doesn’t say a thing about how Democrats want all the guns. Not that it matters to someone like Pfeiffer. All that matters is that Democrats aren’t being honest about coming after all of our guns. He’s annoyed they won’t be honest, but I’m going to let Dan know something. We already know they want them all, and that’s why no one is backing down. Especially since none of his proposals would have stopped Las Vegas.
President Trump has issued an order banning the Saturday Night Live television show. In April 2017, the St. George Gazette web site published an article positing that President Trump had signed an executive order forcing NBC’s popular and long-running Saturday Night Live sketch comedy TV program off the air: Today President Donald Trump made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency by signing Executive Order 14838, which cancels the television show Saturday Night Live, or SNL. Under the new order, it is now illegal for any private or federally funded agency to air or show footage of the popular television show in any format. Any company or individual who violates this order can now face fines of up to $250,0 and five years in federal prison. During the press conference today, Trump explained that his decision was based on a personal belief that the show is divisive and contrary to America’s deepest held values. Saturday Night Live is the definition of fake news and that is why it is now gone forever, Trump told reporters. It mocks the very beliefs that keep this great country running smoothly. I’ve never found the show to be humorous and I don’t know how it stayed on the air as long as it did, but I made sure to put an end to that today. I know some actions that I take are questioned by those who don’t want or understand freedom; these are people who hate America, but I know my true supporters are with me on this decision to cancel SNL, just like all my other brilliant ideas. Trump’s signing of Executive Order 14838 comes after more than two seasons of Saturday Night Live attacking the current President. There was no truth to this story (the premise of which would clearly constitute a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech). This item originated with the St. George Gazette, one of many fake news web sites which masquerade as the online arms of (non-existent) newspapers.

There are not many newspapers that have published positive views on Donald Trump, but the GOP nominee rejected the praise of this one outright. The Crusader, the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan, leapt to defend Trump in its quarterly issue with a front-page banner headline, Make America Great Again. Pastor Thomas Robb, the Klan’s national director, wrote,Can America really be great again? In an interview with the Washington Post, Robb embraced Trump’s campaign, but he denied that his opinion piece amounted to a formal endorsement Overall, we do like his nationalist views and his words about shutting down the border to illegal aliens. It’s not an endorsement because, like anybody, there’s things you disagree with, Robb said. But he kind of reflects what’s happening throughout the world. There seems to be a surge of nationalism worldwide as nationals reclaim their borders. The paper quotes Trump’s slogan and features a large photo of Trump wearing the hat, but it does read more like an essay on the nationalist strain of the GOP nominee’s campaign slogan than a traditional endorsement. While Trump wants to make America great again, we have to ask ourselves, ‘What made America great in the first place?’ America was great not because of what our forefathers did — but because of who our forefathers were. America was founded as a White Christian Republic. And as a White Christian Republic it became great. The Trump campaign was quick to denounce the publication, issuing this statement Tuesday night: Mr. Trump and the campaign denounces hate in any form. This publication is repulsive and their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign. White nationalist and former Klansman David Duke announced his support for Trump in February, and initially, Trump was slow to reject it when asked about it by CNN, saying he didn’t know anything about him.

The man who made a child through rape, was convicted of rape, and served time for rape, will now be granted joint custody of the child born from rape. He was never properly charged and should still be sitting behind bars somewhere, but the system is victimizing my client, who was a child herself when this all happened. An assistant prosecutor on this, Eric Scott, told me she had granted her consent, which was a lie — she has never been asked to do this and certainly never signed anything In granting parental rights to Mirasolo, Ross has prevented the woman from fleeing the presence of her alleged attacker. In other words, the rape victim now has to be within driving distance of her rapist at all times. Kiessling remarked that her client is, not allowed to move 100 miles from where she had been living when the case was filed, without court consent. If she does not comply with the order, she can be locked up. Instead of prosecuting Mirasolo to the fullest extent of the law, he was offered a plea deal for being a first-time offender and was back on the streets after less than 7 months in jail. He went on to commit another rape on a young teenager in 2010 and served only four years for the second rape. Now, Judge Ross has given him parental rights to his first victim. Barbara Yockey, Mirasolo’s attorney did not indicate her client had any intention of being a parent to the child who happens to be the product of a reportedly brutal rape. Yockey said the paternity test and subsequent custody proceedings were initiated after the other parent applied for state services. The Detroit News also spoke with the mother. She said; I think this is all crazy…They (officials) never explained anything to me. I was receiving about $260 a month in food stamps for me and my son and health insurance for him. I guess they were trying to see how to get some of the money back. Following the horrific rape, the victim dropped out of school and moved in with relatives in Florida. She went to a government office to change her address and was notified she had a court order demanding her return to Detroit. Part of me didn’t want to come back home because I was scared…I would’ve got contempt of court if I hadn’t shown. The convicted rapist’s second victim shares her sentiments. She told reporters: When I read the (Detroit News) article, I was disgusted…I guess there is no way they can do anything to him, because he has already served sentences in both cases. But there is no way he should have custody…And I don’t think he should even be allowed around any children without supervision. Yes, America, this is the judicial state of affairs in which many of our residents currently endure. A convicted rapist is given parental rights he didn’t want, to a woman who didn’t want him to have any association with her or her child, and who’d even relocated out of state. Worse still, she may actually be forced to confront her attacker when and if he ever wants to spend time with his biological child.

After only nine months in office, President Trump and family had already spent $147 million on personal travel, amounting to one-and-a-half times as much as President Obama and family spent in the eight years of the latters presidency. The stated total of $147 million for President Trump and familys travel expenditures over nine months was vastly exaggerated and unsupported by actual data. The expenses incurred by United States presidents and their families on vacation trips and other travel away from the White House are an evergreen topic of partisan debate, given that much of those, including the requisite round-the-clock Secret Service protection and use of military aircraft for travel, are footed by the federal government. ( By longstanding convention, even presidential vacation travel is categorized as official business for accounting purposes, since it is assumed, the Congressional Research Service tells us, that the president is always on duty.) In that vein, an Internet meme loosed on social media nine months into Donald Trump’s presidency made the claim that taxpayer expenditures on vacations, golf, and personal security for the president, First Lady Melania Trump, and their youngest son Barron had thus far averaged more than $16 million per month, as compared to an average of about $1 million per month for travel by President Obama and immediate family during Obama’s entire eight years in office. This is the text: As of October 14, 2017 Taxpayer dollars spend on vacations, golf and personal security while not at the White house for Barack, Michelle, Malia and Sasha $98,0,0.00 over 8 years or $1,020,833.33 per month Taxpayer dollars spend on vacations, golf and personal security while not at the White house for Donald, Melania and Barron $147,0,0.00 over 9 months or $16,3,3.33 per month Not a peep from Conservatives. If accurate, the comparison is all the more striking in that Trump was an inveterate critic of President Obama’s travel and vacation expenses for years: The Obama’s Spain vacation cost taxpayers over $476K 6kIpd5x They love to spend money. I would rarely leave the White House because there’s so much work to be done, Trump told The Hill in 2015. I would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off. While campaigning for the presidency in 2016, Trump said to the American people: I’m going to be working for you. I’m not going to have time to go play golf. In point of fact, according to a report in USA Today, Trump only spent five of his first 26 weekends as president holed up exclusively in the White House. The rest entailed trips to his nearby golf clubs. Although it’s too soon as of October 2017, just nine months into his presidency, to render even a semi-complete portrait of the Trump family’s travel expenses (such details are rarely released except in response to Freedom of Information Act inquiries, and sometimes not even then), preliminary indications are that Trump’s past criticisms of Obama will come back to haunt him. The Obamas’ travel expenses therefore averaged about $1.1 million per month over the course of his term. Turning to Trump, the alleged $147 million already spent on travel by the president and his family during his first nine months in office wildly exceeds anything supported by actual data. That having been said, it does appear, based on the information available, that Trump and family have indeed likely outstripped the Obamas in terms of monthly travel costs, albeit by a smaller margin than claimed. Judicial Watch, who have vowed to monitor Trump’s travel expenses as closely as they did Obama’s (FOIA requests are already on file), reported in July 2017 that two months into Trump’s presidency taxpayers were already on the hook for $3.58 million in charges for air travel alone (i.e., excluding auxiliary costs such as Secret Service housing, local transporation, police protection, etc.) by the president, first lady, and vice president during February and March. That’s roughly $1.8 million per month, $700,0 more than the Obamas’ monthly average, which included the auxiliary costs we don’t yet have for Trump. Focusing just on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago trips, of which there were seven between Inauguration Day and mid-August 2017, an attempt at a more comprehensive estimate by the progressive watchdog group Center for American Progress Action Fund settled on a cost of roughly $3 million per trip — a total of $21 million for all of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago stays through August, amounting to $2.6 million per month). The reliability of that estimate has been rightly called into question, given that it was generalized from a Government Accountability Office report written well before Trump took office, but it is indicative of how high the Trump family’s travel costs — when they are updated to include actual Secret Service expenses and incidentals might well go. For that matter, obligatory Secret Service protection extends to all of Trump’s children, including his two adult sons, whose security costs while traveling are borne by American taxpayers even though they don’t work for the administration, instead running their father’s international business holdings. According to CBS News, lodging and transportation costs for federal agents protecting Eric and Donald Trump Jr. on their travels had already surpassed $190,0 by the end of President Trump’s third month in office. Also indicative is a USA Today report that in addition to his Mar-a-Lago residencies, as of 21 August Trump had racked up five visits to his private golf club in New Jersey. At these two locations, the Secret Service spent $60,0 on rent for the golf carts needed to protect the president. If that pattern continues, American taxpayers can expect to be dinged for as much as $103,0 per year in golf cart rentals alone.

Damon New York Times Donald Trump has virtually stopped trying to win this election by any conventional metric and is instead stacking logs of grievance on the funeral pyre with the great anticipation of setting it ablaze if current polls turn out to be predictive. As his path to victory grows narrower, his desperation grows more pronounced. Last week a steady stream of women stepped forward to accuse Trump of some form of sexual assault, abuse or inappropriate behavior. Trump’s response has been marked by a stunning lack of grace and dignity, let alone contrition or empathy, a response much like the man himself. On Thursday, Trump said of the People magazine reporter who accused him of forcibly kissing her: Look at her. He said on Friday of the woman accusing him of groping her on an airplane: Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you. He also said of Clinton, When she walked in front of me, believe me, I wasn’t impressed. His response to these charges has been surprisingly — and perhaps, revealingly — callow. He has mocked, whined, chided, bemoaned and belittled. Furthermore, everything is rigged against him, from the media to the election itself. He’s threatening to sue The New York Times. He says he and Clinton should take a drug test before the next debate. Trump is back to carelessly shooting off his mouth and recklessly shooting himself in the foot. It is sad, really, but for him I have no sympathy. He has spent this entire election attacking anyone and everyone whom he felt it would be politically advantageous to attack. He is a ball of contradictions that together form a bully, a man who has built a menacing wall around the hollow of his self. But in a way, Trump was authentically made in America. America has a habit of romanticizing the playboy as much as the cowboy, but there is often something untoward about the playboy, unseemly, predatory and broken. For years, Trump built a reputation on shuffling through women, treating his exploits with jocularity and having too much of America smiling in amusement at the bad boy antics. He seems genuinely offended that he should be held to the same standards of truth, decorum and even law as those less well off. He is the logical extension of rampant racism. He is the logical extension of wealth worship. With him you get a man who believes himself superior in every way: through the gift of fortune and the happenstance of chromosomes. He believes the rules simply don’t apply. And the Republican Party was just the right place for him to park himself. When you have a political party that takes as its mission to prevent government from working instead of to make government work, a party that conflates the ill effects of a changing economy with the changing complexion of the country and is still struck by fever over the election of President Obama, Trump is a natural, predictable endpoint. Furthermore, Trump is what happens when you wear your Christian conservative values like a cardigan to conveniently slip off when the heat rises. Trump is fundamentally altering American politics — coarsening them, corrupting them, cratering them. And America, particularly conservative America, has only itself to blame. Republicans sowed intolerance and in its shadow, Trump sprang up like toxic fungi.
Only 9% of America Chose Trumpand Clinton as the Nominees By ALICIA PARLAPIANO and ADAM PEARCE While Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton will represent the entire country, the Americans who selected them are a small part of it. The United States is home to 324 million people. Each square here represents 1 million people. 103 million of them are children, noncitizens or ineligible felons, and they do not have the right to vote. Estimates for ineligible felons are from 2010. 88 million eligible adults do not vote at all, even in general elections. Based on the share of eligible adults who voted in the 2012 general election. An additional 73 million did not vote in the primaries this year, but will most likely vote in the general election. Does not include people who voted in caucuses, which have less reliable turnout numbers. A small percentage of people vote in primaries but not in general elections, and they are also not included. The remaining 60 million people voted in the primaries: about 30 million each for Republicans and Democrats. But half of the primary voters chose other candidates. Just 14 percent of eligible adults — 9 percent of the whole nation — voted for either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton. The overall shares were about the same in 2008, the last cycle without an incumbent president running. Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton will be working to win the votes of these three groups. Polls suggest they will be separated by just a handful of squares.
Web hosting company GoDaddy on Monday tweeted that it has given the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, 24 hours to find another internet service provider. A GoDaddy spokesman told the New York Daily News that the Daily Stormer violated its terms of service by posting a blog deriding a woman killed in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday. Heather Heyer, 32, died when a man drove his car into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally there Saturday. Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin on Sunday posted an article characterizing Heyer as fat and childless. Given this latest article comes on the immediate heels of a violent attack, we believe this type of article could incite additional violence, which violates our terms of service, GoDaddy spokesman Dan Race said in an email to the Daily News. Some Twitter users on Monday praised GoDaddy for taking a stand against the Daily Stormer following Anglin’s controversial blog. Other people on the social media platform criticized GoDaddy for hosting the Daily Stormer for as long as it did before Monday’s announcement. GoDaddy’s decision will reportedly force the Daily Stormer’s operators to transfer dailystormer.com to another internet provider. The hacking collective Anonymous also took credit Monday for targeting the Daily Stormer following Anglin’s blog. This site is now under the control of Anonymous, a post on the Daily Stormer’s front page said. For too long the Daily Stormer and Andrew Anglin have spewed their putrid hate on this site, it added. The post did not mention GoDaddy’s message to the Daily Stormer, and the article about Heyer was not taken down. The so-called Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville last Saturday turned violent when white nationalists and anti-fascist demonstrators broke into violence. James Alex Fields Jr., 20, ultimately drove a car into counter-protesters there, killing Heyer and injuring more than a dozen others. Two Virginia State Police officers additionally died Saturday following a helicopter crash authorities linked to the Charlottesville rally.
TIL: Police departments will literally do anything to get us to stop killing each other on the road, even succumbing to meme culture… — Big Uzi Vert (@BlvckGrip) August 21, 2017 The NSW Police Force is Australia’s oldest and largest police organization, and serves a population of seven million citizens in New South Wales. Also, they’re apparently into browsing Reddit, because they just used the Man Looking at Woman meme to promote safer driving… app-facebook about a year ago 11K 1.7K 718 Keep your eyes on the road #yourhappinessisrighthere This isn’t the first time a police department has tried to promote public safety via hip means, and it surely won’t be the last. But are memes an effective way to get people to stop texting and driving? Probably not, because until they finally start using that tax money to hire legitimate graphic designers who up their font game, we’re going to continue to refuse to care about our safety on the road. What do you think of the NSW Police Force using the Man Looking at Woman meme to promote road safety? Do you think this is a good way to get people to be more conscious of their driving habits?
The rapidly-evolving story concerning the FBI’s renewed interest in Hillary Clinton’s email sever has a number of players. Here are some people involved in the latest political drama. ANTHONY WEINER Once a rising star in the Democratic Party, Weiner was an outspoken and telegenic congressman from the outer boroughs of New York City. He launched a comeback bid for Mayor of New York City in 2013, and was briefly the frontrunner until it was revealed that he was still sending explicit photos to people other than his wife, sometimes under the pseudonym Carlos Danger. Abedin announced that she was separating from Weiner in August, but the investigation eventually led to the discovery of a laptop containing thousands of emails potentially relating to the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server. JAMES COMEY Appointed FBI director in September 2013 by President Obama, Comey has a long and distinguished record in law enforcement, including a stint as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2002 to 2003. FBI Director James Comey makes a statement at FBI Headquarters in Washington, Tuesday, July 5, 2016. ANDREW MCCABE McCabe joined the FBI in 1996, serving out of the New York field office and focusing on organized crime. His wife, Jill McCabe, was an unsuccessful Democratic Virginia state senate candidate in 2015, and received nearly $500,0 in campaign funds from Gov. Terry McAuliffe political action committee. JASON CHAFFETZ The GOP chairman of the House Oversight Committee has been closely tracking the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of private email servers as secretary of state. Comey had sent him and other Republican committee chairmen on Capitol Hill a vague letter about the discovery. Chaffetz said that the case had been reopened. Cameron - RTS29RH Before the development, Chaffetz told The Washington Post last week that he planned to spend years investigating Clinton. JILL MCCABE Despite never running for office before, McCabe launched a campaign last year to run for a state Senate seat in Virginia. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a former top aide to the Clintons, reportedly recruited McCabe for the seat in an effort to tip the balance of the state Senate. Chaffetz asked Andrew McCabe last week to provide documents about his wife’s Senate campaign amid questions about a possible conflict of interest. Abedin was said to be surprised by the emails on the computer, and during her interview with the FBI, she said she had given up all relevant electronic devices used for emails relating to her work for Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state. Abedin was deputy chief of staff for Clinton but served in the capacity of a consultant, rather than as State Department staff. During this time, she also consulted for Teneo, a strategic consulting firm founded by a former Bill Clinton aide, Doug Band, and for the Clinton Foundation. She was born in Michigan to Saudi intellectuals and was subsequently raised in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. She returned to the U.S. for college and became an intern for Clinton in 1996, who was first lady at the time. She has served as traveling chief of staff and senior adviser to Clinton, as well. According to The Wall Street Journal, McCabe oversaw the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. At the same time, the Virginia Democratic Party contributed another $207,778 in the form of mailers to McCabe. The Virginia governor responded to insinuations by Republicans that his PAC’s donation to McCabe was an attempt to influence the FBI. I think we’re in silly season, he told WTVR last week. The only time he met her husband, Andrew McCabe, was on Mar. 7, he said: It was about Jill, highly qualified, she’s a medical doctor, and she’s a community leader. FILE - In this Jan. 13, 2016 file photo, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe gestures as he delivers his State of the Commonwealth Address before a joint session of the 2016 Virginia Assembly at the Capitol in Richmond, Va. The FBI is also investigating the propriety of some donations to McAuliffe’s own 2013 gubernatorial campaign, including one by Chinese businessman, Wang Wenliang, CNN reported. McAuliffe’s friendship with both Clintons goes back to Bill Clinton’s presidency -- he was one of Clinton’s top fundraisers and later went on to chair the DNC. And the Clintons were big supporters of both his gubernatorial bids.
Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel stepped right into it on Thursday evening. While Kimmel has spent a lot of the week calling out President Donald Trump and the NRA, this time he decided to take his attacks to a whole new level. Instead of going after the president or an organization, he attacked millions of Americans who dont support gun control. Kimmel tweeted: Dear crazies: it is fascinating that 500 innocent people get shot and your anger is directed at me. Think about that Kimmel calling gun owners crazies backfired on the celebrity big time: Its fascinating that Stephen Paddock shot over 500 people and you are blaming guns and politicians. Stopped that when u became not funny, &amp; think your celeb status can use it for Your political agenda. Im a longtime fan jimmy, sometimes it seems like you are talking down to us and or lecturing. Oh sweetie, it might be a good idea to do some research prior to assigning blame to the wrong people. A DISNEY SHAREHOLDER WHO IS ABOUT TO START COMPLAINING ABOUT YOU. Politics is NOT your forte So only you have compassion. But 100 million who support their rights are crazies. Its crazy to hop on your platform to cudgel &amp; shame innocent people for an act by a madman, then call them crazy when they get mad at you. Kimmel hasnt issued an apology for his statement. But it appears that fans would appreciate it he stayed out politics and stuck to comedy. Their fiery response to his remark really says it all.
Its hard to stay away from strong opinions surrounding the election, even from those not allowed to vote. Apparently, even from kids not big enough to ride Splash Mountain. Jimmy Kimmel, megaphone for children everywhere, took to the streets to ask some kids about their feelings on President-elect Trump. One kid thinks hes going to be "HUUUUUGE!" One Canadian kid is less than thrilled about a potential mass exodus to his home country, but will welcome Snoop Dogg with open arms. At least he didnt steal their Halloween candy!
Donald Trumps campaign manager Kellyanne Conway reacted to Trumps debate performance and the fact he held a press availability with four women who have accused the Clintons of misconduct. " These women want to be heard," Conway said of Kathleen Willey, Kathy Shelton, Juanita Broaddrick and Paula Corbin Jones. " Im really proud of Donald Trump for raising it in exactly the right way," she told Megyn Kelly on The Kelly File, " How does Hillary Clinton treat these women after the fact?" Conway was referring to Clintons statement that alleged victims of sexual assault "deserve to be heard". " Or, are we excluding those who have had contact with her husband?" Juanita Broaddrick in the pre-debate press availability said Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton attacked me. be some Joan of Arc for women.she totally ignored all four of the women tonight." Clinton, then Hillary Rodham, represented the accused rapist of then-12-year old Shelton, and reportedly laughed about the case after the suspect was vindicated. Willey and Jones have accused Bill Clinton of assault and have insinuated that Hillary Clinton enabled him and attacked them. Regarding Trumps vulgar recorded discussion with Billy Bush, Conway said it was "disgusting [and] offensive, and Im not going to excuse what he said."

Commentary It’s suddenly big news that there are perverts in Hollywood. The really big news is that former President Barack Hussein Obama’s communist and terrorist-support network remains a state secret. Attorney General Jeff Sessions won’t touch it. He ran for office as a committed Christian, a monumental deception to conceal his record of service to the communist cause, Muslim background, and grooming by suspected Soviet espionage agent Frank Marshall Davis. A WND story says former Trump White House aide Sebastian Gorka believes radical Islamic jihadists, China and radical leftists pose the greatest threats to U.S. national security, but that they will be defeated by President Trump and his supporters who are restoring America’s global dominance and reclaiming the country’s culture. Gorka tells WND, The immediate term threat is the Shia-jihadis – this is Iran, this is the Republican Guard, Hezbollah. In the first place, Obama should have been impeached. All of this benefited the Muslim Brotherhood. PSD-11, which is still secret, should be released by the Trump Administration and declared exhibit number one in a criminal investigation of Barack Hussein Obama. Trump was supposed to turn things around. In Afghanistan, Gorka tells WND that Trump’s speech sending more American soldiers to their deaths in an endless conflict didn’t use the words radical Islamic terrorism. If you want to defeat radical Islam, engineer regime change in Russia, which is still the global center of revolutionary violence against America. Domestically, Sebastian Gorka mentions in the WND interview the influence of Obama associates Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn in academia, but ignores how their communist terrorist networks spawned the Obama candidacy and presidency. But he stands out during his eight years in office as the real Russian agent, who was passive when Russia invaded Ukraine and Syria, gave Russia a nuclear weapons advantage over the U.S., and awarded the Russians special trading privileges. Working with Russia, he conceived the Iran nuclear deal. China may be our long term enemy, but they don’t a war in their back doorstep either. The U.N. is another communist front, designed by a Russian agent working in our State Department by the name of Alger Hiss. Working through the U.N. is a dangerous dead end. Our book The Sword of Revolution conclusively demonstrates that the Sino-Soviet split was a fraud. Drifting away from or betraying Marxism will lead to the Party’s losing its soul and direction as it moves forward, Xi added. Marxism is unsurpassed in achieving great heights and having a huge influence, he said. The reliance on China to deal with its nuclear client, North Korea, is another dead end. The key failure involves the inability or unwillingness to investigate Obama’s global network and what his anti-American policies were designed to do. Filmmaker Joel Gilbert, a speaker at our upcoming November 10 National conference on Obamunism, has cited evidence that Obama was a member or supporter of the May 19th Communist Organization, an above ground support group for the Weather Underground based in New York City from 1978-1985. Some May 19 members committed acts of violence and terrorism, such as the 1981 Nanuet Brinks robbery and murders, the bombing of South African offices in 1981, and the U.S. Capital bombing in 1983, notes Gilbert. Here’s the big revelation: A former May 19 member I spoke with identified Obama as participating in their public protests and meetings. This might help explain why Borup and Duke are still on the loose. And why Obama never demanded the extradition of Black Liberation Army cop-killer Assata Shakur and FALN bomb-maker William Morales from Cuba. This pope is not Catholic; he’s a communist. * Cliff can be reached at Kincaid@comcast.net View View View

FILE PICTURE: Acting National Police Commissioner Lesetja Mothiba. Picture: Alaister Russell It is alleged Mokushane has a criminal record and runs his own business from work. Acting head of crime intelligence Major-General Pat Mokushane has been axed from his position. This comes after reports that he has a criminal record and that he is being investigated for running his business from work. News24 reports that Mokushane’s termination was signed by acting national commissioner Lesetja Mothiba on August 17. This letter serves to inform you that the acting appointment of Major-General PM Mokushane as the Divisional Commissioner: Crime Intelligence has been terminated with immediate effect, the letter reads. Earlier this month, City Press reported that Mokushane has a criminal record and that he had an affair with another officer’s wife. The report stated he was arrested in 1993 for possession of suspected stolen property. News24 further reported the police portfolio committee was told Mokushane had suspended a police officer who revealed that Mothiba was misled about Mokushane’s clearance.
