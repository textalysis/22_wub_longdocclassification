the applicant was born in 1983 and is detained in sztum. at the time of the events in question, the applicant was serving a prison sentence in the barczewo prison. on 8 january 2011 the applicant’s grandmother died. on 10 january 2011 the applicant lodged a request with the director of prison and the penitentiary judge for leave to attend her funeral which was to take place on 12 january 2011. together with his application he submitted a statement from his sister e.k. who confirmed that she would personally collect the applicant from prison and bring him back after the funeral. on 11 january 2011 the penitentiary judge of the olsztyn regional court (sędzia penitencjarny sądu okręgowego w olsztynie) allowed the applicant to attend the funeral under prison officers’ escort. the reasoning of the decision read as follows:
“in view of [the applicant’s] multiple convictions and his long term of imprisonment there is no guarantee that he will return to prison” 9. the applicant refused to attend the funeral, since he believed his appearance under escort of uniformed officers would create a disturbance during the ceremony. on the same day the applicant lodged an appeal with the olsztyn regional court (sąd okręgowy) complaining that the compassionate leave was granted under escort and also that he was only allowed to participate in the funeral (not the preceding church service). on 3 february 2011 the olsztyn regional court upheld the penitentiary judge’s decision and dismissed the appeal. the court stressed that the applicant had been allowed to participate in the funeral under prison officers’ escort. it further noted that the applicant was a habitual offender sentenced to a long term of imprisonment therefore there was no positive criminological prognosis and no guarantee that he would have returned to prison after the ceremony.
the applicant was born in 1982 and is currently detained in cricova. in december 2010 the applicant was arrested in the russian federation and extradited to moldova, where he was placed in detention on 29 december 2010 on the basis of the detention warrant of 14 february 2002. the applicant lodged a habeas corpus request in which he complained, inter alia, that he had not been informed about the detention warrant of 14 february 2002 within seventy-two hours, as provided by law, and that there were no relevant and sufficient reasons to deprive him of his liberty. later the detention warrant was renewed several times on similar grounds and the applicant’s appeals were rejected. the last decision in the proceedings concerning his remand in custody dates from 27 may 2011 and it was issued by the buiucani district court. by that decision the applicant’s detention on remand was prolonged until 29 june 2011. during his detention the applicant was jailed in prison no. 13 in chişinău between 29 december 2010 and 22 march 2012 and after 10 january 2013. the inmates were allowed to take showers only once a week and were subjected to passive smoking. after this date no more detention warrants were issued and he continued to be detained on the basis of the above sentence. the court was not informed about subsequent developments in the criminal proceedings against the applicant. undoubtedly, progress has been achieved in improving conditions of detention. however, some of the institutions visited by the special rapporteur were heavily overcrowded. the authorities themselves pointed out that institution no. 13 in chişinău was severely overcrowded - on the day of the visit it held 931 persons with the official capacity being 600 (see also appendix). the special rapporteur was informed of government plans to close down this institution. common problems at all pre- and post-trial prisons are the poor hygienic conditions, restricted access to health care and lack of medication as well as risk of contamination with tuberculosis and other diseases. whereas the special rapporteur notes that the minimum norms regarding nutrition of detainees (government decision n. 609 of 29 may 2006) are checked on a daily basis and that, according to the financial plan of the penitentiary department, the food budget for 2008 had almost doubled in comparison to 2004 and is set to rise further, he also received consistent allegations regarding the poor quality and quantity of food. ...” in its report for 2010 (page 142 et seq. “ the same situation was confirmed during a visit to chişinău prison no. in some cells the living space was not proportionate to the number of detainees. during the visit, eight detainees were being held in cell no. 7) over twenty detainees were being held in a cell measuring 65 square metres. in this connection, the minister of justice provided information to the ombudsman about the expenditure on prisoners’ food in 2010. this statistic was often cited by prison authorities to justify why they were unable to provide detainees with meat and fish. the prisons do not conform to current national and international standards; however, the budget constraints upon the state do not allow for their reconstruction or renovation. in the prisons, with the exception of taraclia prison no. 1, detainees are held in large-capacity cells insufficiently equipped for their daily needs, namely areas for sleeping, for everyday living and for sanitary equipment. detainees are held in extremely overcrowded, dark, damp and unventilated spaces full of cigarette smoke. in certain prisons the bunk beds essentially prevent daylight from reaching the living space.”
the applicant was born in 1955 and lives in naro-fominsk in the moscow region. at 8.20 p.m. on 6 march 2004 ms e. was robbed in the street and was stabbed through the heart. she died of the wound shortly afterwards. having obtained from the mobile phone operator the call logs in respect of the victim’s phone, the investigators established that at 9.50 pm on 6 march 2004 a phone call had been made to a number belonging to ms a. from e.’s phone using the applicant’s sim card. then the officers questioning him showed him a call log from ms e.’s phone, informed him of the killing and suggested that he confess to mitigate his sentence. the applicant refused to admit to the crime. the officers proceeded to hit and kick him on his head, chest and flanks. the applicant was not provided with legal assistance on 18 march 2004. no physical force was applied to the applicant. between 12.40 a.m and 2.55 a.m on 19 march 2004 the applicant was questioned without a lawyer present. in the early morning on 19 march 2004 the applicant was placed in a temporary detention centre (изолятор временного содержания, hereinafter “ivs”). according to the government, in the course of the interview he described how he had committed the crime. on 20 or 22 march 2004[1] the investigators carried out an investigative re-enactment. he also selected a knife similar to that used to stab ms e. from a selection of four knives available at a local shop. on 20 march 2004 a judge of the naro-fominsk town court (“the town court”) placed the applicant in custody. on 26 march 2004 the police transported the applicant to a remand prison. however, the staff on duty refused to admit the applicant as he had visible injuries. according to the government, the applicant raised the ill-treatment complaint on 17 june 2004. he observed that upon arrival at the ivs the applicant had had a bruise under his right eye and yet had made no complaints about his state of health, and noted that, according to the ivs logbook, an ambulance had been called for the applicant on account of an epileptic fit. the applicant complained about the town prosecutor’s office’s refusal of 18 june 2004 to the russian prosecutor general’s office, which forwarded it for examination by the prosecutor’s office of the moscow region. on 27 july 2004 the regional court scheduled a trial hearing on 9 august 2004. the applicant raised the matter of ill-treatment before the regional court at his trial. it can be seen from the trial record of that date that n. informed the judge that he was not an expert in interpreting x‑rays and asked for a period of two weeks to consult a colleague; the judge acceded to the request. on 4 november 2004 n. drew up a report stating that the rib fractures had been caused by blunt objects; by 30 march 2004 the knitting together of the fractures had commenced; the fractures had been “considerably old” and “no injuries corresponding to [those of] 11 and 18 march 2004 [had been] identified”. the judge rejected the applicant’s request for another expert report. the regional court dismissed the record of the first interview of 19 march 2004 as inadmissible evidence for the reason that the interview had been conducted without a lawyer present. the judge also heard evidence from an expert, n., as well as investigator mr a. and several police officers. he asked for the first‑instance judgment to be quashed on the grounds given in his appeal of 6 december 2004. the applicant further unsuccessfully sought supervisory review of his conviction. he also pointed out that the regional court had “carefully examined” the applicant’s version of ill-treatment by police officers.
the applicants were born in 1983 and 2007 respectively and live in gevgelija, in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia. on 11 february 2007 she gave birth to their daughter, the second applicant. on 31 may 2007, on an application by the father, the gevgelija social welfare centre (“the centre”) made an order specifying that he could see the second applicant at the first applicant’s house every friday for two hours. the order was made after the centre had examined the situation in both families and had discussed the matter with the parents. тhe order was served on the first applicant on 2 june 2007. the first applicant was also ordered to allow the father to see the child within 30 days after the judgment would become final. in case of non-compliance, the court specified that the suspension would be revoked and the sentence would be enforced. both judgments (k.br.133/07 and k.br.229/07) were delivered after the court had heard oral evidence from the first applicant, the father and a representative of the centre. of the gevgelija court of first instance. in the meantime, on 21 november 2007, the centre set a new venue and time for the meetings between the father and the second applicant. after actions have been taken and facts have been established ... on a meeting held on 12 november 2007 the expert team found that no communication could yet be established with [the first applicant] and the parents could not agree on [the second applicant’s] right to have regular contacts and meetings with the non-cohabitant parent. such an attitude infringes the right of the minor s. therefore, given [the second applicant’s] age, the need for an emotional bond to be created between the minor child and the non-cohabitant parent, the need to protect her rights, as well (the need) to eliminate any possibility for manipulation that would prevent the expert team to supervise the enforcement of the contact arrangements between the minor child and the father, (the centre) decided the father’s visiting rights in respect of the minor s.s...”. on two occasions in january and march 2008, the father did not see his daughter because she was ill. as the first applicant failed to comply in full with the order of 29 april 2008, on 28 may 2008 the centre allowed the order of 29 april 2008 to be enforced by means of a separate order issued under section 14 of the family act (see paragraph 46 below). the first applicant confirmed that she had received the enforcement order of 28 may 2008. she further applied for the removal of judge i.s., the first applicant decided not to testify at the hearing held on 10 july 2008. she confirmed that the first applicant had been served with all the relevant orders the centre had made. in a judgment of the same date the first-instance court, presided over by judge i.s., found the first applicant guilty and sentenced her to three months in prison. on 3 december 2008 the skopje court of appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the lower court’s judgment. lastly, it endorsed the reasons of the first-instance court regarding her custodial sentence. the order did not provide for any contact rights for the first applicant in respect of the second applicant. however, it appears that she did not receive the invitation and, accordingly, failed to appear. on 4 january 2010 the first applicant again requested that the centre specify her contact rights. on an application lodged by the first applicant, on 5 march 2010, the order of 10 february 2010 was replaced by a new order by the centre, dated 17 march 2010, according to which the first applicant was allowed to stay with the second applicant every second weekend in the month, from friday (3 p.m.) to monday (9 a.m.). on the basis of all the available information, the centre’s welfare officers suggested that it would be in the child’s best interests for the father to be given custody. his past behaviour has shown that he is a constructive and cooperative parent whose main concern is the interests of the minor, s.
this court further considers that the reason why the lower courts dismissed the appellant’s claim to have custody of [the second applicant], namely that she was three years and eight months old and that at that age she needed to stay with the mother, with whom she was biologically connected, cannot be regarded as the only relevant legal ground (единствено правно решавачка причина). on 13 march 2014 that judgment was set aside. while the custody proceedings were pending, on 10 june 2013 the father applied to the centre to change the living arrangements to allow him to live permanently with the second applicant.

the applicant was born in 1927 and lives in zagreb. on 24 may 1961 the applicant’s husband was granted a specially protected tenancy in respect of a flat in zagreb by the yugoslav people’s army (the “ypa”). the applicant, as his spouse, was also a holder of a specially protected tenancy of that flat. on 3 june 1991 parliament enacted the protected tenancies (sale to occupier) act (zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo – hereinafter “the sale to occupier act”), which regulated the sale of socially-owned flats previously let under a specially protected tenancy (see paragraph 19 below). however, state-owned flats were excluded. on 3 october 1991 the government adopted a decree (uredba o preuzimanju sredstava jna i ssno na teritoriju republike hrvatske u vlasništvo republike hrvatske) whereby it took all the ypa’s property in croatia into state ownership. in 1995 the act amending the sale to occupier act (zakon o izmjenama i dopunama zakona o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo – hereinafter “the aptso”) allowed the sale of state-owned flats as well (see paragraph 22 below). the time-limit for lodging a request to purchase such a flat was set at sixty days. on 29 january 1997 the constitutional court abrogated some of the provisions of the aptso, including the one stipulating the time-limit for lodging a purchase request (see paragraph 23 below) 11. the applicant’s husband died on 15 april 2006. on 7 june 2006 the applicant lodged with the ministry of defence a request to purchase the flat she was occupying. the request was denied on the ground that it had been lodged outside the prescribed time-limit, which had expired on 31 december 1995. on 19 march 2008 the applicant brought a civil action in the zagreb municipal court seeking a judgment in lieu of a sale contract. she relied on several decisions of the constitutional court ruling that there was no time-limit in respect of a holder of a specially protected tenancy lodging a request to purchase the respective state-owned flat (see paragraphs 24-26 below). in its judgment of 24 june 2008 the zagreb municipal court held that there was no dispute between the parties that the applicant, as a former holder of a specially protected tenancy of the flat that she occupied, had the right to purchase that flat under favourable conditions. the only issue to be resolved was whether there was a time-limit that the applicant had to observe when lodging her request to purchase that flat – and if so, whether she had complied with it. the municipal court dismissed the applicant’s claim on the ground that the applicant had lodged her purchase request outside the accepted time-limit, which had been 31 december 1995. the applicant lodged an appeal, arguing that the time-limit under the aptso for lodging a request to purchase a state-owned flat had been abrogated by the constitutional court and that no new time-limit had been fixed. the fact that there was no prescribed time-limit in place should not have been interpreted to the detriment of a plaintiff. she also relied on the opinion of the constitutional court that the very purpose of the sale to occupier act was to enable holders of specially protected tenancies in respect of socially and state-owned flats to purchase such flats (see paragraph 22 below). the first-instance judgment was upheld by the zagreb county court on 12 october 2010. the relevant part of the second-instance judgment reads:
“as regards the decisions of the constitutional court relied on in the [plaintiff’s] action, it is to be noted that these decisions exceptionally recognised the right of certain parties to purchase flats [they occupied] in particular circumstances (such as their having had no clearly regulated status of holder of a specially protected tenancy before that date – for example in decision no. u-3551/02 of 25 may 2005) ... even though a request to purchase a flat had not been lodged before 31 december 1995. in such particular cases the constitutional court has adopted decisions based on particular circumstances. the constitutional court in all decisions recognising the right to purchase flats [they occupied] of persons who had not lodged a request in that respect before 31 december 1995 has accepted that there were objective circumstances preventing those persons from taking all relevant steps within the prescribed time-limits. in the case at issue the plaintiff did not even argue [that there were any] such circumstances, but insisted that she could bring an action for the purchase of the flat [that she occupies] at any time and that there were no time-limits in that respect. the view of this court is that the holders of specially protected tenancies of state-owned flats were obliged to lodge a request for purchasing these flats before 31 december 1995 (with the exception that in certain circumstances it was possible to claim that a party was prevented from lodging such a request within that time-limit on objective grounds).” the applicant’s subsequent constitutional complaint was dismissed on 20 february 2013. the relevant part of that decision reads:
“the constitutional court notes that the competent courts dismissed the applicant’s civil action on the grounds that she had not proved that any objective circumstances had prevented her from lodging a request to purchase the flat in issue within the prescribed time-limit. the constitutional court considers that the impugned decisions contain reasons acceptable from the standpoint of the constitutional law and that therefore they cannot be seen as arbitrary or unreasonable.”
the first applicant organisation is the vienna chamber of medical doctors (ärztekammer für wien). the chamber represents all medical practitioners in vienna and also has its own website. on 18 january 2007 the second applicant published a letter on the first applicant organisation’s website, which was addressed to all members of the chamber in vienna and was also sent out to all of them via e-mail. the letter was titled “locust funds want to take over medical practices” (“heuschreckenfonds wollen ordinationen übernehmen”). if they would not act according to the companies’ wishes, they would be dismissed. the second applicant then explained the assumed legal and organisational basis of such a plan: radiology services which were currently being provided by medical practices could, in future, also be offered by limited companies. giving an example of a risky development, the second applicant stated that in the last 20 years, colleagues had founded laboratories which had reciprocal agreements with certain health insurance boards. today, almost all of those laboratories were owned by the f. group, which, in turn, was owned by insurance companies, investment funds and foundations, and which employed a large number of doctors. on 24 january 2007 the f. company lodged an action against the two applicants and an application for an injunction with the vienna commercial court (handelsgericht wien). the applicants contested the application. the injunction prevented the applicants from referring to the f. company as a “locust”, “locust company” or “locust fund”. the applicants appealed against the injunction. on 30 october 2007 the vienna court of appeal (oberlandesgericht wien) partly granted the appeal, and prohibited the applicants from alleging that the f. company was ruthless towards third parties and medical practitioners, and from calling it, inter alia, a “locust company”. the court of appeal found that the first applicant organisation had locus standi in the injunction proceedings. according to the court of appeal, the letter in issue pursued the interests of the chamber’s members, outside the chamber’s official sphere of activity. the court of appeal found that austrian law provided wide‑ranging protection for commercial and economic interests. those who published an opinion in an economically competitive context were obliged to exercise a higher level of diligence with regard to the facts and bases of their allegations than those who acted in the non-competitive context of a public debate of general interest. it also did not fall under section 7 of the unfair competition act. the applicants lodged an extraordinary appeal with the supreme court (oberster gerichtshof). on 22 january 2008 the supreme court dismissed the extraordinary appeal. it acknowledged the applicants’ argument that where a competitor, even for economic purposes, took part in a debate of public interest, freedom of expression had to hold more weight in the balancing test. on 7 july 2008 the commercial court gave its judgment in the substantive proceedings and ordered the applicants to refrain from: repeating the statement that the f. company was ruthless towards third parties, in particular medical practitioners and patients; and stating that the f. company was a “locust company”, a “locust fund” or a “locust”. it further ordered the applicants to publish and display the operative part of the judgment on the first applicant organisation’s website for thirty days, and to publish it in the first applicant organisation’s print newsletter. examining the statements in relation to the provisions of the unfair competition act, the commercial court found that the letter had been written by the chamber of medical doctors in a commercial and not a political context. with reference to the court’s case-law allowing for a wider margin of appreciation under article 10 of the convention with regard to commercial language, the commercial court observed that a competitor was required to be more diligent in the context of commercial communication among competitors. on 19 september 2008 the applicants lodged an appeal against that judgment. on 12 december 2008 the vienna court of appeal dismissed the appeal as unfounded. it referred to the extensive reasoning given in the interim injunction proceedings and added that, according to the case-law of the supreme court, the test used to verify whether a statement was covered by the right to freedom of expression required the assessment of whether a factual basis for such a statement existed; if a competitor participated in a public debate of general interest, freedom of expression had more weight with regard to the assessment of the statement than in the context of purely commercial communication. the applicants lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law against that judgment, which was rejected by the supreme court on 14 july 2009. furthermore, the issuing of warnings concerning the potential risks of the provision of medical services by companies was not, as such, prohibited by the decisions of the austrian courts; the applicants had only been required to refrain from making untrue statements of fact in respect of their competitors.
the applicant was born in 1989 and is currently in detention in lublin. on an unspecified date before october 2011 the applicant was convicted of assault and of endangering lives through arson and extortion. on 14 october 2011, the lublin remand centre penitentiary commission (“the commission”) imposed a special regime for detainees deemed to be dangerous (“the dangerous detainee regime”) on the applicant. the commission referred to the fact that the applicant had organised a collective protest in opole lubelskie prison, namely, a hunger strike by prisoners, and that he had planned an attack on a prison employee. it also found that the applicant had received disciplinary punishments on many occasions, in particular for the attempted smuggling of psychoactive substances into prison. the applicant did not appeal against the decision to impose the regime on him. the decision was reviewed and upheld by the commission every three months. on 12 january 2012 the commission again reviewed the situation and upheld its decision, considering that the applicant posed a serious danger to the security of the prison. the applicant did not appeal against that decision. on 11 april 2012 the commission reviewed and upheld its decision, relying on the same grounds as previously. on 16 may 2012 the commission examined the applicant’s appeal and upheld its earlier decision. it referred to the applicant’s conduct, finding that he had often behaved aggressively. it also referred to the applicant’s highly deficient moral character (wysoki stopień demoralizacji), and the fact that he had been the leader of a collective protest in opole lubelskie prison (the prisoners’ hunger strike) and had planned an attack on a prison employee. the applicant lodged a court appeal against the commission’s decision. on 13 june 2012 the lublin regional court dismissed the appeal, holding that the decision had been lawful. on 14 july 2012 the lublin remand centre penitentiary commission lifted the dangerous detainee regime in respect of the applicant. it based its decision on the applicant’s good behaviour and the fact that he no longer posed a danger to the prison. the applicant’s cell, including its sanitary facilities, was constantly monitored via closed-circuit television. the window was covered with a plastic blind. the applicant was subjected to a body search every time he left and entered the cell, which in practice meant that he had to strip naked in front of prison officers and was required to bend over to allow his anus to be examined. whenever he was outside his cell, including at court hearings, the applicant had to wear joined shackles (kajdanki zespolone) on his hands and feet. the shackles consisted of handcuffs and fetters joined together with chains.
the applicant was born in 1933 and lives in karabulak, ingushetia. the armed men pursued him and continued shooting. mr apti dalakov was hit by a car and fell to the ground. the above account of the events is based on the information contained in the application form as well as on written statements by mr i.b.m., during the pursuit he warned mr apti dalakov that he would open fire if the latter did not stop. ... at about 5.20 p.m. police captain [g.g.], the pursuers had been accompanied by a white gazel vehicle with darkened windows and without number plates. the armed men, who were in camouflage uniforms and civilian clothing, who had conducted this special operation, had refused to identify themselves, had not presented any documents, and had warned that they would use firearms against the police officers. the local residents had been aggressively expressing their indignation, as according to them the armed men had killed an unarmed young man; the body was still on the ground. on 15 or 16 october 2007 the investigators questioned an fsb officer, v.l., the witness thought mr apti dalakov was armed and could offer resistance. he checked mr apti dalakov’s pulse and confirmed that he was dead, then the witness and his colleagues called the mine squad and cordoned off the area. and granted them victim status in the criminal case. on 2 november 2007 the investigating department terminated the proceedings in case no. had given similar statements”, without providing any further details in that respect. who had complied with the order of the arresting group ... was not questioned about the circumstances of the incident. however, this information was not examined further ...”
the applicant was informed of the decision on 6 december 2007. in the documents submitted it is also stated that on the same date the same material was forwarded to the military investigations department of military unit no. on 28 february 2008 the military investigations department replied to the investigators that on 30 january 2008 they had refused to initiate criminal investigation into the killing owing to the lack of corpus delicti in the actions of the fsb officer a.k. had got down on the ground, whereas mr apti dalakov had started running away. the karabulak town prosecutor overruled this decision ... i lodged another complaint with the karabulak investigating department in which i requested that a criminal case be opened in order to investigate the killing of mr apti dalakov; witnesses to the incident, in addition to the police officers from the karabulak town police department and the ingushetia omon who had participated in the detention of the fsb officers who had shot mr apti dalakov, be identified and questioned ... and victim status in the criminal case be granted to me. this complaint was delivered on 19 march 2008. the police officers from the karabulak town police department and the ingushetia omon who had arrested the individuals, who shot mr apti dalakov were not questioned. declare unlawful the failure of the investigating authorities to initiate a criminal investigation in respect of my complaint, to identify and question witnesses to the killing ... and grant me victim status in the proceedings; 2. the incoming mail registration stamp on the copy of the document indicates that this complaint was received on 14 august 2008. the judge requested that the documents reflecting the transfer be provided for the next hearing, scheduled for 23 september 2008. in support of his position he stated that the criminal case related to mr a. dalakov’s death had been terminated by the karabulak investigating committee, as the actions of the fsb officers who had carried out the operation in respect of mr a. dalakov had been declared lawful. the court finds the applicant’s and his lawyer’s allegations unsubstantiated, as they are not properly argued and are not supported by appropriate evidence. subsequently, the lawyer repeatedly enquired with the court by telephone and in person about the examination of the complaint. neither the applicant nor his lawyer was provided with a copy of the decision of 23 september 2008.
at the material time all the applicants were detained in russian penal facilities. where relevant, the dates of their detention are listed in annex i. 5. while in detention, the applicants mr yevdokimov, mr rezanov, and mr morozov lodged defamation claims against private third parties; the applicants mr makhov, mr resin, mr anikanov, mr lebetskiy, mr gromovoy, mr gordeyev and mr vinokhodov brought claims seeking compensation for the allegedly inhuman conditions of their detention; and the applicant mr martirosyan lodged a civil claim for compensation, alleging that the criminal proceedings had been instituted unlawfully. none of the applicants were able to attend the hearings at which their claims were examined. the domestic courts refused them the possibility to be present at the hearing, on the ground that there was no domestic legal provision for bringing detainees to courts. in particular, they quoted article 77.1 of the code on the execution of sentences (see paragraph 11 below) and the relevant provisions of the code of civil procedure. in the other cases, the issue of the applicants’ presence in court was not addressed. the applicants appealed, raising the question of their appearance in court in the appeal statement. some submitted a separate request seeking leave to appear before the appeal court. the appeal courts either dismissed the applicants’ arguments or concluded that their absence from the court was in line with the legislation and did not contravene the principle of fairness. the applicants’ claims were refused at two levels of jurisdiction. the dates of the final judgments are set out in annex i.
the applicant was born in 1945 and lives in konstancin jeziorna. the meeting had been recorded by the latter and transcriptions from the recording were later included in the article published by his newspaper. on the same day the public prosecutor questioned the applicant and notified him of the charge against him. the applicant was obliged to present security in the form of a registered charge against his property and his passport was seized. it is nevertheless true that he had been charged with specific offences, that a bill of indictment had been preferred against him, and that the matter is being examined by a parliamentary commission of inquiry. the image of lew rywin had appeared on a number of occasions in the media in connection with this matter. the seriousness of the bribery justified, in the present instance, the use of scathing expressions and very expressive symbols. ... in the meantime, the criminal investigation and the work of the commission were ongoing. the commission sat throughout 2003 and until 5 april 2004, when its last session was convened. the sessions held by the commission between 8 february and 21 november 2003 were devoted to the hearing of witnesses, such as the executives of agora, high-ranking government officials starting with the prime minister, journalists, members of the warsaw public prosecutor’s office and businessmen representing the media. the applicant, who appeared before the commission on 22 february 2003, refused to answer any of its questions. on 6 february 2003 the public prosecutor conducting the investigation authorised the commission to disclose, in the context of the proceedings before it, the material in the criminal investigation file. noting that the commission had been privy to the whole of the investigation case file concerning the applicant, the court pointed out that if the material in the file were used in the proceedings before the commission it would have to be careful not to cause any prejudice to the persons concerned by that investigation, such as the witnesses and the applicant. on 14 april 2004 the court rejected a defence request for the admission of new evidence. on 21 april 2004 the newspaper gazeta wyborcza published an article with the heading “before the judgment” (“przed wyrokiem”), beginning as follows:
“the biggest corruption scandal of the third republic will certainly end in a failure for the justice system – regardless of the charges on which lew rywin is convicted or the sentence handed down. in a judgment of 26 april 2004 warsaw regional court found the applicant guilty of attempted fraud, under article 13 of the criminal code combined with article 286 § 1, article 294 § 1 and article 12 of the same code, and sentenced him to two years and six months’ imprisonment and a fine of 100,000 zlotys (pln). in its reasoning the court found as follows:
(a) that it was established that between 15 and 22 july 2002, the applicant had attempted to incite wanda rapaczyńska, chair of agora’s board of directors, and adam michnik, editor-in-chief of gazeta wyborcza, to dispose of that company’s property with detrimental effect thereto for a value equivalent to usd 17.5 million;
(b) that it had not been established that the applicant had been instructed by the prime minister or any figures in his entourage. at the end of its last session on 5 april 2004, the commission adopted its final report, concluding that the applicant had acted alone. several commission members submitted their own draft reports to the sejm. the report, disseminated by the media, was widely discussed and commented on by the various public stakeholders. on the scheduled date the defence submitted their observations. nevertheless, it endorsed that reasoning to a large extent, noting that the regional court had examined the relevant aspects of the case and that its conclusion was justified. in the view of the court of appeal, the exercise of defence rights could not consist in requests made ad infinitum to elucidate the circumstances of the case, and in particular those that were irrelevant for its resolution. the sejm may set up a commission of inquiry in order to examine a given matter. the relevant provisions of the parliamentary commissions of inquiry act read as follows:
article 8
“1. subject to the approval of the sejm’s president, the commission may authorise another authority to take cognisance of the material gathered ... where it considers that this is the interest of the proceedings conducted by that authority.” the commission may request the principal public prosecutor to carry out certain acts. the defendant shall be presumed innocent until proven guilty in a final judgment. the court shall, in its discretion, rule on questions of fact and of law and shall not be bound by any decisions of another court or body. in a judgment of 14 april 1999 (k 8/99 otk 1999/3/41), the constitutional court found that section 8(1) of the parliamentary commissions of inquiry act was not in breach of the constitution. ...
the applicant was born in 1943 and is currently detained in riedstadt psychiatric hospital. the applicant has previous convictions for rape dating from 1968 and for indecent assault combined with causing bodily harm by dangerous means dating from 1990. it held that the applicant was suffering from a disturbance in his sexual preference taking the form of sadism and found that the commission of further crimes was to be expected. it also observed that the applicant had tried to subjugate several prostitutes whom he had been seeing in recent years. the regional court found that this indicated an evolution in his behaviour. it noted that the applicant had refused psychiatric therapy so far and shared the expert’s opinion that the applicant would not be able to resist his urge to humiliate and abuse women in order to satisfy his sexual drive. however, the expert opinion did not diagnose sexual sadism. on 13 may 2004 the applicant was transferred to the hanau clinic for forensic psychiatry. on 11 december 2006 the hanau clinic for forensic psychiatry delivered a further expert opinion. even assuming that the applicant might have a sadistic sexual disposition, he experienced this without suffering and had no desire to change. according to the verdict of the trial court, the applicant had probably fulfilled his sexual inclinations with prostitutes in order to avoid being charged with an offence. neither the files nor his statements revealed the development of an addiction or of a pressing perverted imagination or of pathologic impulsiveness. there was no call for therapy as the applicant neither suffered from his behaviour nor desired to change it. on 3 september 2007, on 20 august 2008 and on 18 august 2009 similar forensic psychiatric expert opinions were delivered by the hanau clinic for forensic psychiatry. on 30 september 2008 the frankfurt am main court of appeal allowed the re-opening of the criminal proceedings which had been terminated by the judgment of the darmstadt regional court dated 14 january 2002. the expert concluded that the applicant was suffering from sexual sadism, subject to the reservation that he had not examined the applicant in person but had based his evaluation on the medical files only. the applicant’s appeal against this dismissal was dismissed. on 15 march 2011 the haina clinic for forensic psychiatry, where the applicant was detained, delivered an expert opinion on the necessity of the applicant’s further detention in hospital. it made the diagnosis of a dissocial personality disorder, alcohol abuse and a presumptive diagnosis of sexual sadism. although it found a high risk that the applicant would re‑offend, it confirmed the prior assessment that the applicant represented a classic instance of an erroneous hospital treatment order. on 24 may 2011 the darmstadt regional court asked the applicant to inform the court whether he agreed to being examined by the external expert dr. on 29 may 2011 the applicant wrote to the regional court and refused a medical examination. on 26 july 2011 the regional court heard the applicant and his counsel in person as well as a psychological expert from the haina clinic for forensic psychiatry. for this reason alone, therefore, the conditions for application of article 67 d § 6 of the criminal code were not met. lastly, the regional court noted, but explicitly without basing its decision on this fact, that the expert opinion which had been delivered in the course of the re-opening proceedings of the criminal trial had confirmed the diagnosis of sadism. in conclusion, the regional court found that the applicant could not be released on probation as he had refused investigation of his problems relating to sexuality and violence. under these circumstances the court of appeal found that no new conclusions could be expected from such an external expert opinion. on 16 august 2012 the federal constitutional court (file no. on 23 april 2014 the darmstadt regional court decided not to suspend the order for the applicant’s placement in a psychiatric hospital and not to grant probation after obtaining an external expert opinion dated 22 february 2014 and having heard the expert and the applicant’s counsel. the applicant’s appeal in this respect was dismissed by the court of appeal.
the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in st. brought an action against the applicant in the regional court. the action was served on the applicant’s counsel on 18 june 2005. the applicant had assets in liechtenstein, specifically claims for salary and fees against emk and emk engineering, which both had their seat in liechtenstein. following a constitutional complaint of 22 february 2006, on 1 march 2006 the constitutional court granted the applicant’s application to have the court of appeal’s interlocutory decision be given suspensory effect. following the termination of the proceedings before the constitutional court, the regional court resumed the proceedings. it heard evidence from the parties, their counsel and twelve witnesses in person in hearings on 31 may, 28 june and 6 september 2007. on 22 april 2009 the applicant asked the regional court to deliver its judgment, given that the oral proceedings had concluded on 6 september 2007. it ordered the applicant to hand over a specified number of bearer shares in emk and in emk engineering to f.h. and declared that the applicant did not hold and had never held shares in those companies. had never obtained ownership of the shares in question as there had not been a sales contract between her and f.h. was no longer holding shares in the companies. transferring the shares to him as a gift in 2003 at the latest. relying, inter alia, on articles 6, 13 and 14 of the convention and on article 1 of protocol no. 1 to the convention, the applicant complained, in particular, about the length of the proceedings. the applicant would have only had to bear the decision fee if his constitutional complaint had been dismissed. on 20 april 2012 the president of the constitutional court, b., informed the applicant that he, alongside judges bu., as regards the court’s president, judge b., the applicant complained that he had delayed the appointment of the judges who were to decide on his complaint. was biased because he worked for the government drawing up expert reports on constitutional questions and giving seminars organised by the government. he further worked with judge h. on a regular basis. by a decision of 15 may 2012, the constitutional court, with the five judges whom the applicant had challenged for bias comprising the bench, dismissed the applicant’s complaints of bias. on the same day, on 15 may 2012, the constitutional court delivered its judgment (file no. moreover, the courts had generally duly furthered the proceedings. there had only been a delay of two years and three months between the last hearing before the court of first instance on 6 september 2007 and the delivery of the judgment on 28 december 2009. the constitutional court noted that liechtenstein law did not contain any provisions stipulating which consequences should result from a breach of the right to proceedings within a reasonable time. there was therefore a gap in the law which had to be filled by way of judicial interpretation. however, the judgment fee could not be imposed on the state as a measure of compensation as liechtenstein had to bear that cost anyway. moreover, the liechtenstein courts had been independent tribunals. moreover, the findings of facts, the assessment of the evidence and the legal reasoning of the lower courts did not disclose any arbitrariness. the judgment and the decision of 15 may 2012 were served on the applicant on 27 june 2012.
on 16 september 1982 the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. the applicant’s case was reviewed by the board on 12 november 1998, 3 november 1999, 7 december 1999, 26 april 2000 and 30 october 2000. permission was granted but the application was dismissed on 29 june 2001. on 29 november 2001 the applicant’s case was referred to a panel of the lsrc. the panel’s role was first, to establish whether, at the date of recall, there had been a significant risk of the applicant committing serious harm; and secondly, to consider whether the risk currently posed by the applicant was capable of being managed safely in the community, and, if not, whether there were steps that might be taken with a view to reducing the current risk to a level that could, in the future, be safely managed in the community. an initial hearing took place on 17 june 2002. it therefore set that issue aside and the remainder of the hearing only addressed the question of risk at that point in time. in the course of the hearing the applicant dismissed his solicitor. he instructed new solicitors in late september 2002 but they only obtained a legal aid certificate in april 2003, despite the chairman of the panel intervening to expedite the process. a preliminary hearing date was fixed for 16 march 2004. the applicant’s representatives asked the chairman to direct the secretary of state to call them as witnesses. on 12 may 2004 the prison service on behalf of the secretary of state submitted twenty-one witness statements taken by police during the course of the original investigation and sought leave to call one of the complainants as a witness. on 17 may 2004 the applicant’s solicitors wrote to the smith panel to complain about the late submission of the witness statements and the decision to permit the complainant to be called as a witness. as a consequence, a further preliminary hearing was held on the morning of 18 may 2004 instead of the substantive hearing originally planned. on 4 november 2004 the smith panel indicated that it would not direct the secretary of state to issue a witness summons to secure the complainant’s attendance. in addition, both parties submitted written representations. he contended first, that the procedure before the lsrc had been unfair and in breach of articles 5 § 4 and 6 of the convention, as the smith panel had based a finding against him on the statements of witnesses who had not been available to be challenged by cross-examination. moreover, the court accepted that the panel had applied the correct standard of proof. finally, in respect of the question of delay, the court found that the smith panel had not been in breach of its article 5 § 4 obligations as the applicant’s side “was very largely responsible for the long periods in progressing the matter to the point of a hearing”. on 4 july 2006 the applicant filed a notice of appeal against the judgment of the high court in which he argued that the smith panel had misdirected itself as to the standard of proof required to establish the allegations against him; that the procedure before the smith panel had been unfair and in breach of articles 5 § 4 and 6 of the convention, most notably because the applicant’s nieces should have been required to give evidence; and finally, that there had not been a “speedy determination” of the lawfulness of his detention. on 6 september 2007 the court of appeal delivered its judgment. on the question of fairness the court observed that the applicant had suffered no disadvantage on account of the decision not to subpoena his nieces. however, the court held that in determining the standard of proof the smith panel had misdirected itself. he also sought damages in respect of that violation and an order for bail. instead, the initial referral to the lsrc, which took place on 29 november 2001, was revived and a third panel was convened to consider afresh the applicant’s recall (“the first rodgers panel”). on 1 may 2008 the applicant issued a claim for judicial review challenging this decision of 20 march 2008 by the first rodger’s panel. the applicant filed a notice of appeal against this decision. the sole issue was therefore that of current risk. the judicial review application was remitted to the high court. there had therefore remained a causal connection between the original conviction and the risk of harm to the community which justified the detention of the applicant in march 2008.
the applicants were born in 1976 and 1975 respectively and live in moscow. in 2007 the kirov region’s property management department founded the state unitary enterprise kirovles (когуп «кировлес»). according to its incorporation documents, kirovles’ commercial activities were woodcutting and timber processing. it owned thirty-six timber mills registered as its operational branches. it appears that by 2009 the company was in substantial debt and continued to make losses. in early 2009 the first applicant discussed kirovles’ financial and logistical problems with its director, x. he suggested that the company join forces with a timber trading company to bring in customers and, in particular, curtail the kirovles timber mills’ practice of direct sales for cash bypassing kirovles’ accounts. the second applicant created vlk and registered it in march 2009. on 15 april 2009 kirovles, represented by x, concluded a framework contract with vlk, represented by the second applicant. on 1 september 2009 kirovles terminated the contract with vlk. he had therefore terminated the contract. on 28 january 2011 the investigative committee decided not to open a criminal investigation against the first applicant for lack of corpus delicti. on 10 may 2011 the acting chief of the investigation division of the investigative committee decided to open a criminal investigation in respect of both applicants. it follows from the parties’ submissions that the following witnesses were also questioned. witness mr a., chief of the kirov regional forestry department, made a statement about how the contract between vlk and kirovles had been concluded and how the first applicant and x had been at odds. witness mr k., deputy chief of the kirov regional forestry department, stated that the first applicant had insisted on an independent audit of kirovles and proposed restructuring it to prevent financial manipulation by x. seven other witnesses, all managers of vlk, gave details about vlk’s work to find customers for kirovles in accordance with the contract. based on this evidence, the investigators found that there was no case against the applicants. on 25 april 2012 the investigative committee reversed that decision. i am warning you, there will be no mercy, no forgiveness if such things happen again. on 5 december 2012 the first applicant served the leninskiy district court of kirov (“the district court”) with a complaint challenging the decision to sever x’s criminal case and examine it in accelerated proceedings. on 10 june 2013 the applicants filed a request with the district court to have the judgment given in x’s case excluded from evidence. the applicants and their defence team questioned x afterwards. on 3 july 2013 it admitted this material as evidence. the court relied on the testimony of x and his statements made during the investigation. however, it stressed that the first applicant had not been accused, or convicted, of any abuse of his official position at the governor’s office:
“mr navalnyy [is not suspected of] committing a crime by abuse of his official position; consequently, the defence’s arguments that the governor’s volunteer consultant had no powers to give binding instructions to the companies’ management do not refute the accusation [or] prove that it was impossible for mr navalnyy to commit the crime and order its execution.” the court has established that contrary to the said provisions of the certificate of incorporation, the employment contract and the law, [x], acting on behalf of the company directed by him, has entered into a sales contract ... with ooo vlk represented by mr ofitserov to exclusively facilitate stealing kirovles’ property and transferring [it] for the benefit of ooo vlk ... the conclusion of this sales contract has resulted in material damage [being caused] to kirovles. ...
according to the ruling of the plenary of the supreme court of the russian federation no. the court estimated that the damage caused to kirovles amounted to rub 16,165,826. in addition, they were both fined rub 500,000. on 19 july 2013 the regional court granted the request and released the applicants on parole. it amended their sentence and gave them both suspended prison terms on an undertaking not to change their place of residence.
the applicant was born in 1987 and lives in słomczyn. on 6 april 2009 the applicant was arrested on charges of participation in an organised and armed criminal group involved in extortions and procuring of several violent offences committed while acting in an organised criminal group. on 8 april 2009 the warsaw wola district court (sąd rejonowy) remanded the applicant in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. it further considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. it also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence which might encourage the accused to interfere with the conduct of the proceedings. consequently, the suspicion against the applicant could indeed be considered as reasonable. the regional court also agreed with the district court that the circumstances of the case justified the suspicion that a severe penalty might be imposed on the applicant. the court relied on the same grounds as previously. the bill of indictment concerned altogether nine accused charged with thirty six offences. the court relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences, the severity of the anticipated penalty and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings due to the organised character of the criminal activities in question. the applicant’s appeal against the decision of that court of 23 december 2010 was dismissed by the warsaw court of appeal (sąd apelacyjny) on 20 january 2011. meanwhile, the trial was started on 19 july 2010. on 31 march 2011 the warsaw regional court gave judgment. the applicant and the other defendants appealed. it considered that the reasons previously given remained valid. the court also referred to the fact, relied on by the court which had imposed the detention on the applicant (see paragraph 8 above), that one of the charges against him concerned witness tampering by means of violence. on 12 february 2013 the warsaw court of appeal quashed that decision for procedural reasons. on 6 march 2013 the warsaw regional court extended the applicant’s detention for a period of three months. it relied on the severity of the anticipated penalty and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings in finding that keeping the applicant in custody was necessary. it also noted that the length of the proceedings resulted mainly from the complexity of the case. on 18 april 2013 the warsaw court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the above mentioned decision. on 5 june 2013 the applicant’s detention on remand was lifted. the proceedings are still pending before the warsaw regional court. the court also referred to the severity of the anticipated penalty and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. the courts continually justified their decisions by the existence of a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question. they emphasised the need to secure the process of obtaining evidence and the complex character of the case. on 5 september 2013 the bill of indictment containing 187 pages was lodged with the warsaw regional court. the applicant was charged with several instances of drug trafficking committed in an organised criminal group. the prosecutor requested the trial court to hear fifty-eight witnesses. the bail was paid and the applicant was released on 2 july 2014.
the applicant is a moldovan national belonging to the german ethnic minority. he signed various confessions, allegedly following threats to him and his relatives. on 4 november 2009 the applicant’s criminal case was submitted to the trial court. it ordered the materials in the criminal file to be forwarded to the prosecutor’s office with a view to prosecuting the persons responsible for the applicant’s detention and also to determining whether the applicant had breached the rights of other persons. they had to take turns to sleep on the single large wooden platform, which was not covered. in the winter the heating was on for only a few hours a day and, as at the tiraspol police headquarters, the detainees were allowed to shower only once a week (all the detainees in his cell had a combined total of twenty minutes in which to take a shower with cold water). during his detention the applicant often complained about his medical condition and asked for medical assistance. his parents requested on many occasions that their son be seen by a lung specialist. on an unknown date in 2009 the applicant’s mother asked for the applicant to be transferred to a specialist hospital, as bronchial asthma was one of the illnesses listed by the “mrt ministry of the interior” as a reason warranting a transfer to hospital. despite the panel’s findings, the applicant was transferred on the same day to the ivs in hlinaia, which, as stated by the applicant and not contradicted by the respondent governments, was less well equipped than the centre. the applicant’s mother was told by the prison staff that she had to bring her son the medication he required since there was none available in the prison. on 16 february 2010 a visit was authorised, but the applicant and his mother had to talk to each other in the presence of a prison guard. he was denied access to the applicant, a refusal which he subsequently confirmed in a letter to the court dated 29 september 2010. in a news report dated 23 november 2006, the regnum news agency reported a statement by the “mrt president” to the effect that each “mrt ministry” was working on harmonising the legislation of the “mrt” with that of russia, and that a group of representatives of “mrt ministries” was to travel to moscow within the next few days to discuss the matter. the expert heard complaints that the defence in general was disadvantaged in comparison with the prosecution. special training is needed for those judges involved in juvenile justice matters. others had been charged and were defendants at court proceedings. ...
the expert talked with inmates who had been kept on remand longer than 18 months. one woman who had appealed an original sentence had been detained for four years. the former had at the time 1 187 inmates, of whom 170 were under strict special regime. in the report on its visit to moldova between 21 and 27 july 2010 (cpt/inf (2011) 8) the cpt stated that, following the refusal of the “mrt” authorities to allow members of the committee to meet in private with detainees, the cpt had decided to call off its visit because a limitation of this kind ran counter to the fundamental characteristics of the prevention mechanism enshrined in its mandate. in the time available, the delegation was not in a position to make a thorough examination of the whole of the penitentiary system. the cpt recognises that in periods of economic difficulties, sacrifices may have to be made, including in penitentiary establishments. at the end of the visit, the cpt’s delegation requested the authorities to take steps without delay to ensure that all penitentiary establishments are supplied on a regular basis with medicines of various types and, in particular, with a suitable range of anti‑tuberculosis drugs. on the question of russian military withdrawal, the osce observed:
“there were no withdrawals of russian arms and equipment from the transdniestrian region during 2005. the commander of the operative group of russian forces reported in may that surplus stocks of 40,000 small arms and light weapons stored by russian forces in the transdniestrian region have been destroyed. ...
on 13 november, a group of 30 osce heads of delegations, along with osce mission members, gained access for the first time since march 2004 to the russian federation ammunition depot in colbasna, near the moldovan-ukrainian border in northern transnistria. all meetings concentrated on finding ways to restart formal settlement negotiations, which have nonetheless failed to resume. informal meetings of the sides with mediators and observers took place five times. the voluntary fund retains sufficient resources to complete withdrawal tasks.”
the applicant was born in 1955 and lives in kaunas. in february 1993 the kaunas region municipality (kauno rajono savivaldybė) assigned a plot of land measuring 0.15 hectares in the settlement of noreikiškės to the applicant for the construction of a house (hereinafter “the land”). in may 1995 she signed a land purchase agreement with the municipality and bought the land for 29.70 “single-use investment vouchers” (investiciniai čekiai). the purchase agreement indicated that the nominal value of the land was 2,976 lithuanian litai (ltl  approximately 862 euros (eur)). the applicant subsequently obtained a building permit and built a storehouse on the land. on 10 may 2002 the constitutional court found that government regulations which allowed land in noreikiškės to be sold to private individuals were contrary to the constitution of the republic of lithuania and the restitution law (see padalevičius v. lithuania, no. the kca argued that the land in question had to be returned in natura to its former owners and thus had been sold to the applicant and other individuals unlawfully. on 4 june 2004 the kaunas district court allowed the kca’s claim. on 7 february 2005 the kaunas regional court partially quashed the first-instance judgment. it found that the lower court had correctly annulled the administrative decision and purchase agreement, and upheld the judgment in that part. however, it noted that the “single-use investment vouchers” could no longer be used as a means of payment. thus, in accordance with the civil code, the applicant should have received the monetary equivalent of what she had paid in 1995. the court remitted that part of the case for re-examination in order to assess the monetary equivalent. on 3 october 2005 the supreme court upheld the regional court’s judgment. the remitted part of the case was subsequently re-examined by the kaunas regional court sitting as the court of first instance. during those proceedings, the applicant argued that the unlawful allocation and sale of the land had resulted from the state authorities’ negligence. the applicant claimed that she, as a bona fide purchaser, was therefore entitled to receive compensation for the full market value as it was at the time of expropriation, in accordance with article 6.147 § 2 of the civil code (see paragraph 16 below). on 6 march 2008 the kaunas regional court dismissed the applicant’s request for compensation equating to the full market value of the land. the court found that the authorities could not be held solely responsible for the unlawful sale because the applicant had also had a duty to verify whether she had been buying the land lawfully. thus, the court held that, for the purposes of article 6.147 § 2 of the civil code, the applicant could not be considered a bona fide purchaser and was not entitled to compensation for the full market value. the court awarded her the nominal value of the land in 1995, which it assessed to be ltl 29.70 (eur 8.60). the court also noted that if the applicant considered that she had suffered pecuniary damage, she had the right to institute separate proceedings against the state for damages. on 19 august 2008 the court of appeal partially amended the regional court’s judgment. it reiterated that the applicant could not be considered a bona fide purchaser merely because she had bought the land from the state – she had also had a duty to verify the lawfulness of the sale. however, the court of appeal found that the lower court had incorrectly assessed the nominal value of the land in 1995. referring to the text of the purchase agreement (see paragraph 6 above), the court awarded the applicant ltl 2,976 (eur 862). on 27 january 2009 the supreme court upheld the judgment of the court of appeal; however, it partially amended the reasoning. the supreme court stated that the nominal value of the land had been indicated in the purchase agreement, so it had not been necessary to apply article 6.147 of the civil code and assess the monetary equivalent. as a result, the applicant’s good faith had been irrelevant in determining the amount of compensation and should not have been examined. nonetheless, the supreme court considered that that error had not affected the lawfulness of the court of appeal’s judgment.
the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, are similar to those in association “21 december 1989” and others v. romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 may 2011). they have the same historical context and relate to the same domestic criminal proceedings. on 17 december 1989, following demonstrations against the government and on the orders of president nicolae ceauşescu, military operations were conducted in timișoara and, over the following days, in other towns, including bucharest, reșița and braşov. these operations caused many civilian deaths and casualties. according to a document of 5 june 2008, issued by the military prosecutor’s office at the high court of cassation and justice, “more than 1,200 people died, more than 5,000 people were injured and several thousand people were unlawfully deprived of their liberty and subjected to ill treatment”, in bucharest, timişoara, reşiţa, buzău, constanţa, craiova, brăila, oradea, cluj, braşov, târgu mureş, sibiu and other towns in romania. in addition, it appears from ministry of defence documents, declassified by government decision no. 94/2010 of 10 february 2010, that thousands of servicemen, equipped with combat tanks and other armed vehicles, were deployed in bucharest and other cities. during the period of 17 to 30 december 1989 they used considerable quantities of ammunition against the demonstrators. the applicants are people whose relatives were shot and killed in the events which took place between 17 and 30 december in bucharest, except for the applicant in application no. 45779/14, whose husband was killed in reșița and the applicant in application no. 24127/14, whose son was killed in braşov. in 1990, military prosecutors in bucharest, timişoara, oradea, constanţa, craiova, bacău, târgu mureş and cluj opened investigations into the use of force and the unlawful deprivation of liberty of the participants in demonstrations in the final days of december 1989. to date, the main criminal investigation into the use of violence, particularly against civilian demonstrators, both prior to and following the overthrow of nicolae ceauşescu, has been contained in file no. the most important procedural steps undertaken between 1990 and 2009 were summarised in association “21 december 1989” and others (cited above, §§ 12-41). subsequent developments are described below. on 18 october 2010 the military prosecutor’s office at the high court of cassation and justice decided not to institute criminal proceedings with regard to the acts committed by the military, finding that the applicants’ complaints were partly statute-barred and partly ill-founded. the investigation into crimes committed by civilians, members of the patriotic guards, militia members and prison staff was severed from the case file and jurisdiction was relinquished in favour of the prosecuting authorities at the high court of cassation and justice. on 15 april 2011 the chief prosecutor at the military prosecutor’s office set aside the decision of 18 october 2010 on the grounds that the investigation had not yet been finalised and that not all the victims and perpetrators had been identified. on 18 april 2011 the military prosecutor’s office relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the prosecutor’s office at the high court of cassation and justice on the grounds that the investigation concerned both civilians and military personnel. on 9 march 2012 – after classified material in the criminal investigation file had been opened to the public in 2010 – the case was re-registered with a view to an investigation in the light of the newly available information. in february 2014, after the entry into force of the new code of criminal procedure, jurisdiction was again relinquished in favour of the military prosecuting authorities and the file was registered under the domestic case file no. by an ordinance of 14 october 2015, the prosecuting authorities at the high court of cassation and justice discontinued the proceedings in relation to case file no. the parties have not submitted any information on whether there was an appeal against that decision.
the applicant was born in 1989 and lives in istanbul. on 21 and 31 august 2004 she took the practical selection tests performing on the bağlama[1]. referring to the report issued by that hospital’s medical board on 16 september 2004, he informed the chief medical officer that none of the seven sections of the music academy could be deemed not to require eyesight. the letter stated that in order to be able to be educated in any section of the academy, a student had to submit a medical report stating that he or she was fit for the task. the director of the music academy asked the chief medical officer to prepare a fresh medical report taking account of the fact that no section of the music academy could be considered as not necessitating eyesight, and accordingly to specify whether or not the applicant was capable of being educated in the music academy. on an unspecified date the music academy rejected the applicant’s request for enrolment. on 24 september 2004 the applicant’s parents, acting in her name and on her behalf, lodged with istanbul administrative court (“the administrative court”) an action against the administration of istanbul technical university to set aside the music academy’s decision not to enrol their daughter. counsel for the applicant submitted that she had satisfied all those criteria. he also cited the names of former blind students who had graduated from the same music academy. they argued that pursuant to section 27 § 2 of act no. 2577, there had been two preconditions for obtaining a stay of execution: the existence of damage which was irreparable or difficult to repair, and the apparent unlawfulness of the administrative act in question. they also submitted that such refusal was unlawful. moreover, they argued that the respondent administration’s argument that the medical report had not been submitted in time was fallacious, as that report had been submitted to the music academy on monday 20 september 2004, that is to say on the first working day after receipt of the letter from the academy requesting the report. the only reason for the refusal of enrolment had been her blindness. on 23 may 2005 the health department attached to the istanbul governor’s office adopted a decision refusing to authorise the prosecution of the chief medical officer in question. on 18 july 2005 they lodged an appeal with the istanbul court administrative requesting the setting aside of the decision not to enrol the applicant. 5378 of 1 july 2005 on persons with disabilities (“act no. on 14 october 2005 the administrative court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. furthermore, that condition is mentioned on the form distributed to applicants listing the documents required for final enrolment. however, whereas the report prepared by büyükçekmece public hospital had concluded that a report should be requested from a higher medical board, she requested a report from an equivalent medical board, namely bakɪrköy research and training hospital. it has been established that the administration wrote to the chief medical officer of bakɪrköy hospital requesting information on the interpretation of the medical report which it had issued and that the conclusions of that report had subsequently been amended. 1739, that no one could be deprived of his or her right to education and instruction. in his view, it was beyond doubt that it was incumbent on government departments to put in place an environment conducive to education and instruction and meeting the needs of blind persons. he consequently held that the impugned administrative measure had been unlawful. the two reports covered by the inquiry are similar in content. for those reasons it is out of the question for sighted and blind students to follow common courses’. they submitted that that decision was contrary to the constitution, to act no. 5378 and to several international instruments and declarations. on 4 january 2007 the administration of istanbul technical university filed its defence. 1739, also stated that educational establishments were required to take into account persons who required specialist teaching and to adopt the necessary measures to guarantee their education.
the applicant was born in 1987 and lives in orsk, the orenburg region. the summons contained no further details. investigator k. was absent and the applicant was asked to wait. and that he had stayed there until 8 p.m. 8. the applicant denied involvement in the thefts. the applicant felt severe pain in his back. when p. and e. both came out k. untied the applicant’s legs and demanded that the applicant write a statement of “surrender and confession”. at some point e. came out and the applicant was untied and the handcuffs were removed from him. the applicant started writing the statement as requested. p. came in together with lawyer s. who offered his services as counsel for the applicant’s defence. the applicant refused because he wished to be represented by a lawyer of his own choice. an ambulance, which had been called after the incident with the broken glass, arrived and the applicant was examined by the ambulance medical assistant, who provided him with first aid and left. on 15 february 2005 the orsk police department was alerted by the town hospital that the applicant had been taken to hospital with injuries allegedly inflicted by police officers. (a)  explanations received by the investigating authority 23. on 18 february 2005 lawyer s. stated that on 15 february 2005, some time after 7.20 p.m. [the head of the police department] p. had asked him to be present at an investigative measure as counsel for the defence of the applicant, who was suspected of having committed a crime. s. had seen coagulated blood on the applicant’s eyebrow and on his head. the applicant had explained that he himself had hit his head against a bookcase. s. had offered his services as counsel for his defence. e. denied any use of force or psychological pressure in relation to the applicant. p. gave statements similar to those by e. about the applicant hitting the bookcase with his head. stated that on 15 february 2005 at the sovetskiy district police station he had taken the applicant to the experts’ room, where the applicant had been fingerprinted and photographed, and then to the exit. on 5 march 2005 operative officer k. stated that the police had had information, notably explanations by an eyewitness to a theft at a certain shop, that the applicant could have been involved in the theft. the applicant had been fingerprinted and photographed. the applicant complained of recurring headaches. the injuries were qualified as light damage to health as they had caused short-term health disorder. her examination had not revealed any obvious signs of concussion. on 23 march 2005 junior nurse g. gave similar explanations. the applicant’s father appealed against the investigator’s decision of 24 march 2005. he complained, in particular, that the investigator had never held an identity parade in order to identify the two unknown police officers who had delivered blows to the applicant’s head. it noted that an identity parade could only be held once a criminal case had been opened, which was not the case in the present proceedings.
the applicant first visited cyprus in 1991. as a result of this marriage he obtained cypriot nationality in september 2000. two years later the applicant divorced his wife and married his second wife, a syrian national. he and the syrian national divorced in 2005. following a request by the applicant an investigative committee was set up. the applicant was also heard by the committee as part of the investigation. on 23 july 2007, on the basis of the report of the investigative committee, the council of ministers decided to deprive the applicant of his cypriot nationality on public interest grounds, pursuant to section 113 of the census bureau law of 2002 (see relevant domestic law and practice at paragraph 37 below). the report concluded that the applicant had been involved in cigarette trafficking and in the trafficking of illegal immigrants between syria and cyprus. this recourse was dismissed at first instance on 7 may 2008. the appeal was dismissed by the plenary court on 12 may 2011: see paragraph 18 below. on 25 august 2010 deportation and detention orders were issued against the applicant. the next day, at the applicant’s request, he was transferred to a private hospital and remained under police custody until his discharge from the hospital on 21 october 2010. after that he was detained at a police station in pera chorio nisou (nicosia district) and was transferred to the hospital on various occasions, where he remained in police custody. on 24 september 2010 the applicant filed a recourse with the supreme court (revisional jurisdiction) against the deportation and detention orders (recourse no. the same day, the applicant filed a request for a provisional order seeking the suspension of his deportation and an order for his release. on 16 december 2010, the applicant withdrew his application for suspension of his deportation because he had decided to leave cyprus voluntarily. it appears that the applicant took this decision because he had been in detention for too long. on 20 december 2010, the applicant, whilst in detention, received a letter from the civil registry and migration department requesting payment, before his deportation, of eur 30,356 for detention expenses as well as eur 1,200 for the legal costs incurred in recourse no. 1226/07 (the appeal against removal of citizenship: see paragraph 9 above). the eur 30,356 was broken down as follows: (i) eur 20,675 for the salaries of the police officers who guarded him when he was in hospital; eur 2,650 as expenses for his detention and maintenance at the police detention facilities for fifty-three days; and eur 5,831 representing 25% of administrative fees. in his submissions to the court, the applicant alleges that the authorities refused to allow him to leave cyprus unless he paid the sums requested. he did not and claims that he thus remained in detention. on 31 december 2010, the applicant applied to the supreme court for a writ of habeas corpus (application no. on 29 january 2011 the applicant was deported to syria. the applicant maintains that his representatives were notified of this judgment on 30 may 2011. the applicant returned to cyprus on 20 march 2012. he then married his third wife (that is, the woman he had already married in syria in 2007: see paragraph 7 above). the civil registry and migration department refused this application on 11 june 2012, stating that it considered the applicant a threat to public order for the same reasons for which he had been deprived of cypriot nationality and then deported on 29 january 2011. the applicant was asked to leave the country. that claim was withdrawn on 31 july 2015.
the applicant was born in 1973 and lives in brčko, bosnia and herzegovina. on 29 december 2011 the applicant lodged a request for a residence permit in croatia on the grounds of family reunification with her partner, ms d.b., she submitted that she had been educated in croatia and that she had lived in zagreb for seventeen years. she also explained that she wanted to live with d.b., with whom she had been in a relationship for two years, and with whom she wanted to establish a household and start a business. stated that she owned a house in sisak where she wanted to live with the applicant. she explained that she had been in a relationship with the applicant for two years and that they wanted to live together so as to avoid constant travelling and the distance between them. during the proceedings the sisak police department (policijska uprava sisačko-moslovačka) found that the applicant and d.b. had been in a relationship since october 2009 and that in order to maintain their relationship they had been travelling to see each other. it was also established that the applicant had recently stayed with d.b. in the period between 16 september and 4 december 2011. on 24 february 2012 the sisak police department dismissed the applicant’s request with a summary reasoning indicating that all the relevant requirements under the aliens act had not been met. she relied, inter alia, on the constitution and the prohibition of discrimination act, arguing that even if she was not to be considered as d.b. on 8 june 2012 the ministry dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of the sisak police department. the relevant part of the ministry’s decision reads:
“concerning the family reunification, based on which the request for the regularisation of the status of an alien in croatia has been submitted in the case at issue, [it is to be noted that] the case file shows that the appellant relies on the existence of a same-sex relationship with the croatian national d.b., ...
it follows that the [same-sex union] act does not define a same-sex union as a family and the family act does not cover same-sex unions. it should also be taken into account that the provisions of the aliens act concerning temporary residence for family reunification do not provide for a possibility of regularisation of the status of an alien on the grounds of [the existence of] a same-sex union, nor does such a union fall within the scope of [the term] ‘immediate family member’ incorporated in that act, which makes it clear that there is no legal ground for granting the request of the appellant. on 24 july 2012 the applicant lodged an administrative action with the zagreb administrative court (upravni sud u zagrebu), arguing that she had been discriminated against in comparison to different-sex couples who had a possibility to seek family reunification under the aliens act. the zagreb administrative court dismissed the applicant’s action on 30 january 2013. the cited sections 3 and 5 of the family act show that marriage and extramarital relationship are unions between a man and a woman. thus, union between two same-sex persons cannot be considered under the relevant legal provisions as marriage or an extramarital relationship. union between two same-sex persons can be considered under the legal term same-sex union under the conditions provided for in section 2 of the same-sex union act. which is not in dispute between the parties. she relied on the convention and the relevant domestic anti-discrimination legislation, and she cited the court’s case-law on the question of discrimination related to sexual orientation. on 29 may 2013 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint, endorsing the reasoning of the lower bodies. the relevant part of the decision reads:
“8. discrimination means difference in the treatment of persons in the same or relevantly similar situations without an objective and reasonable justification. article 14 of the constitution contains constitutional guarantee against discrimination on any ground in securing a concrete right. the constitutional court also notes that the appellant, in the concrete case, did not show that she has used the legal avenue under the prohibition of discrimination act ...
there has therefore been no violation of her constitutional right under article 14 §§ 1 and 2 of the constitution. the case-law of the european court cited in the constitutional complaint is of no relevance for the case at issue since it relates to cases concerning health insurance and inheritance of tenancy rights by same-sex partners living in a stable (de facto) relationship.”
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in st petersburg. the first twin died nine hours after her birth. the second twin, who was transferred to a resuscitation and intensive therapy unit at one of the st petersburg children’s hospitals (“the children’s hospital”) twenty hours after his birth, survived. on 25 may 2003 the applicant’s mother, mrs d., sent the following telegram to the president of the russian federation:
“... newborns are dying because of delays in emergency medical treatment. hospitals] have waiting lists – a brutal practice. thus in ... april at ... a.m. in maternity hospital no. ... [ my] granddaughter ... never got to the top of the list and died ten hours later. [ in a very serious condition ... the death [of my granddaughter] has shocked our family. who is responsible for the deaths of these children? i request that this problem be examined at the meetings of the government and the state duma ...”
“i am wiring you for the third time about the deaths of premature newborns in st petersburg ... [i] consider the existence of a waiting list for resuscitation treatment a crime ... waiting for [your] response about the action taken ...” 9. the committee ordered an examination, which was carried out by a panel consisting of the chief neonatologist of the committee and the head of the paediatrics department at the advanced medical studies faculty of the st petersburg state paediatrics medical academy. in particular, the report stated that the infant had been born prematurely in the thirty-first week of gestation of an eighth pregnancy and by a first delivery. it was concluded that she had been born with severe respiratory distress syndrome complicated by an air leak syndrome, and that she had been provided with treatment which had been entirely appropriate, given the seriousness of the condition and the nature of the disease. the report also noted that the second twin had suffered from respiratory distress syndrome as well, but to a much lesser extent. on 5 september 2003 the acting head of the committee sent the report to the ministry with an accompanying letter. the letter of 12 september 2003 was the subject of proceedings brought by the applicant against the committee, about which no further information is available. it appears that a request by the applicant for a copy of the report was refused, and that that refusal was the subject of separate proceedings brought by the applicant against the committee. in the course of those proceedings, on 30 november 2004, the applicant received a copy of the report and the committee’s letter to the ministry of 5 september 2003. she requested that the report and the letter of 5 september 2003 be declared invalid. she stated that she had not asked the committee to examine the quality of the medical treatment she and her children had received or to establish the cause of her daughter’s death. she argued that the provisions of article 61 contained an exhaustive list of exceptions to that general rule, and that the committee’s impugned acts had not fallen under any of them. on 14 december 2005 the kuybyshevskiy district court of st petersburg dismissed her application. the chief neonatologist, who was examined as a witness, stated that: he had acted within his powers; he had not been able to verify d.’s allegations without obtaining the medical records in question; he had involved medical specialists in the examination of those records; and no disclosure of the information contained in those medical records had taken place. a representative of the committee denied the applicant’s allegations. the ministry had had the power to request material from the committee, which in turn had had a corresponding duty to submit detailed information. the applicant’s medical records had been examined by doctors bound by confidentiality. it was the report prepared as a result of that examination, and not the applicant’s medical records per se, which had been transferred to the ministry. the district court also noted that the applicant had lodged her application on 25 february 2005, although she had learned that her children’s medical records had been obtained without her consent on 3 december 2003 from the committee’s letter of that date. the applicant did not appeal against that decision. she had therefore complied with that time-limit.
the applicant was born in 1964 and is currently detained in a psychiatric hospital in lippstadt. in 1979 the applicant forced two seven-year-old girls, and in 1980 a four-year-old girl, to undress and hit them with a stick. in 1981 the applicant forced a seven-year-old girl to undress and lay on top of the girl on a bench. on 21 january 1983 the münster regional court convicted the applicant of attempted rape together with sexual assault and dangerous assault and of attempted murder and assault. it considered that the applicant had acted with diminished criminal responsibility (article 21 of the criminal code; see paragraph 27 below). this damage, combined with failings in his upbringing (he had repeatedly been hit by his father with a stick himself), had caused a consciousness disorder and the sadistic sexual tendencies the applicant had disclosed in his offence. since 29 january 1983 the applicant has been detained in a psychiatric hospital. in december 1990, when the applicant was granted leave from detention, he attacked a twenty-six-year-old cyclist, threatened her with a knife and attempted to force her into a forest. the criminal proceedings in this respect were discontinued with regard to his previous conviction. on 28 january 2011 the paderborn regional court ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention in a psychiatric hospital under articles 67d and 67e of the criminal code (see paragraphs 29-31 below). it was unclear whether the applicant still suffered from sadistic paraphilia. moreover, the applicant’s dissocial conduct and schizoid personality disorder had been alleviated by social therapy and psychotherapy. in assessing the risk emanating from the applicant, the expert considered that it had to be taken into account that the applicant had already committed a number of sadistic offences against children. there was a risk that, if the applicant were overstrained or frustrated, he might commit offences as a result of sadistic tendencies. the expert stated, however, that it was impossible for him to assess how far the applicant was still driven by sadistic fantasies. however, he was still unable to reflect on the motives for his offence. therefore, it was difficult to assess how dangerous the applicant was; there was a risk that he would reoffend if released. the regional court, having heard the applicant and having regard to the evidence before it, considered that the continuation of the applicant’s detention in a psychiatric hospital had to be ordered. despite the fact that the applicant had proved reliable during leave from detention during recent years, it could not be expected with sufficient probability that the applicant would not reoffend if released. in particular, it could not be ruled out that his sadistic tendencies persisted. the applicant was currently not undergoing therapy, in the proper sense of the term, and suffered from hospitalism. the regional court further considered that the continuation of the applicant’s detention was proportionate. in support of this view, it referred to the serious offence which had led to the applicant’s placement in a psychiatric hospital, to the fact that he had relapsed during the execution of his detention order and to the potential risk, as confirmed by the expert and the psychiatric hospital staff, that the applicant would reoffend if released. on 23 february 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal against the regional court’s decision. moreover, the experts and courts had confirmed that he was no longer undergoing any therapy and that it was unclear whether he was still dangerous to the public. the applicant underwent several courses of therapy, including social therapy and psychotherapy, during his detention in the psychiatric hospital. however, he had repeatedly declined offers to restart such individual or group therapy. when granted leave under escort several times per year, he has visited members of his family. on 18 january 2012 the paderborn regional court, endorsing the reasons given in its previous decision, ordered the applicant’s continued detention in a psychiatric hospital. on 20 march 2012 the hamm court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in st petersburg. she had a garage and a small storage building (‘the construction’) in yerevan measuring 21 sq. m. in total, that she had apparently built without authorisation. on 26 august 2005 a lease agreement, valid until 22 july 2010, was concluded between the mayor of yerevan and the applicant. on 5 september 2005, based on the mayor’s decision of 22 july 2005, the applicant received an ownership certificate in respect of the construction. on 20 july 2006 the mayor of yerevan lodged a claim against the applicant with the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan seeking to invalidate her ownership certificate in respect of the construction and the lease, on the basis of the decision of 19 june 2006. on 20 october 2006 the applicant issued a power of attorney whereby she authorised advocate g. to represent her in court. this power of attorney was then signed and sealed by g. 13. the first hearing before the district court took place on 24 october 2006. the record of this hearing states, inter alia, the following:
“... [the applicant] has not appeared; advocate g. has appeared on her behalf stating that he represents the defendant and asked to be given time to study the case file and produced a power of attorney signed by the applicant but not certified by a notary. on 1 november 2006 g. lodged a counter-claim on behalf of the applicant seeking to invalidate the mayor’s decision of 19 june 2006 as taken in violation of the domestic law. the relevant parts of the district court’s decision reads as follows:
“having examined ... the presented power of attorney, the court finds that the counter-claim ... must be returned, taking into account that the power of attorney has been issued in violation of article 41 § 1, 2 and 4 of the [the code of civil procedure]. pursuant to that article, a representative’s powers must be stipulated in a power of attorney issued and drawn up in accordance with the law, the power of attorney issued by a citizen shall be certified by a competent official, while the powers of an advocate shall be certified in accordance with the law. in the present case, the power of attorney as submitted by advocate [g.] has been issued in violation of the legal requirements. in accordance with ... article 92 § 1 (2) of the code of civil procedure ... the court decides to return the counter-claim lodged by [g.]. the decision to return the counter-claim can be appealed in cassation proceedings within three days from its receipt by the claimant.” on the same day the district court also examined the mayor’s claim and decided to grant it. on 8 november 2006 the district court sent a copy of its judgment to the applicant by post. it appears from the postal envelope that the copy of the judgment was delivered to the applicant’s local post office on 18 november 2006 and was received by the applicant on 20 november 2006. on 15 november 2006 advocate g. lodged an appeal on points of law with the court of cassation against the district court’s decision not to admit the counter-claim. he claimed that the provisions of the civil legislation did not require that a power of attorney issued to an advocate be certified by a notary. he also added that the imposition of such a requirement restricted the right of access to court since the notary, as a public official, interfered with the relationship between advocate and client and made the possibility to institute court proceedings conditional on his prior approval. the relevant parts of this decision state the following:
“the civil chamber of the court of cassation ... having examined the appeal on points of law against the decision of 1 november 2006 ...lodged by [the applicant’s] representative [g.] ... found that it should be returned for the following reasons:
according to article 230 § 1 (4.1) of the code of civil procedure of the republic of armenia, an appeal on points of law should contain one of the grounds stated in article 231.2 § 1 of the code of civil procedure. ... the present appeal on points of law only mentions the elements of points 1 and 3 of article 231.2 § 1; however the appellant has not submitted proper and sufficient arguments in relation to them; therefore the requirements of article 230 § 1 (4.1) of the ... code of civil procedure have not been met. in such circumstances, the violations of the above-mentioned requirements serve as a basis for returning the appeal on points of law. ...
in view of the above reasoning ... the court of cassation decides to return the appeal on points of law against the decision of ... of 1 november 2006 lodged by [the applicant’s] representative [g.]...” 21. the court finds that the request should be rejected and the appeal dismissed since the appellant has failed to submit any documentary proof which would substantiate this allegation; moreover, ... the case file contains a postal receipt ... according to which a copy of the above judgment was sent to [the applicant] on 8 november 2006 with registered mail in accordance with the procedure and within the time-limits prescribed by ... the code of civil procedure. he argued, in particular, that there was no evidence in the case file, such as an acknowledgement of receipt, which would substantiate that the defendant had received the copy of the judgment in a timely manner. on 15 february 2007 the court of cassation declared the appeal on points of law inadmissible for lack of merit. besides, the person who has lodged the appeal has failed to submit a power of attorney drafted in compliance with the civil legislation ...
at the same time, the court of cassation does not find it appropriate to provide a time-limit to rectify the errors and resubmit the appeal on points of law.

the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in bucharest. he also alleged that the plot of land was not the property of the university but of the romanian state. however, on 31 july 2008 the chief public prosecutor quashed this decision and relinquished its jurisdiction in favour of the national anti-corruption prosecution service (“the nap”). on the same day the prosecutor issued orders to appear before the investigators against the applicant and five other co-defendants. subsequently, another co-accused, p.p.d., was questioned between 8.30 p.m. and 10.05 p.m. 18. two lawyers chosen by the applicant were called and invited to nap headquarters to assist him. from 11 p.m. to 11.20 p.m. the prosecution authorities questioned another co-accused, a.i.n. the applicant was kept at nap headquarters until 11.30 p.m., when he was informed of the decision taken by the nap on the same day concerning the charges against him and the other defendants. the next day, on 25 march 2009, at about 6.40 p.m., the nap asked the bucharest court of appeal to remand the applicant and the other two defendants in custody (the rector was released) for twenty-nine days, from 25 march 2009 until 22 april 2009. on the same date, the bucharest court of appeal, ruling as a single judge, dismissed the prosecution’s request. in this connection it stressed that the applicant had not evaded criminal proceedings, but had complied with every summons from the prosecution service. however, the court imposed on all of them a prohibition on leaving the country for thirty days, on the ground that there was reasonable suspicion that they had committed the offences with which they had been charged. the applicant contested the measure before the bucharest court of appeal, arguing that the prosecutor’s decision did not provide sufficient reasons for the extension of the restrictive measure, adding that he had willingly attended each time he had been summoned by the investigators. he stressed that the restriction on leaving the country had been imposed in 2009, but in connection with an offence that he had allegedly committed in 2002. he relied on the fact that he was an important businessman for whom freedom of movement outside the country was vital for conducting his business. the applicant replied that he had not been invited to the nap to give a statement since 24 march 2009. it held that since there were no new circumstances which could change the applicant’s situation there was no reason to revoke the preventive measure against him. it held that the applicable law did not provide for an appeal on points of law against an interlocutory judgment by which a request for revocation of a preventive measure had been dismissed. he stated that he needed to leave the country as he had been invited to a business meeting abroad. it also stated that there was still reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence, but the revocation of the restriction would not impede the proper administration of justice. it dismissed the applicant’s complaint, and upheld the nap’s decision to extend the restriction. on 18 june 2009 the nap extended the restriction on the applicant’s right to leave the country for another thirty days. it noted in this connection that no procedural act had been carried out in the case since 21 may 2009, and the applicant, a well-known businessman, had been present whenever the investigators summoned him. an appeal on points of law lodged by the nap was dismissed by the high court of cassation and justice on 3 july 2009. on 19 may 2009 the applicant was invited to nap headquarters and informed that he was charged with the offence of active bribery. the applicant refused to give a statement, availing himself of his right to silence. a report was drafted and signed by the applicant, his lawyer and the prosecutor on that occasion. on 21 december 2012 the file was registered with the bucharest court of appeal. according to the most recent information provided by the applicant, the criminal proceedings against him are still pending.
the applicant was born in 1938 and lives in sibiu. to the emergency unit of the sibiu county hospital, accompanied by their family doctor. was immediately examined by the doctor on duty, mr c.c.r., owing to a lack of beds in the intensive care unit, the patient was not immediately transferred there. dr a.m., on duty that night in the unit, came to see l.m. at some point during the night the blood transfusions were stopped. was declared dead owing to cardio-respiratory failure. had refused to allow the patient to be transferred to another, better equipped, hospital. the applicant also complained of the failure to provide blood transfusions, which he said caused the death of his son, and of the generally poor treatment received by his son in the sibiu county hospital. the applicant’s statement was taken on 26 january 2006. in addition, he criticised the delay in the administration of lactulose to his son. on 2 may 2006 the applicant complained to the sibiu prosecutor’s office of excessive delays in the investigation. on 20 december 2006 the forensic report was added to the case file and on 4 january 2007 it was made available to the applicant. on 11 april 2007, in a briefly-worded decision based on the forensic medical report, the prosecutor’s office of the sibiu county court decided not to commence criminal proceedings against the two doctors as there had been no finding of medical errors. the court observed that the prosecutors’ decisions had been based only on statements by the two doctors and on the forensic report and held that the investigators in the case needed to clarify whether the patient’s state of health had required his admission to the gastroenterology unit and whether treatment in that unit could have influenced the course of the victim’s illness. and a.m., the two doctors under investigation, were questioned for a second time. that decision was communicated to the applicant on 26 may 2009. the applicant took his case against those decisions to court. in january 2011 the family doctor, m.l.i., had presented with signs of hepatic distress and that she had recommended various tests. two doctors who had been on duty when l.m. was admitted were questioned in february 2011. on 25 july 2011 the prosecutor’s office of the sibiu county court, considering it established that the applicant had been suffering from cirrhosis well before august 2005 and that nothing could have been done to save his life, decided not to press criminal charges against the two suspects on the grounds that they had not committed any criminal act. on 27 february 2012 a statement from the applicant was taken by the prosecutor. he further requested a confrontation with the two doctors under investigation. a.m. and the applicant took place on 3 may 2012. they all declared that they did not remember anything about the patient l.m. it gave its decision on 27 february 2006, ruling that no medical errors had been made. and a.m. relying on the medical documents in the file and on the opinion of a university professor, the authority considered that it had been established that no medical errors had been made. an appeal by the applicant against that judgment was allowed by the braşov court of appeal on 26 february 2008.
the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in stockholm. on 22 april 2004 the swedish commercial television channel tv3 broadcast an episode of a television show entitled “insider”, in which it was claimed that “shady transactions and shady characters” were revealed. the show was broadcast live with a few recorded features. in the show, the applicant, who was unknown to the broader public, appeared in pictures and was mentioned by name. he was singled out as the central figure of organised crime within media and advertising and as being guilty of several counts of fraud and other economic offences. the programme was re‑broadcast on 25 april and 17 september 2004. at this time, no criminal investigation had been initiated against the applicant. the television programme was produced in sweden by the swedish company strix television ab. it was sent by satellite link from sweden to the london-based company viasat broadcasting uk ltd and from there sent unaltered to a satellite which transmitted the programme to the swedish audience. the encoded programme was viewable via a satellite receiver or a cable connection in sweden a fraction of a second after it had been sent by satellite link. even if it was viewable in the united kingdom, which is doubtful, it would have been watched there by a small audience. it was presented in the swedish language for a swedish-speaking audience, and was sponsored by companies competing in the swedish market. the anchorman of the show, x, a swedish national, was a celebrity and a well-known television personality in sweden; he was also the chief executive officer of strix television ab. the show had a long run and was watched by many viewers. he maintained that he had been unreservedly pointed out as the central figure of organised crime within media and advertising and as being directly or indirectly responsible for a large number of serious crimes. the applicant submitted a legal opinion stating that it would be impossible, or at least not useful, to bring an action in the united kingdom in the present case since the damage flowing from the television programme at issue had not occurred in the united kingdom. x disputed the claim on the grounds, inter alia, that he was not the responsible editor of the show and that he enjoyed the freedom to communicate information as provided for under chapter 10, section 2 of the constitutional law and as clarified by the supreme court (högsta domstolen) in the case nja 2005 p. 884 (see paragraphs 32 and 33 below). the court finally drew the parties’ attention to the supreme court case nja 2005 p. 884. the applicant appealed, repeating what he had stated in his earlier submissions. although viasat ab had acquired the right to transmit the show from the swedish company tv3 ab, it had had no impact on or responsibility for the programme selection. the applicant also submitted that swedish courts were competent to examine the case under the brussels i regulation (see further paragraph 35 below). x contested the arguments and submitted that it was the company viasat broadcasting uk ltd, whose seat was in the united kingdom, which was responsible for the programme service and decided on the final content of the programmes. on 20 march 2009 the court of appeal (svea hovrätt) upheld the district court’s decision. it further stated that the burden of proof concerning the applicability of the constitutional law rested on the applicant and that he had not, in response to x’s refutation, established that the decisions concerning the programme content were taken in sweden. consequently, chapters 1-9 of the constitutional law were not applicable in the case. in the present case, the harmful event had occurred in sweden and the applicant thus should have had the right to bring his action before the swedish courts. on 21 september 2009 the supreme court rejected the applicant’s referral request and refused leave to appeal in the case. it held that, since the district court had found itself competent to examine the applicant’s claims in so far as they were based on grounds other than the constitutional law, there was no reason to request a preliminary ruling from the ecj. he was convicted of aggravated fraud as well as tax and bookkeeping offences and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. the criminal proceedings were finalised by a supreme court decision to refuse leave to appeal on 4 october 2010.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in mežica. on 22 august 2003 the applicant brought criminal charges (“criminal action”) for defamation against a.š., thus undertaking criminal prosecution as private prosecutor. along with the criminal action, the applicant made a motion to be awarded compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss arising from the commission of the criminal offence in question. on 16 november 2006 the ljubljana district court handed down its judgment and found a.š. guilty of the criminal offence of defamation, giving him a suspended sentence of one month in prison and ordering him to pay the costs of the proceedings. in respect of the applicant’s claim for compensation, the district court held that the claim was unsubstantiated and directed the applicant to seek compensation in civil proceedings. both parties appealed against the judgment before the ljubljana higher court. in particular, the applicant alleged that there had been a violation of the criminal code and that the punishment imposed on a.š. he also complained about the fact that the first-instance court had not ruled on his claim for compensation, despite the fact that there had allegedly been enough material in the case file to enable it to rule on the matter. on 11 march 2008 the ljubljana higher court granted the applicant’s appeal in respect of the punishment and increased it to three months of suspended sentence. however, it dismissed the complaint concerning the applicant’s unsuccessful claim for compensation, confirming the lower court’s view that it had not been substantiated. the applicant did not institute separate civil proceedings for compensation. lodged with the supreme court a request for the protection of legality (an extraordinary legal remedy whereby to challenge the procedural and substantive legality of final decisions), alleging an incorrect application of the criminal procedure act. in particular, he alleged that the applicant’s criminal action had been brought out of time. had lodged a request for the protection of legality; however, the notification did not include a copy of the said request for the protection of legality. in that response, the supreme state prosecutor agreed that the criminal action had been brought out of time. however, neither the applicant nor his representative were served with that response; nor were they ever served with the request for the protection of legality. on 28 august 2008 the supreme court, without having informed the parties of the date of the deliberation session, deliberated in private and upheld the request for the protection of legality, dismissing the applicant’s action as having been lodged out of time. further, it ordered the applicant to pay the costs of proceedings including the costs and attorney’s fees incurred by a.š. and a lump sum covering court fees of 600 euros (eur). not being aware that the request for the protection of legality had already been decided, on 3 september 2008 the applicant’s representative requested the relevant documentation from the ljubljana district court. on 5 september 2008 the ljubljana district court informed the applicant’s representative that the case-file documents had been with the supreme court since 30 june 2008. on 12 september 2008 the supreme court informed the applicant’s representative that a.š. had lodged a request for the protection of legality which had been upheld on 28 august 2008. on 22 september 2008 the supreme court’s judgment was served on the applicant’s representative. on 20 november 2008 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint. he also alleged violations of the convention, citing articles 6 and 14 and article 1 of protocol no. 1, the latter in respect of the fact that he had been ordered to pay the opposite party’s costs of the proceedings. on 5 january 2009 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s complaint.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in buivydiškės, vilnius region. in 1991 the lithuanian parliament enacted the law on land reform which provided that residents of rural areas had the right to acquire land for individual farming (asmeninio ūkio žemė) from the state, in accordance with the requirements set out in the relevant legal instruments (see “relevant domestic law” below). it indicated the amount of land to which each listed individual was entitled but did not specify actual plots. on 20 june 1995 the convention entered into force in respect of lithuania. however, as submitted by the applicant and not disputed by the government, the applicant had not been using this land since no land had been provided to her at that time. it ordered matininkai to amend the delimitation and allocation of plots accordingly and to prepare all the necessary documents by 15 october 2002. in july 2002, april 2004, april and november 2006 and february 2007 the applicant and her husband petitioned the vca and the national land service (hereinafter “the nls”), stating that they had still not received the land to which they were entitled, and requesting that such land be provided to them without further delay. they were informed that the preparation of the land allocation plan in the area was ongoing. on 13 october 2006 the vilnius regional administrative court dismissed the claim. in may and june 2007 the bailiff in charge of the enforcement of the supreme administrative court’s judgment submitted several notices to the vca, urging it to enforce the judgment immediately. on 5 june 2007 the vca approved an amended land allocation plan of the buivydiškės cadastral area. on 26 july 2007 the vca informed the applicant that it had instructed arlitanus to identify a specific plot of two hectares for the applicant from the stock of available state land by 1 august 2007. in august 2007 the applicant asked the supreme administrative court to clarify its judgment of 5 may 2007 and to set a concrete deadline for the vca to enforce it. in august 2008 the applicant asked the vca to inform her whether the supreme administrative court’s judgment of 30 may 2008 had been enforced. the applicant was not included on that list. the list indicated that the applicant had been assigned two hectares of land and that she had not been using them. in december 2008 the vca informed the applicant and her husband that the land allocation plan of the buivydiškės cadastral area was again being amended, and that the list of candidates to receive land in that territory would be compiled after the completion of the planning when the available land has been identified. however, in december 2009 the vilnius regional court annulled the first-instance decision, noting that the vca had already included the applicant on the list of candidates to receive a plot of land (see paragraph 36 below), which meant that the judgment of the supreme administrative court had been partly enforced and thus there were no grounds to order a fine. the applicant appealed against the bailiff’s decision and in march 2011 the vilnius city first district court allowed the appeal and ordered the bailiff to continue the enforcement. in july 2010, after an administrative reform, the vca was abolished and its obligations were transferred to the nls. the list indicated that the applicant had been assigned the four plots of land offered to her on 20 may 2013 (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above). in april 2015 the state land fund identified that one of the four plots assigned to the applicant included 0.55 hectares of forestland. as a result, that part of the plot could not be transferred to the applicant and had to be returned to the state. in june 2015 the nls amended the land allocation plan for the eldership of zujūnai, indicating that the total area which had been allocated to the applicant amounted to 1.45 hectares. in july 2007 the applicant and her husband submitted a complaint against the vca to the vilnius regional commission of administrative disputes (hereinafter – “the commission”). the commission partly upheld the complaint and ordered the vca to respond within five days to two requests submitted in june 2007. the applicant’s husband also complained that he and the applicant still had not been included on the list of candidates to receive land in the buivydiškės cadastral area and that the land in that territory was being distributed to candidates of lower priority ranks. that same month a group of residents of buivydiškės, including the applicant’s husband, submitted a complaint to the parliamentary subcommittee on the rule of law, complaining about the actions of the vca in the implementation of the land reform. the applicant and her husband appealed against that decision. in june 2009 the district prosecutor decided to discontinue the criminal investigation against the vca on the grounds that no crime had been committed.

the applicant was born in 1955 and lives in hamburg. the applicant is a civil servant working as a lawyer for the hamburg tax authorities. in this capacity he opened a bank account for the association. the account was used for the deposit of donations and membership fees. in 2000 the applicant left the board of the association. in 2003, a third person reported to the police that he had bought a watch via ebay. the “red aid” association had protested against the payment, which had been returned on 27 november 2003. he explained, convincingly, that he had nothing to do with the email address “sternschnuppe756” or the bank account of the “red aid” association. on 21 september 2004, upon a request of the prosecutor’s office of munich i, the munich district court issued a search warrant in respect of the applicant’s home (and the home of three other members of the “red aid” association who were authorised to draw on the association’s bank account) on suspicion that they had committed “copyright piracy” by selling fake goods such as watches and computer programmes. the search warrant authorised the search and seizure of computers and documents containing information about the sale of the fake watch and the computer programmes. on 8 december 2004 the applicant’s (shared) flat in hamburg was searched. the police found none of the items they were searching for. the amount and quality of the hashish was asserted by an expert. the amount was enough for 2606 consumption units. the munich district court and the munich i regional court dismissed the complaint. first proceedings before the federal constitutional court challenging the lawfulness of the search warrant and the house search 11. on 13 november 2005 the federal constitutional court held that the complaint was manifestly well-founded, found a violation of article 13 of the basic law, declared the house search unlawful and quashed the search warrant and the decisions of the district and the regional court. on 24 january 2006 the hamburg district court convicted the applicant of possession of a substantial amount of drugs in less serious circumstances and imposed a ten months’ suspended prison sentence. as he lived in a shared flat, the room, and hence the drugs, could have belonged to any of his flatmates. with regard to the admissibility of the evidence the court of appeal found that the hashish found during the search could be used as evidence against the applicant. whether or not the search warrant had been sufficiently precise, and whether a sufficient initial suspicion for issuing a search warrant had been present or not, did not have to be determined because, even assuming that this had not been the case, such shortcomings did not render the obtained evidence unlawful. on 27 december 2006 the federal constitutional court rejected the complaint as inadmissible. in the resumed proceedings before the hamburg district court, the applicant made a statement that the room in which the hashish had been found was exclusively used by him. the court weighed the public interest in prosecuting the crime of possession of drugs against the applicant’s interest in respect for his home. hence, the applicant’s right to respect for his home had been infringed in such a severe way that despite the seriousness of the crime of drug possession and the substantial amount of hashish found, the public interest in prosecution could not outweigh the applicant’s interest in respect for his home. furthermore, the regional court was of the view that the court of appeal’s findings in its judgment of 5 september 2006 (see paragraph 15 above) on the admissibility of the hashish as the sole evidence were binding and that hence the hashish found in the applicant’s flat could be used as evidence against him. on 2 july 2009 the federal constitutional court dismissed the complaint (file no. the decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 3 august 2009. hence the applicant’s constitutional rights had not been violated. following the conviction of the applicant by the criminal courts, the competent authorities formally noted that the applicant had committed a disciplinary offence and discontinued the proceedings as the offence had not been of a kind or degree demanding disciplinary measures.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in suceava. at the relevant time, he was a journalist for a local newspaper monitorul de suceava (hereafter “the newspaper”). the article, accompanied by a photograph of s.a., as he has fled in order to avoid criminal investigation for the offence of aggravated theft, a general search has now been launched by the police (a fost dat în urmărire generală) and his photograph is now on the desk of the policemen of the judicial service [biroul judiciar] throughout the country. aged 35, is suspected of being one of the organisers of the burglary of the local headquarters of the governing party committed at the end of last year. the night before christmas eve 2002 was marked by bad luck for the psd in suceava, as thieves visited their headquarters. on the morning of 24 december some of the members of this party arrived at the headquarters located in the centre of suceava ... [and] noticed that the headquarters had been ravaged. after checking inside, they realised there had been a burglary and that the thieves had stolen two televisions and approximately rol 17,000,000. while searching for valuables, the thieves vandalised the offices, breaking all the doors, and yanking the televisions from the electric sockets. who has been missing from his place of residence since that date. see photo) fled in order to avoid criminal investigation for the offence of aggravated theft and so a general search has been instituted and his photograph has been sent to judicial service police officers throughout the country. if the person is not found within ninety days, the police launch a national search. following the publication of the article, the father of s.a. found out from your newspaper that there was a national and local search order for my son, a.s., regarding the [content of the] article, i can tell you that [at the time] my son was neither in the country nor in suceava county as he was in italy. the employees of the suceava county police inspectorate promptly informed me that there had been a mistake and that the general search for my son had been called off. the document confirming this information is available to the public from the suceava judicial service. my wish would be to have the article retracted.” this letter was published in the newspaper on 29 august 2003. the letter was published unedited, but nothing else was done since then. considered that the article contained serious allegations which considerably affected his public image, causing him personal suffering. he therefore requested that those responsible be convicted and ordered to pay him non-pecuniary damages in the amount of rol 100,000,000. he further argued that he did publish a retraction in the newspaper, namely the letter of s.a. on 17 october 2003, the head of the police department of suceava informed the first-instance court that:
“in response to your letter in which you enquire whether on 25 august 2003 a general search order was outstanding against s.a. ... i wish to inform you that on 31 december 2002 by order no. 124000 of the general inspectorate of the romanian police a general search order was issued in respect of this person as he was attempting to avoid criminal investigation while under suspicion of theft. the relevant excerpts from the judgment read as follows:
“taking into account the fact that the applicant obtained information concerning the suspect from the judicial office within the general police inspectorate, he cannot be found to have deliberately (mens rea) defamed the plaintiff ...
under the civil limb of the action, defamation concerns public communication of a distorted, negative image of a person, which is likely to cause him or her personal suffering and damage to reputation, leading to changes such as social embarrassment and injury to self-esteem. the first-instance court considers that publishing the article in the newspaper caused damage to the standing of the civil party ...
moreover, it must be noted that although the civil party’s father notified the newspaper that the facts published about his son were false, the newspaper did not publish a retraction of the article written by the defendant.” this is because following the discovery of the error he did not publish a retraction in order to try to rectify it. the article caused non-pecuniary damage to the civil party which can be repaired only in the manner established by the first-instance court”.
the applicants were employed by hk komgrap ad komgrap-makiš doo, a company based in belgrade (hereinafter “the debtor”). at the relevant time, the company was predominantly socially-owned. since the debtor had failed to fulfil its obligations towards its employees, the applicants brought a civil claim seeking payment of salary arrears and various social security contributions. on 23 june 2003 the belgrade second municipal court (drugi opštinski sud u beogradu) ordered the debtor to pay to the applicants certain sums in respect of salary arrears and various social security contributions. this judgment became final and enforceable on 25 july 2005. on 26 september 2005 the applicants applied to the belgrade fourth municipal court (četvrti opštinski sud u beogradu) for enforcement of the judgment of 23 june 2003. on 18 january 2006 the said court ordered the enforcement of the judgment and awarded the applicants the costs incurred in the enforcement proceedings. the government maintained that the debtor had been sold in 2007 to a private company. the applicants disagreed and claimed that it was, in fact, a different company that had been privatised in 2007. the government submitted that bankruptcy proceedings had been instituted in respect of the debtor on 22 july 2010 and had been terminated on 10 june 2013. the applicants disagreed and claimed that it was, in fact, a different company that went into bankruptcy in 2013. in their additional observations the government submitted that bankruptcy proceedings had been instituted in respect of the debtor on 24 july 2013 and had been terminated on 8 november 2013 when the decision to institute bankruptcy proceedings had been quashed. on 27 october 2010 the applicants lodged a constitutional appeal, seeking redress for the non-enforcement of the judgment in question. on 27 november 2013 the constitutional court held that the applicants had suffered a breach of the “right to a trial within a reasonable time” with regard to the enforcement proceedings. the court, however, did not award them compensation for non-pecuniary damage, finding that only the period after the applicants had continued the enforcement proceedings following the death of their relatives (on 9 july 2013 and 15 may 2013, respectively) could be taken into account. on 27 november 2013 the constitutional court held that the applicants had suffered a breach of the “right to a trial within a reasonable time” with regard to the enforcement proceedings. the court ordered the acceleration of the proceedings and declared that the applicants were entitled to compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered in the amount of eur 800 each, converted into the national currency at the rate applicable at the date of settlement. the constitutional court held that since the enforcement proceedings in question had not yet been completed, the constitutional appeals were premature in so far as they concerned pecuniary damage, and dismissed the appeals in that regard.

the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in chisinau. in january 2008 the balti police organised an undercover operation with the purpose of apprehending a criminal group specialised in the production and circulation of forged documents. for that purpose an advertisement was placed in a local newspaper specialised in advertising, stating as follows: “need help with obtaining passport (romanian-bulgarian)” followed by a telephone number. according to the applicant, at that time he was interested in leaving moldova for romania or another country in the european union in order to find a job. he was therefore interested in obtaining a romanian passport which would facilitate his plans. both men agreed to let each other know in the event that one of them found an easy way of obtaining a romanian passport. both d. and z. confirmed during the subsequent court proceedings that it was d. who had recommended z. to the applicant in march 2008. it appears from the materials of the case-file that approximately three weeks after the applicant’s first meeting with e., the latter called him to find out whether he had progressed in his search for a way of obtaining a romanian passport. this was submitted by the applicant in the proceedings and not contested by the prosecution. the applicant informed e. that he had found a person, z., who could help in exchange for eur 1,500 and proposed to put e. in contact with z. however, e. refused to get into direct contact with z. and informed the applicant that he did not have the money at the time. he also told the applicant that he had an acquaintance t. who was also interested in obtaining a romanian passport and proposed a deal to the applicant. in particular, he proposed to him to act as an intermediary between z. and t. and tell t. that the price was eur 2,300. the applicant accepted e.’s proposal and agreed to arrange a meeting with t. 10. the applicant then discussed the matter with z., who gave him a list of documents necessary for t.’s new romanian identity card. the applicant submitted during the proceedings that he had been convinced at the time that the identity card was not going to be forged and that z. would only act as a representative of t. before the romanian authorities. on 3 april 2008 the applicant met with t. and obtained from him the necessary documents and an advance of eur 750 for which he had written and submitted to t. a receipt. he then transmitted the money and the documents to z. the identity card was later produced in the united kingdom and reached z. and then the applicant by the middle of april 2008. on 16 april 2008 the applicant met with t. and gave him the identity card in exchange for the rest of the money. on 17 april 2008 an official criminal investigation was initiated against the applicant on charges of manufacturing and trading with forged official documents. in the meantime, z. signed an agreement with the prosecutors acknowledging his guilt and was convicted on the basis of that agreement and given a suspended sentence of four years. on 17 december 2008 the balti district court found the applicant guilty of participating in the production of a false romanian identity card and of selling it to t. the court sentenced him to a criminal fine of some eur 200. the judgment did not make any mention of the applicant’s assertion concerning incitement. the applicant lodged an appeal in which he submitted inter alia that the first instance court had not paid attention to the fact that the offence had been committed as a result of police incitement and that the court had refused to hear the persons who had entrapped him. during the appeal proceedings, the applicant asked again that e. and t. be heard in court. initially the court of appeal agreed to hear them; however, later it decided otherwise. on 4 march 2009 the balti court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and confirmed the judgment of the first instance court. in so far as the issue concerning the hearing of e. and t. was concerned, the court considered that that was not important as their statements had not been used against the applicant. moreover, according to the law, they could not be heard unless they agreed to that. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law and submitted the same arguments as in his appeal. on 8 july 2009 the supreme court of justice dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law and upheld the previous judgments.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in shadrinsk. on 20 august 2003 the shadrinsk town court of the kurgan region convicted him of murder and sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment. on 29 october 2003 the kurgan regional court upheld the conviction on appeal. the applicant is hiv-positive and at the material time also suffered from tuberculosis and hepatitis. on 25 december 2008 the applicant was transferred to the liu of‑73/3 medical facility (лечебно-исправительное учреждение) in the kurgan region and was detained in the following wards:
(a)  quarantine ward 24 from 25 to 30 december 2008 and from 18 to 30 june 2009;
(b)  ward 25 from 30 december 2008 to 28 may 2009 and from 30 june to 21 september 2009; and
(c)  ward 26 from 21 september to 3 november 2009. according to the applicant, the wards were severely overcrowded. for instance, ward 25 measured approximately 80 square metres, was equipped with fifteen two-tier bunk beds and housed twenty-seven inmates. passages between the beds, lengthwise, were as narrow as fifty centimetres and were used by four inmates. the wards were poorly lit as the windows were covered with louvre shutters blocking access to natural light. according to the government, ward 24 measured 61.49 square metres, had sixteen sleeping places and accommodated up to sixteen inmates. ward 25 measured 67.5 square metres, was equipped with thirteen two-tier bunk beds and housed up to twenty-six inmates. finally, ward 28 measured 49.4 square metres and accommodated fifteen inmates. the applicant was provided with an individual sleeping place at all times. in support of their submissions, the government provided original floor plans and ward population registers containing information about the exact number of inmates in each ward for the whole period the applicant was in the liu of-73/3 facility. they also submitted a prosecutor’s report dated 11 october 2010 regarding the conditions there. it indicated, in particular, that windows in all wards were fitted with metal louvre shutters. on 9 february 2009 the medical facility authorities issued an order introducing visiting fees for inmates and their families. the calculation table annexed to the order specified that a fee of 320 russian roubles (approximately 9 euros) per day per person would be payable, covering maintenance charges, prison staff salaries, the depreciation of visiting room equipment, bed linen and cleaning products. on 14 april 2009 the director of the federal service for the execution of sentences sent a letter to the heads of russian penal facilities, reminding them that charging visitors and detainees for family visits was in breach of article 89 of the code on the execution of sentences (see paragraph 17 below) and that facility administrations must bear the costs of providing rooms for long-term visits. only additional services are payable by detainees in accordance with the internal regulations of correctional facilities (see paragraph 20 below). on 22 april 2009 the applicant was authorised to see his two daughters on a long-term family visit. he calculated that a three-day visit from them would cost rub 1,920, which was far beyond their means. his daughters did visit him, but stayed only one day instead of the expected three, as they did not have enough money on them to stay any longer. on 22 august 2009 the applicant’s daughters visited their father again, this time free of charge. on 29 april 2010 the applicant received a letter from the court dated 19 march 2010 in the correspondence department of the of-73/2 correctional facility, to which he had been transferred in february 2010. it was handed over to him in an open envelope and he was told to sign a copy which had been attached to his personal file.

the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in chișinău. the applicant’s diagnosis was, inter alia, personality disorder. while in the corridor the detainees were ordered to stand with their faces to the wall. the search lasted for approximately half an hour. one prison officer recorded the events on video. the detainees were then ordered back into the cell. according to the applicant, when he saw their possessions, including food brought to them by their relatives, medication and documents, scattered on the floor and in total disorder, he declared that he would return to the cell only after a prosecutor or a representative of the prison administration had made a report on the search and the disorder caused. his reading glasses fell to the ground and were smashed by one of the masked men. the government submitted that no force had been used and that the cell had been left in good order. further forensic examinations were carried out on 1 and 28 december 2006 and 3 may 2007. according to the government, a further forensic examination carried out on 31 october 2007 contradicted the results of the previous ones, finding no conclusive evidence that the applicant had had a broken bone. the parties did not submit full copies of the last three reports mentioned above. on 8 december 2006 a prosecutor from the chișinău prosecutor’s office started a criminal investigation into the applicant’s allegations. 20 had confirmed, in their complaints and statements made to the investigator during the criminal investigation, that the masked men who had entered the cell on 28 october 2006 had caused great disorder, had insulted the detainees, and had hit them with rubber truncheons. according to the statement of detainee s.b., they were then moved back to their cell, again by force. witnessed one of the masked officers slamming the cell door and crushing the applicant’s foot, threatening to break his hands if he continued to write complaints. submitted that the filming was selective, not showing the acts of violence in order to shield those who had carried them out from responsibility. moreover, the various parts of the film were clearly not in chronological order. 13, stated that after the search on 28 october 2006 he saw disorder in cell no. 20, but did not see any food on the ground. later on the applicant complained of pain in his foot and was taken to the emergency hospital, from which he returned with his foot in plaster. he was then taken to hospital by ambulance and returned with his foot in plaster. 13, on 28 october 2006 he was informed that someone was asking for medical assistance in cell no. 13, on 28 october 2006 at 5 p.m he saw the applicant, who complained that he had been beaten up earlier, during the search. he had not witnessed any disorder or violence towards the detainees. who coordinated the actions of the various groups of prison staff and the pantera special forces regiment (the masked men), declared that after the search their teams did not report having used force on anyone or having had any exceptional situation to deal with. the last scene showed the cell door being closed. the prosecutor found that the video recording did not prove that violence had been used, and that the sound of the cell door being struck, heard at the end of the recording, allowed the supposition that the injury to the applicant’s foot could have been self-inflicted. by a final decision of 12 august 2008 an investigating judge of the buiucani district court upheld the decision of 17 april 2008.
mr gerardo menéndez garcía (“the first applicant”) was born in 1964 and lives in gargantada (langreo). mr sigifredo álvarez gonzález (“the second applicant”) was born in 1956 and lives in sant jordi de cercs (barcelona). on 2000 the applicants acted as intermediary (purchase agent) in the sale of three cars, sold to a company. as a result of this sale, on 20 november 2000 criminal investigations were instituted by the gijón no. 1 investigating judge against the applicants and other eight suspects for fraud and forgery of documents. on 16 april 2001 and 18 april 2001, respectively, the applicants were detained, charged with document forgery and informed about the rights they were entitled as detainees. they were subsequently interrogated by the guardia civil in the presence of their lawyer. on 8 november 2004 the judge issued a decision (auto) ordering the initiation of oral proceedings (apertura de juicio oral) and set the complete file to the asturias audiencia provincial. on 6 may 2009 the hearings before the asturias audiencia provincial took place. on 5 june 2009 the asturias audiencia provincial sentenced the first applicant to a three years and six months’ imprisonment, and the second applicant to a five years’ imprisonment for fraud and document forgery. the asturias audiencia provincial refused the applicants’ request to reduce the sentence in view of the undue delay of proceedings, as prescribed in article 21 of the criminal code. the asturias audiencia provincial acknowledged that the proceedings had been “unusually” long, but this was due to the complexity of the case, namely the difficulties in gathering evidences within different jurisdictions, the great number of parties involved, the difficulty faced when trying to notify some of the defendants, as well as the applicants’ conduct, whose lawyers had lacked celerity in presenting their submissions. the applicants lodged a cassation appeal before the supreme court. on 27 may 2010 the supreme court partially ruled in favour of the applicants and sentenced them both to three years and eight months’ imprisonment for fraud. however, the supreme court rejected the claims of undue delay of proceedings. the supreme court considered that even though the proceedings might have appeared excessively long, the asturias audiencia provincial had provided a sounded and detailed justification for the duration of the proceedings. both applicants lodged an amparo appeal with the constitutional court complaining, inter alia, about the undue length of the proceedings. by two decisions of 20 may 2011 and 12 september 2011, respectively (served on 25 may 2011 and 23 september 2011), the constitutional court declared both appeals inadmissible on the grounds that they lacked the constitutional relevance provided for in article 50 § 1 b) of the organic law on the constitutional court.

from 1996 onwards the applicant, a former police officer discharged for health reasons, enjoyed disability benefits under the labour disablement insurance act (wet op de arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering – “wao”). this he did by running a one-man business as a trainer teaching people how to deal with stress. he alleges that mr g. gave him the assurance that he would be permitted for a period of five years to earn income over and above the sum of nlg 60,000, the purpose being to allow him to create cash reserves in case his health should deteriorate further. the agreement had been witnessed by another official, one mr s. 7. the applicant states that he never received any reply. in september 1999 the applicant’s business was transformed into a limited liability company. the applicant was its managing director and its only employee; he entered its employ on 1 october 1999. on 3 september 2003 mr d., an official of the social-security authority (by this time re-named employee insurances schemes implementing body (uitvoeringsinstituut werknemersverzekeringen; “uwv”)) submitted an extensive investigation report implicating the applicant and his wife in suspected social-security fraud. on 28 january 2004 uwv gave a decision reducing the applicant’s wao benefits with retroactive effect. on 3 march 2004 uwv gave a second decision ordering the applicant to repay the excess. the applicant lodged objections (bezwaar) against both decisions. as relevant to the case before the court, the applicant argued that as from 1999 he had kept the competent authorities informed of developments as they occurred, withholding no information, and invoked the arrangement which he had agreed with mr g. he named mr s. as a witness. having held a hearing on 11 january 2006, uwv gave a decision on 31 january 2006 dismissing the applicant’s objections. he also submitted that mr g. had acted within his competence in making the agreement alleged. having held a hearing on 30 august 2006, the regional court gave judgment on 21 november 2006 dismissing the applicant’s appeal. its reasoning included the following:
“the [applicant] has also stated that [uwv] officials had agreed with him that he would be permitted to earn unlimited income in addition to his wao benefits for a period of five years. on the contrary, it appears from the labour expert mr g.’s report of 26 october 1998 that the [applicant’s] income did in fact have to be taken into account. but even without this letter it ought in reason to have been clear to the [applicant] that income can have an effect on the benefits. he asked for them both to be heard as a witness in order to prove the existence of the agreement. he did not, however, himself summon mr g. and mr s. as witnesses by registered letter or bailiff’s writ. the central appeals tribunal held a hearing on 8 august 2008. the applicant did not bring mr g. and mr s. along but restated his request to have them heard as witnesses. the applicant and uwv waived the right to a further hearing. the central appeals tribunal gave judgment on 30 january 2009 dismissing the further appeal without having heard any witnesses. in response to a question by the court, the applicant acknowledged that he had made no attempt to summon mr g. and mr s. himself or bring them along to the hearing of either the regional court or the central appeals tribunal, as permitted by section 8:60(4) of the general administrative law act (algemene wet bestuursrecht; see paragraph 25 below). in parallel with the administrative proceedings outlined above, the applicant was prosecuted for social security fraud and forgery. on 20 january 2006 the single-judge chamber of the criminal division (politierechter) of the roermond regional court convicted the applicant. the suspect understood these arrangements in the sense that he would in principle be allowed to earn unlimited additional income without losing his benefits. to this end he got in touch with uszo on multiple occasions by means of letters. these letters were answered by uszo with automatised standard letters which did not address the specific situation in which the suspect found himself and which the suspect himself had raised with uszo.
the applicant was born in 1997 and lives in deva. were about the same age as the applicant. who was under fourteen and hence not criminally liable. who insistently told him to have sex with the applicant. on 11 march 2009 a forensic report found that no traces of violence had been detected on the applicant’s body. he further stated that it was she who had come to him and had asked him to have sex with her the first time, in august or september 2008. the applicant declared before the police that she had been forced by j.v. to have sex with him on several occasions, alleging that he had threatened that he would beat her if she told anyone. the other boys had also forced her to have sex with them, telling her that it was j.v. on 22 april 2009 the deva police sent the file to the prosecutor’s office of the hunedoara county court in order to pursue the investigation into rape. she has a vivid memory of the events. ... the report concluded that the applicant had difficulties in foreseeing the consequences of her actions and had insufficient discernment due to her age. declared that he had had sex with the applicant in the autumn of 2008. declared that he had had sex with the applicant once in april and then again in october 2008. he further mentioned that he had used a condom that he had in his pocket. and that they had never seen him taking the applicant by force while they were playing. for the crime of sexual intercourse with a minor on repeated occasions. were given administrative fines for the same crime. from the statements of the perpetrators and the two sisters, the prosecutor held as proved the fact that the applicant had gone to the neighbours’ house scantily dressed and had had a sexual relationship with j.v. was rejected by the superior prosecutor and subsequently by the courts. was found guilty by the deva district court of sexual intercourse with a minor and was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. she submitted to the file a copy of a judgment issued on 10 november 2009 by the bacău court of appeal which held that a girl aged ten years and eight months could not understand what a sexual act meant sufficiently well to give her consent to it. had forced her to have sex with him and had threatened to beat her if she told anyone. she was afraid of him because he could become violent when he was drunk. at the time when the accused had sexual intercourse with the victim, she was eleven years old. and upheld with final effect the judgment of the deva district court of 20 april 2010. as well as the account of the events given by the other perpetrators. based on these testimonies and the fact that the victim had not told her parents about the alleged abuse, the court drew the conclusion that the instances of sexual intercourse had always been initiated by the applicant and dismissed the theory that the victim might have lacked capacity to express her will. the findings of the forensic psychiatric report of 7 july 2009 were not mentioned or discussed in any way by the court. on the other hand, the crime of sexual intercourse with a minor, as provided by article 198 of the criminal code, means engaging in a sexual intercourse with a minor under 15, but with the minor’s consent. ...
between 2005 and 2006 the applicants successfully sued the authorities for miscalculating social benefits. on various dates the supervisory review courts quashed the judgments delivered in the applicants’ favour after applications by the defendant authorities, considering that the lower courts had misapplied substantive or procedural law (for more details see the appendix). on 3 july 1986 the applicant was sentenced to three and a half years’ imprisonment. on an unspecified date the applicant lodged an application with the sovetskiy district court, claiming 3,973,578 russian roubles (rub) in compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage on the grounds of wrongful prosecution. on 24 may 1999 the sovetskiy district court allowed the applicant’s claim in part, awarding him rub 43,568 in compensation for unpaid salary, the confiscation of his car, and judicial costs and expenses. on an unspecified date the applicant brought a similar set of proceedings against the ministry of finance, claiming compensation for wrongful prosecution in 1997. on 27 july 2006 the leninskiy district court granted the applicant’s claim in full and awarded him rub 761,815 in compensation for unpaid salary; the confiscation of his car and other property; rent for his flat; travel expenses; and judicial costs and expenses. no appeal against the judgment was lodged and it became final. on 1 february 2007 the presidium of the rostov regional court quashed that judgment by way of supervisory review on the grounds that the same issue had already been decided by the judgment of 24 may 1999 and that there had been no grounds to examine the complaint a second time.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in london. the applicant and his wife divorced on 27 august 2004. his legal aid certificate was withdrawn following a financial award made as part of the divorce. meanwhile the contact proceedings continued. on 23 february 2005 woolwich county court granted the applicant’s former wife an injunction which inter alia prevented him from using or threatening violence towards her. on 6 july 2005 the applicant’s former wife issued an application for him to be committed to prison for breach of the undertaking and injunction. he heard the applications on 26 and 27 july 2005. his position as regards legal aid was due to be reviewed shortly after the hearing. on 27 july 2005 the judge made an order for indirect contact. he subsequently obtained legal aid and legal representation to pursue those proceedings. on 23 march 2007 the court of appeal quashed both the finding of contempt and the sentence imposed. it found that the county court’s errors of procedure were grave ones. such proceedings concerned a “criminal charge” for the purpose of article 6 of the convention and the defendant therefore benefited from the right to legal assistance set out in article 6 § 3 (c). in particular, he did not ask anything as to the circumstances in which he was unrepresented. he was of the view that the judge had been obliged to ask appropriate questions and to consider, at the very outset of the hearing, whether there should be an adjournment so as to enable the defendant to be represented. moses lj further found that the decision to hear the application for committal at the same time as the application for contact led to inescapable errors in procedure. the applicant should have been warned that he did not need to give evidence; he received no such warning. he noted that the judge never paused, even at that stage, to consider whether the applicant should have legal representation or to remind himself of the relevant principles. even in a case where a defendant admitted every breach alleged, representation would be needed so as to assist the judge in considering the appropriate disposal. there was ample material to suggest that legal representation would have made a difference. there are, of course, many cases in the books in which this court has upheld committal orders even although they have been made in proceedings which were procedurally flawed ... provided the contemnor has had a fair trial and the order has been made on valid grounds, the existence of a defect in the committal application or in the order served will not result in it being set aside except in so far as the interests of justice require that to be done ... 36. he sought an extension of time for lodging his claim. on 25 february 2009 the high court dismissed his claim and refused the extension of time. the applicant’s claim accordingly failed. 25277/94 and others, 12 october 1999 and lloyd and others v. the united kingdom, nos. blake j concluded that the applicant’s detention pursuant to the order of judge collins was not so gross or obvious an irregularity, within the meaning of § 115 of the court’s judgment in lloyd and others, cited above, as to be not in accordance with the law. having thus concluded, blake j explained that, had he reached the contrary conclusion, it would have been necessary to consider what the causal nexus between the unfairness and the detention resulting from the unfairness was. however, whilst custody was the more probable outcome, the length of sentence would have been significantly shorter and approximately fourteen days, so the applicant would not have served six weeks in prison. he indicated that, had a violation of article 5 been established, he would have awarded damages in the sum of gbp 6,000, on an equitable basis. the applicant sought leave to appeal out of time.
the applicants were born in 1985 and live in vanadzor and gyumri, armenia. who had been found dead in a nearby canal on 9 and 10 january 2004. the questioning was carried out by investigators a.h. was also present for part of the questioning. they were kept in various rooms and cells at different law enforcement agencies and were neither fed nor allowed to sleep. during the questioning, the second applicant confessed that it was he and the other two applicants who had committed the murders. on 11 may 2004 the second applicant addressed a letter to the military prosecutor of armenia in which he retracted his confession, claiming that he and the other two applicants had nothing to do with the murder. the second applicant requested that he be questioned again. in reply to the investigator’s question about why he had made a false confession, he replied that when he had told the truth the investigators refused to believe him. by letter of 19 may 2004 investigator a.h. and requesting that he be removed from the case. following his complaint of 11 may 2004 he had been additionally questioned upon his request and stated that he had not been forced to make any statements. and one tall police officer from the stepanakert police department. the following record was made in the first applicant’s medical file:
“since 11 august 2004 the patient has been on hunger strike and under constant medical observation ...” 68. by a letter of the same date the investigator informed the chief of nubarashen pre-trial detention facility about this and added that the first applicant’s detention period was suspended pursuant to article 138 § 3 of the ccp. by a letter of 21 october 2004 the deputy chief of the hospital for prisoners informed the lawyer that no visceral illnesses had been disclosed following the first applicant’s objective inpatient examination, clinical and biochemical analyses of his blood and urine, and a number of instrumental examinations. upon his instructions the second applicant had been brought from the military outpost to the military unit, since it was necessary to find out where and with whom he had eaten the food contained in the parcel received from his parents. chiefs of the third and fourth battalions e.m. on an unspecified date, the proceedings commenced in the criminal and military court of appeal. submitted that the applicants had been admitted to the arrest facility when he was on duty. by a letter of 26 december 2005 the general prosecutor’s office informed the applicants that, during the court examination of the criminal case against them, the syunik regional court, guided by article 17 § 4 of the ccp, had taken the necessary measures to verify the statements alleging that they had been subjected by the investigators to coercion during the investigation, and found them to be unsubstantiated in its judgment of 18 may 2005. as regards the question of the applicants’ deprivation of liberty and their allegations of ill-treatment, the court of cassation stated:
“it follows from the materials of the case that [the applicants] were detained on 24 april 2004. on 6 february 2007 the investigation into the applicants’ criminal case was assigned to another investigator of the military prosecutor’s office, v.s. an investigator of the gugark garrison military prosecutor’s office of armenia, s.g., military police officer m. stated that he had been absent from the stepanakert military police department during the period when the applicants were taken there and he had never encountered them. added that the second applicant did not raise his allegations of ill-treatment until 15 days later when they met in private at the military police arrest facility. lawyers were assigned to them and they were detained by a court decision of 27 april 2004. on 25 october 2007 the applicants lodged an appeal against this decision. for more than four years they had consistently raised their allegations of ill-treatment and indicated the names of the perpetrators but no effective investigation had ever been carried out. according to the applicants, a number of former servicemen of their military unit and also a few civilians testified during the trial that they had been locked up during various periods at the beginning of 2004 at the martakert garrison military prosecutor’s office and the stepanakert military police department and questioned in connection with the murders. it appears that no appeals were lodged against this judgment.

the applicant was born in 1972 and is currently serving a sentence in prison no. on 9 august 2001 criminal proceedings were instituted in yevpatoriya in connection with a murder and attempted murder committed in the course of an armed robbery (“the murder proceedings”). he submitted that he had presented himself to the police voluntarily once he had become aware that he was wanted. on the same day, he drafted a “statement of voluntary surrender” (явка з повинною) in which he confessed to committing, as part of a criminal group, a number of armed robberies on the kharkiv-dnipropetrovsk-simferopol road, as well as one in the town of yevpatoriya. he stated that, in the course of the latter, he had used a firearm against the victim. on 12 november 2001 the applicant was charged with armed robbery and questioned. on 13 november 2001, in the absence of a lawyer, the applicant was questioned in the context of the robbery proceedings. during the questioning, the applicant, apart from giving information on the robberies, reiterated his statements regarding the shooting which had occurred in yevpatoriya. he was further questioned in that regard. on 21 november 2001 a lawyer, d., was appointed to represent the applicant. he waived his right to a lawyer during questioning. on 13 december 2001 the applicant was charged with premeditated armed robbery as part of a criminal group. the applicant did not appeal against this decision. he pleaded not guilty as charged and refused to give further testimonies. according to the government, no investigative measures were conducted that day. the decision to do so was not amenable to appeal. it found, inter alia, that the applicant had officially been charged with offences other than those considered by the trial court. on 29 april 2004 the supreme court heard the applicant’s appeal in the presence of the prosecutor. on 20 august 2004, in the presence of his lawyer, amended charges were brought against the applicant. during further questioning he pleaded not guilty and refused to give any testimony. in the part of the judgment which concerns the murder charges, the court referred, in particular, to the “testimonies given by the applicant as a suspect and an accused, including in the presence of a lawyer”. in this context, when finding the applicant guilty of armed robberies, the court held that, having been informed of his procedural rights, the applicant had voluntarily waived his right to legal representation and that such a waiver had been lawfully accepted by the investigative authorities as robbery charges could not lead to a life sentence. he submitted that his cell had been overcrowded: it had measured 16 square metres, contained eight beds for ten people, and detainees had had to take turns to sleep. he stated that the applicant had never been in contact with anyone suffering from such a disease whilst in kharkiv sizo. in kharkiv sizo the applicant was held in cells nos. 27 and 537 measuring 24.2 square metres each, designed to accommodate eight detainees. there was natural ventilation and light through windows; artificial lighting allowed inmates to read and write without damaging their eyesight. the temperature in the cells was between 18oc and 20oc. all detainees were provided with bed linen and clothes in accordance with domestic standards. whenever the applicant was taken out of his cell and escorted within the donetsk sizo, handcuffs were used pursuant to the relevant domestic legislation.
the applicant was born in 1972 and lives in burgas. at about 6 a.m. on 11 july 2007 several police officers visited the applicant’s home with a summons for him to report to the police station in the neighbouring town of pomorie “as a witness” in relation to an investigation. the applicant alleged that he was not at home at the time and that he was alerted by phone by his wife. on the summons, on the other hand, it is noted that he refused to accept receipt. at about 7 a.m. the applicant arrived at the pomorie police station. he was notified that he was being detained under section 63(1)(1) of the ministry of internal affairs act (“the miaa”, see paragraph 15 below). the detention order stated that he was being detained on the basis of section 63(1)(1) “in connection with an offence under article 195 of the criminal code”, which refers to theft. during his detention, the applicant was transported to a police station in burgas and then back to the police station in pomorie, where his fingerprints were taken. he was not interviewed, and no further investigative steps involving his participation were taken. at about 12 a.m. the applicant was allowed to meet with a lawyer retained by his wife, who insisted that the police release him. the applicant was released shortly after that, at 1.30 p.m. on 11 july 2007. immediately after his release the applicant applied for judicial review of the detention order. in the framework of the ensuing proceedings the police presented an order dated 10 july 2007 and signed by a police investigator in pomorie. they stated that the case file concerning the applicant contained no further documents. the order stated that a theft had been committed by an unknown person in a hotel in pomorie and instructed the police to take the appropriate measures to search for the perpetrator. the burgas administrative court heard the case on 28 november 2007. it accepted the order mentioned in the preceding paragraph as evidence. in a judgment of 21 december 2007 it upheld the detention order, holding that the applicant’s detention had been in accordance with the law. it found, in particular, that for the lawful application of section 63(1)(1) of the miaa it was not necessary that the police should hold evidence showing “in an unqualified manner” that the detainee had committed an offence; data “justifying a suspicion that there was a probability that the person had committed an offence” was sufficient. the domestic court noted further that the police had operational freedom as to the application of section 63(1)(1) of the miaa. on appeal by the applicant, on 17 november 2008 the supreme administrative court upheld the judgment of the burgas administrative court, reiterating its reasoning.
the applicant was born in 1984 and lives in baku. he is the chairman and one of the co-founders of human rights club, a non-governmental organisation (ngo) specialising in the protection of human rights. human rights club was established in december 2010 and has made several unsuccessful attempts to obtain state registration by the ministry of justice in order to obtain legal entity status under domestic law. the authorities’ refusal to register human rights club is the subject of another application pending before the court (see application no. the applicant has collaborated with other ngos in azerbaijan on various projects. he is also a member of the board of directors of the republican alternative civic movement (real). the applicant has been involved in the preparation of various reports relating to human rights issues in azerbaijan. he has also been involved in promoting the adoption of a parliamentary assembly of the council of europe (pace) report on political prisoners in azerbaijan, and has been working on a consolidated list of political prisoners to be presented to the council of europe. during the june 2014 session of the pace the applicant presented a report on human rights violations in azerbaijan at the council of europe. in recent years a number of human rights activists, lawyers, politicians, journalists and other government critics have been arrested and/or charged with various criminal offences. he was informed that he could not leave the country because a travel ban had been imposed on him on 25 july 2014. the description of charges consisted of a single sentence which was one page long. on 4 august 2014 the prosecutor general’s office made a public statement which noted that the applicant had been charged under articles 192.2.2, 213.1 and 308.2 of the criminal code because there was a suspicion that he had committed the criminal offences set out in the above‑mentioned articles. as to the risk of disrupting the investigation, the applicant argued that the existence of such a risk had not been substantiated. on 24 october the applicant appealed, reiterating his previous arguments. on an unspecified date in december 2014 the applicant applied to the nasimi district court, requesting the substitution of remand with house arrest. on 12 december 2014 the applicant appealed against the nasimi district court’s decision of 10 december 2014, reiterating his arguments in detail. the applicant’s criminal trial began in january 2015. the conviction is not yet final and the appeal is pending. in those articles, he was described as a spy for foreign interests and “a traitor”. the following are some examples of such comments. in january 2012 yeni azerbaijan, the official newspaper of the ruling party, ran a piece entitled “new target of national traitors: eurovision 2012”, which attacked the sing for democracy campaign coordinated by the applicant as a campaign against the interests of the country and stated the following:
“the blackmail and slander campaign of the alliance to protect political freedoms, institute for peace and democracy, institute for reporters’ freedom and safety, and human rights club is based on ugly intentions which are evident from the names of these organisations. these organisations always orchestrate the ugly plans of several interested circles against azerbaijan and act as mercenaries. the organisations which have allocated grants to them in non-transparent ways, directing them into various activities, including those against azerbaijan. in an interview published on 2 september 2014 y.m., capital punishment must be the gravest punishment for them. on 3 december 2014 state-owned news agencies published a sixty‑page manifesto written by r.m., ədalətsiz və qərəzli hökm çıxarmaz, nə də onun kimisi hakim işləməzdi”). on the same day the collegium of the aba decided to refer mr bagirov’s case to a court, with a view to his disbarment. it appears from documents submitted to the court that, following mr bagirov’s suspension as an advocate, the domestic authorities stopped allowing him to meet the applicant in prison.
the applicant was born in 1948 and lives in plovdiv. the doctor who performed the scan recommended a further bone scintigraphy. a radiography in february 2003 showed a suspected pathological lesion in the sixth left rib. whether further tests were required before the operation. he told her that the suspected metastasis was very small, could not be localised visually, and had to be precisely localised before any surgery. and reiterated her request for further tests before the operation. however, he reassured her that the available imaging results were sufficient. having assented to the operation by signing an informed consent form, the applicant underwent surgery on 13 march 2003. removed fragments of her fourth and fifth left ribs, rather than her sixth, eighth or ninth left ribs. likewise told her that he had removed fragments of those ribs, and that he had inspected her lungs. a computerised axial tomography scan carried out the same month found that parts of the fourth and fifth left ribs had been removed and that the sixth left rib was fractured. to explain all that, and he apparently again denied having made any mistake. the ministry ordered the plovdiv regional health inspectorate to carry out an inquiry and, based on its findings, on 23 january 2004 informed the applicant that in view of the inconclusive results of the medical imaging tests, the operating team had chosen to make a wide opening in the thorax, enabling them to inspect the left side of the thoracic wall from the fourth to the ninth ribs. the reference to the eighth and ninth ribs in the operation report had been a clerical mistake. on 27 january 2004 the applicant brought a claim for damages against dr k.m. she alleged that he had (a) erroneously removed parts of two healthy ribs, the fourth and the fifth on the left, without having obtained her consent; (b) inspected her lungs, which had been unnecessary and unjustified; (c) fractured her sixth left rib; and (d) failed to remove the metastasis, which had been the very purpose of the operation. at the request of the applicant, the court ordered an expert report, to be drawn up by an oncologist, nominated by the applicant, a thoracic surgeon, nominated by dr k.m., the two expert reports were filed in october 2004. or the hospital, reopened the proceedings and instructed her to do so. on 26 october 2005 the court heard the new expert, including his answers to questions put by counsel for the applicant. he explained in detail why he stood by his conclusions. the fact that the histological test had later showed otherwise had not retrospectively rendered his assessment flawed. in particular, the experts were agreed that the medical imaging results submitted by the applicant could not be conclusive on that point in the absence of a fresh histological test. the applicant appealed to the plovdiv court of appeal. the applicant however reiterated her earlier request for a fresh expert report (see paragraph 30 above), and the court acceded to it, appointing as experts two thoracic surgeons, one of whom was dr v.t., and a thoracic surgical oncologist, all from sofia. the other two experts expressed the same views as those set out in the thoracic surgeon’s supplementary report (see paragraph 31 above), and came to the conclusion that the operation had been required and that the operating team had not acted out of line with good medical practice. on an unknown later date in 2006 the plovdiv court of appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment. see paragraph 33 above), which went against the remainder of the evidence. the court also admitted other evidence submitted by the applicant.
the applicant was born in 1949 in the khabarovsk region. on 9 march 2006 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of aggravated murder, robbery and firearms possession. he remained in detention throughout the investigation and trial. on 28 july 2006 the stavropol regional court found him guilty as charged and sentenced him to nineteen years’ imprisonment in a correctional colony. when the applicant arrived at the colony the resident doctor noted that he had a first-degree disability: he was totally blind as a result of mature cataracts in both eyes. his blindness, which had developed during his detention, meant that he was unable to move around alone. in addition, he was suffering from coronary disease, hypertension, gallstones and chronic pancreatitis. he was included on a list of detainees requiring enhanced medical attention. the applicant was assigned to colony unit no. 10 for special-needs detainees, which comprised a separate dormitory. it housed forty-six detainees with various disabilities or serious illnesses. the unit had a dormitory measuring 149.6 square metres, a dining room, a toilet, showers, and several offices for administrative and medical personnel. a large part of the dormitory floor area was taken up by furniture such as bunk beds, bedside tables and chairs. as is apparent from the documents and photographs submitted by the government, the premises were not adapted for visually impaired or blind persons. the authorities assigned another inmate with cardiac problems to assist the applicant with his basic needs. he helped the applicant to move around the dormitory and to take showers, and guided him in the dining room. he regularly stumbled over objects, slipped and fell. in 2011 he was diagnosed as having an emotionally unstable personality disorder. on 21 february 2011 and 19 november 2012 a medical commission confirmed the applicant’s disability. they recommended that the authorities provide him with a walking stick, a white cane, a player for audiobooks designed for blind people, a vocal clinical thermometer and a vocal tonometer. according to two entries in his medical record, on 30 november 2011 and 23 january 2013 officials asked the applicant whether he wished to receive those items. the applicant allegedly refused, but did not agree to make a written note to that effect in the medical record. in september 2014 the inmate who had been assisting the applicant was released from detention and the applicant was left to fend for himself. according to a certificate issued by the authorities, he refused the assistance of other inmates. relying on the conclusion of the medical commission, the applicant lodged an application with the kochubeevskoe district court, stavropol region, for release on health grounds. on 16 april 2013 the district court dismissed the application. 21 of the supreme court of russia dated 20 december 2011 (see paragraph 26 below), the court noted that the fact that the applicant’s illness was included in the list provided for by government decree no. 54 did not automatically mean that he would be released. the court cited the gravity of the crimes committed by the applicant and the length of the prison term he had yet to serve. the stavropol regional court upheld that judgment on appeal.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in fontanelas. he is one of the most well-known television hosts in portugal and is currently the host of a morning talk show. he has worked in the media for almost forty years. he publicly declared his homosexuality in 2008. and featured two famous people from the media as guests. in the course of the talk show, during a quiz, the guests were asked to answer the following question, which was identified as the most important by f.c.: “ who is the best portuguese female tv host?” the possible answers to the question included the name of three female television hosts and the applicant’s; the latter being the “correct” one. who is the best female portuguese tv host? i will obviously exclude option a, definitely. from the other three, i think they are all gorgeous. goucha in the afternoons, mornings... f.c.: she was the one telling me not to say it, that it could be bad.” on an unspecified date of 2010 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint for defamation and “insult” (injúria) with the lisbon criminal department for investigation and prosecution against the state-owned television company rtp, the production company, the television presenter f.c. and the directors of programming and content. he complained that they had damaged his reputation and dignity by including his name in the list of possible answers to the question asked during the programme. on 2 march 2011 a public prosecutor of the lisbon criminal department discontinued the proceedings by adopting a decision which stated that the defendants had not intended to offend the applicant. on an unspecified date the applicant sought to intervene in the proceedings as an assistant to the public prosecutor (assistente) and lodged private prosecution submissions (acusação particular) with the lisbon criminal investigation court (tribunal de instrução criminal) against the defendants. they challenged his prosecution submissions by requesting that a judicial investigation be opened (requerimento de abertura de instrução). on 24 june 2011 the investigating judge (juiz de instrução) responsible dismissed the case (despacho de não pronúncia). in relation to the individual defendants, the judge decided that there was insufficient evidence of any defamation and insults by them, thus the case was unable to be brought to trial. nor did they anticipate this as possible. the subjective element of this criminal offence is therefore unverified. the [assistente] is a public figure and so must be used to having his characteristics captured by comedians in order to promote humour; it being public knowledge that [the applicant’s characteristics] reflect behaviour that is attributed to the female gender, such as his way of expressing himself, his colourful [feminine] clothes, and the fact that he has always lived in a world of women (see, for example, the programmes he has always presented on television). the [assistente] has recently made his homosexuality public, and the defendants never intended to criticise his sexual orientation ...”
with regard to the two defendant companies, the proceedings were discontinued pursuant to article 11 of the criminal code, which excludes “legal persons” from liability for defamation and insult. in particular, he argued that the reason his name had been included in the list of possible answers had been his sexual orientation. on 17 april 2012 the appeal was dismissed. the court upheld the criminal investigation court’s decision. it stated that there was insufficient evidence to enable them to consider that there had been any defamation by the defendants. it further considered that:
“... the expression used in a playful and irreverent context and in the normal style previously adopted by the television show under consideration, even though one may consider it as being in bad taste, does not reach the threshold required by law for the protection of honour and consideration.”

the applicant is a journalist by profession. the article in question concerned a set of criminal proceedings against m.b., the incident, in which three people had died and eight others had been injured, had caused much emotion and controversy in switzerland. profession: nursing assistant ... it is 8.15 p.m. on tuesday 8 july 2003, in the austere premises of the lausanne criminal investigation department. this algerian citizen is withdrawn, introverted, inscrutable, indeed completely impenetrable. and yet the questions are flying from all sides. did not lodge a complaint against the applicant. however, criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant on the initiative of the public prosecutor for having published secret documents. had photocopied the case file and lost one of the copies in a shopping centre. following an application by the applicant to have the decision set aside, the lausanne police court, by a judgment of 22 september 2005, replaced the prison sentence with a fine of 4,000 swiss francs (chf) (approximately 2,667 euros (eur)). the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. the applicant lodged a public-law appeal and an appeal on grounds of nullity with the federal court, which on 29 april 2008 dismissed the appeals. he does not challenge the fact that the information which he published falls within the ambit of article 293 of the criminal code. complicity in such acts is also punishable (see paragraph 2). the court may decide not to impose any penalties if the secret thus made public is of minor importance (see paragraph 3). according to case-law, this provision proceeds from a formal conception of secrecy. it is sufficient that this declaration should nonetheless appear tenable vis-à-vis the content of the documents, investigations or deliberations in issue. the secrecy requirement relates to all the evidence uncovered by the investigation itself as well as all non-public decisions and investigative measures (see paragraph 2). lastly, the law provides for a range of exceptions. 1066, p. 678; gérard piquerez, procédure pénale suisse: manuel, 2nd ed., furthermore, in so far as the impugned publication concerned excerpts from records of interviews of the accused and reproduced certain letters sent by the latter to the investigating judge, this evidence can validly be classified secret, by prohibiting public access to it, as provided by the legislation of the canton of vaud. this type of information provides no relevant insights into the accident or the circumstances surrounding it. it should first of all be noted that article 293 of the criminal code punishes only the disclosure of information, irrespective of how the perpetrator obtained it. moreover, even under article 10 echr, the european court does not attach decisive importance to this fact when considering whether applicants have fulfilled their duties and responsibilities. this point is well-established in the present case (see section b above). it suggested that the case had already been tried in the author’s view, in the sense that the fatalities on the lausanne bridge had been caused not by an ordinary motorist but by a ‘mad driver’, a man ‘oblivious to the events and all the hubbub around him’; the journalist concluded by wondering whether the driver was in fact doing his best to ‘make himself impossible to defend’. the cantonal court concluded that this factor did not indicate that the public interest in receiving information prevailed. that court cannot be criticised on that account. nor did he challenge the refusal to grant him a probationary period after which the fine would be struck out (former article 49, point 4, in conjunction with former article 106, paragraph 3, of the criminal code) under swiss law. from the angle of weighing up the interest in the interference, we might simply note that the fine imposed, the amount of which took into account a previous conviction dating back to 1998 (imposition of a chf 2,000 fine, which could be struck out after a two-year probationary period, for coercion and defamation), does not exceed half the amount of the appellant’s monthly income at the material time (see police court judgment, point 1, p. 5), and there is nothing to suggest that his freelance status at the time of the first-instance judgment led to any significant drop in his earnings.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in šibenik. who had come to croatia as a tourist from the czech republic. on 20 september 2005 an investigating judge of the šibenik county court heard the applicant, who denied the charges against him. he explained that on the occasion in question some children from a house in betina had thrown water-filled balloons at him. he had approached the house the children had come from and had knocked at the door, but no one had answered. when he was back at home, two young women had come to ask for the mobile telephone belonging to one of them, but he told them he had not taken it. in response to a request for international legal assistance from the croatian prosecuting authorities, on 9 june 2006 the chomutovo county court in the czech republic heard evidence from e.r. she said that on 12 july 2005 in betina, croatia, her children had thrown water-filled balloons at the applicant. he had then approached the house they were staying in and through a window she had seen him steal her mobile telephone from a table on the terrace of that house. together with her step-daughter she had followed the applicant to his house and asked him to return her telephone. on 9 november 2006 the šibenik municipal state attorney’s office indicted the applicant in the šibenik municipal court (općinski sud u šibeniku) on the charge of stealing a mobile telephone from e.r. during his trial before the šibenik municipal court the applicant gave oral evidence on 18 may 2010. he reiterated the statement he had given before the investigating judge. throughout these proceedings the applicant challenged the allegation against him, contending that, although there had been a dispute between him and e.r. over the behaviour of her children, he had not stolen her mobile telephone. the applicant’s account was confirmed in essence by his former wife, who was also questioned as a witness during the proceedings. at a hearing held on 27 october 2010 the šibenik municipal court decided to admit the record of e.r. ’s questioning as evidence without examining her directly. the applicant objected to the reading out of e.r. on 28 october 2010 the šibenik municipal court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to four months’ imprisonment suspended for one year. the trial court held that it was clear that the applicant had been the person who had approached the house where e.r. had no reason “to blame the accused without basis”. before the chomutovo county court, the czech republic, on 9 june 2009 without the parties’ consent because there were sound reasons for doing so, namely that the victim gave her evidence more than four years ago and this court considers that, owing to the passage of time, it would not learn any new facts or circumstances relevant for assessing the circumstances of the event [at issue], and was also mindful of the fact that the [charges against the accused] will become time-barred in july 2011 and ... summoning the victim would protract the criminal proceedings unnecessarily. ...
... considering the evidence given by witness and victim e.r. in his appeal of 28 january 2011 the applicant argued, inter alia, that e.r. had never been summoned to a hearing during his trial before the šibenik municipal court and that he had had no opportunity to question her. ’s mobile telephone had not been found in his possession. ... this decision of the first-instance court did not violate the defence rights of the accused ...
...
... it should also be said that the mobile telephone could not have been found in the accused’s possession because nobody looked for it. on 8 december 2011 the constitutional court declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. this decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 12 january 2012.
the applicants were born in 1966 and 2007 respectively and live in st petersburg. between 1983 and january 2012 he lived in st petersburg neuropsychological care home no. he would visit her regularly, spend time with her, take her for walks and buy her books, toys and clothes. ’s legal capacity, relying in particular on a psychiatric examination report. on 24 september 2008 the marriage between the first applicant and ms n.s. in february 2012, on the basis of a medical assessment, the first applicant was discharged from the care home and moved into his flat. they stated that the second applicant had difficulties in communicating with her parents and that she felt fear, anxiety and emotional stress in their presence. in a certificate dated 26 may 2011 a municipal custody and guardianship agency confirmed that the second applicant was living temporarily at the children’s home at the first applicant’s request pending the allocation of social housing to him, and that he visited her there. he was able to cook and kept his room in the care home clean and orderly. his psychiatric state was stable; he did not show any signs of aggression towards others or emotional instability and did not need any medical treatment. (b)  oral submissions and witness statements 25. the first applicant’s lawyer thus insisted that the second applicant should be transferred into his care. ms o. expressed her certainty that the first applicant would be fully able to fulfil his parental obligations and take good care of the second applicant. in this connection, it noted that his medical diagnosis and category of disability would make him ineligible for applying to adopt a child. the first applicant appealed against the judgment of 20 march 2012 to the st petersburg city court (“the city court”). the first applicant further insisted, with reference to the district court’s argument to that end, that the fact the girl’s mother was legally incapacitated was of no relevance to his case. legal incapacity was a formal status and did not mean that the person was dangerous to others. the first applicant also claimed that during the second applicant’s stay at the children’s home, her mother had been allowed to visit her. 39948/06, 18 december 2008) and the relevant provisions of the united nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, he also submitted that his income could not be a decisive element in the decision to restrict his parental authority. it repeated the reasoning and conclusions of the district court, stating that they were correct and accurately reflected the factual circumstances of the case. he did not attempt to pursue the cassation proceedings any further. after the present application was communicated to the respondent government, they submitted information on factual developments in the case. the judgment entered into force on 25 october 2012. according to the government, on the basis of that order the first applicant regularly and without any limitations visited the second applicant there. he also pointed out that since february 2012 he had been living on his own and maintaining a household and that he was employed and had a stable income. on 8 april 2013 the district court gave its judgment. it took into account the parties’ arguments and observed, as had been submitted by a representative of the children’s home, that the first and second applicants had developed close emotional ties, that at present the girl felt comfortable and calm in her father’s presence and that she missed him whenever he left the children’s home. the living wage being rub 7,352 for a working adult and rub 5,802.50 for a child, the court considered that he was fully able to ensure the second applicant had adequate financial support. the court went on to note that the legal capacity of ms n.s., the judgment was not appealed against and entered into force on 17 may 2013.
the applicant was born in 1967 and lives in plasencia. on 3 january 2011 following a trial, the plasencia criminal judge (juez de lo penal) no. 1 sentenced the applicant to six months’ imprisonment for serious disobedience to public authority (desobediencia grave a la autoridad). the applicant was acquitted of other charges against him, namely false accusation of a crime (calumnias), defamation (injurias) and concealment (encubrimiento). the judge established that the applicant was the webmaster of an internet forum on which defamatory messages against the complainants in the proceedings had been published, and that he had deliberately disregarded the request made to him by a police officer within the framework of the criminal investigation not to alter the messages in question. in fact, the applicant had proceeded to have the forum webpage removed altogether, despite the police officer’s request to leave it unchanged. as regards the charges for defamation and false accusation of a crime, the judge held that there were reasonable doubts as to whether the applicant had been aware of the messages in question before his police interview and that he should therefore be acquitted in that regard. it was also alleged that he had protected the individuals who had made the defamatory statements; however, the judge considered that he could not be found guilty of concealment as it had not been proved that he had been aware at the time of his police interview that it had been possible for him to have access to the internet protocol (ip) numbers of the participants on the forum. both the prosecution and defence appealed against the judgment before the cáceres audiencia provincial. the applicant did not request a hearing, nor did the audiencia provincial order one. instead, the court watched a video-recording of the trial. on 16 may 2011 the audiencia provincial upheld the applicant’s conviction for serious disobedience to public authority and, unlike the first-instance judge, found him guilty of continuous and false accusation of a crime (delito continuado de calumnias). his punishment was a daily fine of 15 euros (eur) for a period of eighteen months. in finding the applicant guilty, the appellate court stated that it had relied on the facts established by the first-instance judge and on the testimony given by the complainants, the applicant and the witnesses in the earlier trial. the facts declared proved in the first-instance judgment constitute continuous and false accusation of a crime and defamation regulated and punished by section 205 and seq. of the criminal code in relation to section 74 of the same code for which the defendant jorge gómez olmeda should be declared guilty as a principal pursuant to sections 28 and 30 of the code with the mitigating factor of undue delays pursuant to section 21 paragraph six of the code. ...
it is undisputed that documentary evidence does not require judicial immediacy for its assessment because it is written down and can be read and interpreted in the light of the circumstances of the case, which had been perfectly outlined in the complainants’ brief and proved in the hearing, both with respect to what was written on the forum and the people against whom those expressions were directed. those expressions imputed the commission of crimes to the complainants (sexual assault, sexual slavery of a person) and were detrimental to their fame and reputation to the extent that it is obvious that the imputations were serious in themselves and related to public understanding, which is an open-ended concept of which interpretation depends on the particular facts of the case. it is worth remembering that we are speaking here of a small town where everybody knows each other, where everybody runs into each other, where everybody attends the same places, where everyday life is routine and there is little room for novelties, where anything breaking the monotony is something which attracts public attention, where the genealogy of every inhabitant is known to the rest. for these reasons we find the applicant guilty of the crime of continuous and false accusation of a crime ...which he had been acquitted of at first instance. the applicant states that he was the administrator of the forum; that he did not log onto it very often; that he lacked computer skills and that he had removed some phrases and messages which in his view might be considered insulting for the purposes of the case now before us. we disagree with the accused when he states that he was unaware of what was written on the forum, the argument on which the first-instance judge relied to acquit him of false accusation of a crime and defamation. and we disagree for the following two reasons. the applicant applied to the audiencia provincial to have the previous proceedings before it declared void. his application was dismissed on 29 september 2011 on the grounds that no legal provision had been infringed and none of his rights had been breached in those proceedings. the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the constitutional court. he cited article 24 of the constitution (right to a fair hearing), complaining that the audiencia provincial had convicted him on appeal without giving him the opportunity to plead his case in open court. by a decision served on 13 march 2012 the constitutional court declared the applicant’s amparo appeal inadmissible as it had no special constitutional significance.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in wiener neustadt, austria. on 15 september 2010 he was arrested in hungary and on 17 january 2011 he was extradited to moldova on suspicion of defrauding c., a company registered in moldova. 13, where he was detained between 21 january and 23 august 2011. for the first month he was held in cell no. 13, designed for prisoners with medical problems, since he had complained upon his arrival of pain due to his prostate cancer, as well as hypertension. a window opened on to another room which had an opening in its roof, thus giving a glimpse of daylight. it was full of parasitic insects and rats. the water was yellow because the pipes were rusted, but he had to drink it in the absence of an alternative. he received basic medication for his hypertension. in the absence of changes of clothes or incontinence pads, he had to wait for the next day for bathing, which happened only once a week. according to the government, during his detention in prison no. 13, designed for twelve detainees and measuring 30 square metres, cell no. 609 concerning the minimal norms of food for detainees. in an appeal to the chișinău court of appeal on 18 february 2011 the applicant referred to his poor state of health as a reason for his release; he was ill with prostate cancer. on 19 april 2011 the applicant asked to be released, relying, inter alia, on a letter from his doctor in austria concerning his untreated cancer and recommendations after delayed surgery for cancer in 2008. that request was refused on 20 april 2011 by the buiucani district court. 13 of medical personnel who specialised in treating his kind of illness, as well as the lack of equipment required to treat him, and the worsening of his health resulting in severe pain and in his inability to control the urination process, causing him to wet himself. on 24 may 2011 the chișinău court of appeal dismissed that appeal, finding that there was no medical evidence in the file to suggest that the applicant could not be treated while in detention. 13 as to the specific treatment given to him. in an appeal of 1 july 2011 the applicant repeated his submissions made before the buiucani district court. in its report for 2010 (page 142 et seq., “ at the same time, that authority stated that, owing to the difficult financial situation, during 2010 the detainees in prison no. 17 in rezina received 75% and 80% of their normal quotas of meat and fish products respectively. this statistic was often cited by prison authorities to justify why they were unable to provide detainees with meat and fish ...” 21. all of them noted problems concerning conditions of detention, and a significant proportion also noted problems with medical assistance. 13 the report stated that:
“... the situation in respect of conditions of detention ... is of real concern. ... the report noted the continuing problem of insufficient access to daylight in the cells, in which the windows are covered with layers of metal bars, the lack of ventilation, increased humidity in the cells, very worn-out bed linen, the separation of the toilet from the rest of the cell by a cellophane sheet, or the lack of any type of separation. 13 be closed down in order to avoid new findings of violations by the court. in december 2015 the human rights centre repeated its recommendation of closing down prison no. 13 and, if that was impossible, the urgent improvement of conditions of detention there.
the applicant was born in 1989 and lives in kresttsy, novgorod region. on an unspecified date the applicant was charged with theft. on 16 december 2003 the case was settled and the criminal proceedings were discontinued. on 28 july 2004 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed a murder. the applicant was 15 years old at the time of the arrest. the other participants in the crime confessed and incriminated [the applicant]. given that [the applicant] has been previously charged with criminal offences, that he is suspected of having committed a serious crime, it is impossible to apply a more lenient preventive measure.” on an unspecified date the applicant was charged with conspiracy to commit robbery. on 27 september 2004 the novgorod town court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention until 8 november 2004 noting as follows:
“regard being had to the [applicant’s] character and the seriousness of the charges against him, the court considers that it is not possible to lift or replace the earlier imposed preventive measure because [the applicant] may interfere with the establishment of the truth or abscond.” on 4 november 2004 the town court extended the applicant’s detention until 8 january 2005. it reiterated verbatim its earlier reasoning. on 7 december 2004 the investigator dropped the murder charges against the applicant for lack of corpus delicti. he further re-classified the charge against the applicant as robbery committed by a group of persons. on 30 december 2004 the town court extended the applicant’s pre‑trial detention until 28 january 2005. on 14 february 2005 the regional court fixed the preliminary hearing of the applicant’s case for 24 february 2005. the court also ruled that the applicant should be detained pending trial. on 28 april 2005 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the said decision on appeal. the applicant and his lawyer were present. the lawyer asked for the applicant’s release into his mother’s care pending trial. both the applicant and his lawyer appealed. on 21 september 2005 the supreme court upheld the decision of 20 july 2015 on appeal. the court decided to consider the matter in the applicant’s absence noting that the applicant had attended the hearing on 20 july 2005 and had been provided with an opportunity to be heard. the applicant’s lawyer and the prosecutor were present and made submissions to the court. he had not spent nights at home and had not lived with his mother for extended periods of time. his mother could not control his behavior; she did not pay due attention to his upbringing and had no influence over him. on 17 october 2005 the regional court extended the applicant’s and two other defendants’ detention until 27 january 2006. the court reiterated verbatim its reasoning of 17 october 2005. on 13 february 2006 the regional court found the applicant guilty of robbery and sentenced him to four and a half years’ imprisonment. on 27 september 2006 the supreme court of russia upheld, in substance, the applicant’s conviction on appeal. on 2 august 2007 the nevelskiy district court of the pskov region released the applicant on parole.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in london. both mr osman and another suspect were thought to be living in an apartment at 21 scotia road, london. no request was made at this stage for a unit from so19. by 6.04 a.m. two surveillance teams from so12 had been deployed to the scotia road address to control the premises and to follow anyone coming out of the apartments. upon arrival they received a further briefing from dci c, which commenced at 8.50 a.m. the briefing was not recorded but it appears that dci c confirmed the terrorists had the capacity to attach a device to themselves that would be difficult to detect. the cctv on the bus did not capture the entire journey due to vibrations but mr de menezes was recorded as being on the bus by 9.39 a.m. at this point the surveillance team described him as “a good possible likeness” to hussain osman. it appears from the stockwell one report of the independent police complaints commission (the “ipcc” – see paragraphs 45-71 below) that those on the ground had not been able to identify mr de menezes as hussein osman. by this time mr de menezes was already in the underground station. at 9.45 p.m. on 22 july 2005 the anti-terrorist branch formally handed over control of the scene to the dps as they were satisfied that mr de menezes was not connected to the attempted bombings. first, it criticised the briefings given by dci c and trojan 84:
“20.8 there is no doubt that the briefings provided by [dci c and trojan 84] included a comprehensive update on the intelligence including the links between 7 july and 21 july and the possibility that the firearms officers may have to confront one of the terrorists who had survived the suicide bombings the previous day. ... ... ... 20.32 detective chief inspector c, the silver commander, was effectively the ground commander with responsibility for so12, so13 and [so19] officers. and as they approached stockwell underground station they hear that the suspect had entered the underground station and they received an order to stop him getting on the underground train. on 14 october 2005 the mpa referred a complaint to the ipcc about the mps’s handling of public statements following the shooting of mr de menezes. the contents of that report are not directly relevant to the complaint currently before the court. there is no doubt that some police officers did shout something before any shots were fired .... unless i could prove that officers had lied ... to mislead any investigation, i could not prosecute them for attempting to pervert the course of justice. more detailed reasons were provided in a fifty-page review note dated 9 march 2006 as well as in a final review note of 9 july 2006. he also considered the possibility of prosecuting commander dick for offences under sections 7 and 33 of the 1974 act, but, having applied the relevant criteria, found that the prosecution of her or of any of the other individual officers under these provisions would not be in accordance with health and safety executive policy. likewise, the prosecutor considered that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute trojan 80, dci c or the surveillance teams for gross negligence manslaughter. (vi)  alteration of the surveillance log 87. there is no doubt that the officers intended to kill mr de menezes when they fired. where a person faces a threat, the courts will not judge with too precise a measure the degree of force he uses... it is also significant for present purposes that a person under threat is not required to wait passively for the blow to fall. in my judgment, no such duty could exist. the dso] had [the sfos] at the proper holding point at the time she wanted to deploy them. in my judgment, she was entitled to rely upon that information. the claimant subsequently agreed that no further action would be taken in relation to these grounds because, inter alia, even if the judicial review was successful the only remedy for the family would be for the court to order a fresh inquest and the claimant did not “see any great benefit in re-hearing all the evidence to enable a different jury to come to a verdict, particularly bearing in mind the very high cost of holding such an inquest”. the coroner also reviewed material indicating which remedial steps had already been taken to develop police practice since the events of july 2005. on 26 march 2009 the family asked the dpp to review the decision not to prosecute in light of new evidence which had emerged at the inquest. by letter dated 2 october 2009 the chairman of the ipcc rejected the family’s request to review its decision not to initiate disciplinary proceedings as no new evidence had emerged during the inquest to justify bringing disciplinary charges against any individual officer. with regard to commander mcdowall, the ipcc concluded that it was not likely that any tribunal would find that failings which occurred after he set his strategy were due to negligence on his part. a civil action in damages was brought by the family of mr de menezes (including the applicant) against the commissioner of police of the metropolis.
the applicants were born in 1960 and 1956 respectively and live in riga. aiming to verify that information, the knab launched operational proceedings (operatīvā izstrāde). upon being summoned by the knab, on 12 april 2005 the second applicant went to its offices, where he was questioned by two investigators, h. and j. initially, he refused to cooperate and instead asked j. questions about his duties. on 13 april 2005 the second applicant arranged a meeting with j. away from the knab’s offices. during the meeting the second applicant paid j. lvl 18,000 as a first instalment. meanwhile, the second applicant called the first applicant, who was a board member of the company he owned. he asked her to withdraw cash from the company’s account. he explained that the money would be spent on “protection”. their phone conversations were intercepted and recorded. the next day, the second applicant arranged another meeting, during which he gave the investigator lvl 27,000. on the same day he was arrested by knab officers. after the second applicant’s meeting with j., on 13 april 2005 the knab instituted criminal proceedings for bribery. the second applicant was charged as a suspect. the second applicant pleaded guilty and stated that the payments had been intended to prevent further investigation into his business activities. in a letter of 31 may 2005 the knab informed the supervising prosecutor at the prosecutor general’s office that the second applicant’s phone had been tapped in accordance with section 17(3) of the law on operational activities “upon the authorisation of a judge of the supreme court”. the knab asked for the recordings to be included in the criminal case file. on 2 june 2005 the office of the prosecutor brought a charge of aiding and abetting against the first applicant, and a charge of bribery against the second applicant. moreover, the document had been classified as a state secret. the first applicant did not appeal against that reply to a more senior prosecutor. on 15 july 2005 the criminal case concerning both applicants was referred to a court. it appears that on 18 october 2005 the representative of the first applicant sent a complaint about the activities of knab officials in relation to the phone tapping to the prosecutor general’s office. on 2 november 2005 the riga city vidzeme district court, acting as a first-instance court and presided over by judge b.t., the court found the second applicant guilty and gave him a suspended sentence of two years’ imprisonment. the second applicant submitted an appeal concerning the severity of his sentence. the representative of the first applicant submitted that the case file did not contain any information pertaining to the authorisation of the interception of phone conversations, which had been the main evidence against her. during the hearing, the prosecutor confirmed orally that judicial authorisation had been obtained. on 31 october 2006 the appellate court adopted a judgment which upheld the prosecutor’s appeal and quashed the disputed parts of the lower court’s judgment. the second applicant submitted, inter alia, that the appellate court had not assessed the lawfulness of the phone tapping and had ignored the fact that the criminal case had contained no reference to any authorisation to carry out the above activity as prescribed by article 176¹ of the code of criminal procedure. on 19 january 2007 the senate of the supreme court dismissed the appeal on points of law in open court. meanwhile, during a judges’ conference on 4 november 2005, the minister of justice stated in her opening speech:
“today i would say that i, like the majority of you sitting in this hall, am powerless against the actions of our colleagues, which neither society nor i personally understand”.
the applicant was born in 1969 and lives in yerevan. in 1991 the applicant, without permission, constructed a building consisting of a shop/storage and an unfinished construction and measuring in total 500 sq. m. plot of land situated in a suburb of yerevan. the applicant alleged that this land was not being used by anyone so he had cleaned it and constructed the building using his own means. it appears that the applicant used this property for the following ten years. on 8 june 2001 the shengavit district court decided to recognise the applicant’s ownership right in respect of the building and to leave the plot of land under his use. the district court found that the building in question had no registered owners and the applicant had openly and in good faith had it in his possession and used it without interruption for over ten years, which entitled him to become its owner under article 187 of the cc. no appeal was lodged within the prescribed 15-day time-limit, so this judgment became final. on 9 april 2002 a certificate was issued by the local branch of the state real estate registry on the basis of this judgment, confirming the applicant’s ownership in respect of the building. on 20 may 2003 the applicant, pursuant to article 118 § 7 of the lc, paid the cadastral value of the plot of land which amounted to amd 1,465,500 armenian drams (amd). on 22 may 2003 the applicant’s right of ownership was registered in respect of the plot of land and a relevant ownership certificate was issued. the applicant regularly paid property tax on both the building and the plot of land in the following years. the relevant diagram mentioned the applicant as the owner of the land in question. when she later applied to the local branch of the state real estate registry to have her ownership right registered, she was informed that the plot of land in question overlapped with the neighbouring plot of land. she requested that the auction be cancelled in its part concerning the overlapping part of the plot, the money paid for that part be returned and a new sale contract be concluded in respect of the remaining part of her plot. on 7 may 2009 the deputy prosecutor general lodged an appeal against the judgment of 8 june 2001 seeking to quash it and to dismiss the applicant’s acquisitive prescription claim, arguing that the district court had erred in its interpretation and application of the relevant provisions of the substantive law. the land had belonged to the state and hence had not been ownerless at the material time, so the district court should not have applied the acquisitive prescription rules to the case. as a result, the judgment had damaged the state’s pecuniary interests. the deputy prosecutor general further argued that the district court had been obliged to involve, as parties to the proceedings, the local branch of the real estate registry, as well as the yerevan mayor’s office as the authority vested with management of land. by failing to do so, and adopting a judgment affecting their rights in their absence, the district court had also violated the procedural law. the deputy prosecutor general requested the court of appeal to restore the expired time-limit for appeal, arguing that the yerevan mayor’s office had not been aware of the judgment of 8 june 2001 and therefore had been deprived of the possibility of lodging an appeal, while the prosecutor’s office had been informed about that judgment by the mayor’s letter of 24 february 2009. the mayor’s office further claimed that it had become aware of the contested judgment by a letter from the local branch of the state real estate registry dated 24 february 2009, which had been received by the mayor’s office on 18 march 2009. it finally added that the letter of the judicial department of armenia of 6 february 2009 had been accompanied by a copy of another judgment of the shengavit district court, dated 26 june 2001, which was unrelated to the present case. on an unspecified date, the applicant lodged a reply to the appeals. the court of appeal found, in particular, that the shengavit district court had applied articles 178 and 187 of the cc, which were not applicable to the case, and failed to apply articles 168 and 188 of the cc, thereby reaching incorrect findings. the building in question was an unauthorised construction built on a plot of land belonging to the state. hence, only the state could have acquired ownership rights in respect of that building. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. on 9 september 2009 the court of cassation decided to return the appeal as inadmissible for lack of merit. following these decisions, the authorities instituted proceedings against the applicant seeking annulment of registration of his ownership rights in respect of the building and the plot of land, which was granted by the courts.
the first applicant was born in 1992, the second applicant in 1995, and the third applicant in 1993. in summer 2008 and the second applicant was coached by him during the summer of 2009. he had furthermore watched the girls changing and had touched their intimate body parts. for the same reason, the third applicant had also started going to the sauna naked. according to the applicants’ account, even though girls had been in the sauna naked, o.b. – the second applicant stated that he had also tried to touch her, which she had prevented. during all three days of the competition, o.b. she had tried to persuade the girls that it was not normal and had gone to the sauna dressed in a swimsuit. the second applicant had gone to the sauna twice. concerning the sauna sessions, the third applicant had not found it normal that the sauna needed to be attended naked. he had not known how it had come about that girls had been in the sauna naked. stated that in summer 2009 he had massaged the first applicant on her hip muscle. on 21 january 2010 the mother of the third applicant gave evidence. he did not have any complaints concerning the coach and did not know any details about the situation in issue. she did not believe that he had had a sexual purpose. in november 2010 they supplemented the appeal. had ridiculed her in front of the other girls with regard to undressing in sauna; and the third applicant had recounted her experience in lithuania. and the third applicant had not been questioned. they furnished the report by the psychologist, k.v., had never touched students’ naked body parts other than with a besom and when massaging parts causing pain. ridiculing her in front of the other girls regarding undressing for the sauna. on 14 january 2011 the higher prosecutor, e.b., using his coach’s authority, had convinced them that wearing swimsuits was harmful to health. that aspect and the reasons which had led children to undress for the sauna had not been investigated. they had not been asked to attend the sauna undressed, which, in the parents’ submission, signalled that o.b. constituted newly discovered facts, asked the police to reopen the investigation. by a final decision of 6 february 2012 that request was dismissed. had recommended sauna sessions to his students. at the same time, the district court continued, it was not proved that the sauna sessions had been necessary in order to achieve good results in sports without harming health. it was not proved that either the applicants or their parents had consented to the coach’s presence in the sauna together with naked girls.
mr dzhabarov was born in 1975 and lives in burgas. ms nikolova was born in 1962 and lives in sandanski. the police issued an order for mr petkov’s detention for twenty-four hours at 1.30 p.m. that order likewise said that he was being detained under section 63(1)(1) of the miaa, but in his case in conjunction with 198 § 1 of the criminal code 1968, which criminalises robbery. neither of the two orders mentioned the factual grounds on which they had been issued. however, the order had not specified the offence of which he was suspected. the lack of such suspicion was also demonstrated by the absence of any evidence in the police file. mr dzhabarov did not ask the stara zagora administrative court to vary its ruling in relation to costs, as was possible under the applicable rules of procedure. he did however ask the supreme administrative court to award him the costs incurred in the appeal proceedings. the supreme administrative court upheld the lower court’s judgment. it held that the detention order, which had been issued at 12 noon on 20 december 2007, was chiefly tainted by the undisputed lack of contemporaneous evidence that mr dzhabarov might have been implicated in an offence. in january 2009 mr dzhabarov brought a claim under section 1(1) of the state and municipalities liability for damage act 1988 (see paragraph 47 below) against the stara zagora regional directorate of the ministry of internal affairs. he alleged, inter alia, that his detention had been unlawful and had caused him psychological trauma. he sought bgn 2,000 (eur 1,023) in non-pecuniary damages and, under the head of pecuniary damages, reimbursement of the remainder of the costs that he had allegedly incurred in the judicial review proceedings: bgn 206 (eur 105). he had not provided any evidence, in particular medical expert reports, on that point. the court went on to say that it was not possible to seek costs incurred in proceedings for judicial review of a detention order by way of a claim for damages under section 1(1) of the 1988 act. he argued, inter alia, that it was logical to presume that a person who had been unlawfully detained had endured mental suffering on account of that, and that he was entitled to compensation because his detention had been in breach of his fundamental rights. in january 2008 mr petkov sought judicial review of the order for his detention. on 10 march 2008 the stara zagora administrative court quashed the order. that is why the law did not require conclusive evidence of an offence but simply information enabling the police to form a reasonable suspicion in that regard. in a bench ruling of 18 november 2009 (опр. on 12 april 2010 the proceedings were resumed. on 29 september 2010 the burgas administrative court dismissed the claim. inside, checking the personal data of certain individuals in the agency’s computer database. in the meantime, two plain-clothes officers arrived at the station; it later transpired that they were officers of the national security agency. they interviewed ms nikolova without identifying themselves and without explaining the reasons why she was detained. following this incident, the prosecuting authorities opened criminal proceedings against ms nikolova on charges that she had knowingly divulged confidential information to which she had access by virtue of her position as a tax administration official, contrary to article 248 § 1 of the criminal code 1968. it noted that it was not disputed that between about 11 a.m. and about 3.30 p.m. on 9 september 2006 ms nikolova had been detained by officers of the sandanski police. it was not supported by the statement of mr b.t. had the detention lasted more than twenty-four hours, the outcome of the case would probably have been different. the supreme administrative court dismissed the appeal.
the present case concerns the applicant’s trial and conviction before a judge and jury at the central criminal court for the murder of a mr jon bartlett. mr bartlett was shot dead at about 7.40 pm on 31 march 2006. shortly after the murder the applicant fled to the netherlands. he answered “no comment” to the questions asked. at the trial it was accepted by the applicant that the real issue for the jury was whether he or mr pearman was the murderer. the defence objected to their admission in evidence but the judge ruled that they should be admitted. secondly, he indicated that mr pearman could not be called because he refused to give evidence, but noted that all the enquiries carried out by the police to date had confirmed his lack of involvement in the killing. sixthly, the trial judge said that the defence had already cross‑examined the officer in the case as to mr pearman’s previous convictions and the details of the murder for which he was serving his sentence of life imprisonment. items connected to drug dealing were recovered from mr bartlett’s home, one of which was a list of debts. there had also been significant telephone contact between the applicant and mr bartlett in the ten days prior to the murder. witnesses also saw a white van in the vicinity of the shooting at the relevant time. mobile telephone cell site evidence was led by the prosecution with the intention of showing that the applicant’s mobile telephone was in the vicinity of the murder at the relevant time, although it was switched off between 7.28 p.m. and 7.50 p.m. cell site evidence also demonstrated that the applicant and his co-accused were in the vicinity of the road where the vectra was found between 8.01 p.m. and 8.17 p.m. 28. a third eye-witness, a ten-year old boy, also gave evidence that the gunman had been in his mid-thirties and had been wearing a baseball cap. a fourth eye-witness, mr gordon raggett, also gave a description matching the applicant. a police superintendent also gave evidence of the enquiries into mr pearman. mr pearman’s previous convictions for drug offences, firearm offences, and murder committed on 2 may 2006 were also adduced. in the course of their deliberations, the jury asked and were allowed to hear the tapes of mr pearman’s telephone calls again. he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of thirty years. he appealed against conviction to the court of appeal. the application for leave to appeal was initially considered and rejected by a single judge in february 2009. the judgment was delivered on 12 march 2010. it is true that he could have been compelled to come to court. the prospect of any sensible evidence being given by him was, on any realistic view, nil. we do not know whether the jury shared this view. the allegation against pearman had been made late, and given that on the appellant’s case he had known of pearman’s responsibility for the murder within days of its being committed, it is to be inferred that it was deliberately made late so as to make it more difficult for the crown to investigate it. (ii) seton and bartlett were involved in drugs together; there was evidence that seton was in debt to bartlett and that bartlett was pressing for payment. (iii) there was no good reason for the allegation of pearman’s involvement to have been made so late. the evidence of rita willott (described by the judge as an extremely important witness) was not challenged and was read at the trial. (ix) similarly, kate botwright described the driver of the vectra car, seen by her together with the ava van, as in his late teens or early 20s, with short brown hair and wearing a baseball cap. (xii) lastly, evidence was given that on a previous occasion seton had had a connection with a firearm.
the applicant was born in 1936 and lives in sofia. in 1997 the compensation for owners of nationalised real property act (“the 1997 compensation law”) entered into force. on 27 november 1997 the applicant requested from the regional governor of sofia region compensation for an apartment which had belonged to his ancestor at the time of its nationalisation in 1949. as he received no reply, at some point in 1998 the applicant challenged the governor’s silence in court. the sofia city court quashed the governor’s tacit refusal on 18 june 1999, finding that the applicant had to be compensated with “housing compensation bonds” (жилищни компенсаторни записи) as restitution was not possible. the applicant appealed, challenging the type of compensation awarded to him. on 9 april 2001 the supreme administrative court upheld the lower court’s judgment and returned the case to it for the compensation amount to be determined. instead of ruling on the compensation, the sofia city court archived the case; it was only put back on the case roll on 5 july 2002 when the applicant complained. the sofia city court, sitting in its administrative bench, delivered a decision on 19 july 2005. consequently, the applicant’s share of the inheritance stemmed directly from the law, which provided that the children of the deceased inherited in equal parts. the decision became enforceable on 6 september 2005. he sent another request to that effect on 8 august 2006. the deputy regional governor replied in writing on 14 february 2007 that the applicant needed to submit a certified copy of the court decision, as well as a certificate attesting to his status as heir and a declaration certified by a notary. on 19 february 2007 the applicant submitted a certified copy of the court decision of 19 july 2005. in the meantime, on 19 january 2007, the applicant requested to be issued with a writ of execution on the basis of the 19 july 2005 judgment and, more specifically, in respect of its part concerning the amount of compensation and his consequent share of it. on 16 march 2007 he was issued with a writ of execution in respect of the compensation owed to him. on 30 march 2007 he asked the bailiff to start forced enforcement proceedings and to collect the related costs and expenses. he also indicated that an original writ of execution was needed in order for his office to pay costs and expenses. on 25 april 2007 the applicant wrote to the regional governor that the ordinance in question did not apply to his case, as it only concerned situations in which the administrative body itself was called upon to determine the compensation amount. the bailiff sent another letter to the regional governor on 27 april 2007, inviting him to enforce the court decision. the bailiff specified that the costs and expenses which the governor was requested to pay related to the enforcement proceedings, that a writ of execution was not necessary in order to claim or collect those expenses, and that they had increased with the passage of time. finally, the bailiff reiterated that a weekly fine in the amount of bgn 200 would be imposed on the governor in the event of failure to enforce the court decision. on 10 may 2007 the regional governor challenged in court the bailiff’s acts. this decision was confirmed by the supreme administrative court on 21 december 2007 in a final decision. as no further action by the regional governor followed, in march 2009 the applicant once again asked the bailiff to enforce the court decision of 19 july 2005. the bailiff wrote to the governor on 31 march 2009, requesting enforcement and with a reminder that failure to enforce could result in weekly fines of bgn 1,200 and in prosecution. the deputy regional governor replied on 27 april 2009 that the compensation proceedings had not been completed because of the applicant’s failure to submit the requested declaration about his share of the inheritance in accordance with the inheritance act 1949. two days later the regional governor himself fined the applicant bgn 1,000, to be applied weekly. on 11 may 2009 the applicant challenged the fine in court. by a letter of 19 august 2013 the applicant’s lawyer informed the court that the final court decision of 19 july 2005 remained unenforced.
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in budapest. the applicant intended to organise a demonstration protesting against “the persecution of national radicalism”. it was planned to take place between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on 15 august 2009. the venue was venyige street in budapest xth district, in front of budapest penitentiary. venyige street is of a width of five metres in the government’s submissions and of eight in the applicant’s. parallel to the main driveway, there is a service lane, of a width equivalent to that of two cars; this area is normally used as a car park. in the applicant’s submissions, this latter section could have accommodated largely all the participants, without them creating any major traffic incident. the applicant, in the notification addressed to budapest police department under act no. iii of 1989 on the right of assembly, indicated that a maximum of 200 participants were to be expected. this notification was made at 5.40 p.m. on 12 august 2009. on 14 august 2009 budapest police department banned the demonstration, in pursuit of its prerogatives under section 8(1) of act no. it was of the view that there was no alternative route for the traffic in the neighbourhood, and consequently the demonstration would impede traffic inordinately. the applicant was reproached with the fact that the notification did not contain the agenda for the gathering. because of this prohibition, the demonstration did not take place. on 17 august 2009 the applicant requested judicial review of the police decision. he explained inter alia that he had not specified the agenda because the meeting had been intended as a rather small one and that therefore the actual course of events, such as speeches or discussion, was hard to predict. on 19 august 2009 the budapest regional court rejected the applicant’s complaint. it observed that the question of previous notification of the agenda was immaterial, since the only valid reason in the case was the disproportionate difficulties which would be caused to traffic by the demonstration. the court relied on the expert opinion provided by the traffic division of budapest police department, in whose view the demonstration would have significantly impeded the traffic heading to the shops located in venyige street, a dead end, to the local waste disposal site and to the suppliers’ entrance of budapest prison; and the disruption caused by the crowd might have extended to maglódi road, a major thoroughfare in the vicinity with lines of city transport involved. relying on that reasoning, the court endorsed the police decision.
the applicant was born in 1967 and lives in porto. on 28 april 2009 the applicant lodged a request to be granted permanent disability with respect to work before the state’s attorney’s office of the porto labour court as a consequence of a labour accident that she had suffered and with regard to which she was claiming damages and compensation. on 27 may 2009 the applicant supplied statements to the state’s attorney’s office in which she confirmed she was receiving medical care. on the same day the state’s attorney’s office request the applicant to provide her medical reports, which she submitted on 28 and 29 july 2009. meanwhile, the applicant’s employee was notified to provide information on the applicant’s work accident, which was done on 16 june 2009. on 16 september the applicant supplied second statements, informing the state’s attorney’s office that she remained under medical treatment. between 16 september 2009 and 20 september 2010 the state’s attorney’s office requested information regarding the evolution of the applicant’s medical treatment. between these dates, the state’s attorney’s office stayed the proceedings twice for thirty days, on 5 march and on 4 may 2010, until the applicant was medically fit. on an unknown date the state’s attorney’s office was informed that the applicant was no longer being treated in the same clinic and on 7 october 2010 requested the applicant to inform whether she was still being treated and in which clinic. the state’s attorney’s office was informed that the applicant had changed her address and on 25 october 2010 requested the police to provide information on the applicant’s new address. on 4 november 2010 the applicant informed the porto labour court of her new address and that she had not been certified as medically fit yet. on 5 january 2011 the court requested the forensic institute (instituto de medicina legal) to make a medical examination of the applicant, which was made on 27 february 2011. the medical report was submitted by the forensic institute on 3 march 2011 in which it referred that further clinical data and an additional examination were still needed. on 9 march 2011 the porto labour court the collection of those data and the realisation of the additional examination, which were submitted on 26 may and 15 june 2011, respectively. on 12 october 2011 the forensic institute submitted its final report. on 24 october 2011 the state’s attorney’s office scheduled a conciliatory hearing between the parties on 23 november 2011. the conciliatory hearing was adjourned to 24 january 2012 due to the lack of notification of the applicant’s employer. on 24 january 2012 the hearing was again adjourned to 14 march 2012 at the request of the applicant. on this date the conciliatory stage ended without an agreement between the parties. on 2 april 2012 the applicant requested the porto labour court to continue with the judicial stage of the proceedings against her employer and the insurance company. between 8 june 2012 and 21 november 2012 several procedural steps took place, mostly notifications, provision of information from the parties to the porto labour court and a medical examination at the request of the applicant. the hearing started on 20 february and continued on 28 february 2013. on 8 march 2013 the porto labour court delivered its decision in which it ruled against the applicant.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in kaliningrad. on unspecified date the applicant bought a house in kaliningrad. a third person, m., was her authorised representative for the conclusion of the purchase contract. on 18 august 2003 her ownership of the house was registered in the consolidated state register of real estate titles and transactions (единый государственный реестр прав на недвижимое имущество и сделок с ним, “the land register”) and it remains there to date. on an unspecified date m. was charged with fraud against the savings bank of russia (сбербанк) (hereafter – “the bank”) and a private person. on 20 april 2005 a judge of the lomonosovskiy district court of arkhangelsk issued an interlocutory injunction prohibiting the applicant from selling the house. on 15 march 2006 the oktyabrskiy district court of arkhangelsk found m. guilty of fraud. the court found, inter alia, that m. was also the de facto owner of the house as she had paid for it and resided in it since 2003. the court ordered the seizure and sale of the house in order to pay m.’s debt to the victims of the crime. on 9 june 2006 the arkhangelsk regional court partly quashed m.’s conviction on appeal, notably as regards the district court’s finding that she was the real owner of the house. it considered that this finding was not based on any legal provision and failed to take into account the purchase contract concerning the house. the regional court thus remitted that specific issue for fresh consideration in civil proceedings. on an unspecified date the bank sued m. for additional damages and sought reimbursement by means of the sale of the house. the applicant was also summoned to the proceedings as a defendant. on 17 september 2007 the tsentralnyy district court of kaliningrad rejected the bank’s civil claims and declared that the house was the applicant’s property. it held that the applicant had always demonstrated her intention to be the owner of the disputed house, notably by systematically paying all charges and taxes relating to the house, and that her mother was living in it. as regards the bank’s request for annulment of the powers of attorney given by the applicant to m. for the purchase of the house and of the purchase contract itself, the district court found that this claim was time-barred and consequently rejected it. on unspecified date the bank lodged an appeal against that judgment, notably arguing that the purchase contract should be declared null and void because the applicant had never intended to become the real owner of the house but was merely helping m. to cover up for her crimes. on 19 december 2007 the kaliningrad regional court upheld on appeal the judgment of 17 september 2007, which became final. on 16 april 2008 the applicant applied to the tsentralnyy district court of kaliningrad for the revocation of the interlocutory decision of 20 april 2005 by the lomonosovskiy district court of arkhangelsk to seize the house. on 28 april 2008 the tsentralnyy district court of kaliningrad rejected the application on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction to decide on a measure imposed by another court in the framework of criminal proceedings. on 4 may 2008 the bank lodged an application for supervisory review. on 18 august 2008 the presidium of the kaliningrad regional court quashed the judgment of 17 september 2007, as upheld on 19 december 2007, and ordered the seizure of the house from the applicant in order to pay m.’s debt to the bank. the presidium relied on the finding made by the oktyabrskiy district court in its judgment of 15 march 2006 that although the applicant was registered as the official owner of the house, it had been bought with funds belonging to m. 20. on 16 october 2008 and 10 march 2009 the applicant and m. challenged the judgment of the presidium of the kaliningrad regional court by way of supervisory review applications, which were rejected by the supreme court and the deputy president of the supreme court, respectively. on 8 june 2009 the bailiff decided to seize the house in accordance with the judgment of the presidium of the kaliningrad regional court. on 2 april 2010 at the bailiff’s request the tsentralnyy district court stayed the enforcement proceedings pending examination of the applicant’s case by the court.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in krasnodar. on 24 march 2009 the military court of novorossiysk garrison (новороссийский гарнизонный военный суд) convicted the applicant of laundering of the proceeds of crime and sentenced him to a fine. on 21 may 2009 the military court of the north-caucasian command (северо-кавказский окружной военный суд) acquitted the applicant on appeal. on 21 july 2009 the presidium of the military court of the north‑caucasian command, on a public prosecutor’s initiative, annulled the judgment of 21 may 2009 by way of supervisory review and remitted the case for fresh consideration to the appeal court. the annulment was reasoned by two main arguments: (1) unresolved contradictions between witnesses’ statements pertaining to the applicant’s criminal intent, and (2) absence in the appeal judgment of a summary of the arguments presented by the prosecution during the appeal proceedings. on 6 august 2009 the military court of the north-caucasian command, acting on appeal, reversed the judgment of 24 march 2009 and remitted the case for fresh consideration to the trial court. in 2010 the criminal proceedings against the applicant were terminated due to decriminalization of his actions under the domestic law.
the applicants were claimants in civil proceedings. in the applications trapeznikov v. russia and bychkov and others v. russia, the applicants were former participants of the chernobyl clean-up operation who sued the relevant authorities for an inflation adjustment to their social benefits. in the application markova v. russia, the applicant sought the eviction of her late son’s wife and her granddaughter from the flat she was living in, alleging that she was the sole owner because her son had renounced his share in the flat in her favour. in the application ryabchikov v. russia, the applicant inherited a house in accordance with a will drawn up by his late mother. later he discovered that she had two plots of land which she transferred back in 1994 to an agricultural company to which she was a member. the applicant sought to recover the property of these two plots of land alleging that the transfer had not been duly formalised and that consequently the land formed part of his inheritance. in all of the applications, the first-instance courts found for the applicants, the judgments were upheld on appeal and they became enforceable. subsequently, at the defendants’ requests, the presidia of the relevant regional courts quashed the judgments by way of supervisory review. in the applications trapeznikov and bychkov and others, the presidia found that the lower courts failed to take into account the specific method of calculation of indexation established by the government for this particular category of social benefits. in the applications markova and ryabchikov, they concluded that the findings of the lower courts favorable to the applicants were based on the retrospective application of the law (see appendix).
on 8 april 1998 the applicant requested the bucharest commission for implementing law no. 9/1998 (the county commission) to award compensation for a property owned by his ancestors and taken over by the bulgarian state. on 15 december 2000 the commission issued a decision proposing payment of compensation in the amount of rol 2,013,957,441 (approximately eur 88,000 at the time). that decision, according to the law, had to be validated by a central commission within sixty days. as the central commission did not issue any decision, the applicant brought a court action aimed at obliging the central commission to act in accordance with the law. the applicant also asked for the amounts granted by the county commission to be adjusted for inflation when payment was made. the applicant’s action was dismissed on 17 february 2002 by the bucharest county court, which held that the sixty-day deadline was not compulsory, but rather advisory. the court also held that the adjustment of the amounts granted was indeed prescribed by article 8 § 3 of the law, but any adjustment was to be made at the time payment was actually made, once the central commission had ratified or otherwise the county commission decision. on 23 june 2003 the bucharest court of appeal allowed the applicant’s claim, and ordered that the central commission issue a decision ratifying or otherwise the proposal made by the county commission on 15 december 2000. the court held that the claim concerning the adjustment of the amounts granted as compensation was to be dealt with during the enforcement stage. on 29 august 2003 the central commission ratified the county commission decision of 15 december 2000. the compensation, representing at that time approximately eur 54,000, was paid to the applicant on 22 november 2003. dissatisfied with the decision of the central commission, on 13 december 2003 the applicant lodged a court action aimed at obtaining an adjustment of the initial amount to take into account inflation from the date on which it was established by the county commission to the date of actual payment. by a decision of 16 april 2004, the bucharest county court ruled in the applicant’s favour. the county court established that in accordance with article 8 § 2 of law no. 9/1998, the amounts set by the county commission had to be adjusted for inflation if they were not paid in the year they were awarded. on 21 february 2005 the bucharest court of appeal reversed the decision, and ruled that the applicant was not entitled to an adjustment for inflation. the appellate court concluded that the county court had interpreted the applicable law incorrectly, as the entitlement to adjustment for inflation had to be determined on the basis of the date when the central commission had ratified the decision of the county commission. as the payment had been made uno ictu, and not in instalments, during the same year as the central commission took its decision, the applicant was not entitled to an adjustment for inflation. it also concluded that the failure of the central commission to ratify the decision of the county commission within sixty days could not represent a legal basis for the adjustment of the amount in question.
the applicant was born in 1936 and lives in skokie, usa. on 31 august 1998 the applicant lodged a request with the bucharest commission for implementing law no. 9/1998 (the county commission) seeking compensation for assets owned by her ancestors and transferred to the bulgarian state. on 29 april 2004 the county commission issued a decision whereby the applicant was entitled to compensation of rol 4,991,284,506 (approximately eur 123,500 at the time). between 2005 and 2008 the applicant lodged several applications with the national authority for property restitution (hereinafter “the national authority”) and the president of romania for payment of the compensation. on each occasion, the applicant was informed that her file was subject to ratification by the responsible authority for implementing law no. on 20 february 2009 the national authority issued the ratification decision, confirming the applicant’s entitlement to ron 499,128.43 (approximately eur 117,000 at the time). the decision mentioned that the payment would be made in two annual instalments, as provided for by the methodological rules for the implementation of the law, in force since 30 november 1998 and amended on 26 october 2007. to date, the applicant has not received the compensation or any indication as to when such compensation would be paid.

“the civil chamber of the court of cassation ... having examined the question of admitting [the respondents’ appeal lodged against the judgment of the civil court of appeal of 19 january 2007], found that it must be returned for the following reasons:
pursuant to article 230 § 1 (4.1) of [the ccp] an appeal on points of law must contain a ground [required by] article 231.2 § 1 of [the ccp]. the court of cassation finds that the admissibility grounds raised in the appeal on points of law[, as required by] article 231.2 § 1 of [the ccp], are absent. in particular, the court of cassation considers the arguments raised in the appeal on points of law concerning a possible judicial error and its consequences, in the circumstances of the case, to be unfounded.” this decision became final from the moment of its pronouncement and was not subject to appeal. on 19 july 2007 the respondents lodged another appeal on points of law with the court of cassation against the judgment of the court of appeal of 19 january 2007, alleging violations of substantive and procedural law. as a ground for admitting their appeal the respondents indicated, besides the grounds mentioned in their first appeal on points of law, that the contested judicial act contradicted a judicial act previously adopted by the court of cassation. on 2 august 2007 the court of cassation decided to admit the appeal for examination, finding that it complied with the requirements of articles 230 and 231.2 § 1 of the ccp. on 10 october 2007 the court of cassation examined the appeal on the merits and decided to grant it by quashing the judgment of the civil court of appeal of 19 january 2007 and validating the judgment of the shengavit district court of 14 september 2006. on 15 november 2007 an ownership certificate was issued in the name of the respondents in respect of 115.4 sq.

the facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, are similar to those in association “21 december 1989” and others v. romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 may 2011). they have the same historical context and relate to the same domestic criminal proceedings. between 17 and 28 december 1989, many people, including the applicants and the close relatives involved in this case, took part in anti‑communist demonstrations in bucharest, timișoara, slobozia, vișina and țăndărei, which led to the fall of the communist regime. they were injured or killed by gunfire during the demonstrations, which took place on 17 december 1989 in timișoara, and in bucharest and other cities across the country from 21 to 28 december 1989. in 1990, following the overthrow of the communist regime, the military prosecutor’s office opened a criminal investigation into the december 1989 armed crackdown on the anti-communist demonstrations in bucharest and the other cities. in a number of cases concerning the events in timișoara, the investigations culminated in referral to the courts and the conviction of senior military officers (see şandru and others v. romania, no. as regards the events in other cities, the criminal investigation is still pending before the prosecuting authorities. the most important procedural steps were summarised in association “21 december 1989” and others (cited above, §§ 12-41). subsequent developments in the investigation are as follows. on 18 october 2010, the military prosecutor’s office at the high court of cassation and justice decided not to institute criminal proceedings with regard to the acts committed by the military, finding that the applicants’ complaints were partly statute-barred and partly ill-founded. the investigation into crimes committed by civilians, members of patriotic guards, members of militia and prison staff was severed from the case file and jurisdiction was relinquished in favour of the prosecuting authorities at the high court of cassation and justice. on 15 april 2011 the chief prosecutor at the military prosecutor’s office set aside the decision of 18 october 2010 on the grounds that the investigation had not yet been finalised and that not all the victims and perpetrators had been identified. on 18 april 2011 the military prosecutor’s office relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the prosecutor’s office at the high court of cassation and justice on the grounds that the investigation concerned both civilians and military personnel. on 9 march 2012 - following the opening of the classified information in the criminal investigation file to the public in 2010 - the case was re-registered with a view to an investigation in the light of the newly available data. following the entry into force of the new code of criminal procedure in february 2014, jurisdiction over the case was relinquished in favour of the military prosecutor’s office. on 14 october 2015, the prosecutor’s office closed the investigation, finding that the applicants’ complaints were partly statute-barred, partly subject to an amnesty and partly ill-founded. it also found that some of the facts which had been investigated could not be classified as criminal offences; and that some of the facts were res judicata. the parties have not submitted any information on whether there was an appeal against that decision.

the applicant, who is of roma origin, was born in 1988 and lives in gyöngyöspata, a village of 2,800 people, about 450 of whom are of roma origin. between 1 and 16 march 2011, in connection with the demonstration, the civil guard association for a better future (szebb jövőért polgárőr egyesület) and two right-wing paramilitary groups (betyársereg and véderő) organised marches in the roma neighbourhood of the village. on 6, 9, and 10 march 2011, during the demonstration and the marches, there was a considerable police presence in gyöngyöspata. the president of the local roma minority self-governing body, informed the police that he and the mayor of the municipality had been threatened by people they did not know. at this time the applicant was outside the house in her garden together with her daughter and some acquaintances. in response to the four men, the applicant and her acquaintances told them to leave, saying that it was their village. at around 2 p.m. on the same day police officers k.k. the mayor of gyöngyöspata identified two of them, mr s.t. as having participated in the incident that morning. on 7 april 2011 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against “unknown perpetrators” with the heves county regional police department, alleging offences of violence against a member of an ethnic group, harassment and attempted grievous bodily assault. the president of the local roma minority self-governing body. on 12 april 2011 the applicant was heard as a witness concerning the events. she testified that three men and a woman had passed by her house and one of them, brandishing a whip, had threatened to build a house out of her blood. subsequently, the applicant was informed that her complaint had been joined to that of mr j.f. on 14 september 2011 a hearing was held in the ensuing minor offence proceedings in which mr s.t. questioned as a witness, maintained that two of the persons subject to the proceedings had been wielding an axe and a whip and had threatened the inhabitants of the roma settlement that they would kill them and paint the houses with their blood. who had threatened the inhabitants of the roma settlement. the applicant, who was also heard as a witness, identified mr s.t. on 20 october 2011, in the criminal proceedings on charges of harassment, the applicant’s lawyer requested the gyöngyös district prosecutor’s office to open an investigation into “violence against a member of an ethnic group” under article 174/b (1) of the criminal code. he maintained that the motive of the threats uttered against the applicant was her roma origin. were established by the investigating authorities. moreover, the police department questioned a number of witnesses, including the applicant’s acquaintances present during the incident, but only two of them provided statements relevant for the case. on 2 february 2012 the gyöngyös police department discontinued the investigation into harassment on the grounds that none of the witnesses heard had substantiated the applicant’s allegation that she had been threatened. had confirmed only that threats had been made, but not that they had been directed against a certain person. and two other individuals suspected of the offences. the prosecutor’s office found that it could not be established on the basis of the witness testimonies whether mr s.t. had been armed and whether the threats and insults he had uttered had been directed at the applicant. thus neither the criminal offence of harassment, nor “violence against a member of a group” could be established. this decision was served on the applicant on 2 april 2012, informing the applicant of the possibility to pursue substitute private prosecution proceedings. on 6 november 2012 the criminal proceedings were discontinued since the applicant had withdrawn the charges, in her submission, because of for fear of reprisals.
the applicant was born in 1944 and lives in bucharest. in 1984, the applicant, a professional photographer, took a number of photographs of landscapes in călăraşi county that had been commissioned for commercial publication in an album. the album was not, in the event, published, but the photographs were retained by f.g., in 2004, the applicant discovered by chance that an album named “călăraşi county” had been published by a company run by f.g. he noticed that of the 143 photographs of landscapes from călăraşi county contained in the album, 135 were photographs taken by him and left in the possession of f.g. was credited as the photographer, and not the applicant. the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against f.g. with the romanian copyright office (“the rco”) on 25 february 2004, claiming that f.g. had committed one of the offences provided for by articles 140‑142 of law 8/1996 on copyright and neighbouring rights (“law 8/1996”). he joined a civil action to the criminal complaint, seeking compensation amounting to eur 50,000 for pecuniary and non‑pecuniary damage. on 29 june 2004, a report was drawn up by the rco following an investigation carried out at the headquarters of the company that had published the album. after finalising its investigation and concluding that the provisions of article 140 § 1 let. a) of law 8/1996 had been infringed, the rco forwarded the applicant’s complaint, together with the accompanying documents, to the călăraşi police department on 5 november 2004. on 8 november 2004, an expert report was ordered by the călăraşi police department. the report, dated 24 december 2004, confirmed that the photographs had been taken by the applicant. on 21 april 2005, the prosecutor’s office attached to călăraşi county court decided not to open a criminal investigation on the ground that the limitation period for the punishment of f.g. the applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with the chief prosecutor. the latter confirmed the decision not to open an investigation. a complaint lodged by the applicant with the călăraşi county court was allowed on 24 november 2005. the court held that the period between 27 april 1999 (the date of publication of the album) and 25 february 2004 (the date on which the applicant lodged his complaint with the rco) was less than five years – the term of limitation provided by law. it added that the procedure stipulated by law 8/1996 was a special procedure for the punishment of offences related to copyright, which was justified by the complexity and exceptional nature of such cases. therefore, the court held that in the light of the special provisions applicable to the file, the date from which the term of limitation of five years should have been calculated was not the date on which the rco forwarded the file to the police (5 november 2004) but the date on which the applicant lodged his complaint with the rco (25 february 2004). accordingly, the călăraşi county court remitted the file to the prosecutor’s office in order for it to initiate criminal proceedings. on 17 february 2006, the bucharest court of appeal allowed an appeal by the prosecutor against the judgment of 24 november 2005 and held that the case had become time-barred, given that the police had received the criminal complaint only on 5 november 2004 – more than five years after the offence had been committed. no reference was made to the civil complaint lodged by the applicant.

the applicants were born in 1957, 1961, 1966, 1970 and 1946 respectively and lived until their arrest in st petersburg. it was named after one of the applicants as “shutov’s gang”. at the time, mr shutov was serving as a member of the st petersburg legislative assembly. on 20 january 1999 a criminal investigation into the gang’s activities was opened. the applicants were arrested on the following dates:
-  mr gimranov and mr dodonov on 26 january 1999;
-  mr denisov on 13 february 1999;
-  mr shutov on 16 february 1999; and
-  mr filimonov on 7 march 2001. the city court did not examine in detail the need or grounds for continuing detention and extended the applicants’ pre-trial detention by repeating the contents of earlier orders. all of the extensions were upheld on appeal. on 26 january 2001 the preliminary investigation was completed. mr denisov, mr gimranov, mr dodonov, mr shutov and twelve other individuals implicated in the gang’s activities were charged with multiple counts of aggravated murder, kidnapping, armed robbery and extortion. 7806) were transmitted to the city court, where it reached on 29 january 2001. on 13 april 2001 mr filimonov was indicted in separate proceedings for similar offences and his criminal case was transmitted to the city court and consolidated with case no. the trial continued, with few interruptions, until 15 february 2006. on 12 february 2004 the applicants applied to have their case examined by a jury. on 27 may and 23 august 2004 the defence unsuccessfully challenged the lay judges ms i. and ms m., on the grounds that they lacked the requisite credentials. the prosecutor explained to the court that mr shutov suffered from different health ailments and constantly required medical supervision which was not possible in the courtroom as there was no on-site medical stuff present in the court building, unlike in the remand prison which had a permanent medical post. between 27 august 2004 and 17 february 2006 thirty-seven individuals were admitted to attend the hearings taking place in iz-47/1. on 15 june 2000 mr denisov and g., the lawyer representing him at the time, signed a form acknowledging that they had received sixty-five files of the criminal case for review. on 16 august 2000 the head of the criminal investigation unit gave mr denisov a formal warning for delaying the review of the case documents for no valid reason and notified him that the time allocated to him for studying the case material might be reduced. on 6 september 2000 the head of the criminal investigation unit reported that because mr denisov had intentionally delayed the review of the case documents and had refused to review them on several occasions, he and his lawyer had been given eighty days to finish the review, and by 15 january 2001 at the latest. on 29 september 2004 the city court informed the applicants’ lawyers, including k., that they could study the case documents every afternoon after the hearings and during working hours on fridays. in particular, he stated that each detainee in his cell had only been allocated 1.5 square metres of space. on 28 september 2004 the city court had refused to allow his second legal counsel k., who had entered the proceedings that day, time to study the case file. on 2 december 2004 and 27 june 2005 his remaining legal counsel k. had requested access to certain evidence and procedural documents. the request had been granted only in part. they had continued to represent him, but according to the applicant, they had not effectively participated in the defence. on 15 february 2006 the city court convicted the applicants and twelve other defendants of multiple counts of organising a criminal group, murder and assault, preparing explosive devices and unlawfully storing and carrying firearms. (a)  mr shutov’s request to participate in appeal proceedings 50. he did not request to be present during the hearing. on 30 august 2006 he was informed that the hearing of his case on appeal would start on 16 november 2006 in the supreme court of russia (hereinafter “the appellate court”). on 29 june 2006 the appellate court granted mr dodonov’s request to participate in the appeal hearing of his case.
the applicant was born in 1971 and is currently in detention in warsaw. on 17 january 2006 the applicant was arrested and detained on remand. he was suspected of the murder of two people and of inciting the murder of another person who had intended to testify against him in a separate set of proceedings. he was subsequently convicted several times for various offences. in particular, on 27 february 2013 the warsaw regional court convicted him of murder. on 19 january 2006 the warsaw remand centre penitentiary commission (“the commission”) classified the applicant as a dangerous detainee. the decision stated as follows:
“the commission hereby decides that [the applicant] is to be placed in a designated wing or cell in a remand centre in conditions which provide increased protection for society and for the security of the remand centre. the commission approves the proposals of the directors of the protection and prison wings. the detainee has been informed of his right to appeal against the commission’s decision within seven days to the warsaw regional court, xi penitentiary division.” the last sentence of the decision contained information about who was to be informed about the applicant’s placement in a cell for dangerous detainees. the applicant did not appeal against that decision. the commission reviewed and upheld its decision to classify the applicant as a dangerous detainee on several occasions. in total, there were over thirty decisions to extend the period of imposition of the regime in respect of the applicant. all the decisions were based on the same pattern of wording, which read as follows:
“the commission has decided to extend [the applicant’s categorisation as a dangerous detainee] as the reasons for his placement in a cell in conditions which provide increased protection for society and for the security of the remand centre have not ceased to exist.” in particular, a decision of 3 january 2013 to extend the imposition of the dangerous detainee regime on the applicant referred to the seriousness of the charges against him and his highly deficient moral character. an appeal by the applicant against the latter decision was the only one he made against the series of decisions to impose and extend the dangerous detainee regime on him. on 30 january 2013 the warsaw regional court dismissed the appeal. the court held that the decision had been lawful. on 21 november 2013 the commission lifted the dangerous detainee regime applied to the applicant. the applicant was kept in a cell which was constantly monitored via closed‑circuit television. he was subjected to a body search every time he left or entered the cell, which meant in practice that he had to strip naked in front of prison officers.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in the united states of america. it therefore ordered that these objects be restored at no cost. the judgment became final on 7 may 1996, no appeal having been lodged against it. the petrol station and fuel tanks were subsequently expropriated in the public interest. on 25 march 1998 the ministry of economy challenged the lawfulness of the district court’s judgment of 24 april 1996 (see paragraph 11 above) recognising the landowners’ property rights. on 12 may 2000 the supreme court joint benches gave two separate decisions by accepting both applications for supervisory review and the reopening of the proceedings. the applicant took part in them as a third party. in the second set of rehearing proceedings, the case was heard by the court of appeal and the supreme court, which on 27 october 2005 decided to remit the case to the court of appeal for fresh consideration. the domestic courts ruled in favour of the landowners. m in one of the forms prescribed by law, the remaining 56,500 sq. m having already been decided upon by the authorities. 604/07, 43628/07, 46684/07 and 34770/09, 31 july 2012). on 18 january 1996 one of the landowners, acting on his own and the remaining heirs’ behalf, concluded an agreement (akt marrëveshje) with the applicant’s company, according to which the latter would secure finance for the privatisation of fuel tanks and installations located on the landowners’ plot of land, in respect of which they would exercise their right of first refusal (e drejta e parablerjes) at the time of privatisation. on 10 october 2002 the landowners instituted proceedings against the applicant seeking the annulment of the agreements and contract concluded between february and may 1996 (see paragraphs 21-24 above). the claim was signed by their lawyer, to whom they had given power of attorney. the claim was signed by only their lawyer. on 20 october, 11 and 18 november 2005 and 27 february 2006 the applicant, having regard to the number of previous requests that had been rejected, challenged the bench. on 9 december 2005 the president of the district court set aside the withdrawal, finding that it did not contain any of the grounds stipulated in article 72 of the code of civil procedure. it found them to be fictitious on the grounds that they had been concluded at a time when the said property in question was being administered by the state, no property rights having been transferred to the landowners. in this connection, the withdrawal of the presiding judge of the bench had not been accepted by the president of the district court and his four requests for the withdrawal of the bench were rejected, no such mention having been made in the hearing records. finally, he claimed that the contracts had been concluded in complete conformity with the domestic law and that there had been no need to summon witnesses. in this connection, the landowners had confirmed the applicant’s ownership of the plot of land by way of specific powers of attorney, while the applicant had lodged numerous procedural requests, applications and appeals and had attended hearings to defend his and their property rights. on the same date he requested that thirty-nine items of evidence and twenty procedural requests absent from the case-file before the district court be readmitted. on 19 february 2007 the deputy president of the court of appeal requested the minister of justice to appoint three judges from other appellate courts to hear the case, since all of its judges had sat in the proceedings. on 29 march 2007 the applicant challenged the new composition of the bench, submitting that the hcj should appoint judges from other ordinary appellate courts instead of the military court of appeal. on 25 may 2007 the court of appeal, composed of three judges, upheld the district court’s judgment of 18 april 2006 (see paragraph 33 above). (c)  proceedings before the supreme court 42. on 18 march 2010 the applicant lodged an eighty-three page constitutional appeal. on 15 september 2010 he supplemented it with a fifteen-page memorandum. in addition to maintaining the same grounds of appeal he had raised before the lower courts, the applicant also complained of a lack of reasoning in the supreme court’s decision and about the length of the proceedings.
the applicants were born in 1959 and 1947 respectively and live in the village of sinemorets, on the southern black sea coast. the two of them have lived as a family since 1989. the first applicant’s father and mother owned a plot of 625 square metres in sinemorets. on the plot, there existed a dilapidated one-storey cabin. in 2005 he was recognised as a disabled person and has since then been in receipt of a disability pension. they submitted that they put all their savings into the reconstruction of the cabin, converting it into a solid one-storey brick house. they did not apply for a building permit. the reconstruction took place in 2004-05. since that time, the two applicants have lived in that house. in 2006 two of the other co-owners of the plot formally notified the first applicant that they did not agree with the reconstruction. in 2006 the other ten heirs of the first applicant’s father and mother brought a claim against the first applicant, seeking a judicial declaration that they were the owners of 140.57 of the 625 shares of the plot and of the house built on it. the tsarevo district court dismissed the claim. it also held that the first applicant was the owner of the remaining 484.43 shares of the plot and the house. the first applicant attempted to appeal on points of law, but in a decision of 22 june 2009 (опр. the supreme court of cassation refused to admit the appeal for examination. the applicants used the money to buy a second-hand car. in september 2011, prompted by some of the other co-owners of the plot, municipal officers inspected the house and found that it had been constructed illegally. they notified their findings to the first applicant in october 2011. in october 2012 that office advised the first applicant that it had opened proceedings for the demolition of the house. on 30 september 2013 the head of the regional office of the directorate noted that the house had been constructed in 2004-05 without a building permit, in breach of section 148(1) of the territorial organisation act 2001, and was as such subject to demolition under section 225(2)(2) of that act (see paragraphs 25 and 26 below). the first applicant had not put forward any arguments or evidence to show otherwise. once the decision had become final, the first applicant was to be invited to comply with it voluntarily. if she failed to do so in good time, the authorities would enforce it at her expense. the first applicant sought judicial review of that decision. on 10 december 2014 the burgas administrative court dismissed the claim. the house could not be exempted from demolition under paragraph 16 of the transitional provisions of the 2001 act or paragraph 127 of the transitional and concluding provisions of a 2012 act for the amendment of the 2001 act (see paragraphs 28 and 29 below). in a final judgment of 17 march 2015 (реш. the supreme administrative court upheld the lower court’s judgment. on 18 august 2015 the burgas municipal ombudsman urged the minister of regional development to halt the demolition on the basis that, although formally lawful, it would have a disproportionate impact on the applicants. after the government were given notice of the application (see paragraph 4 above), on 15 october 2015 the directorate’s regional office asked the municipal authorities to explore whether, if necessary, they could provide alternative accommodation for the first applicant.
the applicants were born in 1950, 1979, 1988, 1958, 1947, 1927 and 1932 respectively. they live in plovdiv, apart from ms asthig hampartsum bedrosyan, who lives in new york, united states of america. before her death in 2014, ms anaiys hampartsum shirin lived in burgas. ancestors of the applicants owned a plot of land measuring 246 square metres in the old part of plovdiv, which had a two-storey house built on 160 square metres of it. in 1949 the building was declared a cultural monument. in 1966 the property was expropriated and the applicants’ ancestors received compensation. after that, the building was the subject of substantial renovation work, in particular after a fire destroyed part of it in 1978. after the adoption of the restitution of property expropriated under building planning legislation act (“the restitution act”) in 1992 (see paragraph 15 below), some of the applicants and other heirs of the original owners (from whom the remaining applicants succeeded in the course of the domestic proceedings) applied for the revocation of the expropriation. on 28 june 1993 they were informed that their application had been refused by the mayor of plovdiv municipality, and on 7 july 1993 they applied for judicial review of that refusal. in a judgment of 9 october 1997 the plovdiv regional court upheld the administrative decision. however, in a final judgment of 2 october 1998 the supreme administrative court reversed. it found that the applicants’ property had been taken under legislation regulating expropriations made with a view to carrying out public works, namely expropriations intended to be followed by the construction of new buildings or infrastructure. the property in issue, however, had been declared a cultural monument, and had been expropriated to be used as such, thus the expropriation had been in breach of the law. the fact that no construction work had ever been envisaged had to be assimilated to a situation where no public works within the meaning of the restitution act had ever been commenced. in addition, the renovation work carried out after the expropriation did not represent “public works” either, as it had only aimed to preserve the building. lastly, it was noted that the property still existed. all of those factors meant that the preconditions for restitution had been fulfilled. on this basis, the supreme administrative court revoked the expropriation, quashing the mayor’s refusal in that regard. following the above judgment, in order to make the restitution effective (see paragraph 16 below), on 21 may 1999 the applicants paid back to the municipality the monetary compensation received by their ancestors at the time of the expropriation. the parties disagreed as to whether the applicants had also received compensation in the form of other property at the time of the expropriation, and whether they had to return that as well. in 2001 the applicants obtained a notarial deed, which named them as the property’s owners. despite the events described above, the applicants could not take possession of the property, because it was being held and used by the plovdiv municipality, which in 1997 had declared it a public municipal property and had rented a room in the building to an organisation called “13 centuries bulgaria” national endowment fund (“the fund”, see paragraphs 19-20 below). after unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate an agreement, in december 2003 the applicants brought rei vindicatio proceedings against the plovdiv municipality and the fund. the action was dismissed by a final judgment of the supreme court of cassation of 8 june 2007. in the first place, the domestic courts found that they were competent to examine the action. according to the second-instance plovdiv regional court, the judgment of 2 october 1998 was open to indirect judicial review, because it was replacing the mayor’s administrative decision on the applicants’ request for restitution, and did not have a res judicata effect in proceedings specifically concerning the right to property. according to the supreme court of cassation, the defendants to the rei vindicatio action, namely the plovdiv municipality and the fund, had not participated in the earlier judicial proceedings and therefore were not bound by the judgment of 2 october 1998. next, the domestic courts found that the reparation work carried out on the building which the applicants were claiming had been so substantial (the building’s appearance had been preserved, but the internal construction had been largely modified – the roof, some windows and other elements had also been replaced) that, within the meaning of the restitution act, it could not be said that the building still existed. in addition, the property was being used for the purpose for which it had been expropriated, namely as “a cultural monument”, which, in the courts’ view, constituted “public works” within the meaning of the same act. accordingly, none of the preconditions for restitution had been satisfied.
the applicant was born in 1987 and lives in tallinn. he was charged with causing serious health damage. according to the charges, at 4.30 a.m. on 22 april 2006, he, together with i.j., had repeatedly hit l. on the head outside a nightclub on harju street. l. had fallen to the ground and had then been kicked several times. he had sustained serious head injuries which had been life-threatening and caused him permanent health damage. were discontinued after his death in a car accident on 25 february 2007. the county court found that the witness statements were incoherent and that some were contradictory. merely because he was a friend of the applicant. as evidence, as well as identification reports drawn up during the pre-trial investigation identifying the applicant as one of the (probable) attackers of the victim, as their statements in the identification reports did not match their statements before the court. by a judgment of 30 april 2007 the county court acquitted him. he did not request a re-examination of the witnesses. however, the applicant informed the court in writing that he did not wish to take part and asked for the case to be examined in his absence. subsequently, the court heard the parties’ arguments. the court of appeal assessed the evidence differently, based on the material in the case file, and found that the applicant’s guilt was established. ’s and k.m’s statements and identification reports as evidence. the fact that she could not describe his clothing did not discredit her evidence. a person could only focus on a single detail rather than on the full picture. similar considerations were applied to k.m., who, moreover, had recognised the applicant at the county court hearing. another witness) – who had been together at the time of the events – had taken note of different aspects of the events did not render those statements unreliable; rather, it reflected the fact that the perception and memory of different people differed. at the identification procedure and in court render her statements unreliable. ’s statements in the identification report and in court, and therefore considered that the rejection of his statements as evidence had been not justified either. in conclusion, the court of appeal considered that k.a. the court of appeal also disagreed with the county court’s position concerning the reliability of s.g. had been friends, whereas the other witnesses had had no connection with them. he had said during the preliminary investigation that he had seen i.j. ’s statements according to which the last blow had been given by the applicant. the applicant appealed to the supreme court. he pointed out that the court of appeal had not directly verified the evidence; he referred in that respect to the conduct of the witnesses, which was of paramount importance in assessing their credibility but which was not reflected in the record of the court hearing.
the applicant was born in 1953 on the island of aruba. in 2013, while serving a sentence of life imprisonment in a prison in aruba, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. at the time the applicant was convicted and sentenced, the kingdom of the netherlands consisted of the netherlands (the realm in europe) and the netherlands antilles (consisting of the islands aruba, bonaire, curaçao, sint maarten, sint eustatius and saba). the conclusion reached by the psychiatrist was summarised as follows in the judgment (the conclusion and advice contained in the psychiatrist’s report are set out in full in paragraph 33 below):
“... that the defendant suffers from a pathological disturbance, in particular a very limited development of his mental faculties ... considering this, the defendant should be regarded as having diminished criminal responsibility (verminderd toerekeningsvatbaar), but nevertheless should mainly be held criminally liable for his actions. taking into consideration that the risk of recidivism is for the time being very high, even if treatment would possibly start immediately, and that, consequently, intensive surveillance is of primordial importance (such surveillance being impossible in the national mental hospital), and the fact that the defendant is not to be considered criminally insane within the meaning of the law, admission to the national mental hospital is wholly contra-indicated. the first instance court considered that a life sentence, the imposition of which had been sought by the public prosecutor, would only be condign punishment if it was established from the outset that the applicant’s condition was not amenable to improvement. on 24 november 1981 the applicant filed a request for revision with the joint court of justice which was rejected on 6 april 1982. some of which led to periods spent in solitary confinement. in a letter of 26 april 1982 the applicant requested that the minister of justice of curaçao review his life sentence and give him some kind of relief. a request lodged on an unknown date was rejected on 29 november 1983. it does not appear that the circumstances have changed. humanitarian grounds may be said to have been the basis for the transfer to the kia. murray claims that he has behaved like a model prisoner in the course of the past twenty-two years. our society cannot afford to take any risks with such a murderous psychopath. in my opinion it cannot be excluded that this solidly built 51-year-old man, with his serious criminal behaviour ..., and currently in the prime of his life, will once again reoffend. on 29 august 2013 the applicant requested a pardon in view of his deteriorating health. a section entitled “the position of the relatives of the victim” reads as follows:
“the relatives indicated at the hearing that they did not agree with a possible release of the convicted person. 8.4  the court will therefore first and foremost have to assess to what extent the risk of recidivism existing at the time is still present today. reported on the convicted person’s personality and the risk of recidivism. after all, and just as the experts have pointed out, prison life is very structured and circumstances such as those under which the convicted person committed his crime are absent there. advice: the rapporteur should wish to present his advice on the basis of the following questions: 1. reply: yes, he certainly is, and in particular from a very inadequate development of his mental faculties. can it be expected that the accused might commit the same offence again or disrupt public order in a different manner? the psychiatrist expressed her opinion that from a psychological point of view a transfer to aruba would benefit the applicant’s rehabilitation. he pents up his emotions and anger and hides them from those around him. ... [ that is why he is very distrustful of the people he encounters and displays antisocial behaviour. ... he is always polite and respectful towards prison staff; none of them have complaints about him. there are also signs of narcissistic features. it is reasonably certain that his personality will not change. in an email of 29 july 2014 to the applicant’s representative, the senior social worker in the aruba prison stated that there was nothing in the prison’s medical file on the applicant, who had been transferred to aruba in 1999, to suggest that he had undergone any treatment by a psychiatrist or a psychologist.
the applicant party is a turkish political party based in ankara. 2820 on political parties (“the political parties act”). the decisions delivered by the constitutional court in this regard are final. in keeping with the requirement under article 69 of the constitution and sections 74 and 75 of the political parties act, the applicant party submitted the consolidated final accounts of its headquarters and local branches for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 to the constitutional court for inspection. the constitutional court carried out a preliminary inspection on 1 july 2010 for the 2007 accounts and on 6 april 2011 for the 2008 and 2009 accounts. 213 on tax procedure (“the tax procedure act”) for all items of expenditure that had not been submitted previously. it was, however, unable to provide original invoices or the like for all the items of expenditure as requested. on 7 march 2012 the constitutional court delivered its decision regarding the final accounts of the applicant party for the year 2007, which was followed by decisions pertaining to the 2008 and 2009 accounts, both delivered on 11 july 2012. the contents of a receipt have been set out in section 237. under section 70 of the political parties act, ‘all expenses of a political party shall be incurred on behalf of the legal personality of that political party’ and pursuant to section 75 of the same act, ‘at the end of its inspection, the constitutional court shall determine the accuracy and the lawfulness of the political party’s income and expenses, and shall order the registration of unlawful income and expenses as revenue with the state treasury’. they included food, pharmaceutical and accommodation expenses, including those incurred by members of the party and employees of the party headquarters or its youth branches. although the applicant party argued that the expenses in question had been incurred by the relevant individuals while on official duty, the constitutional court did not accept them as lawful expenses since the invoices had been drawn up in the individual members’ or employees’ names, rather than in the name of the party. who appears to have hosted six dinners in 2008 in connection with election work. the constitutional court accepted two of those meals as lawful expenses in relation to party work, but rejected the remaining four without any explanation. the constitutional court also deemed costs for printing of business cards for employees to be unlawful, considering them to be personal expenses. blankets, umbrellas and raincoats purchased for use at the party headquarters were also found to be personal expenses, whereas no such finding was made for clothes and dishwashers purchased for the use of personnel. in addition, payments made to security and cleaning personnel in excess of the amounts specifically indicated in the service agreements, where such excess amounts – no matter how meagre – could not be explained by increases in social security contributions or taxes, were considered unjustified and thus unlawful. another payment that was considered unlawful by the constitutional court was made to halk tv, a nationwide television channel, for the live broadcasting of political rallies and activities attended by the applicant party’s leader and coverage of the party’s parliamentary group meetings, press conferences, and important statements made by the party’s senior management, as well as the distribution of that material to other media outlets. fuel and other expenses (such as installation of sound systems, speakers and microphones) for the vehicles owned or leased by the party and its local branches were accepted as having been made in the party’s name and for its purposes only where the vehicle registration certificates or lease agreements had been submitted to the constitutional court along with the invoices. as for fuel and other expenses for vehicles made available to the party by volunteers during the election campaigns, they were deemed entirely unlawful in the absence of any contracts with the volunteers for the use of the relevant vehicles. moreover, the constitutional court found that advance payments made to fifty-two employees in 2009 had only been partially repaid. although the applicant party had submitted the relevant payment orders, it had not provided bank statements demonstrating that the amounts ordered had actually been paid. the constitutional court warned the applicant party to submit such bank statements with its consolidated accounts to demonstrate that the payments in question had indeed been made. the constitutional court requested the applicant party to submit a technical report indicating when the work had been completed and a record stating that the bus had been duly delivered. the applicant party responded that there was no legal obligation to prepare such documents. yet another warning was issued about the incompatibility between the party’s expenses and its inventory, in that a number of items allegedly purchased for the party (three televisions and one computer) had not been registered in the inventory. the amount deducted thus totalled approximately try 3,549,000 (approximately eur 1,527,000 on 10 january 2013). on 31 october 2012 the applicant party received a letter from the ankara governor’s office ordering it to pay the amounts indicated in the constitutional court decisions concerning the review of the 2008 and 2009 final accounts, plus interest, which totalled approximately try 3,738,700 (approximately eur 1,604,000 as at 31 october 2012), within ten days of the receipt of the letter. it refused to pay the interest, which it contested before the relevant authorities. on 30 march 2014 local elections were held in turkey.
the applicants’ seventeen close relatives were members of an outlawed organisation in turkey, namely the maoist communist party (hereinafter “the mkp”). berna saygılı-ünsal was the fourth applicant mr tevfik fikret saygılı’s daughter;
v.  ali rıza sabur was the fifth applicant mr hıdır sabur’s brother;
vi. alattin ataş was the sixth applicant ms nari ataş’s son;
vii. binali güler was the eleventh applicant ms elif güler’s husband;
xii. when they failed to obtain any information there a lawyer representing one of the families went to see the local prosecutor. when all the bodies had been identified and autopsies carried out on them they were handed over to the families for burial. despite warnings to surrender issued by the security forces, the terrorists opened fire and injured a soldier. the prosecutor then ordered the destruction of the material which had no evidential or economic value. the operation was also supported from the air. the ovacık prosecutor, assisted by two doctors, arrived at the car park and examined the bodies. the prosecutor and the doctors noted in their report the extensive injuries they observed on the bodies. it was later established that ten of the identity papers belonged to the deceased and the remaining six identity documents were in the names of other people. finally, the three applicants asked the prosecutor to give them a copy of the documents from the investigation file. when the ovacık prosecutor received the applicants’ complaint he wrote to the ovacık magistrates’ court the same day and informed that court of his opinion that “when taken into account that [the three applicants] are related to the deceased members of the terrorist organisation, handing over to them documents from the investigation file would endanger the investigation”. on 29 june 2005 the ovacık prosecutor wrote to the forensic medicine institute’s headquarters in istanbul, stating that although autopsies had been carried out on the bodies of the seventeen at the malatya branch of the forensic institute, clothes belonging to some of the deceased had been returned to his office without examination, because there was no expert in malatya able to carry out that task. the applicants also challenged the logic behind the decision to restrict their access to the investigation file, and questioned how their involvement in the investigation, the aim of which was to establish the facts, would endanger it. also on 1 july 2005, the forensic laboratories of the police in diyarbakır published their reports on the swabs taken from the hands of the seventeen deceased. on 23 september 2005 the forensic medicine institute prepared its report in response to the ovacık prosecutor’s request of 29 june 2005 for the clothes worn by four of the deceased at the time they were killed to be examined. it was noted in the report that the holes observed on three of the four sets of clothes were not bullet holes. between september 2005 and june 2006 a number of ballistic examinations were conducted; the ovacık prosecutor was informed at the end of those examinations that the rifles and the spent cartridges found next to the bodies had not been used in any other incident. that was why they could not be formally identified in ovacık. thus, those press releases not only confirm that the deceased were members of the terrorist organisation, but also that they died in armed clashes with the security forces. the investigation documents, the nature of the weapons recovered, the other documents and information [in the file] and the fact that the deceased did not obey the security forces’ warning to surrender show conclusively that they were members of the mkp/hko and were acting in accordance with that organisation’s aims to change the constitutional order through armed struggle. in addition, it was openly stated in the press release issued by the terrorist organisation mkp/hko that all the deceased were members of the mkp/hko terrorist organisation. it was the terrorists who fired first, despite an order to surrender issued by members of the security forces. the response of the security forces to prevent the terrorists’ so-called last mission (the traps) which caused severe damage to the terrorists’ bodies must be regarded as a lawful action carried out within the ambit of ‘self-defence’ and ‘necessity’, because they acted with the aim of protecting their own physical integrity and lives. in recovering dead the members of the mkp/hko terrorist organisation, members of the security forces used their weapons in accordance with s. 24-25 of the turkish criminal code, article 2 § 2 of the echr and s. 17 § 4 of the turkish constitution, and they did so within the limits of their powers and duties. in their submissions the applicants also referred to the kemah report and drew attention to the discrepancies between that report and the ovacık report. in the ovacık report it was stated, however, that their relatives had been given warnings to surrender. the applicants argued that if the prosecutor had taken notice of the contents of the kemah report he would have seen that no warnings had been issued by the soldiers before they opened fire on their relatives.
the applicant was born in 1952 and lives in zagreb. they relied on extensive material obtained in the course of a preliminary investigation. the case immediately attracted wide media interest and coverage. he submitted extensive medical documentation showing that he had suffered a stroke in 2007. the applicant decided to remain silent and refused to give any evidence. the investigating judge found, on the basis of the available material, that there was a reasonable suspicion that in the period between october and december 1991, in his capacity as commander of a police unit, the applicant had ordered arbitrary arrests, ill-treatment and the killing of a number of civilians, and that, by not taking the necessary measures to prevent and punish those responsible, he had consented to a number of other arbitrary arrests, the unlawful confiscation of property, ill-treatment and the killing of civilians by his subordinates. during the investigation the investigating judge heard evidence from thirty-one witnesses and requested international legal assistance from the serbian authorities in obtaining evidence from the witnesses. on the basis of the evidence obtained during the investigation, on 9 june 2011 the zagreb county state attorney’s office indicted the applicant in the zagreb county court on charges of war crimes against the civilian population. the indictment listed twenty-two counts of arbitrary arrest, unlawful confiscation of property, ill-treatment and the killing of civilians. on 28 june 2011 the applicant lodged an objection against the indictment, arguing that it was not supported by any relevant evidence. on 4 october 2011 the zagreb county court commissioned an expert report concerning the possibility of the applicant following the trial. in a report of 14 december 2011 a court expert found that with the appropriate accommodation arrangements and medical supervision, the applicant could follow the trial. in the further course of the proceedings a number of hearings were held before the zagreb county court. on 12 december 2010 the investigating judge ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody for a further day. on 17 december 2010 a three-judge panel of the zagreb county court dismissed the applicant’s appeal as unfounded. furthermore, in view of the manner in which the war crimes against the civilian population under article 120 of the criminal code were allegedly committed by the defendant, and which are punishable by twenty years’ imprisonment, the investigating judge correctly found that the circumstances of the offences were particularly grave, warranting pre-trial detention under article 102 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure. these particularly grave circumstances of the offences concern, in the view of this panel, the manner in which the civilians ... were unlawfully and arbitrarily deprived of their liberty, how their property was confiscated without any legal basis, how they were physically and mentally ill-treated (often by the use of electric shocks) and eventually killed; and the fact that some of these unlawful acts were committed on the basis of the defendant’s orders, while the others he did not prevent although he was aware of them ...” 26. on 9 may 2011 the investigating judge extended the applicant’s detention for a further month under article 102 § 1 (2) and (4) of the code of criminal procedure (risk of collusion and gravity of charges), reiterating his previous arguments concerning the gravity of the charges and finding that five more witnesses needed to be questioned. the applicant appealed against that decision and on 27 may 2011 a three-judge panel of the zagreb county court dismissed his appeal as ill-founded, noting in particular that, in view of the gravity of the charges imputed to the applicant and given that he had been detained for some six months, there was still a predominant interest in keeping him in detention. it also considered that he should be remanded in custody until all the witnesses had been questioned. and subsequently exposed them to brutal torture, such as electric shocks through an induction telephone, cutting open muscles and wiring open wounds, severe beatings, physical ill-treatment, degrading treatment and locking them in rooms without beds or toilets. all of the above-mentioned circumstances, in the opinion of this panel, represent particularly grave circumstances that overcome the usually grave circumstances pertinent to such offences. ...
according to the indictment ... the behaviour of the accused, in the view of this second-instance court, significantly surpasses the ordinary circumstances and consequences of such offences, and represents particularly grave circumstances of the offence allegedly committed by the accused which warrant detention under article 102 § 1(4) of the code of criminal procedure. in his appeal, the accused alleged that there had been a serious breach of criminal procedure, without specifying his argument. the relevant part of the decision reads:
“in view of the competence of the supreme court as the highest court ensuring the coherent application of the law and the equality of everyone in its application (article 116 § 1 of the constitution), the likelihood of a prison sentence within the given term and the particularly grave circumstances of the offence, the constitutional court finds that the supreme court and the zagreb county court satisfied the relevant opinions and requirements when extending the pre-trial detention under article 102 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure ...” 37. on 28 november 2011 a three-judge panel of the zagreb county court extended the applicant’s detention under article 102 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure (gravity of charges) on the grounds that the reasons warranting his detention still persisted. the applicant challenged that decision before the supreme court and on 29 february 2012 the supreme court dismissed his appeal as ill-founded on the grounds that no doubts had been raised as to the findings of the zagreb county court. on 18 april 2012 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint, endorsing the extension of his pre-trial detention. the applicant challenged that decision before the supreme court. on 29 june 2012 the supreme court accepted his appeal and remitted the case for re-examination on the grounds that the decision of the zagreb county court lacked relevant reasoning.
the applicants were born in 1953 and 1950 respectively and live in ankara. meanwhile, on 6 august 2006 a gendarmerie officer, ş.k., according to a confiscation report drafted at 1.40 p.m. on that day and signed by ş.k. she believed that her husband had committed suicide. the experts compared the signature on the suicide note with two documents taken from aselsan. on the same day a further fingerprint analysis report was also issued. the experts noted that only four fingerprints could be analysed and that two of them belonged to mr hüseyin başbilen. on 29 august 2006, following examination of the hair and blood samples collected at the crime scene, the ankara police crime laboratory issued a report. according to the report, the blood and hair found in the car belonged to the deceased. they referred to a number of shortcomings in the investigation conducted by the ankara public prosecutor. they complained, in particular, about the failure of the public prosecutor to take statements from their son’s wife, the psychiatrist who had been treating mr hüseyin başbilen, and other possible witnesses, to have the deceased’s computer, his emails and the transcripts of his telephone conversations examined and to determine the date the suicide note file had been created on his computer. a minority expressed a dissenting opinion. a relative of the deceased who had gone to the crime scene together with the deceased’s father, made a statement to the ankara public prosecutor. on 31 january 2011 hasan başbilen made a statement to the ankara public prosecutor, in which he reiterated his suspicions regarding his brother’s death. made a statement to the ankara public prosecutor. stated that he had not looked into when the suicide note document had been created as he had limited knowledge of information technology and as he had not received an order to carry out such an analysis. the expert also noted a number of dubious issues. he contended that he had diagnosed the deceased with serious depression and had prescribed medication for his health issues. his colleagues also noted that the project on which he had been working had not been a critically important project and that his death had not had an impact on its running. the crime scene gendarmerie officers had showed the documents to aselsan officials and had asked whether they were important and should be returned to aselsan. on 21 september 2011 the deputy legal advisor at the air force command informed the ankara public prosecutor that the air force had not asked aselsan to develop software. on 12 december 2011 the ankara public prosecutor asked the forensic medicine institute to prepare a new report regarding hüseyin başbilen’s death. stated that he had heard from somebody that three cars had arrived in the village a day before hüseyin başbilen’s car had been found and that the deceased’s car had been one of them. they had then left the village and driven towards the cemetery. contended that he did not recall who had talked to him about this incident. the report concluded that the signature belonged to the deceased. on 16 july 2014 a public prosecutor from the office for investigating offences allegedly committed by civil servants (memur suçları soruşturma bürosu), attached to the ankara public prosecutor’s office, asked the ankara provincial gendarmerie command to form a task force and to reinvestigate the deaths of hüseyin başbilen and four other engineers who had also worked for aselsan. he also ordered the gendarmerie to find out whether the recordings were extant if they had not already been secured. on 29 september 2014 the ankara public prosecutor asked the gendarmerie command to instruct the officers in the task force to conduct a thorough investigation, to be in constant contact with the public prosecutor’s office and to provide information on the outcome, especially in view of the public interest in the investigation. according to the information in the case file, the investigation is ongoing.
the applicants were born in 1962 and 1958 respectively and live in sisak. both applicants denied the allegations against them. on the contrary, by using his authority as commander of the police units, he prevented the taking of necessary measures to identify the direct perpetrators and thereby condoned the unlawful actions of his subordinates and encouraged them to take such actions, accepting that they would continue with their actions and condoning their consequences. the applicants objected to the indictment. in the further course of the proceedings a number of hearings were held before the osijek county court, notably on 11-13 june; 2-4 and 9-11 july; 4-5 and 17-19 september; 9-10 and 15-17 october; 5, 7, 19, 20-21 november, 11-12 december 2012; as well as on 4-5 and 18-20 february; 18-20 march; 29 april; 14 and 28 june; 26 august; 29 september; and 14-16 october 2013. it acquitted the second applicant on the grounds of lack of evidence. on 10 june 2014 the supreme court upheld the acquittal of the second applicant and increased the first applicant’s sentence to ten years’ imprisonment. the judgment of the osijek county court thereby became final. thus the detention under article 102 § 1 (2) of the code of criminal procedure is justified. the description of the offences [referred to in the decision on opening of the investigation] suggests that the circumstances of the offences were particularly serious. in this respect the impugned decision provided relevant and detailed reasons, which this second-instance panel accepts. the first applicant appealed against that decision to the supreme court. on 17 october 2012 a three-judge panel of the osijek county court, relying on an expert report which indicated that there was no imminent risk to the first applicant’s health or necessity for urgent surgery, extended the first applicant’s detention. on 15 november 2012 the supreme court dismissed his appeal as ill-founded on the grounds that the osijek county court had correctly established all the relevant circumstances of the case warranting the extension of his detention. on 8 january 2013 the constitutional court dismissed his complaint as ill-founded, upholding the decision of the supreme court. the supreme court held as follows:
“it is therefore, in the view of this court, justified to remand the accused vladimir milanković in custody under article 102 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure ... in view of the fact that the purpose of detention under the cited provision is to prevent persons whose actions provoke particular moral condemnation from being at large, the appeal arguments, according to which the decision of the first-instance court with regard to the necessity of detention lacks the relevant reasoning, cannot be accepted.” on 7 november 2013 the constitutional court dismissed the complaint as ill-founded. in particular, the supreme court provided reasons showing that in view of the local circumstances in sisak and the [court’s] case-law relevant to the prevention of disturbance to public order (in the terminology of the supreme court: public disturbance), the appellant’s detention under article 102 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure was justified. ... following the first applicant’s conviction at first-instance on 9 december 2013 (see paragraph 15 above), he was remanded in custody pending a final judgment. the second applicant appealed against that decision to the supreme court, challenging the necessity of his detention and complaining of a lack of relevant and sufficient reasons for ordering it. the second applicant challenged that decision before the supreme court. on 27 august 2012 a three-judge panel of the osijek county court extended the second applicant’s detention under article 102 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure (gravity of charges), relying on its previous findings as to the gravity of the charges against him (see paragraph 39 above). ’s] sons z. and b. were taken to an improvised detention camp and beaten up, after which they disappeared. the remaining appeal arguments concern the assessment of evidence and the proceedings and are not decisive for the decision on detention. the second applicant challenged the decision of the supreme court by lodging a constitutional complaint before the constitutional court. on 18 april 2013 the constitutional court dismissed his complaint as ill-founded on the grounds that the lower courts, when extending his detention, had provided relevant and sufficient reasons. on 25 october 2013 the supreme court dismissed his appeal as ill-founded, endorsing the reasoning of the osijek county court. thus in the appellant’s case what the constitutional court indicated in its decision ... of 27 september 2013 was confirmed: that ‘every further reliance on the risk of public disturbance as a ground for extending the appellant’s detention could ... turn that ground for detention into a strong basis [for detention], which would mean in practice a constitutionally unacceptable and prohibited obligatory deprivation of liberty’. in october 2014, after he had been finally acquitted, the applicant instituted the friendly settlement procedure with the state concerning the compensation for his unjustified detention. on 15 october 2015, on the basis of the state’s partial admission of the claim, the osijek municipal court adopted a partial judgment and awarded him 108,900 croatian kunas (hrk; approximately 14,300 euros) in non-pecuniary damage plus the applicable statutory interest.

as regards sanitary conditions, lighting and ventilation problems continue to exist in the majority of living blocks in moldovan prisons, with the exception of taraclia prison no. in the prisons, with the exception of taraclia prison no. 1, detainees are held in large-capacity cells insufficiently equipped for their daily needs, namely areas for sleeping, for everyday living and for sanitary equipment. detainees are held in extremely overcrowded, dark, damp and unventilated spaces full of cigarette smoke. in certain prisons the bunk beds essentially prevent daylight from reaching the living space.”
the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in bucharest. on 11 october 2009 the ecopolis association, founded by the applicant and four other associates, opened proceedings before the bucharest district court to seek registration in the register of associations and foundations kept by that court. it also asked the court to grant it legal personality. the association’s goal, as declared in its memorandum of association (act constitutiv) and in article 2 of its articles of association (statutul asociației), was that of promoting the principles of sustainable development at the public policy level in romania (promovarea principiilor dezvoltării durabile la nivelul politicilor publice din românia). by an interlocutory judgment of 24 october 2009, delivered in private, the bucharest district court granted the association legal personality and ordered its registration in the register of associations and foundations. the court held that the organisation had attached all the lawfully required documents to the application for registration and that the documents had complied both in form and content with the requirements set out by government ordinance no. moreover, the goal set by the association complied with the provisions of articles 1 and 4 of that ordinance. the bucharest public prosecutor’s office lodged an appeal on points of law (recurs) against the interlocutory judgment of 24 october 2009. it argued that it interpreted the association’s declared goal as belonging to the field of activities of a political party. that interpretation was supported by the association’s objectives and by the activities it planned, as set out in articles 7 and 8 of the articles of association. however, a political party could not be registered under the provisions of government ordinance no. by a final judgment of 10 february 2010 the bucharest county court allowed the appeal on points of law by the public prosecutor’s office and rejected the organisation’s request for registration. it held that the goal of the association, as declared in its memorandum and articles of association, was that of promoting the principles of sustainable development at the public policy level in romania. also, according to article 7 of its articles of association, one of the association’s objectives was to increase expertise in the development of sustainable public policies in romania. the court considered that the concepts used by the organisation had been very general and had run the risk of being understood as belonging to the field of activities of political parties. the association’s objectives could likewise have been interpreted as belonging to the realm of activity of a political party, although government ordinance no. 26/2000 expressly prohibited the use of the ordinance for the registration of political parties.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in zagreb. the applicant was a co-owner of a block of flats on the island of vir. on 2 and 23 march 2006 building inspectors of the inspectorate of the ministry of the environment, spatial development and construction (ministarstvo zaštite okoliša, prostornog uređenja i graditeljstva, uprava za inspekcijske poslove) carried out an on-site inspection of the block of flats in question. on 31 march 2006 one of the building inspectors ordered that the block of flats be demolished within three days from the date of service of the decision. the applicant lodged an appeal against the demolition order, submitting that the time-limit for compliance was too short and that the block of flats was not within the protected coastal area. on 15 may 2006 the appeal section of the legal department at the inspectorate (odsjek za postupak u drugom stupnju – “the second-instance body”) dismissed the appeal, finding that the block of flats had been built without a building permit. meanwhile, on 4 may 2006 the building inspector issued an administrative enforcement order (zaključak o dozvoli izvršenja), stating that the demolition order of 31 march 2006 had become enforceable on 6 april 2006 and that the co-owners had not complied with it within the given time-limit. he therefore ordered that the demolition be carried out by a third party after 11 may 2006, at the expense of the co-owners. the applicant lodged an appeal against the administrative enforcement order, submitting that it was not sufficiently reasoned and that the construction of the block of flats could be retrospectively approved. on 23 may 2006 the second-instance body dismissed the appeal as ill-founded. on 27 june 2006 the co-owners had the block of flats demolished. meanwhile, on 26 june 2006 the applicant lodged an administrative complaint with the administrative court, repeating the arguments made in her appeal and seeking damages for the demolition. since it was not clear whether the applicant was complaining about the second-instance decision concerning the demolition order or the administrative enforcement, on 11 july 2006 the administrative court requested her to specify which she wished to contest. on 30 august 2006 the applicant replied that she was seeking annulment of the second-instance decision of 15 may 2006 concerning the demolition order. on 22 april 2010 the administrative court dismissed her complaint as ill-founded, but addressed it as if it had been about the second-instance decision of 23 may 2006 concerning the administrative enforcement. on 13 july 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint, alleging, inter alia, a violation of her right of access to court, on the ground that the administrative court had erroneously decided a matter which had not been the subject of her administrative complaint. on 13 december 2010 the constitutional court declared the constitutional complaint inadmissible, on the grounds that the contested decision had not concerned the merits of the case and as such was not amenable to constitutional review. this decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 7 january 2011.

the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in kavadarci. in april 2000, while criminal proceedings were pending against a certain mr i.a., the latter sold a lorry (“the lorry”) to a company, m. 7. on 13 june 2000 the skopje court of first instance (“the trial court”) convicted mr i.a. of smuggling nearly 9 tonnes of sugar, which he had transported in the lorry in november 1997. on 20 november 2001, following separate appeals by mr i.a. and the public prosecutor, the skopje court of appeal found the public prosecutor’s application immaterial (беспредметна) and quashed all aspects of this judgment. on 17 september 2003 the trial court convicted mr i.a. in the absence of an appeal, the judgment became final on 29 october 2003. on 12 june 2006 the kavadarci court of first instance (“the first-instance court”) enforced the confiscation order of 17 september 2003 against the applicant and issued a record of enforcement (записник за извршување). on 15 november 2006 the applicant objected to the enforcement of the confiscation order, arguing that mr i.a. had died on 21 march 2005 and that the confiscation order accordingly could not be enforced. there had been no injunction restricting the sale of the lorry. he had been the lawful owner and he had been making his living using the lorry. lastly, he stated that he had sought, in separate civil proceedings, return of the lorry (see paragraph 14 below). on 20 november 2006 the execution-of-sanctions judge of the trial court rejected the objection as inadmissible, finding that the applicant had no procedural standing. it further found that the applicant, as the third person from whom the lorry had been confiscated, could assume his rights under section 129(5) of the criminal proceedings act (see paragraph 25 below). however, he had been entitled to claim, in civil proceedings, return of the lorry. in this latter context, he identified the upgrades that he had installed in the lorry. on 10 may 2007 the first-instance court dismissed the applicant’s claim. for these reasons, the court dismisses the [applicant’s] main claim and also the alternative claim, because it concerns upgrades made to the [lorry]. but by the [applicant] as the bona fide possessor (совесен владетел), given that from the evidence it was established that when the offence was committed the [lorry] was owned by [mr i.a.] and the safety measure confiscation of the [lorry] was issued on those grounds. the court also considers groundless the [applicant’s] representative’s arguments that under section 129(5) of the criminal proceedings act the final decision for confiscation of the [lorry] could be amended with a decision in civil proceedings if there were a dispute concerning the ownership of the confiscated items, given that this provision would have been applied if the [lorry] had been sold to the [applicant] before the offence was committed and had, under any legal basis, remained in the factual possession of the convicted [mr i.a.] and he, after having sold it, committed the crime; but in the present case it is vice versa; firstly the offence was committed and then the [lorry] was sold.” he stated that he had previously requested that the first-instance court obtain evidence from the ministry of the interior which would confirm that mr i.a. from disposing of the lorry or to seize the lorry at the time the offence had been discovered. he also argued that he was the bona fide owner and that he had obtained title to the lorry by adverse possession (одршка). the lorry had been confiscated nine years after the offence had been committed. on 13 november 2007 this judgment was served on the applicant.

the applicant was born in 1958 and lives in tetovo. on 12 april 2006, the applicant concluded a sales contract (купопродажен договор) with a sh.a., for the purchase of a concrete mixing and transport lorry (“the vehicle”) for the equivalent of 5,000 euros (eur) in macedonian denars (mkd). on 15 may 2007 the applicant lent the vehicle to his company. on 6 october 2008 the ministry of the interior temporarily seized the vehicle and its registration certificate (сообраќајна дозвола) from the applicant in order to examine the vehicle’s chassis (проверка на шасија). a record of temporarily seized objects (потврда за привремено одземени предмети) was issued. on 1 february 2010 the struga court of first instance (“the first-instance court”) acquitted sh.a. of charges of forgery of a document (“фалсификување исправа“) concerning the vehicle’s chassis number and rejected an indictment brought by a public prosecutor against a certain i.s. the court found that during the trial it had not been established that sh.a. in accordance with section 102(3) of the criminal proceedings act (see paragraph 18 below), the court further advised the applicant, who had claimed compensation in the criminal proceedings, to pursue the claim by means of a separate civil action before the civil courts. on 21 july 2010 the judgment became final. on 16 november 2010 the applicant requested that the first-instance court return the vehicle in his possession. on 3 december 2010 the first-instance court heard evidence from the applicant, who stated that he had bought the vehicle from sh.a. he further stated that he could not have been aware at the time that the chassis number of the vehicle had been forged. on 6 december 2010 the first-instance court, relying on article 100‑a (3) of the criminal code (“the code”, see paragraph 17 below), found that there were no grounds for confiscation of the applicant’s vehicle. the applicant had not known nor could he have known that the vehicle had been used to commit a crime. the court also ordered that the registration certificate be returned to the applicant. upon the public prosecutor’s appeal, on 24 january 2011 the bitola court of appeal (“the appellate court”) quashed that decision. relying on article 100-a (2) of the code, the appellate court found that the vehicle’s chassis had been forged and that the vehicle, in the interest of public safety, could not be declared roadworthy. it further referred to section 100-a (3) of the code and instructed the first-instance court to assess whether the continued use of the vehicle would constitute a “use of a forged document” offence under the code (употреба на фалсификувана јавна исправа, see paragraph 17 below). on 22 february 2011 the first-instance court dismissed the applicant’s application and ordered the confiscation (се одземаат) of the vehicle and its registration certificate. it referred to article 100-a (2) and (3) of the code and found that the vehicle’s chassis number had been forged and that the vehicle could be used for committing an offence. for that reason and for the reasons of road safety, it was necessary to confiscate the vehicle and the registration certificate. it also referred to section 532(1) of the criminal proceedings act (see paragraph 18 below) and found that, irrespective of the fact that there had been no proceedings against the applicant and that he was not an offender, it was necessary to confiscate the vehicle for general safety reasons. on 11 march 2011 the applicant appealed arguing that the first-instance court had wrongly applied article 100-a (2) and (3) of the code and that he had not known that the vehicle had been used to commit a crime. on 19 may 2011 the appellate court dismissed the appeal and upheld the first-instance court’s decision. the relevant part of the decision states as follows:
“[the arguments] raised in the appeals, [namely] that the first-instance court had not established the decisive facts concerning [the certitude] that the [applicant] had not known that the vehicle’s chassis had been forged, which was decisive, are groundless. specifically, it is true that [the applicant] did not know that the vehicle’s chassis had been forged, as a result of which [he] registered the vehicle as its last buyer, [he was] issued a driving licence and [he] paid a large amount. it appears that the latter decision was served on the applicant on 2 june 2011.
at the time of the events, she was living with her daughter, who was a minor, in a flat in kyiv. on 8 march 2005 criminal proceedings were instituted against b. for document forgery committed in conspiracy with others. on that day the police recorded telephone conversations between b. and the applicant which suggested that certain documents relating to his driving licence and his study in the driving school had been kept in her flat. the recorded conversations were later documented in a report on 31 october 2005. on 10 march 2005 an investigator with the pivdenno-zakhidna railway police department, who was dealing with the criminal case against b., applied to the shevchenkivskyy district court in kyiv for search warrants for two flats, including the one belonging to the applicant, where, according to the investigator, b. permanently resided. on 11 march 2005 the shevchenkivskyy district court of kyiv issued the search warrants. only the investigator was present at the hearing. upon their arrival, the investigator and the other police officers present found that the flat was locked and that nobody responded when they rang the bell. according to the statements of the police officers, as submitted to the investigative authorities, they had contacted the applicant to inform her about the search. according to the applicant, on that day she and her daughter had left for their cottage outside the city; she had had her mobile phone with her and had not been contacted by the police. the police officers called a task force to open the door to the flat. once the door had been opened, the investigator and three police officers carried out the search, with two attesting witnesses and a representative of the building maintenance organisation in attendance. in the course of the search the police officers seized items of property, which they listed in a report. the list included, among other things: floppy disks, compact discs, vehicle registration certificates, keys, a box containing cash, certificates issued in b.’s name, a painting and an icon. she also found that some items of property not included in the list of seized items were missing: four mobile phones, top-up cards for mobile phones, jewels and a bottle of whisky. on 5 july 2005 the applicant was granted victim status and her civil claim was admitted to the file. it considered that the mobile phones had not been included in the list of seized items owing to a technical mistake. the phones had been given back to the applicant and, consequently, she had sustained no damage. it was concluded in the end that there had been no objective evidence to suggest that the police officers had neglected their duties. the applicant challenged that decision in court. as of 22 july 2011 the investigation was ongoing. no further information was provided to the court. on 16 june 2005 the kyiv transport prosecutor, having conducted a pre-investigation inquiry, refused to commence criminal proceedings in relation to the possible abuse of power or ultra vires actions by the police officers during the search of the applicant’s flat. in his decision, the prosecutor referred to the statement of a police officer that the applicant had been contacted on her mobile phone and informed that the search would be carried out, and the door to the flat had only been broken down after her refusal to appear. the prosecutor also stated that the search had been carried out in accordance with established procedure; it had been observed by two attesting witnesses and the representative of the building maintenance organisation, as required by the domestic law. on 21 june 2005 the applicant challenged the decision of 16 june 2005 in court. on 7 july 2005 the holosiyivskyy district court of kyiv found that the decision of 16 june 2005 was well-founded. the court further stated that the prosecutor had examined the search warrant, search report and other relevant documents, and had come to the correct conclusions when refusing to open an investigation. on 8 september 2005 the kyiv court of appeal upheld the decision of 7 july 2005, finding that the prosecutor had lawfully refused to open an investigation. the applicant’s contentions were dismissed as groundless.

the applicant was born in 1988 and lives in zagreb. who was a war veteran, killed the applicant’s mother and her parents and then committed suicide. on 19 june 1996 his request was dismissed by the competent zagreb office of the ministry of defence (ministarstvo obrane) in charge of war veterans’ affairs on the grounds that the war veteran status of his father had not been established. the applicant challenged this decision before the ministry, and on 15 january 2006 the ministry found that the facts of the case connecting the suicide of the applicant’s father to his participation in the war had never been clearly established. it thus ordered the zagreb office to clarify the matter by commissioning an expert report from the competent medical institution and to obtain the relevant witness statements concerning the applicant’s father’s wartime service. it also questioned two witnesses concerning the applicant’s father’s wartime service. this expert report was not forwarded to the applicant. on 26 september 2007 the zagreb office dismissed the applicant’s request for the family disability benefit referring to the centre’s expert report, which had not established any link between his father’s suicide and his participation in the war. the applicant challenged the above decision before the ministry, seeking remittal of the case to the zagreb office for further examination. he alleged that the centre’s report was superficial, since it had not been commissioned with regard to all aspects of the events, such as the triple murder committed by his father. he also stressed that any expert opinion on the matter should necessarily be forwarded to him for comments before the adoption of a decision. on 2 april 2008 the ministry dismissed the applicant’s appeal on the grounds that the centre’s report was conclusive that the suicide of his father had not been related to his participation in the war. he pointed out that the proceedings had already lasted excessively long and that the administrative bodies had failed to comply effectively with the previous instructions of the administrative court. he therefore considered that the administrative court should itself decide the case on the merits, as provided under section 63 of the administrative disputes act (see paragraph 25 below). the applicant also contended that, if the administrative court did not decide the case on the merits, it should quash the ministry’s decision and remit the case for re-examination. in his administrative action the applicant in particular pointed out that the ministry had failed to reply to the specific arguments set out in his appeal against the first-instance decision of the zagreb office and had merely reiterated the findings of the first-instance decision. he also reiterated his appeal arguments that the centre’s expert report was superficial and illogical, since it had not been commissioned with regard to all aspects of the events, such as the triple murder committed by his father, and that it had failed to take into account that before the war his father had had no psychiatric problems whereas after his wartime activities he had committed a triple murder and suicide. in these circumstances, the applicant stressed that under section 191 of the administrative disputes act another expert report ought to be commissioned from the permanent court experts in psychiatry. on 4 december 2008 the administrative court dismissed the applicant’s action as ill-founded. the report concluded that based on the relevant documents from the case file it did not find that ž.l. the defendant therefore correctly dismissed the appeal against the first-instance decision and thereby it did not act contrary to the relevant law. us-2377/00 [see paragraph 9 above] concerning the appellant’s request for family disability benefit, which is the subject matter of the proceedings at issue. although the defendant did not expressly reply to the appeal arguments concerning the necessity to request a report with regard to [ž.l. ’s] act of triple murder, [the court finds] that it could not be a decisive factor for a decision in the proceedings at hand. this is because such a criminal act cannot be a basis for the establishment of a link between the death of the war veteran and his participation in [the war]...” 20. on 18 february 2009 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) arguing that his right to a fair trial in the proceedings had been violated. on 27 may 2010 the constitutional court declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded, noting that:
“in his constitutional complaint, the complainant was unable to show that the administrative court had acted contrary to the constitutional provisions concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms or had arbitrarily interpreted the relevant statutory provisions. the constitutional court therefore finds that the present case does not raise an issue of the complainant’s constitutional rights. thus, there is no constitutional law issue in the case for the constitutional court to decide on. ...” the decision of the constitutional court was served on the applicant’s representative on 14 june 2010.
the applicant was born in 1992, and at the time of the introduction of the application was detained in lyster barracks detention centre, in ħal far. the applicant entered malta in an irregular manner by boat on 6 may 2012. the return decision also informed the applicant that her stay was being terminated and that she had the possibility to apply for a period of voluntary departure. the two documents further informed the applicant of her right to appeal against the decision and order before the immigration appeals board (“the iab”) within three working days. on 9 may 2012 the applicant was assisted to submit a preliminary questionnaire (pq), thereby registering her wish to apply for asylum under article 8 of the refugees act, chapter 420 of the laws of malta. the appeal decision reads as follows:
“the refugee appeals board refers to a fill-in-the-blanks form received in its office on 18 july 2012 and to a legal submission on your behalf received in its office on 8 october 2012. the board notes that you travelled to libya in december 2011, first via kenya and then via sudan. in none of these countries did you consider applying for refugee status. you also claim that your brother had been killed by a terrorist islamic organization, al shabab, because they thought he worked for the government. however, you also claim that if there was peace back home, you would be prepared to return. up to the date of the lodging of her application with the court on 19 august 2013 the applicant had heard no news about any steps being taken in connection with her removal. in practice malta effected no removals to somalia or somaliland. ever since her arrival in malta the applicant suffered from several medical problems, such as headaches, earaches and fainting, and was frequently hospitalised (see paragraphs 16-19 below). according to the referral form, filled in by an official of the jrs:
“sagal has been complaining of several medical problems ever since she arrived in malta. she had several appointments in hospital was also taken to emergency by ambulance after collapsing in detention. sagal was also rejected by the office of the refugee commission, causing her to be very depressed. every time we visit she is in her bed crying and showing signs of severe anxiety.” the interview was held in english and the applicant was assisted by another detainee who was not fluent in the language. her impression is that she was verbally informed that she would be released. the applicant submitted that although awas was not formally charged with the responsibility of this procedure by the law which set it up, in practice the agency had full responsibility for the procedure. however, in spite of the fact that this procedure can have a determining impact on the continued detention of individuals detained in terms of the immigration act, it was not adequately regulated by law or by publicly available rules or procedures. forms were distributed to individuals working in the sector such as ngos. the government submitted that the vulnerable adult assessment procedure was a quick process in straightforward cases (such as pregnant women and families with very young children) which were usually determined within two weeks. a certificate issued by a doctor in may 2012 confirmed that the applicant had been hospitalised on 7 and 8 may 2012 (upon her arrival in malta) for dehydration, she was seen again on 15 may and 15 june of the same year. she suffered “fits” and was waiting for an appointment. in none of these occasions was she kept under observation overnight, or hospitalised. she explained that the block is divided into five zones alike in terms of layout and facilities. she noted that zone d was less crowded but that it still lacked privacy and sanitation. the applicant highlighted the lack of female staff - in particular she noted that every morning male soldiers barged into her dormitory while the inmates were still asleep to make a head count, during which they removed the sheets to check for their presence. the applicant also complained of limited access to medical care, also because of a lack of interpreters to enable communication with medical staff.
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in turkey. he feared, in particular, that if he stayed in uzbekistan, he would face persecution from the state authorities, and would eventually be imprisoned and tortured like some of his fellow muslim friends. in support of his allegation of the risk of ill-treatment in uzbekistan, the applicant submitted a copy of a list of persons who had been charged with offences against the state. the list had been prepared by the human rights centre “memorial”, a non-governmental organisation based in moscow, and included the applicant’s name. from tajikistan, the applicant went on to afghanistan and pakistan. in 2005 he arrived in iran, where he settled in zahedan. he lived in zahedan for two years without experiencing any major problems. in 2007, however, together with some other uzbek asylum seekers who had left their country for the same reasons, the applicant decided to flee from iran following deportation threats. he claimed that the threats had been a response to certain disagreements with the iranian authorities over their living conditions. on 18 november 2007 the applicant entered turkey illegally through van and went to ankara to apply for refugee status at the unhcr. following a preliminary interview, the applicant was referred to the unhcr office in van. the van office issued him with an asylum seeker certificate. subsequently, he registered with the van police headquarters and started the domestic temporary asylum procedure. thereafter he was given a temporary residence permit until 24 september 2008 and was ordered to report to the police three times a week for signature. it appears that the other uzbek asylum seekers who had fled iran together with the applicant were granted similar certificates and permits after following the same procedural steps. on an unspecified date the van police sent a notice to a number of uzbek families requiring them to appear at the police station on 12 september 2008. their personal items, including identity documents, money and telephones, were confiscated. the applicant was allegedly ill‑treated and threatened by the police during deportation. the asylum seekers contacted some other uzbeks who had managed to escape deportation from turkey and obtained the ransom fee. the smugglers made them walk for three days to yüksekova, a town close to the iranian border of turkey, where they were released. after re-entering turkey illegally, the applicant went back to van together with the other uzbek asylum seekers. the same evening, they were deported to iran once again. the applicant, however, escaped this deportation by pure chance, as the police did not have his correct home address. in his reply dated 22 april 2009, in his capacity as head of the human rights commission of the van governor’s office, the deputy governor of van informed the applicant’s representative that the applicant and the other deportees had been removed to iran in compliance with the legislation in force and that iran was a safe third country where the applicant had lived before he had arrived in turkey in 2007. he has not received any information from the turkish authorities as to his request for asylum. when the applicant applied for asylum in turkey in december 2007, he informed the authorities that he had been granted refugee status in iran by the unhcr. on 14 february 2008 the applicant left van and returned there on 26 august 2008. he subsequently repeated his asylum request. he was subsequently deported to iran, a safe third country, where he was recognised as a refugee by the unhcr. according to the government, the applicant was not deprived of his liberty.
the applicant was born in 1982 and until his arrest lived in moscow. however, the person had had no intention of selling the equipment or returning the money. the next day the tverskoy district court of moscow (“the district court”) authorised his pre-trial detention until 16 september 2013, having regard to the seriousness of the charges against him and the risk of his absconding, reoffending and interfering with justice. he referred to, among other things, his poor health. on 13 january 2014 the district court dismissed the applicant’s request for release on bail or under a written undertaking not to leave moscow. it also addressed his arguments that he had become paraplegic and thus no longer posed a flight risk. for about a week after his arrest on 16 july 2013 the applicant was kept in a moscow police ward. throughout his detention he slept on an individual prison bunk. severe back pain was accompanied by numbness in the legs and resulted in him being unable to walk unaided. he spent the major part of his day in bed being assisted by his cellmates. they took him for walks in the prison yard, carried him to the toilet and washed him with wet towels, which was their way of showing that they were annoyed with his helplessness. the applicant submitted that on 24 october 2013 during his transfer to a court hearing in a standard prison van, he had again severely hurt his back and head. iz-77/1 in moscow for more comprehensive treatment. the hospital performed a number of medical tests, including blood and urine tests, a cat scan and a cerebrospinal fluid analysis. his health improved, but not significantly. the doctors were, however, unable to ensure any improvement in his conditions. however, his conditions still did not reach the level of severity to warrant his release. meanwhile, the applicant’s lawyer asked an independent medical specialist to provide an opinion on the quality of medical care afforded to the applicant in the remand prison. 77/1 was not licensed to provide neurological treatment or perform neurosurgery. his bedsores were a sign of insufficient medical attention. on 14 february 2014 the applicant was taken to remand prison no. according to the government, he shared his cell measuring around 11.4 square metres with another inmate. at the train station he was placed on board a standard train carriage, where he had to stay for four hours awaiting departure. after another two hours the train departed for kostroma. within the next hour a prison van took the applicant to a nearby remand prison, where he was detained from 2 to 6 march 2014. the parties disagreed whether the vehicles used to transfer the applicant, with the exception of the gazel minivan, were equipped to accommodate ill inmates. the applicant was placed in the medical unit of the colony. the sverdlovskiy district court of kostroma granted the request and on 3 july 2014 ordered his release. on 26 august 2014 the kostroma regional court upheld the order on appeal. two days later the applicant was released.
the applicants were born in 1968 and 1973 and live in belgrade (the first applicant) and skopje (the second applicant). as established in the criminal proceedings described below, on 7 january 2007, during a search carried out by the macedonian customs at the blace border crossing (between the respondent state and kosovo[1]) 434.555 kg of cocaine were found hidden in rectangular packs submerged in hermetically sealed cans of acrylic paint. the second applicant denied knowing that he had been transporting drugs. on 9 may 2007 the first applicant’s lawyer requested permission to inspect the case file. on 10 may 2007 the first applicant was incarcerated in skopje detention facility. on 11 may 2007 the investigating judge heard the first applicant in the presence of her lawyer. on 16 may 2007 she was heard for the second time. she had also given him the contact details of n., the montenegrin forwarding agent. j. also had given her the contact details of a buyer in greece regarding paint from a third container (the subject of the proceedings) and the telephone numbers of n.v. the first applicant had introduced herself by name as the owner of company m., saying that she was calling upon instructions from a certain sandra). she reiterated that she had hired the second applicant to transport the paint from bar to greece, had handed over the necessary documentation to him, and had provided him with the contact details of n.v. the second applicant had arrived at blace border crossing at 5 pm. when there was no reply, the trial court reiterated its request in letters dated 2 and 10 october 2007 and sent to the ministry of justice. she asked me to prepare documentation so that the container would be transported to greece, to thessaloniki instead of to belgrade ... i do not know [the applicants]. both witnesses gave their evidence under oath and were warned of the consequences of false testimony. on 16 october 2007, in the presence of the applicants and their representatives, the court heard evidence from the experts o.b. the laboratory is not accredited for isso standards.

the applicant was born in 1946 and lives in nazran, the republic of ingushetia. her account of the events is based on information obtained from her neighbours in kalinin. in conducting them, they had blocked mr a.kh., on 31 october 2009 the press office of the ministry of the interior of the chechen republic (министерство внутренних дел чеченской республики) (hereinafter “the chechen mvd”) published information on its official website concerning the special operation conducted in kalinin. on 10 november 2009 the investigation department refused to institute criminal proceedings into mr a.kh.

on 31 october 2002 the bucharest commission for the enforcement of law no. the land was located on v. street, in bucharest. on 23 november 2007 the applicant asked the mayor of bucharest, as well as the bucharest general and local councils, to take the necessary measures to remove the fence. the applicant informed those authorities that on 17 september 2007 the sdc had, by letter, dismissed his request for the removal of the fence built by his neighbour. the sdc had done so on the ground that his request related to a fence – for which a building permit had been issued – erected by a certain c.m. the applicant stated that after the fence had been built he could no longer access his land by car, but only on foot. moreover, he asked the court to require the mayor to arrange for the removal of the fence without the owner’s consent if the fence’s owner ignored such removal notice. he stated inter alia that in its letter to him of 17 september 2007 the sdc had indicated that the neighbour who was the target of his complaint had had a building permit for the fence. was not the owner of the property located opposite his land, which was owned by an unidentified neighbour, but the owner of the property adjoining his. consequently, their findings had had no bearing on his claim. moreover, his requests of 23 november 2007 had not received any answers. on 9 may 2008, at the first-instance court’s instruction, the applicant specified his court action. having been lodged by a third party living on the same street. it held that the applicant had not specified which of his neighbours had closed off part of the street by building the fence, either in his applications to the administrative authorities or in his application to that court. in such circumstances, the court could not accept that the authorities had refused to address the applicant’s request. given that the street in question had been used by several other property owners, the applicant would have had to identify the person unlawfully occupying part of the street before the authorities could have acted. moreover, it dismissed the aforementioned authorities’ claim that they lacked legal standing (capacitate procesuală pasivă) on the ground that the street ensuring access to the applicant’s property was on the public domain which was managed by them. the applicant appealed on points of law (recurs) against the judgment. but the neighbour whose property had been located opposite his who had blocked the street by building the fence. the fence had diminished the width of v. street, preventing vehicular access to the applicant’s property. consequently, he had been unable to use that property for its practical purpose – namely, to build a home. the authorities had not asked him to provide the name of the owner of the fence; indeed, it was the duty of the public servants – not the applicant – to inform the mayor of bucharest of the impugned person’s identity. 5) that, inter alia, his complaint concerning the occupation of part of v. street had concerned not c.m. but the unidentified neighbour whose property was located across the street from c.m. on 19 september 2008 the public domain administration attached to the office of the mayor of bucharest district no. by a final judgment of 3 november 2008 the bucharest court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law against the judgment of 17 june 2008. moreover, according to the sdc’s letter of 17 september 2007, c.m. had been the owner of the land to which the applicant had been referring. the applicant had argued before the judicial authorities that the administrative authorities had been mistaken as to the identity of the owner of the fence; however, he had failed to inform them of the alleged mistake in order that they might clarify the situation. consequently, he had lost eur 20,725 as a result of the lower sale price.
on 11 august 2000 the vukovar county state attorney’s office (županijsko državno odvjetništvo u vukovaru) asked an investigating judge of the vukovar county court (županijski sud u vukovaru) to open an investigation in respect of the applicant, in his capacity of the director of company m., in connection with suspicion of several charges of economic crime. on 28 may 2007 the vukovar county state attorney’s office amended the indictment, dropping the charges on six counts against the applicant and charging him on one count of misappropriation of company shares, and several counts of misuse of the company m.’s assets and facilities. on the basis of the amended indictment, on 8 april 2008 the vukovar county court found the applicant guilty of charges of misappropriation of company shares and acquitted him of all other charges. it did not submit an assessment of the value of the property nor did it make any reference to its possible value. on 27 june 2012 a single judge of the vukovar county court ordered seizure of the applicant’s real property listed in the request of the vukovar county state attorney’s office so as to secure effective enforcement of a possible confiscation order in the amount of approximately eur 1,060,000. on the basis of an order of the vukovar county court, the seizure of the applicant’s real property was registered in the land registry. the applicant challenged the decision of the vukovar county court before the supreme court and on 5 september 2012 the supreme court quashed it and remitted the matter for re-examination on the grounds that the decision on seizure of the real property was not within the competence of a single judge but a panel of three judges. he contended that he had taken a bank loan which was secured by a mortgage on his real property and that the loan would not be extended due to the seizure of his property, which could lead to his total bankruptcy and destruction of his business. in support of his request, the applicant submitted email correspondence with the bank asking him to clarify when the seizure order would be lifted, as it affected the management of his loan. on 18 october 2012 the applicant’s representative received a summons by the vukovar county court to appear before a three-judge panel of that court on 30 october 2012, without specifying the exact reason for the summons. it was also indicated that the court session could be held in the absence of the defence. the relevant part of the decision reads:
“the records from the land registry ... show that the accused antun džinić is the owner of the above listed items of real property. under section 11 § 1(a) in conjunction with section 31 § 2 of the confiscation of the proceeds of crime act (official gazette no. ...
[t]he proceedings at issue concern ... the confiscation of the proceeds of crime under section 11 § 1(a) in conjunction with section 31 § 2 of the confiscation of the proceeds of crime act. on 12 november 2012 the applicant lodged an appeal before the supreme court challenging the decision of the vukovar county court ordering the seizure of his property. he contended in particular that the value of the restrained property was according to his provisional estimate more than hrk 20,000,000 (approximately eur 2,600,000), which significantly surpassed the pecuniary gain allegedly obtained by the commission of the offences which were the subject matter of the proceedings. the applicant therefore submitted that by failing to make any such assessment, the vukovar county court had imposed an excessive individual burden on his property rights. the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on 27 december 2012. with regard to the applicant’s specific complaint concerning the lack of proportionality of the measure imposed, the supreme court noted:
“the supreme court finds that the principle of proportionality has not been breached since antun džinić is charged with having obtained a pecuniary gain in the amount of hrk 1,800,857.74, and the value of the restrained property does not justify [his] argument that the value of the restrained property listed in the operative part of the impugned decision significantly surpasses the [possible confiscation] claim.” on 20 february 2013 the applicant requested the vukovar county court that the seizure order be lifted or reassessed. he argued that there were other less restrictive means of securing the enforcement of a possible confiscation order, and contended that it had not been alleged that the seized property had been obtained by a criminal activity. he also urged the vukovar county court to make an assessment of the value of the seized property so as to limit the scope of the restraint to the value of the pecuniary gain allegedly obtained. he also contended that the value of the seized property significantly surpassed the alleged pecuniary gain obtained, which had endangered the normal functioning of his business. on 12 july 2013 the applicant challenged this decision by lodging an appeal before the supreme court. according to this estimate, the total value of the seized property corresponded to some eur 9,887,084. the applicant thus contended that there was a gross disproportionality between the alleged pecuniary gain obtained by the commission of the offences referred to in the indictment and the value of the seized property, which imposed on him an excessive individual burden. the applicant challenged this decision before the constitutional court and on 7 february 2014 the constitutional court declared it inadmissible, reiterating its previous reasoning (see paragraph 25 above). at a closing hearing in the criminal proceedings before the vukovar county court on 8 july 2014, the applicant again requested that the seizure order be lifted. the applicant was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and confiscation of the amount of hrk 1,800,857.74. the case is pending on appeal before the supreme court.

the applicant, ms gabriele fürst-pfeifer, is an austrian national who was born in 1964 and lives in mödling. specialised in the psychological examination of children and adolescents, her focus is mainly on custody and contact-rights-related disputes. on 23 december 2008 an article was published in “meinbezirk.at” as well as in the print version of bezirksblatt, which stated as follows:
“the quality of experts in the spotlight (gutachterqualität im visier)
disclosed: court expert for custody proceedings a case for therapy
(aufgedeckt: nö sorgerechts-sachverständige selbst ein therapie-fall)
suffering from up-and-down mood swings, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts and hallucinations, together with paranoid ideas – but working as a court-appointed expert. m. was commissioned in 1993 in the course of civil proceedings (action because of an alleged breach of promise of marriage) which unearthed the deficiencies of [the applicant] described above. the passage was followed by comments by a member of the green party, who had made a criminal complaint against the applicant with the public prosecutor’s office, the youth advocate at the regional government of lower austria, and the vice-president of the wiener neustadt regional court, who was responsible for managing the list of experts at the court. in the course of those proceedings the applicant’s mental status was also set to be examined. on 14 january 2009 the applicant lodged an action with the st. however, she did not argue that the expert report had been obtained unlawfully. furthermore, the publisher was to bear the costs of the proceedings. the article, that also featured the applicant’s full name and the description of her psychological impairment, touched her intimate personal sphere, since it created a link between her mental state and the quality of her work. furthermore, the court did not consider that there was a direct link between the contents of the article and the applicant’s public position, given that she mainly worked as an expert in custody cases, which were not usually heard in public. the publisher appealed on points of law and fact, as well as against the sentence (berufung wegen nichtigkeit, schuld und strafe). furthermore, the court did not find the article to be incomplete or manipulative, but sufficiently well-balanced and faithful to the different sides of the story in that it also referred to the fact that the applicant’s integrity had never been questioned in ten years; the court also asked for statements from the vice-president of the wiener neustadt regional court, a member of the green party, and the youth advocate of the regional government of lower austria. the court of appeal further found that the publication in issue was directly linked to the applicant’s public status. she had been included in the list of experts to be appointed by the courts since the year 2000 and had been appointed in several cases. even though the impugned expert opinion dated from 1993 and concerned a period in the applicant’s life prior even to that date, the reporting in question touched sufficiently upon the present public activities of the applicant. considering the importance and sensitivity of the area of custody proceedings and the dominant role of experts in the field, the psychological integrity of an expert assigned to those cases had to be beyond doubt. any reservation in relation to the mental health of experts – if based on sufficient reasons – had to be met with a thorough investigation in the interest of good conduct of the administration of justice, which was what had happened as the next step in the present case. that judgment was served on the applicant’s representative on 17 december 2009. in the meantime the applicant lodged an action with the innsbruck regional court on 7 april 2009. she sought damages under section 8a of the media act (mediengesetz) and publication of the judgment claiming that the article, and in particular the passages dealing with the psychological expert report on her, violated her intimate personal sphere and compromised her publicly. furthermore, costs were awarded against the publisher. that the applicant’s psychological illness was directly linked to the intimate personal sphere was beyond doubt. the article was so incomplete and distorted that it could not be considered a report of matters of fact. there was no connection between the applicant’s work at present and her mental health status years ago. thereupon, on 11 february 2010, the innsbruck court of appeal (oberlandesgericht innsbruck) granted the appeal, set aside the judgment of the lower court, and dismissed the applicant’s action. the article did not indicate however that the applicant was not competent to exercise her profession as a psychological expert. furthermore, the published information was true. the impugned article concerned the applicant’s activity as an expert in custody proceedings. insofar, a truthful report linked to a person’s public status, which also contained information belonging to the intimate personal sphere must be permitted to be published.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in kazan. on 24 november 2006 the novo-savinovskiy district court of kazan (ново-савиновский районный суда города казани) acquitted the applicant on four counts of drug-dealing, convicted her on one count and sentenced her to eight years’ imprisonment and a fine. on 13 february 2007 the supreme court of republic of tatarstan (верховный суд республики татарстан) upheld the judgment on appeal with minor changes. on 2 july 2008 the presidium of the supreme court of the republic of tatarstan in supervisory review proceedings annulled the judgment on the applicant’s request, because she was formally indicted outside the prescribed statutory time-limits. on 15 october 2008 the novo-savinovskiy district court of kazan acquitted the applicant on the same grounds after re-calculation of the applicable time-limits for investigative actions. on 18 november 2008 the supreme court of the republic of tatarstan upheld the judgment on appeal. on 18 february 2009 the presidium of the supreme court of the republic of tatarstan in supervisory review proceedings annulled the judgments on the prosecutor’s request. the annulment was reasoned by three main arguments: 1) in the opinion of the supervisory court all of the evidence was collected within the statutory time-limits, 2) the lower courts having examining all the evidence during the hearings did not mention them in the judgments and only gave reasons for dismissing them, and 3) formal indictment of the applicant outside of the statutory time-limits should not have led to acquittal in any event. on 9 october 2009 the applicant was convicted, sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, suspended for five years, and fined.
the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. in april 2004 the applicant sustained a serious knee injury. he was certified as third-degree disabled, the lowest category. in his written observations submitted to the court on 23 february 2012 in reply to those of the government, the applicant’s lawyer stated that police officers had “wrung the [applicant’s] hands and feet and hit him on the body, including the areas of his liver and kidneys, and on [his] arms and legs”. according to the applicant, the conditions of detention in that facility were inhuman. once p. had come to a bank of the pond and had seen a. fishing there. the applicant had been fishing on the opposite bank of the pond. p. had approached the applicant who had taken him to some bushes and raped. on 25 april 2005 the police questioned a. who said that on 10 april 2005 in the afternoon he and his brother e. had been fishing from the bank of the pond. a. had seen that p. had approached the applicant and they had gone into some bushes. both doctors noted that the applicant was fit for detention in the itt. on the same date and the following day he was medically examined and did not raise any complaints of ill-treatment or health problems. the applicant’s case was referred to the kominternovskyy district court of odessa for trial. on 26 july 2005 the applicant asked the authorities to appoint him a lawyer. this request was granted on an unspecified date still in august 2005. during one of the hearings the trial court questioned the victim, p., who stated, without indicating the exact dates, that the applicant had raped him several times between september 2004 and april 2005. he said that he had been raped only by the applicant and not by other persons. p.’s mother also said that the applicant’s mother had told her that p. had come to the apartment where the applicant lived and the applicant’s grandmother had ousted him. all of those witnesses were questioned by the trial court in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer. the lawyer and the applicant were allowed to question the witnesses and ask for explanations regarding the facts of the case. before the court the applicant pleaded not guilty. the applicant was absent from that hearing. it remains unknown whether the complaints were examined. in november 2006 the odessa regional court of appeal (“court of appeal”) informed the applicant that it would hold a hearing in his case on 12 december 2006. the court granted the request and ordered the bailiffs to bring the applicant to the court hearing. in the meantime, on the same date the court of appeal, in the presence of the applicant’s lawyer, upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. on 16 january 2007 the applicant and his lawyer, b., lodged two separate appeals in cassation with the supreme court, raising the same arguments as those raised before the court of appeal. the applicant did not seek the assistance of any other lawyer. on 19 february 2007 the applicant lodged his application with the court. the supreme court received the request but did not reply to it for unknown reasons.
the applicant was born in 1971 and lives in barking. the applicant arrived in the united kingdom on 7 january 2003. he claimed asylum on 15 january 2003 but his claim was refused by the secretary of state for the home department on 15 march 2003 and his appeal against that decision was refused on 1 october 2003. on 31 march 2005 the applicant was served with the decision to make a deportation order. the deportation order was signed on 4 august 2005 and served on him on 12 august 2005. one month later an application was submitted to the iranian authorities for an emergency travel document to enable him to travel there. the applicant was subsequently interviewed at the iranian embassy on 15 september 2006. on 17 october 2006 the home office was informed that the iranian embassy required a birth certificate before any travel documents could be issued. it appears that the home office thereafter proposed to submit copy documents. the iranian embassy initially agreed to this proposal, but later refused. the applicant refused to sign a “disclaimer” on 14 december 2007. as a consequence, the applicant was once again liable to detention. on 27 december 2007 group 4 securicor reported that they had on two occasions attempted to visit the applicant at his nominated address to install the equipment required for electronic tagging. on 8 january 2008 an authority was issued for the applicant’s detention and on 14 january he was detained while reporting to the immigration authorities. on 26 february 2008 the claim for judicial review launched on 13 september 2007 was dismissed. on 4 june 2008 he again refused to sign a disclaimer. his behaviour was also alleged to have been disruptive. however, no prosecution was ever mounted. however, the border and immigration agency refused to agree to any such request. on 6 january 2009, 6 february 2009, march 2009, may 2009, june 2009 and september 2009 the authorities made further attempts to engage the applicant in a voluntary return. on 17 march 2009, 9 june 2009 and 7 october 2009 the applicant made three applications for bail to the asylum and immigration tribunal. on 4 december 2009 the high court granted the applicant permission to apply for judicial review and the home office was ordered to release him on bail within forty-eight hours. counsel for the secretary of state for the home department argued – and the court appears to have accepted – that the first period could not be in question legally, since the applicant had been released for one month pursuant to a court order and the order enforcing release had been discharged. in considering the lawfulness of the second period of detention, the administrative court judge recalled that the authorities should be free to make strenuous efforts to obtain the assent of a person they proposed to deport. however, the judge noted that the law did not permit the indefinite detention of someone who was never going to consent to deportation. he therefore held that the applicant’s detention had been unlawful from 14 september 2009. with regard to the question of whether there should be guidance on how long it might be appropriate to detain an individual, the judge made the following observations:
“it cannot be right for the secretary of state to be led to believe, by looking at a digest of the range of decisions that have been taken, that it is safe to detain for x months or x years. in a decision dated 13 may 2011 the applicant was awarded gbp 6,150 in damages. the applicant sought permission to appeal. on 31 october 2011 permission to appeal was refused.
the applicant was born in 1999 and lives in pleven. in its reasoning the court specified that placement in a correctional boarding school was liable to have a negative impact on the child’s psychological and social development, given the “unfavourable environment offered by that type of institution”. on 10 june 2013 a criminal bench of the district court held a hearing. the applicant also asked to have a lawyer appointed. she came from a large family where the mother did not exert any parental control. in their view, such protection would only be provided in a secure centre with a restrictive regime. he viewed those measures as insufficient. the officially appointed lawyer called for the adoption of less severe educational measures. accordingly, the measure of placement in a correctional boarding school was in fact in her interests. in its reasoning the court held that despite the judicial decision of 1 april 2013 in which a compromise solution had been adopted for the applicant, namely the confirmation and extension of her placement in the children’s crisis centre, she was still failing to abide by the institution’s internal rules, was not returning to the centre by the designated time after school, was in contact with individuals identified as “delinquents” and was still behaving rudely and aggressively towards the social workers at the centre. in the court’s view, the applicant no longer displayed any willingness to abide by the rules of society, or even those of the institution in which she was living, and it was therefore advisable to remove her from her circle of acquaintances who were harming her personal development, and to provide her with enhanced educational support in order to eradicate her negative behavioural traits. the applicant, represented by her lawyer, appealed against that judgment. according to a medical certificate dated 15 september 2013, she had taken ten 500 mg paracetamol tablets and ten remotiv tablets and was in a fragile state. on 15 september 2013 the applicant was taken to the podem school. regarding life at the school, the applicant submitted in her application that the level of teaching was much lower than at her previous institution. on 19 november 2013 she had attempted suicide for the second time, as part of a group with four other girls, by ingesting chemical substances. there had been other suicide attempts at the school. the applicant further submitted that her telephone conversations were monitored by a supervisor. for that purpose, a loudspeaker had been attached to the telephone and switched on during each conversation. the results of the inspection are not known. when submitting their observations on the admissibility and merits of the application, the government included a report dated 30 january 2015 by the head of the podem school about the applicant’s situation. although she did not apply herself consistently, she had nevertheless shown some interest in schoolwork. the report also noted that at the end of the 2013/14 school year, the applicant had achieved an average mark of 3.69 out of 6 and had therefore moved up to the next class, that she had also been awarded a certificate as a qualified seamstress and that she would be receiving a similar mark for the first semester of the 2014/15 school year. each time, the applicant had returned late to the podem school. the remaining 52% of pupils failed to complete their education. the 2013 report mentions a low success rate among pupils, with average marks of between 3 and 4 out of 6. with regard to the podem school in particular, the teaching and support staff are subject to external educational supervision. they also criticise the lack of any programme to foster closer relations between children and their families. these children often run away, do not attend lessons regularly and have insufficient contact with adults. it appears that, following the 2009 report by the state agency for child protection, the ministry of education and science undertook to reform the secure institutions for juveniles in order to ensure that the system was entirely focused on the child and offered an individually tailored approach.
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in shostka. on 13 november 2003 the applicant’s wife died as a result of a traffic accident caused by mr v. whose car collided with a horse-drawn carriage in which the applicant’s wife was travelling. the police examined the scene of the accident immediately. the medical examination of mr v. was also conducted. on 17 november 2003 the shostka district police department instituted a criminal investigation into the road traffic accident. on 27 december 2003, after a number of forensic medical examinations and on the basis of witnesses’ testimonies, the investigative officer terminated the criminal proceedings on the ground that it was impossible to establish who was responsible for the accident. on 4 february 2004 the investigative officer of the shostka district police department decided to resume the investigation on account of its incompleteness and the necessity to conduct further investigative actions. between february 2004 and april 2005 six more decisions to discontinue the criminal proceedings for lack of corpus delicti in the driver’s actions were taken (on 5 february, 5 march, 15 april, 17 august, 7 october, 23 december 2004). all of them were subsequently quashed and the criminal proceedings have accordingly been reopened by decisions of the police officer of the shostka district police department (on 3 march and 1 april, 11 june, 6 october, 10 november 2004, 1 march 2005) with reference to the incompleteness of the investigation. the latter authority referred, in particular, to the failure of the inquiring officers to question additional witnesses and to reconcile factual discrepancies between the experts’ conclusions and the accounts of some witnesses, the completion of technical examinations, including reconstruction of the events. on 11 july 2004 the applicant was recognised as being a victim and a civil plaintiff in the criminal case and on 5 january 2005 he lodged a civil claim, seeking compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage within the context of the criminal proceedings. on 27 april 2005 the police officer of the shostka district police department instituted criminal proceedings against the car driver mr v. on 1 july 2005 the indictment against mr v. was prepared by the shostka district prosecutor’s office. on 5 july 2005 the criminal case was referred to the shostka local court for consideration on the merits. on 29 august 2005 the shostka local court allowed the prosecutor’s request and decided that the case should be remitted for additional investigation to shostka district prosecutor’s office on account of the incompleteness of the investigation. on 18 march 2006 the shostka district police department terminated the proceedings against mr v. for lack of evidence of his involvement in the crime. on 20 march 2007 the prosecutor quashed the resolution regarding the termination of the proceedings in the case, having found that additional investigation was required. on 19 april 2007 the investigator of the shostka prosecutor’s office terminated criminal proceedings against mr v. for lack of evidence against him. on 1 july 2008 this resolution was quashed and the case was remitted for additional investigation. on 24 july 2008 the shostka prosecutor’s office instituted criminal proceedings against mr v. on 11 august 2008 the criminal case was referred to the shostka local court for consideration on the merits. on 12 march 2011 the shostka local court sentenced mr v. to five years’ imprisonment combined with a driving ban for three years and awarded pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage to the applicant and other victims (two more persons were injured in the traffic accident). on 28 july 2011 the sumy court of appeal quashed the judgment of 12 march 2011, terminated the criminal proceedings and amnestied mr v. it also left civil claims without examination, indicating that they could be examined in the context of civil proceedings. on 29 august 2011 the applicant instituted separate civil proceedings against mr v. 18. on 29 march 2012 the higher specialised civil and criminal court upheld the decision of the appellate court in the criminal case against mr v. 19. on 8 january 2013 the higher specialised civil and criminal court of ukraine upheld the decision of the sumy court of appeal of 15 august 2012 allowing the applicant’s civil claim and ordering payment of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages relating to his wife’s death in the amount of uah 10,774.32. it appears that the decision of the court of appeal has not been fully enforced due to lack of funds of mr v. and the impossibility of selling his property. on 28 november 2014 the decision was partly enforced and the applicant was paid pecuniary and non‑pecuniary damages in the amount of uah 1,942.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in garkalne (riga district). and undertook to repay that sum with interest by 30 june 1999. however, he acknowledged that there was no documentary evidence of this. the respondent government contested the applicant’s submission. the applicant was summoned to appear or to come forward within thirty days of receiving the summons. however, the copy of the summons furnished by the latvian government indicated that it had been drawn up on 17 november 2003. the slip produced by the cypriot postal service stated that the summons had been sent on 18 november 2003 to the address in g. street, and had been delivered and signed for on 27 november 2003. street in riga which differed from the address previously notified to the cypriot court. the respondent government did not dispute these facts. however, he lodged an interlocutory appeal (blakus sūdzība) against the order of 27 february 2006 with the riga regional court, while asking the latgale district court to extend the time allowed for lodging the appeal. hence, they must all have been aware of his business address. the last part of the certificate, intended for the name of the person against whom the judgment was enforceable, had been left blank. he then requested that the charge on his property in garkalne be lifted. everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal previously established by law. artico v italy judgment of 13 may 1980, series a no 37, § 33, and eur. consideration of the texts which constitute the common european asylum system shows that it was conceived in a context making it possible to assume that all the participating states, whether member states or third states, observe fundamental rights, including the rights based on the geneva convention and the 1967 protocol, and on the echr, and that the member states can have confidence in each other in that regard. it follows from all of the foregoing considerations that, as stated by the advocate general in paragraph 131 of her opinion, an application of regulation no 343/2003 on the basis of the conclusive presumption that the asylum seeker’s fundamental rights will be observed in the member state primarily responsible for his application is incompatible with the duty of the member states to interpret and apply regulation no 343/2003 in a manner consistent with fundamental rights. in the case of alpha bank cyprus ltd v dau si senh and others (case c-519/13, judgment of 16 september 2015), concerning the application of regulation (ec) no 1393/2007 of the european parliament and of the council of 13 november 2007 on the service in the member states of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters, the cjeu held:
“30. a judgment given in a member state shall be recognised in the other member states without any special procedure being required. ...”
article 34
“a judgment shall not be recognised: 2. the decision on the application for a declaration of enforceability may be appealed against by either party. considerable changes have accordingly been made to the brussels convention mechanism. moreover, the grounds for non-recognition or non‑enforcement have been narrowed down quite considerably. the same requirement appears in the 18th recital in the preamble to regulation no 44/2001, pursuant to which respect for the rights of defence means that the defendant should be able to appeal in an adversarial procedure, against the declaration of enforceability of a decision, if he considers one of the grounds for non-enforcement to be present. in the original proceedings in the state in which the judgment was given, it follows from the combined application of articles 26(2) of regulation no 44/2001 and article 19(1) of regulation no 1348/2000, that the court hearing the case must stay the proceedings so long as it is not shown that the defendant has been able to receive the document which instituted the proceedings or an equivalent document in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defence, or that all necessary steps have been taken to this end. as the austrian, german, netherlands and polish government and the commission of the european communities have rightly argued in their observations submitted to the court, the commencement of proceedings against a judgment is possible only if the person bringing those proceedings was able to familiarise himself with its contents, the mere fact that the person concerned is aware of the existence of that judgment being insufficient in that regard. consequently, in order to justify the conclusion that it was possible for a defendant to commence proceedings to challenge a default judgment against him, within the meaning of article 34(2) of regulation no 44/2001, he must have been aware of the contents of that decision, which presupposes that it was served on him. in trade agency ltd v seramico investments ltd (case c-619/10, judgment of 6 september 2012), the cjeu was called on to give a ruling as to whether, where the judgment given in default of appearance in the member state of origin was accompanied by the certificate referred to in annex v to the brussels i regulation, the court of the member state in which enforcement was sought could nevertheless check whether the information in the certificate was consistent with the evidence. article 34(2) of regulation no 44/2001, unlike article 27(2) of the convention, does not necessarily require the document which instituted the proceedings to be duly served, but does require that the rights of the defence are effectively respected ... 76. at the material time the relevant sections of the latvian civil procedure law (civilprocesa likums) read as follows:
section 8(1)
“the court shall establish the circumstances of the case by assessing evidence obtained in accordance with the law.”
all applicants were former employees of “leteks” u stečaju (the debtor), which was, at the relevant time, a company predominantly comprised of socially-owned capital. since the debtor failed to fulfil its contractual obligations towards its employees, on an unspecified date, the applicants instituted civil proceedings against it. on 18 april 2008 the leskovac municipal court ordered the debtor to pay the applicants specified amounts on account of salary arrears, plus the costs and expenses of the civil proceedings. on 3 october 2010 the above judgment became final. between 20 november 2008 and 30 november 2009 all applicants filed separate requests for the enforcement of the above judgment. the leskovac municipal court ultimately accepted the applicants’ requests and issued the enforcement orders, respectively. the essential information as to the enforcement proceedings in respect of each application is outlined in the annex to this judgment. on 25 january 2011 the leskovac commercial court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor (st. the applicants duly submitted their respective claims. on an unspecified date the applicants’ claims based on the judgment of 18 april 2008 were formally recognised. the insolvency proceedings against the debtor are still ongoing. on 31 march 2010, the applicants lodged a constitutional appeal. on 8 july 2013 the constitutional court dismissed the appeal in respect of all applicants except the applicants ms jagoda jančić (application no. 62499/10), mr predrag stamenković (application no. 63100/10) and ms stana stanković (application no. on 18 september 2013 the constitutional court also found a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, in respect of ms jančić, mr stamenković and ms stanković. it further awarded each of them 500 euros (eur) as just satisfaction for non-pecuniary damage and ordered the court in leskovac to expedite the proceedings.
the applicant was born in 1968 and, prior to his conviction, lived in yaroslavl. on 15 april 2008 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of fraud. subsequently, he was charged with fraud, attempted fraud, embezzlement, tax evasion and a breach of duties in his work as a tax agent. on 16 april 2008 the kirovskiy district court of yaroslavl remanded the applicant in custody pending investigation. the judge found that (1) the applicant was suspected of serious crimes, (2) he might abscond, (3) he might put pressure on witnesses, or (4) he might interfere with the investigation. on 25 april 2008 the yaroslavl regional court upheld the detention order of 16 april 2008 on appeal. the applicant remained in detention pending investigation and trial. the courts extended his detention, using the same stereotyped formula as described above. on 16 march 2009 he was committed for trial before the kirovskiy district court of yaroslavl. on 27 october 2009 he was convicted of the charges and sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment. on 29 december 2009 the yaroslavl regional court quashed the judgment on appeal and remitted the case to the first-instance court for a fresh examination. on 25 january 2010 the trial court ordered his release on bail. on 27 january 2010 the bail was paid and the applicant was released. on 20 july 2010 the applicant was convicted of fraud and attempted fraud and sentenced to five years and six months’ imprisonment. on 19 october 2010 the yaroslavl regional court upheld the judgment on appeal. on 2 december 2014 the government submitted a unilateral declaration. they acknowledged that the applicant had been detained “between 15 april 2008 and 27 october 2009 ... without relevant and sufficient grounds”, in breach of the requirements of article 5 § 3 of the convention. they offered to pay him a sum of 1,850 euros (eur) as just satisfaction and invited the court to strike the case out of its list of cases. on 2 february 2015 the applicant replied that he had taken note of the government’s acknowledgment of the violation, but that the amount of compensation was not acceptable to him.

the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in voronezh. on 7 march 2008 the applicant was arrested and brought to the tsentralniy district police station, voronezh (отдел внутренних дел центрального района г. воронежа, “the tsentralniy ovd”) for having employed offensive language in public. he submitted that after the interview the policemen had ill-treated him. in particular, they had handcuffed his hands behind his back, lifted the handcuffs so that he could only stand on his toes, attached the handcuffs to metal bars and administered several blows to the applicant’s face and chest. a few hours later, the applicant was released. on 8 march 2008 the applicant paid a visit to voronezh town clinical hospital no. a bruise on the left side of his chest was noted during the examination carried out by a doctor there. on 10 march 2008 the applicant was examined by the voronezh regional forensic bureau which in addition detected bruises on the applicant’s right eye and right wrist, and scratches on the left of his forehead and both wrists, inflicted by a blunt hard object. the report reflected the timing of these injuries as “one to three days prior”, “possibly 7 march 2008, as argued by [the applicant]”. it further concluded that the injuries in question did not entail any permanent damage to health or disability. on 11 march 2008 the applicant visited local polyclinic no. 4, which diagnosed him as having developed periarthritis as a result of trauma of the wrist joints. on 19 march 2008 the applicant lodged an application with the tsentralniy district investigation department of the investigative committee at the voronezh regional prosecutor’s office (следственный отдел по центральному району г. воронежа cледственного управления следственного комитета при прокуратуре российской федерации по воронежской области, “the district investigation department”) requesting that criminal proceedings be instituted against the police officers who had ill-treated him at the tsentralniy ovd on 7 march 2008. on 23 march 2008 an investigator of the district investigation department rejected the applicant’s request as unfounded for lack evidence of a crime. on 24 april 2008 the above decision was set aside by the deputy head of the district investigation department as unfounded, and the case file material was referred for an additional pre-investigation inquiry. thereafter the applicant’s request was repeatedly rejected and re‑examined. who submitted that on 7 march 2008 at about 6.10 p.m. he and police officer s.s. had apprehended the applicant for having employed offensive language in public;
-  the statements of officers v.v. who denied having applied physical force to the applicant;
-  the statements of police officer p.a., who submitted that on 7 march 2008 at about 7.00 p.m. the applicant was brought to the tsentralniy ovd; he had had no visible injuries and had been behaving calmly, and no physical force or measures of restraint had been applied to him;
-  the statements of police officers s.sh. who had been on duty on 7 march 2008, who submitted that they had had no information about the applicant’s arrest, and that they had not seen physical force or measures of restraint being applied to any of the persons brought to the tsentralniy ovd on that date;
-  the statements of several persons who had been detained at the tsentralniy ovd at the same time as the applicant, who submitted that they had not seen or heard that any unlawful measures had been applied to the applicant by the police officers. on 19 may and 28 october 2008, and 10 august 2009 the tsentralniy district court, voronezh, discontinued the proceedings by which the applicant sought to challenge the lawfulness of the decisions of 23 march, 1 october and 11 december 2008 respectively, refusing to open a criminal case against the police officers as in the meantime the above decisions had been set aside. after the application was communicated to the russian government, on 23 march 2011 the district investigation department instituted criminal proceedings under article 286 § 3 of the criminal code of the russian federation. on an unspecified date in the end of march 2011 the applicant was questioned as a victim. on an unspecified date in april 2011 the investigator appointed a doctor to carry out a forensic medical examination. on 6 june 2011 the applicant participated in an onsite verification of his statements and in an identity parade of the police officers. of the tsentralniy ovd were presented for identification; however, none were recognised by the applicant. on 25 july 2011 the investigation was suspended on the grounds that it was impossible to identify the alleged perpetrators.
the applicants were born, respectively, in 1971 in togo and in 1979 in ghana. from the age of 6 to 21 he lived in ghana with his uncle. on 25 september 1998 the first applicant and his danish wife got divorced. on 22 april 2002 the first applicant acquired danish citizenship. on the application form, the first applicant submitted that he had not received any education in denmark, but had participated in various language courses and short-term courses concerning service, customer care, industrial cleaning, hygiene and working methods. the appeal did not have suspensive effect. in its assessment, it noted that the first applicant had entered denmark in july 1993 and had been a danish national since 22 april 2002. he had ties with ghana, where he had been raised and had attended school. he had visited the country four times in the past six years. when applied, the rule may therefore imply an indirect discrimination. the balancing of this overall consideration relating to the specific circumstances in the case requires a detailed assessment. accordingly, and in view of the specific information on [the first applicant’s] situation, the high court finds no sufficient basis for holding that the refusal by the ministry to grant a residence permit to [the second applicant] with reference to the attachment requirement of the aliens act implies a disproportionate infringement of [the first applicant’s] rights as a danish national and his right to family life. if the refusal was not contrary to article 8, they submitted as their alternative claim that it was contrary to the prohibition against discrimination enshrined in article 14 read in conjunction with article 8, for which reason they were eligible for family reunion in denmark without satisfying the attachment requirement set out in section 9(7) of the act. 1204 of 27 december 2003, the requirement that the spouses’ or cohabitants’ aggregate ties with denmark must be stronger than their aggregate ties with another country (the attachment requirement) does not apply when the resident has been a danish national for 28 years (the 28-year rule). until 2002, danish nationals had had a general exemption from the attachment requirement. it is mentioned in this connection that danish expatriates planning to return to denmark one day with their families will often have maintained strong ties with denmark, which have also been communicated to their spouse or cohabitant and any children. this is so when they speak danish at home, take holidays in denmark, read danish newspapers regularly, and so on. a consequence of this current state of the law is that different groups of danish nationals are subject to differences in treatment in relation to their possibility of being reunited with family members in denmark, as persons who have been danish nationals for 28 years are in a better position than persons who have been danish nationals for fewer than 28 years. a different additional requirement is made under danish law: a requirement of danish nationality for 28 years. this also applies to danish nationals who have stayed abroad for a shorter or longer period, for example in connection with education or work. he] was born in togo in 1971 and came to denmark in 1993. in 2003 he married [the second applicant] and applied for reunion with his spouse in denmark. the application was finally refused in 2004. hence, the 28-year rule results in obvious indirect difference in treatment between the two groups of danish nationals. when the attachment requirement was introduced by act no. 365 of 6 june 2002 made the attachment requirement generally applicable also to danish nationals. concerning the reason for this, the preparatory work in respect of the act states, inter alia: ‘with resident aliens and danish nationals of foreign extraction it is a widespread marriage pattern to marry a person from their country of origin, among other reasons due to parental pressure ... the government find that the attachment requirement, as it is worded today, does not take sufficient account of the existence of this marriage pattern among both resident foreigners and resident danish nationals of foreign extraction. in our opinion it is dubious whether there is any basis for such a restrictive interpretation as the provision, according to its wording, comprises any difference in treatment exercised as a consequence of how and when nationality was acquired. difference in treatment based on nationality must be seen, inter alia, in the light of the right of danish nationals to settle in denmark, and no significance can be attributed to the fact that such discrimination is not considered contrary to article 14 read in conjunction with article 8 when assessing whether it is permissible to implement a scheme implying a difference in treatment between different groups of danish nationals. in our opinion, it cannot be considered a fact that, from a general perspective, this group of danish nationals has stronger ties with denmark than persons who have acquired danish nationality after entering and residing in denmark for a number of years.

the applicant was born in 1969 and lived until his arrest in moscow, having worked as a notary. on 24 may 2005 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having organised the murders. the district court found that other measures of restraint could not be applied because the circumstances which had prompted the applicant’s arrest had not changed. on 27 september 2005 the court extended the applicant’s detention until 9 december 2005, having noted, inter alia, that the applicant had only read three, and his lawyer nine, volumes and that they therefore needed additional time. having finished studying the file, on 22 november 2005 the applicant was committed to stand trial before the moscow city court (“the city court”). the applicant appealed against the decision of 15 february 2006. the court refused the request, using wording identical to that of its decision of 15 february 2006. a stamp on the appeal statement indicates that it reached the city court on 12 april 2006. on 6 may 2006 the city court acquitted the applicant and his co‑defendants of all charges and ordered their immediate release. the facility had been overcrowded and his cell had been dirty and in a deplorable state. six days later the lawyer requested the district court not to hold hearings on wednesdays in order to provide the applicant with the possibility to rest. the court agreed that at least one working day per week should be left free for the applicant to recover and prepare for forthcoming hearings. according to the government, the applicant had not had any particular health problems in detention, save for his having lost consciousness once while being transported in a prison van. the government stressed that he had not suffered any epileptic fits and had been regularly seen by prison doctors. the prison paramedic had treated the cut. a prison paramedic had visited the applicant several times, mostly before and after his transport to the courthouse, each time noting that he was healthy. once, on 12 april 2006, the applicant had been seen by a prison doctor after he had lost consciousness in a prison van. 77/1 in moscow, where his epilepsy had received medical attention. according to the applicant, the medical records had not reflected his actual state of health in detention. as a result of another seizure, he had inadvertently poured hot water over himself. the applicant had further alleged that the authorities had not provided him with the required medical attention or drugs necessary to treat his epilepsy or at least to decrease the frequency of seizures, of which they had been fully aware. the applicant’s lawyer had interviewed three inmates who had shared a cell with the applicant between june 2005 and may 2006. the inmates testified to either having seen the applicant suffering a seizure or having heard about them. (c)  requests for medical examination 39. on 12 october 2005 the applicant’s lawyer sent a letter to the prosecutor general’s office asking it to authorise a complex psychological and psychiatric examination of the applicant. two days later the request was refused as unsubstantiated. in addition, it was noted that a request for a medical examination of an inmate by civil medical specialists could only be authorised by the investigating authorities. on 31 march 2006 the applicant’s lawyer unsuccessfully asked the city court to authorise a complex medical examination of the applicant. the investigating authorities alleged that between june 2002 and february 2003 the applicant, acting in his official capacity as a notary, together with two other individuals, had forged a will and had fraudulently acquired a flat belonging to the deceased. on 11 may 2006 the applicant was arrested and on the following day the zamoskvoretskiy district court authorised his detention on remand, which was further extended on a number of occasions.
the applicants were born in 1943 and 1942 respectively and live in odessa. on 30 april 2002 the applicants’ daughter was struck by a car driven by p. as she was crossing the street. she died in hospital following the accident. between april 2002 and october 2010 the prosecution authorities delivered at least ten decisions refusing to institute or discontinuing criminal proceedings in respect of p. owing to a lack of corpus delicti in his actions. all those decisions were quashed by the supervising authorities as unsubstantiated and further investigations were ordered. on 9 july 2009 the first applicant lodged a civil claim against p. within the criminal proceedings. on 15 july 2009 he was attributed the status of an aggrieved party in those proceedings. on 26 october 2010 the odessa suvorivskyy district court discontinued the criminal proceedings against p. as time-barred. on 21 december 2010 and 20 november 2012 the odessa regional court of appeal (“the court of appeal”) and the higher specialised court for civil and criminal matters (“the higher specialised court”), respectively, upheld that decision. on 20 november 2012 the higher specialised court also issued a separate ruling, by which it brought to the attention of the court of appeal and the odessa regional prosecutor’s office a number of shortcomings in the proceedings. it stated, in particular, that the pre-trial investigation had been perfunctory and lengthy. since 2002, there had been hardly any investigative measures. the numerous refusals by the investigating authorities to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the accident had been unfounded and had eventually been quashed. guidelines as regards remedying shortcomings in the investigation had been ignored. the overall duration of the investigation, over ten years, had been unjustified. in summary, the higher specialised court held that the criminal investigation in question had not complied with domestic legislation or the convention. it therefore instructed the aforementioned authorities to take measures to prevent similar violations in the future.
the applicant was born in 1946 and lives in zagreb. in 1965 the sisak ironworks (željezara sisak), a socially-owned company, granted a specially protected tenancy to its employee s.k. the town of sisak was close to the border of krajina. in may 1991 the socially-owned company sisak ironworks was transformed into a joint-stock company and became sisak ironworks holding (željezara sisak holding). it remained state-owned and state-controlled. it owned several companies, one of them being sisak ironworks flat company (željezara sisak “stan”) which since may 1991 managed all the flats having been previously owned by the former sisak ironworks company. another company was sisak ironworks fortis, which was privatised in july 1995. petrinja was occupied by serbian paramilitary forces in september 1991. the applicant and his family moved to sisak as displaced persons. the applicant found employment with sisak ironworks fortis. according to the applicant the flat was allocated to him and his family by his employer. according to the government, during the proceedings before the domestic courts the applicant did not produce any document which showed the flat as having been allocated to him. agreed that the applicant and his family, as displaced persons, could temporarily occupy the flat. on 13 july 1992 the sisak ironworks flat company brought a civil action in the sisak municipal court against s.k. seeking the termination of their specially protected tenancy of the flat at issue. the applicant gave oral evidence as a witness in those proceedings. he stated that he did not know where s.k. having been adjudged to be persons whose whereabouts were unknown, had a special guardian ad litem appointed to represent them in the proceedings. that judgment was upheld by the sisak county court on 24 march 1992 and thus became final. lodged an application for the reopening of civil proceedings which had been completed with final effect. the application was granted on 12 april 1994 and the proceedings were reopened. after the croatian authorities had gained control over petrinja in 1995, the applicant and his family sought reconstruction assistance for their house in petrinja to be repaired, under the reconstruction act (see paragraph 28 below). the applicant and his family confirmed to the administrative authorities that they had returned to petrinja on 16 january 1998. they had their registered residence in petrinja between 5 february 1993 and 28 december 1999. the municipal court’s judgment was reversed on 22 november 2007 by the sisak county court (županijski sud u sisku). therefore, the impugned contract of sale was contrary to morals and constitutional principles and therefore null and void under section 103(1) of the obligations act. the judgment was upheld by the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske) on 20 january 2010. on 26 march 2008 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint. he relied on article 3 and articles 14 § 1 and 29 § 1 of the constitution (see paragraph 22 below). the applicant is still living in the flat at issue.

the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in klaipėda. ’s cabin, the captain sent a report about the death to his superiors in klaipėda, the limarko shipping company. the following day, 25 october 2007, a brazilian doctor, p.c.j., gave acute heart attack (ūmus miokardo infarktas) as v.b. considering that no crime had taken place and that v.b. his qualifications and photographs from his cabin. on 21 november 2007 the applicant requested that the prosecutor and the state labour inspectorate (valstybinė darbo inspekcija, a state body responsible for safety at work, hereinafter – “the sli”) examine her husband’s body and investigate the cause of his death and his working conditions on the ship. preservation of the body by chemical means irreparably altered the chemical composition of the blood, and therefore there had been no reason to carry out a further examination of the body. the prosecutor noted that in april 2007 v.b. when fires broke out, there was a strong smell of fumes. had worked intensively and rested little. no repairs in the machinery section had been carried out until v.b. had not complained about his health or stated that he had any heart problems. thus raising doubts about his credentials. on 21 february 2009 the klaipėda city district court granted the applicant’s appeal. it emphasised that what was at issue was a criminal investigation into charges of a violation of requirements to protect health and safety at work. in the opinion of the klaipėda regional court, it was therefore vital to continue the pre-trial investigation and to eliminate the doubts raised by the applicant as to the reliability of the results of the medical examination of v.b. had indeed worked in harmful conditions during the voyage, including whether regulations on hours of work had been observed. on 24 march 2009 the prosecutor ordered the klaipėda seaport police to establish the whereabouts of the vega and whether it was possible to inspect the ship; to question everyone who worked on it, including about working conditions, as noted in the applicant’s complaint; to obtain documents from limarko related to safety at work; and to ask the sli whether they had examined the actual working conditions on the ship. the sli noted that the circumstances of v.b. failures of the main engine meant that fires on the ship had been frequent, happening almost daily. all the fires and repairs had been registered in the machinery logbook. on 13 october 2009 the klaipėda seaport police transferred the criminal file to the applicant so that she could acquaint herself with it. on 25 february 2010 the investigators again provided the case file to the applicant. it by then comprised three volumes and 565 pages. had been performed and his blood tested (and, if so, to provide the results of the autopsy and the tests), and whether the brazilian authorities had inspected the vega after the death to examine the working conditions on board. for the experts, it was known from the criminal case file that v.b. according to him, although the existence of harmful working conditions and leaks of gases in the engine room of the ship had been confirmed, they could not have caused the victim’s heart failure. the applicant also pointed out that the ship’s logbooks had not been obtained, and that the ship had not been inspected. ’s heart attack (see paragraph 19 above).
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in nova gorica. the facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. on 29 october 2002 the applicant lodged a civil action against company x, her former employer, seeking payment of 3,285.89 euros (eur) and statutory default interest in respect of contributions made by her into the employee share scheme (trajne vloge delavca). on 24 may 2011 the nova gorica local court (“the local court”) dismissed her claim and on 13 june 2011 the judgment was served on her lawyer. the time-limit for appealing against the judgment expired at midnight on 28 june 2011. the next day, after the expiry of the time-limit, the applicant’s lawyer sent the appeal against the first-instance judgment, consisting of six pages, by registered mail. on 12 july 2011 the local court rejected the appeal as out of time. it held that the applicant had lodged her appeal on 29 june 2011, which was after the time-limit. on 30 july 2011 the applicant appealed against this decision, arguing that she had lodged her appeal by fax within the prescribed period. in this connection, she submitted a fax confirmation page according to which on 28 june 2011 at 6.54 p.m. her lawyer had sent a six-page document to the local court’s fax number. subsequently, this information was sent to the higher court. on 14 november 2011 the higher court dismissed the appeal, noting that the local court had received the documentation that had been lodged by mail only on 29 june 2011. the burden of proof that the appeal had been lodged in due time was on the applicant. the higher court acknowledged that the confirmation page submitted by the applicant indeed showed that on 28 june 2011 the applicant had sent a document of six pages by fax. however, the confirmation page made no reference to the type of document sent, its content and to which case it referred. on 5 june 2012 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. the applicant submitted that the local court had received her appeal by fax in due time but then most probably failed to print it out and the document had automatically been deleted from the fax machine’s memory. she further emphasised that a timely delivery should not have any negative consequences for the parties to the proceedings. furthermore, as regards her failure to prove the content of the fax that had been sent to the local court on 28 june 2011, the applicant submitted: firstly, that the confirmation page from her lawyer’s fax machine had showed the date of the transmission, the number of pages sent and the time it had taken to deliver the document to the receiving machine; secondly, on the following day, 29 june 2011, the applicant had lodged the relevant document by registered mail which, according to her, proved that the document in question was in fact the appeal against the judgment of 24 may 2011. the applicant added that, according to information given to her by a telecommunications company and a fax-machine manufacturer, it was not possible to prove the content of a document sent by fax as those transmissions were encrypted. on 20 june 2013 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law. it referred to its decision of 4 april 2013 (ii ips 603/2009 and ii ips 718/2009) in which it had held that proof that a fax was sent did not necessarily mean proof of receipt of the document. in the supreme court’s opinion, there was a possibility that the court would not receive the relevant document in due time because of faults in the telecommunications network or similar technical reasons (lack of paper, an empty ink cartridge, the machine shutting down, and so on). such a risk was borne by the applicant in the same manner as if the document were sent by regular – as opposed to registered – mail, whereby the risk of late receipt of a motion was borne by the sender. on 18 october 2013 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint in which she reiterated the arguments raised before the supreme court. on 11 november 2013 the constitutional court dismissed the constitutional complaint for lack of significant disadvantage and for not raising an important constitutional question. on 15 november 2013 this decision was served on the applicant. meanwhile, on an unspecified date, the applicant requested that the local court reinstate her case. on 7 february 2012 the local court dismissed the applicant’s request. the applicant lodged an appeal which she subsequently withdrew.

the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in strumica. at the time when the criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 11-32 below) were initiated, there were four judges working in the criminal section of the strumica court of first instance (“the trial court”): judges m.a., was an investigating judge in the trial court, judge v.d. worked on cases concerning minor offences, and judge s.d. she was appointed as a judge in february 2005. heard evidence from five eyewitnesses, two experts and the victims’ representative. the applicant’s representative was only present when two of the eyewitnesses gave their statements. commissioned an expert report, to be prepared by the forensic bureau (биро за судски вештачења) (“the bureau”), regarding the reasons for the accident, the speed at which the applicant had been driving at the relevant time, whether the accident could have been avoided, and other relevant matters. on 14 march 2007 a mechanical engineer from the bureau drew up an expert report (“the first expert report”), relying partly on the statements given by the witnesses before judge b.b. on 15 may 2007 a three-judge panel of the trial court, presided over by judge t.d., dismissed an objection (приговор) by the applicant to the indictment. the president of the trial court referred to those statements, and dismissed the application for exclusion in respect of judges c.k. on 13 july 2007 the president of the trial court upheld the latest application for the exclusion of judge t.d. at a hearing held on 26 september 2007 the trial court (judge c.k. on 31 january 2008 a fresh expert report was issued by the bureau (“the third expert report”). on 4 march 2008 one of the experts who had drawn up the third expert report was examined at the trial. on 5 march 2008 the applicant’s lawyer, in his closing remarks, submitted that the trial court was adjudicating a case concerning an incident in which their colleague’s daughter had died. he argued that the practice in similar cases was that the judges withdrew in order not to cast doubt on the court’s impartiality. on the same day the trial court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to four years and six months’ imprisonment. it based its findings on the third expert report and the oral evidence. it did not give any weight to the second expert report. her husband and her other daughter against the applicant’s insurance company, which had acknowledged the claim (го призна барањето). had previously worked as a court clerk delegated to judge m.a. in this connection he submitted that there had already been such transfers in cases concerning criminal proceedings against a public prosecutor and a president of a court. there had been grounds for exclusion under section 36(2) of the criminal proceedings act. the applicant further requested that the case be remitted and heard either before a different panel of the trial court or before a different court. the appellate court further held that the second expert report had not been ordered by the court, that the experts had not been warned of their duties and had not taken an oath, that the court had not established which matters should have been addressed by the report, and that it was for the trial court to decide whether it would accept the report. on 11 november 2008 the applicant lodged a request for extraordinary review of a final judgment (барање за вонредно преиспитување на правосилна пресуда), arguing that the trial court had refused his request for an additional expert report (супервештачење) to be commissioned from an independent institution. was the president of the criminal section of the trial court. he further complained about the refusal to assign the case to another competent court.
the applicants were born in 1971 and 1975 respectively and live in the city of komsomolsk. on 27 may 2006 mr s., driving a bus, hit the applicants’ minor son who was later that day brought to hospital with severe injuries. on the same day police examined the scene of the accident, questioned s. and several other witnesses. on 1 june 2006 the applicants’ son died of numerous serious injuries caused by the above traffic accident. on 9 june 2006 the komsomolsk prosecutor’s office refused to institute criminal proceedings against s. this refusal was quashed on 14 june 2006 by the same office and instructions were given as to further investigative actions. in particular, the police were instructed to find and examine the direct witness of the accident who was an employee of the komsomolsk department of state postal service (later it turned out to be b.). the case was transferred to the police for further inquiries. on 6 july 2006 the poltava regional police department instituted criminal proceedings into the traffic accident which led to the child’s death. on 13 july 2006 the applicants were officially recognised as aggrieved parties in the criminal proceedings. between may 2006 and april 2007 the police conducted two technical and two medical forensic expert examinations, on-site traffic accident reconstructions, questioned s., the applicants and several other witnesses. from april 2007 until october 2009 the investigation was terminated on numerous occasions for lack of corpus delicti in the actions of s. subsequently it was resumed by the investigator (in november 2007) or the above decisions were quashed by higher prosecutor’s office, due to various omissions in the investigation and with instructions to carry out further actions with a view to collecting evidence. on several occasions the criminal investigation was suspended because it was not possible to establish a person liable for the traffic accident. during the above period the police investigator examined several witnesses (including b. on 7 september 2009) and conducted one reconstruction. between september 2010 and march 2012 the police conducted three additional technical forensic expert examinations, several on-site traffic accident reconstructions and questioned several witnesses. on several occasions the criminal investigation was suspended because of s.’s illness. on 5 october 2010 s. was for the first time officially recognised as a suspect in the criminal proceedings. on 26 march 2012 the case was referred to the komsomolsk court. on 4 april 2013 the komsomolsk court, having established that s. had committed the crime of negligence, amnestied him and left unexamined the applicants’ civil claim. on 25 june and 31 october 2013 the poltava regional court of appeal and the higher specialised civil and criminal court upheld the judgment of 4 april 2013.
the applicant company, instytut ekonomichnykh reform (a limited liability company), is the editorial body of the evening news newspaper (вечерние вести), registered in ukraine. in the 1990s ms ganna german worked as a newspaper journalist in lviv. in 2004 she became a spokesperson for the then-prime minister, victor yanukovych, a move which was widely perceived as constituting a significant change of sides in the political debate on ms german’s part. on 2 april 2007 the president of ukraine issued a decree dissolving parliament. fresh parliamentary elections were originally scheduled for 27 may 2007 but were postponed; they eventually took place on 30 september 2007. on 21 may 2007 evening news published an article entitled “how i became a victim of demagogues” (как я стал жертвой демагогов) written by mr i. tkalenko (“the author”). she was talking live on bbc radio and she almost persuaded me. and of course i was impressed by her eloquence. i used to think that one could easily debate with ganna german. should make her blush and lower her gaze. she, a nationalist, should be ashamed to belong to this group of ukraine haters (украиноненавистническую компанию). and although she does it for money, she does it with such devoted artistry that it made me want to cry out, contrary to stanislavsky: “i believe you! i think any ukrainian journalist would sell himself to yanukovych for that much money – for a thousand bucks. he is a great guy ...”
what if i were given more than a thousand bucks a month? one does not have to do anything complicated for this. one just has to say, with beautiful diction and intonation, that yanukovych is a lost sheep that has finally found the right path and constantly thanks god for it ...
...
i could also say those things. and many other simple country guys could say those things for a flat in kyiv. at least ten thousand bucks, but all in one go. or for a monthly salary of eight hundred dollars. this is irony, although somebody may consider it sarcasm. according to [the] ozhegov [dictionary], “demagoguery” is “influencing the feelings and instincts of those with low-level awareness on the basis of the deliberate distortion of facts”. it is not possible to argue logically with them. an intelligent man can hardly stay emotionally composed listening to them. the thing is that demagoguery requires artistry. she also sought compensation for non-pecuniary damage. rather, the statements in question constituted statements of fact which had not been verified or proved by either of the defendants, and were negative and insulting to the plaintiff. relying in particular on the provisions of the civil code and of the information act and referring to the constitutional provision guaranteeing respect for private life (see paragraphs 20 and 21 below), the court ordered the applicant company to retract this information by publishing the operative part of its judgment and to pay the plaintiff 1,700 ukrainian hryvnias (uah, approximately 300 euros (eur) at the time) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. i believe that all journalists dream of selling themselves for a flat in kyiv, even those who already have one ... i listened to ganna german and i wish i were as lucky as she is. for the applicant company, the lack of coherence in the plaintiff’s demand that a subjective opinion be retracted was illustrated by the fact that the plaintiff and the first-instance court had been unable to formulate a specific statement of retraction and had resorted to the requirement to publish the text of the judgment itself. the applicant company appealed on points of law.
at the time of lodging his application, he had been placed in a supervised residential facility in springe (germany). the court, having regard to the findings of a psychiatric expert and the results of a re-examination of the applicant’s brain by new technical means, found that he did not suffer and had never suffered from a pathological mental disorder. he had therefore not acted with diminished criminal responsibility. all these offences had been committed between 6 december 1982 and 1 may 1984. the hildesheim regional court found that the applicant had attacked his victims in a violent manner. the victims had been almost exclusively male and had included schoolchildren. he had attacked two homeless people whom he did not know with a knife. they had been sleeping in an abandoned building. he had injured the hand, lip, chest and thigh of one and the back and finger of another. the hildesheim regional court, having consulted a psychiatric expert and a psychological expert, found that the applicant had acted with full criminal responsibility at the time most of his offences had been committed, despite his prior consumption of alcohol. he did not suffer from any other pathological mental disorder within the meaning of article 21 of the criminal code. his personality differed from that of the majority of the population in that he lacked empathy and saw himself as a strong and dominating man, without that difference being of a pathological nature. on 7 may 1990, having fully served his term of imprisonment, the applicant was placed in preventive detention for the first time, initially mainly in salinenmoor prison. in view of another prison sentence he had served, by 7 august 2000 he had spent ten years in preventive detention. the applicant served that sentence in 2002. on 25 august 2003 the applicant was transferred to the detoxification department of moringen hospital. the order for the applicant’s continued preventive detention in a psychiatric hospital was subsequently extended. in march 2011 he was authorised to reside provisionally (probewohnen) in friedland castle in northeim, a supervised residential facility. on 19 july 2011 the göttingen regional court again ordered the applicant’s continued preventive detention in a psychiatric hospital, under article 67d § 3 of the criminal code (see paragraph 31 below). this diagnosis had further been confirmed by the applicant’s treating doctors at moringen hospital. as had been confirmed by s., there was a danger that he would again threaten the lives of others by attacking them, for instance by kicking his victims in the head or setting a dog on them and inciting it to bite them on the neck and face. that risk was particularly high when the applicant – whom the expert had concluded abused alcohol without being addicted, as defined by the icd-10 – was drunk. the regional court further considered that the applicant’s preventive detention was still proportionate. in view of his conduct, it was already unclear whether he would be permitted to continue residing in his current residential facility in friedland castle. the regional court confirmed that the applicant’s rehabilitation could still be better promoted by detention in a psychiatric hospital than by placement in a preventive detention facility (article 67a §§ 1 and 2 of the criminal code, see paragraph 32 below). moreover, it had not been found by the experts or the domestic courts that his alleged mental disorder had caused the offences in question, nor that he was or had ever been an alcoholic. three times a week he was allowed to go shopping in moringen for two hours, and once a week he was allowed to go to northeim for half a day under escort. the applicant continued his work therapy in moringen hospital. he no longer received any specific treatment for his mental condition or the alcohol abuse with which he had been diagnosed. the aim of his stay in the supervised residential facility was to enable him to cope with the requirements of everyday life by drawing on his own resources.
the applicants were born in 1955 and live in baku. on 30 july 2014 the nasimi district court, relying on the official charges brought against the first applicant and the prosecutor’s request for application of the preventive measure of remand in custody (həbs qətimkan tədbiri), ordered her detention pending trial for a period of three months. on 30 july 2014 the second applicant was questioned by an investigator at the scd. yunusovun hal-hazırkı sağlamlıq durumu ilə əlaqədar onunla istintaq hərəkətlərinin aparılması mümkündür”). on 8 august 2014 the second applicant appealed against this decision. he submitted, in particular, that there was no reasonable suspicion that he had committed a criminal offence and that there was no justification for replacing the preventive measure of placement under police supervision with detention pending trial. the temperature inside the cell and in the walking area was very low in winter. however, following his arrest on 5 august 2014, she was deprived of the necessary diabetic food and medicine. the letter also indicated that on 19 august 2014 she had been examined by an endocrinologist from the ministry of health, who had recommended that she continue her previous treatment. on 26 september 2014 the first applicant’s lawyer asked the administration to provide him with a copy of the administrative decision depriving the first applicant of her right to make phone calls. he did not receive any response to his request. the letter was however silent as to the delivery of any parcels between 5 and 23 august 2014. in march 2015 the eyesight in her left eye had drastically deteriorated. it further appears from the extracts of the first applicant’s detention facility medical records (məhkumun tibbi kitabçası) submitted by the government that on 31 july 2014 the doctor recommended that the first applicant continue the medical treatment for diabetes prescribed by her previous doctor, the drug galvus. on 12 december 2014 the first applicant’s lawyer lodged a request with the prosecution authorities, complaining of the deterioration of her state of health in detention and asking for a forensic medical examination. however, none of the documents submitted contained any information regarding medical recommendations or prescriptions made by the doctors following the examinations dated 29 december 2014. on 12 march 2015 she was examined in the presence of c.w. on the same day, she underwent a blood test and gynaecological ultrasound examination. -  on 22 september 2014 she complained of constant exhaustion, general sickness and weakness. -  on 15, 21, 25 and 26 november she refused to be examined. -  on 12 december 2014 she was provided with medication brought in by her friends. -  on 3, 13 and 16 december 2014 she refused to be examined. the sanitary conditions were acceptable and the food served was of good quality. upon his arrival at the detention facility, the second applicant underwent a medical examination, during which he stated that he had suffered from arterial hypertension since 2006. she complained to the administration, but no action was taken. as regards the second applicant’s state of health and medical treatment, all the reports contained the two following sentences:
“over the past month, the second applicant’s state of health was under constant medical supervision, and it was assessed as satisfactory; no deterioration in his health has been noted. as regards the second applicant, the report contained the above-mentioned two sentences. no medical documents were attached to the information report. on 2 november 2015 he had been transferred to the medical department of the prison service, where he had received the necessary medical treatment. on 12 november 2015 the baku court of appeal granted the request and ordered the second applicant’s release.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in kremenchuk. on 19 june 1998 the applicant’s 17-year-old daughter, m., was found dead in a field in the kharkiv region. her body was naked and had numerous injuries. according to the information submitted by the government, on 20 june 1998 a post mortem was carried out. it established that m. had been strangled and that her body had been dragged to the place where it had been discovered. there was no indication that she had been raped. nor had she been under the influence of alcohol or drugs. on 22 june 1998 the kharkiv inter-district prosecutor’s office opened a criminal case in respect of the murder. on 24 june 1998 the applicant was admitted to the proceedings as an aggrieved party. on 28 june 1998 the police inspected the scene of the crime. they discovered the remnants of a fire and two plastic bags not far from the place where m.’s body had been found. samples of the coal and the bags were collected as material evidence. on 30 june 1998 another examination of the crime scene was carried out and the following objects were found: some matches, two cigarette ends, two plastic bags, a burnt notepad with some notes written by m. (her parents identified her handwriting later). on 18 january 1999 a witness stated that on the evening of 18 june 1998 she had twice seen a beige car belonging to a certain b., with two male passengers and a girl resembling m., near the crime scene. the witness also submitted that b. had apparently had the car seat covers changed shortly thereafter. on 14 april 1999 the investigator in the case instructed the police to verify whether b. and his two passengers of 18 june 1998 could have been involved in the murder and to identify the girl who had been seen with them. the police questioned those seen in the car and concluded that sufficient grounds did not exist to treat them as suspects. as regards an inspection of the car and the covers of the seats, it appears that none was carried out at the time as the investigator had to order one again on 22 february 2010. that belated inspection produced no tangible results. the investigation of m.’s murder has been unsuccessful. between 1998 and 2010 it was suspended at least thirteen times for failure to establish who had committed the murder. at least five of those decisions were quashed as premature and as not based on a comprehensive investigation. in the remaining instances the investigation was resumed without any further details being given in the respective decisions. in particular, on 20 january 2009 the investigator, when instructing the police to undertake certain investigative measures, noted that earlier instructions to that effect, given in 2000, had not been followed up. overall, throughout the period in question, the investigator’s instructions to the police remained the same: to identify all the possible witnesses to the murder and to verify whether any of m.’s acquaintances, or any people with a criminal record living nearby, could have been involved in it. the applicant submitted numerous complaints to the prosecution authorities about the length and ineffectiveness of the investigation. he also put forward his own version of events and mentioned the names of several people whom he suspected of being involved in the crime. he was informed on at least four occasions that there had indeed been omissions in the investigation and that the police officers responsible had been disciplined. the applicant also brought a civil claim against the prosecution authorities, but courts at three levels of jurisdiction found against him. there is no information in the case file about any developments in the investigation after 2010.
the applicant company specialises in taking soil samples by way of drilling for geological examination, inter alia, for the purpose of assessing suitability for building sites and for the construction of wells. in the building industry in germany, a number of collective agreements operated, which contained regulations related to the social welfare of employees working in that sector (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraphs 21-28). the employers’ associations in the building industry (hauptverband der deutschen bauindustrie and zentralverband des deutschen baugewerbes) and the trade union (ig bauen-agrar-umwelt) concluded the collective agreement on social welfare proceedings in the building trade (tarifvertrag über das sozialkassenverfahren im baugewerbe, “vtv”). as the federal ministry for labour and social affairs declared the vtv generally binding (allgemeinverbindlich) pursuant to section 5 § 1 of the law on collective agreements (tarifvertragsgesetz), it was binding on all employers in the building industry, even if they did not belong to the employers’ association (section 5 § 4 of the law on collective agreements, see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 20). as a consequence, all employers in the building industry were obliged to contribute to the social welfare fund an additional sum amounting to 19.8% of the gross wages paid to their employees. the applicant company was not a member of an employers’ association that was party to the relevant collective agreements. it was thus not directly bound by any collective agreements by virtue of such membership. on 10 august 2004 the social welfare fund sent a letter to the applicant company with key information about the supplementary welfare schemes, including with regard to contributions to be paid and possible benefits it might receive. the applicant company did not react to this letter. on 12 april 2005, following enquiries made in order to establish whether the applicant was obliged to pay contributions, the social welfare fund sent a letter to the applicant company, informing it about its duty to pay contributions and that an account had been opened into which benefits would be paid. on 28 april 2005 the applicant company’s lawyer sent a letter to the social welfare fund, objecting to being registered with the fund. on 11 october 2007 the wiesbaden labour court ordered the applicant company to pay 63,625.58 euros (eur) in welfare fund arrears for the period between september 2002 and march 2004 to the zvk. the applicant company was further ordered to submit copies of the wage slips issued to its employees between january 2006 and june 2007. the labour court considered that the applicant company was bound by the vtv, which was binding on all employers in the building industry even if they did not belong to one of the employers’ associations. the activities of the applicant company fell within the scope of the vtv which, in its article 1 § 2 (v) no. 6, listed drilling as an activity within its scope. the applicant company lodged an appeal submitting, in particular, that the generally binding effect of the vtv violated the negative aspects of its right to freedom of association. it argued that it was obliged to contribute to a fund jointly set up by the employers’ association and the trade union, even though it did not belong to either of these associations. the applicant company further complained that it was prevented from founding its own association, due to a lack of funds. on 27 june 2008 the hesse labour court of appeal rejected the applicant company’s appeal and did not grant leave for an appeal on points of law. as well as confirming the labour court’s reasoning, the court of appeal held that the generally binding effect of the vtv did not violate the applicant company’s right to freedom of association. it observed that the generally binding effect did not entail an obligation to adhere either to one of the employers’ associations or to the social welfare fund. referring to the case-law of the federal constitutional court (decision of 15 july 1980, 1 bvr 24/74, see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 27), the labour court of appeal conceded that the applicant company, which was not a member of one of the employers’ associations, had the disadvantage of not being able to assert its interests by exercising control over the activities of the social welfare fund via these associations. the right to participate in the decision-making process within these associations was reserved to members of the respective association. in so far as this fact exerted a certain pressure to become a member of one of the employers’ associations, this was, however, not sufficient to amount to a violation of the negative aspect of its right to freedom of association. the court of appeal further considered that the obligation to contribute to the social welfare fund did not prevent the applicant company from founding its own association. it observed that the major parts of the contributions due would be reimbursed to the applicant if properly declared. the court of appeal finally considered that the obligatory contribution to the social welfare fund took account of the high fluctuation of employees in the building industry and served the public interest of allowing for management of the employee’s claims by the social welfare fund, thus preventing a distortion of competition. on 10 december 2008 the federal labour court rejected the applicant company’s complaint against the refusal to grant leave to appeal. on 5 february 2009 the federal constitutional court refused to accept the applicant company’s constitutional complaint for adjudication without providing reasons (1 bvr 243/09).
the applicant was born in 1960 and lives in bad dürkheim, germany. through the german stock market, he purchased 81,529 turkish and 737 german share certificates in demirbank, which at the time was identified as the fifth largest private bank in turkey. accordingly, demirbank’s management and control, and the privileges of its shareholders except for dividends, were transferred to the fund. the fund also confiscated all properties belonging to demirbank. as a result, on 14 december 2001 demirbank’s legal personality was extinguished and it was struck off the commercial register. on 2 february 2001, the main shareholder of demirbank, namely cıngıllı holding a.ş., brought administrative proceedings against the banking regulation and supervision agency (bankalar düzenleme ve denetleme kurumu – hereinafter “the agency”) before the ankara administrative court, seeking a ruling setting aside the decision of 6 december 2000 to transfer demirbank to the fund. the ankara administrative court found that it lacked jurisdiction, and transferred the case to the supreme administrative court. in its submissions before the supreme administrative court, the plaintiff claimed that its property rights had been violated. the company further stated that prior to november 2000 demirbank had never encountered major financial problems. however, no such warning had been given in the instant case. secondly, the board had not claimed that demirbank’s financial situation was so weak that it could not be strengthened even if specific measures were taken. lastly, the company stated that following the transfer of the bank to the fund, a general assembly composed of the fund’s officials had exonerated the former managers of demirbank, holding that they had not been at fault in the incident leading to the bank’s transfer. after examining the case file, on 3 june 2003 the supreme administrative court dismissed the case. on 18 december 2003 the joint administrative chambers of the supreme administrative court decided to quash the decision of 3 june 2003. on 29 april 2004 a request for rectification lodged by the agency was refused. a further appeal and a request for rectification lodged by the agency were rejected on 14 april 2005 and 15 december 2005 respectively. following the transfer of demirbank to the fund, the applicant applied to the board claiming compensation. subsequently, on an unspecified date in 2002, the applicant brought compensation proceedings against the agency before the supreme administrative court. a rectification request lodged by the agency was rejected on 26 may 2005. on 19 september 2005 the supreme administrative court held that it lacked jurisdiction ratione materiae, as the applicant’s case merely concerned an implied rejection by the board, which should be assessed by the ankara administrative court. on 29 december 2005 the ankara administrative court dismissed the case as out of time. the court held that the applicant should have initiated proceedings within sixty days of the date on which demirbank’s equities had been transferred to the fund’s account at the stock exchange, namely 31 january 2001 (see paragraph 7 above). the supreme administrative court upheld the first-instance court’s judgment on 12 march 2007. on 15 june 2006 the fund refused the applicant’s request, stating that restitution was legally and practically impossible. he argued that the bank still owned a certain amount of assets following its sale to hsbc and that restitution was therefore possible to a certain extent. he further claimed that in the event that his rights were not reinstated, he ought to be awarded compensation for the loss of his shares. it found that the applicant could not be considered as “concerned” as he had not been a party to the annulment proceedings (iptal davası) brought by the main shareholders. holding that the annulled administrative acts were individual acts, the court considered that the applicant had not been “concerned” by the annulment. lastly, it indicated that the decisions of the agency and the fund to reject the applicant’s requests had been lawful and that restitution would not be possible.
the applicants are a married couple, mrs r.b.a.b. in two separate decisions of 17 january 2002, after the applicants’ lawyer had filed written comments (zienswijze) concerning the intended refusals, the deputy minister rejected the first and second applicants’ asylum requests, finding that the written comments had not dispelled her doubts concerning the credibility of their asylum statement. the applicants’ objection (verzet) was dismissed on 10 september 2002 by the regional court. they submitted various documents in support of their declaration. on 14 june 2005 the first and second applicants, and mrs r.b.a.b. on 17 june 2005, the minister for immigration and integration notified the first and second applicants separately of her intention to reject their third asylum request. they argued that the minister had failed to present a proper reasoning for her finding that it had not been demonstrated that the first applicant did not belong to the group of highly educated women who would be able to resist the social pressure to circumcise their daughters, especially as the first applicant had stated in her first request for asylum that she had only had a primary school level education. according to chapter a8 vc 2000 “country-specific part, the asylum policy in respect of sudan” under 5.5 vc, genital mutilation is widespread in sudan. women with a higher education in larger towns will generally not have their daughters circumcised. this will generally not give rise to problems from their social environment. the refusal thus reasoned cannot be upheld. no further appeal lay against this ruling. the third applicant, ms x., gave birth to a daughter on 11 june 2011 and to a son on 15 march 2013. no further information about these proceedings has been submitted. the interpretation of this legislative provision is left to the judge. in practice, perpetrators of genital mutilation are not prosecuted. in 2008 sudan pledged to eradicate fgm within 10 years. however, other population groups residing in the north, including the southern sudanese, have also adopted the practice. genital mutilation takes place in childhood, generally between the ages of four and ten. because genital mutilation is a parental choice, the question does not arise whether and to what extend girls can avoid it. an increasing number of urban, educated families are refusing to have their daughters circumcised. generally these families do not experience any problems. these campaigns have rendered circumcision a topic of debate. fgm comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. sudan signed the maputo protocol on 30 june 2008 but has not yet ratified it. 25.42 however, the sudan tribune reported on 8 february 2009 that sudanese activists had slammed a decision by the sudanese cabinet to drop an article banning the practice of female genital cutting in the country. as regards fgm in sudan, the operational guidance note on sudan released in august 2012 by the united kingdom home office cites the following extracts from a country guidance determination issued by the united kingdom immigration and asylum tribunal (fm (fgm) sudan cg [2007] ukait00060) on 27 june 2007:
“‘significant action is being taken in sudan, both within government and by ngos, to combat the practice of female genital mutilation in all its forms. despite limited progress made at the national level, several states in sudan have managed to pass laws prohibiting all forms of fgm/c. the states of south darfur and red sea passed laws prohibiting fgm/c as a harmful practice affecting the health of children. comprehensive figures were not available for the year.
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in tbilisi. at 3.50 p.m. on 19 february 2005 the applicant was arrested as a suspect in a criminal case. on 21 february 2005 he was charged with multiple episodes of fraud. on 22 february 2005 the first-instance panel of the supreme court of georgia, rejecting the prosecutor’s request to place the applicant in pre-trial detention, ordered the applicant’s release under police supervision. the applicant was released at 4.00 p.m. on the same day. on 25 february 2005 the appeals chamber of the supreme court of georgia, reversing the lower-instance decision, placed the applicant in pre-trial detention for three months. it justified its decision solely by noting that the applicant had been charged with a serious crime carrying a possible penalty of more than five years’ imprisonment. this fact in itself, in the supreme court’s view, substantiated the risk of the applicant absconding, given that article 151 § 3 of the code of criminal procedure (“the ccp”), as in force at the material time, provided that the seriousness of an offence could constitute grounds for the imposition of pre-trial detention. on 25 march 2005 amendments were introduced to article 151 §§ 1 and 4 of the ccp; those amendments, inter alia, provided that, subject to assessment by the national courts, pre-trial detention should in principle only be the last resort in cases where it is demonstrated that a more lenient measure of restraint would not suffice in view of the profile of the accused and the concrete circumstances of the case in question. on 18 may 2005 the investigative panel of the tbilisi district court, having heard the prosecutor’s argument that more time was needed to finalise the investigation, extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention for another two months, until 22 july 2005. the court did not address the question of whether the required investigative actions could be conducted without the applicant’s continued detention. the applicant’s reasons for his objection to any prolongation (his good reputation and family situation; the absence of previous convictions; and formal assurances from several public persons, including a member of parliament) were dismissed by the court. the court also refused an offer made by the georgian labour union to post bail for the applicant in the form of bonds with an approximate value of 680,000 georgian laris (gel, approximately 248,300 euros (eur)), reasoning that, under article 168 § 3 of the ccp, persons being charged with serious offences were not subject to release on bail. on 23 may 2005 the appeals chamber of the tbilisi district court upheld the order of 18 may 2005. like the lower-instance court, the appellate court did not address the possibility of imposing a more lenient measure of restraint in order to ensure the aims of the investigation. on 15 june 2005 the applicant requested that his pre-trial detention be replaced by a more lenient measure of restraint. the prosecutor agreed to the applicant’s request. on 9 july 2005 the tbilisi district court released the applicant on bail on payment of a security of gel 5,000 (approximately eur 1,800). when ordering his release, the court took into consideration the applicant’s good references and the fact that he had fully compensated the injured party for the damage caused by his allegedly fraudulent activities. at the time of submission of the present application, while the applicant contended that he was unable to have certain unspecified witnesses examined and to obtain expert opinions pertinent to his case, the criminal proceedings against him were still pending.
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in komsomolskoye village in the kharkiv region. on 28 january 2000 the applicant was arrested in russia on suspicion of having committed an unrelated crime in that country, for which he was subsequently convicted by a russian court to a term of imprisonment that was due to end on 27 july 2004. on 1 december 2004 the applicant was extradited to ukraine and placed in a pre-trial detention facility. he was informed of his right to have access to a lawyer as from the first interrogation. the applicant signed this report, stating that he generally disagreed with its content and that he wished to have a lawyer as from the first interrogation. at the same time on the same day the applicant also signed a record confirming that he had been informed about his rights as a suspect, in particular the right to remain silent and to consult a lawyer. the applicant alleged that he had been compelled to sign this and subsequent waivers because the police had told him that they would not provide him with a lawyer, as he had initially requested. he denied any involvement in the alleged offence. on 25 january 2005 the applicant was formally charged with aggravated burglary. on 27 january 2005 he signed another such record using the same wording. on 29 january 2005 the pavlograd prosecutor signed the final bill of indictment, charging the applicant with aggravated burglary. according to the trial record, the trial unfolded as follows:
(a)  only the applicant and b. were present at the opening of the trial, the prosecutor, p. and the witnesses being absent. none having objected, the judge ruled to proceed. (c)  responding that he understood those rights, the applicant asked to be allowed to represent himself. (e)  the applicant responded that he understood the charges, pleaded guilty and refused to testify. the applicant expressed no objection, and the court granted the victim’s request. (i)  the judge explained to the applicant that he had the right to challenge the prosecutor. the applicant responded that he did not wish to challenge the prosecutor. he again pleaded guilty and stated that he did not wish to testify. he stated that the evidence of his guilt was “admissible and sufficient,” asked the court not to call the absent witnesses since he was ashamed of his actions, and asked the court to dispense with the examination of evidence, pursuant to article 299 of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 30 below). according to the applicant, this record of the trial was inaccurate. in particular, the applicant did not initially plead guilty. at the close of the trial on the same day, the court delivered its judgment. she argued that the term of imprisonment should be calculated from the date of the applicant’s arrest in ukraine rather than from the date of his arrest in russia for an unrelated crime. according to the applicant, he had requested the presence of a lawyer at this hearing but his request had not been granted. accordingly, the court of appeal sentenced the applicant to twelve years’ imprisonment to be calculated from 16 january 2005, the date of his arrest in ukraine. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, arguing that he was in fact innocent. however, he had then pleaded guilty because of pressure from the trial judge and because he had wished to be released sooner and had no funds to pay for a lawyer. the applicant also alleged that the court of appeal had erred in failing to take into account the time he had served in prison in russia. on 30 september 2011 the applicant was released.
the applicant was born in 1947 and lives in plovdiv. between 1992 and 2000 the applicant was involved in proceedings regarding the restitution of a flat which she and her family had been occupying. the flat, purchased from the state by the applicant’s parents in 1968, had become state property after having been nationalised in the period following 1947, and denationalisation legislation adopted in the beginning of the 1990s provided that under certain circumstances even properties which had in the meantime been sold to private parties could be subject to restitution. at the end of the proceedings at issue the courts found that the pre-nationalisation owners were the true owners of the flat by virtue of restitution. those proceedings were the subject of the applicant’s first application before the court, in which the court found a violation of article 1 of protocol no. 1, and also a violation of article 6 § 1 of the convention due to the length of the court proceedings (see gyuleva and others v. bulgaria, no. on 1 february 2002 the persons recognised as owners of the flat at issue (the pre-nationalisation owners) sold it to a mr and mrs p. soon after that, mr and mrs p. brought rei vindicatio proceedings against the applicant, who was still living in the property. their claim was allowed at first instance by the plovdiv district court on 24 october 2002. even though the rei vindicatio proceedings after that remained the subject of appeals, the applicant vacated the property on 10 january 2003. she moved to a house she owned in the village of hrabrino, where she registered her address on 4 february 2003. on 4 may 2005 mr and mrs p. brought another action against the applicant, for unjust enrichment, alleging that she had had no valid legal grounds to live in their flat between 1 february 2002 and 10 january 2003, and seeking compensation. on 16 may 2005 the plovdiv district court issued a summons, notifying the applicant of the action brought against her and the date of the first court hearing. the summons was sent to the mayor of hrabrino for delivery to the applicant. however, in a letter to the district court dated 16 june 2005, the mayor sent the summons back, stating that “no such person has been registered” as living in the village. on 8 july 2005, upon a request by mr and mrs p., the plovdiv regional directorate of the interior issued a certificate confirming that the applicant’s last declared address was in the village of hrabrino. without making any further attempts to find the applicant, on 26 august 2005 the plovdiv district court, after concluding that the applicant was of “unknown address”, published a notification concerning the unjust enrichment proceedings in the state gazette (article 50 § 1 of the 1952 code of civil procedure, see paragraph 18 below in fine). the district court appointed ex officio a lawyer to represent the applicant, to whom all subsequent papers and notifications were served. according to the applicant, the lawyer did not adequately defend her interests in the proceedings, because she failed to seek to contact the applicant, to appeal against the plovdiv district court’s judgment, which would have been standard practice, to make any evidentiary requests, or to contest in any meaningful manner the claimants’ arguments, including by raising what the applicant considered a valid objection that the claims against her were partially time-barred. on 6 april 2006 the plovdiv district court gave judgment, allowing the claim against the applicant and ordering her to pay 3,573 bulgarian levs (bgn), plus interest, to mr and mrs p. 14. upon an appeal by mr and mrs p., in a judgment of 10 july 2006 which was final, the plovdiv regional court ordered the applicant to pay the claimants an additional bgn 1,006.21. the applicant became aware of the proceedings and the judgments against her on 22 february 2008, when she received a notice from a bailiff to pay the sums due. the applicant points to several additional facts. in 2004, she was appointed as a juror at the plovdiv district court for the period between 2005 and 2009 and she received notifications of the court hearings she needed to attend at another address she had provided to the authorities (the address of her brother in plovdiv). at that same address, in 2007 and 2008, she received two summonses related to other unspecified proceedings brought against her by mr and mrs p. at that same address, in february 2008, she received the bailiff’s notice mentioned in the previous paragraph. the applicant is a well-known piano teacher at the academy of music, dance and fine arts in plovdiv whose place of work could have been known to the authorities. in the months after february 2008 the applicant paid the sums owed by her in full. the overall amount paid, comprising the damages awarded to mr and mrs p., accrued interest and the relevant fees and expenses, totalled bgn 8,767.07 (equivalent to approximately 4,473 euros (eur)).
the applicant was born in 1964 and lives in srebrenica, a town in the republika srpska (one of the two constituent entities of bosnia and herzegovina[1]). the applicant declares himself as bosniac[2] (one of the country’s “constituent peoples”). he actively participates in the social and political life of the country. the applicant is a member of the party for bosnia and herzegovina (stranka za bih; “the bh party”) and a founding member of the srebrenica intellectuals’ club (klub intelektualaca srebrenice). he has held several elected and appointed political positions in the republika srpska. at the time of lodging his application to the court, the applicant was a member of the national assembly of the republika srpska. in 2006, as a candidate of the bh party, the applicant submitted his candidacy for the 2006 elections to the presidency of bosnia and herzegovina. on 1 august 2006 the cec rejected the applicant’s request for the reconsideration of that decision. it held that the applicant’s candidacy was in contravention of the constitution and the election act 2001. on 20 september 2006 the bh party and the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal relying on article 1 of protocol no. on 29 september 2006 the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina held that there had been no violation of that provision (decision no. the relevant part of the majority opinion reads as follows (the translation has been provided by the constitutional court):
“...therefore, the provision of article 8 of the election law of bosnia and herzegovina, including article v of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina, should be viewed in the light of the discretionary right of the state to impose certain restrictions when it comes to the exercise of individual rights. taking into account the current situation in bosnia and herzegovina, the restriction imposed ... is justified at this moment since there is a reasonable justification for such reasoning. 12 to the european convention and article 25 of the international covenant on civil and political rights since the above-mentioned decisions are not arbitrary and are based on law. however, i have another reason for joining the majority of the constitutional court in this case. it would have been otiose, reduced to empty words. i accept that there different parts of the constitution appear to have conflicting values and objectives, but constitutions are never entirely coherent. they are always shaped by, and are a compromise between, conflicting values and objectives. such a tribunal has no duty to uphold the constitution. the constitutional court has an express constitutional obligation to uphold the constitution, and in my opinion has no power to set aside parts of it, or make them ineffective, by relying on rights arising in an international instrument in preference to the express and unambiguous terms of the constitution itself.” ...i consider the exclusion of the candidate mr. contrary to the statements of the majority (§ 22), it seems to me that the current situation in bosnia and herzegovina does not justify at this moment the differential treatment of the appellant’s candidacy in relation to the candidacy of other candidates who are the serbs and are directly elected from the territory of the republika srpska, nor it serves a legitimate aim, such as preservation of peace, continuation of dialogue or creation of conditions for amending the provisions of the constitution of bih and election law. the constitutional specificity of bih consists of the multi-ethnic character of state and public institutions. 36/00), stressing the equality of all constituent peoples in both entities and excluding in consequence the minority status of any constituent people in any entity. in other terms, the differential treatment challenged by the appeal is not justified in an objective or in a proportionate manner. i also differ from the opinion expressed by judge feldman in his point 4. this implies that the constitutional court grants the same importance to the peace agreement and its annexes and thus that in case of conflict of norms, the case may only be resolved through a method of systematic interpretation. furthermore the provisions of articles ii.2, ii.3 and x.2 of constitution place the compliance with the human rights and the european convention among the basic pillars of the constitutional order in bosnia and herzegovina which have priority over any other law and cannot be restricted even by a constitutional revision. on 5 july 2010 the applicant again submitted his candidacy to the cec. on 29 july 2010 it was rejected for the same reasons as before.
the applicant was born in 1924 and lives in cologne. after germany’s reunification, the applicant’s application for restitution of the property under the property act (vermögensgesetz) proved unsuccessful. in 2006 the applicant initiated proceedings under the criminal rehabilitation act (strafrechtliches rehabilitierungsgesetz) on behalf of his late father. he claimed that the expropriation and other measures had a penal character, although his father’s guilt had been determined not by a court but by an administrative body. he submitted a vast number of documents, claiming that the historical background of the measures taken under the soviet occupation command had to be evaluated anew. in particular, the 1946 and 1947 provisions on which the measures against his father had been taken could now be qualified as criminal prosecution. new research had shown that their objective was to punish individual germans for alleged wrongdoing. the applicant requested, inter alia, that the 1946 decisions to find his father guilty of being a nazi and the subsequent decisions to expropriate him and confiscate his personal property and the property belonging to his company be declared contrary to the rule of law and hence void. according to the applicant, the value of his restitution claims amounted to about ninety million euros. on 26 june 2008 the dresden regional court fixed a public hearing for 19 august 2008, as requested by the applicant. on 21 july 2008 the applicant’s lawyers published a press release under the following title:
“turnaround in the assessment of the communist industrial reform? for the first time the dresden regional court discusses a criminal rehabilitation application at an oral hearing.” in the press release the lawyers explained, in particular, that until that time the domestic courts had seen the objective of the measures in question as motivated by economic policy, that is, having the purpose of modifying the prevailing ownership structure. they presented the fact that the regional court had fixed an oral hearing as a potential turning point in domestic case-law and announced that they would explain orally and in detail at the hearing what the so-called “economic reform” had really been about. at the same time they communicated the date, time and place of the hearing. on 8 august 2008 the regional court cancelled the hearing foreseen for 19 august and set a time-limit for written procedure ending on 15 september 2008. it found that, according to section 11 § 3, first sentence, of the criminal rehabilitation act, a decision should generally be taken without holding an oral discussion. making use of its margin of appreciation, the regional court refrained from holding a hearing since, contrary to its prior opinion, there was no longer any additional benefit to be gained for dealing with the case. in fact, the scheduling of the hearing had been used to create the impression in a press release, also published on the internet, that by calling a hearing the regional court had indicated that it was abandoning its settled case-law. furthermore, the press release had announced that the applicant would use the hearing to “reveal an important part of contemporary history”. this indicated that the hearing was to be used as a public forum. against this background, the court refrained from holding a hearing. on 24 august 2009, following unsuccessful claims by the applicant that the judges were biased, the regional court rejected the applicant’s request. it held that the measures taken against the applicant’s father were not of a penal character. the expropriation measures did not result in further consequences to his detriment. contrary to the applicant’s submission, nothing indicated that an arrest warrant had been issued in 1947. the applicant’s father’s loss of his electoral rights, his business licence and his personal assets had been a necessary consequence of the expropriation. on 26 november 2010 the dresden court of appeal, without holding an oral hearing, dismissed the applicant’s appeal, fully endorsing the regional court’s reasons. it added that the documents submitted proved neither the penal character of the measures in question nor that there had been an arrest warrant. an oral hearing was not necessary as the documents presented were sufficient for the case to be assessed.
the applicant was born in 1969 and lives in astrakhan. on the same day at 11.37 p.m. criminal proceedings were instituted against him. on 13 august 2004 the applicant was informed that the investigation had been completed and that the case file had been submitted to the district court for trial. the applicant challenged the above decision in a supervisory review procedure. the crime, according to the charges brought, was committed in abuse of office. so far [the applicant] has not been suspended from [his post]. on 7 april 2005 the district court dismissed the application for release and extended the applicant’s detention pending trial for another two months, until 16 june 2005. referring to article 355 § 5 of the code of criminal procedure, the court held that rulings rendered by a court in the course of the trial were not amenable to separate appeal. on 21 july 2005 the regional court upheld the above decision on appeal. on 13 march 2006 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 15 june 2006, noting that the grounds for detention had not changed. during the hearing the applicant was kept in a metal cage. on 27 january 2009 the applicant obtained a conditional early release. from 17 june 2004 to 22 january 2007 and from 5 may 2007 to 25 february 2008 the applicant was held in remand prison iz-30/1 in the astrakhan region. he claimed that the facility had been severely overcrowded and that the cells had been in a poor sanitary condition. he claimed that the conditions of his transport to and from the courthouse had been appalling. upon the applicant’s arrival at iz-30/1 remand prison in june 2004 he underwent a mandatory medical examination, including clinical laboratory tests and an examination by medical specialists. the applicant subsequently underwent scheduled health examinations. he was prescribed and provided with the necessary treatment and his condition improved. the applicant was discharged on 10 may 2006 in a satisfactory condition with a recommendation to continue outpatient supervision. upon return to iz-30/1 the applicant was put under outpatient supervision and given the recommended treatment. despite the court’s request to submit a copy of the applicant’s medical file, the government’s account was not supported by any relevant documents. in october 2005 a dentist was recruited by the remand prison. the only treatment available was extraction and there was a three-week waiting list. the applicant also complained on numerous occasions about hypertension. appropriate treatment was prescribed with the medicine available at the remand prison. furthermore, a prescription was given to the applicant to purchase more efficient medication. at the present moment [the applicant’s] state of health is relatively satisfactory. an ambulance was called for the applicant at the court hearings on several occasions and he was given treatment for high blood pressure. following numerous complaints about inadequate medical assistance in the remand prison, the applicant was transferred on several occasions to the hospital in the ik-2 correctional colony in the astrakhan region. as is apparent from the documents submitted by the applicant in support of his allegations, on 19 september 2006 an inspection of iz-30/1 was carried out by the prosecutor’s office of the astrakhan region.
the applicant was born in 1966 and is detained in the suwałki prison. it attached great weight to the possibility that the applicant might attempt to obstruct the proceedings by bringing pressure to bear on witnesses and other suspects. on 22 april 2003 the applicant was arrested in the netherlands. the applicant was transferred to poland on 20 october 2003. in the meantime, in another set of criminal proceedings, on 1 april 2005, the suwałki regional court convicted the applicant of armed robbery and sentenced him to four years and six months’ imprisonment (ii k 96/04). the bill of indictment was first lodged with the augustów district court, which declared itself not competent to deal with the case on 14 april 2004. the court held many hearings and heard witnesses. on 26 january 2006 the prosecutor submitted a request for the case to be transferred to the lublin regional court. the court held at least sixty-five public hearings lasting up to four hours. at the applicant’s request the trial court provided him with translations of documents. in addition, at four hearings in 2005 the applicant requested copies of the relevant documents in polish. he contended that he had argued with the incumbent lawyer and could not communicate with him. in particular he was convicted on six counts of kidnapping for ransom and leading an organised criminal gang. the period of the applicant’s detention from 22 april 2003 until 20 january 2006 was credited towards the sentence. during the trial before the lublin district and regional courts the applicant was represented by mr m.c. the lawyer prepared an appeal on his behalf. on 7 december 2010 the lublin court of appeal (ii aka 235/10) upheld the conviction. in the cassation appeal he further argued that the trial court never actually provided the applicant with copies of the translated documents although it had agreed to do it. as regards the arguments put forward in the cassation appeal, the court stated that the applicant had been detained on remand and had therefore had to be accompanied by guards during the meetings with the lawyer which had taken place during recesses in the trial court hearing. on an unspecified date the applicant lodged a complaint with the lublin regional prison service inspectorate concerning the constant monitoring of his cell, repeated body searches and the lack of unsupervised visits. in the more recent requests the remand centre authorities pointed out that the applicant had not taken any active part in the “social rehabilitation process” and had been of low moral character. all the commission’s decisions and the requests by the remand centre issued between april 2005 and 2012 had similar wording. the applicant appealed against some of those decisions. in particular, he appealed against the decision of 2 april 2009, but this was dismissed by the lublin regional court on 8 june 2009. in 2010 these took place on eight occasions and in 2011 on seven occasions. in 2010 he had in total eight visits mostly from his wife and daughter. each visit lasted between thirty minutes and two hours. the government acknowledged that during the hearings before the lublin regional court the applicant had been held in a metal cage separating him from the judges and the public, and whilst in the cage, his hands had remained handcuffed. it is also not clear whether the guards were positioned inside the cage with the applicant or next to it. the government submitted that he was placed in the cage, handcuffed, during some hearings before the lublin regional court but not all of them.
the applicant was born in 1946 and lives in bucharest. on 24 april 2002 she was hit by a car while crossing the street. she underwent surgery five days later and was released from hospital on 14 may 2002. the police opened an investigation to clarify the circumstances of the accident. on 19 june 2002 the police took a statement from the applicant, in which she complained that the driver had caused her bodily harm. she also requested 20,000 us dollars (usd) from him in civil damages. on 5 july 2002 the police officer in charge of the investigation ordered a technical expert report. on 8 july 2002 an eyewitness was interviewed by the police. on 23 august 2002 a forensic medical report was attached to the investigation file. according to reports drafted by the investigating police officers, on 30 november 2002 and 16 january 2003 the applicant failed to attend the police station to take note of the objectives set for the expert report. the technical expert report was finalised on 25 august 2004. it stated that the applicant was to blame for the accident because she had crossed the street in an unmarked place without paying attention. the driver, who had been turning his vehicle at the time, had not breached any traffic regulations. the applicant took note of the expert opinions on 23 november 2004. on 17 january 2005 she submitted objections, to which she received a reply on 25 january 2005. on 31 january 2005 the prosecutor’s office attached to the bucharest district court decided not to prosecute the driver, since the fault of the accident lay entirely with the applicant. the applicant lodged a complaint against that decision, but it was rejected as ill-founded by a hierarchically superior prosecutor on 4 april 2005. she lodged an appeal on points of law (recurs) against that judgment. on 4 august 2005 her appeal was allowed by the bucharest county court, which decided to send the case back to the prosecutor for a more thorough investigation since numerous facts had not been clarified. on 29 december 2005 the applicant made enquiries with the prosecutor’s office about the status of the investigation.[1] 20. on 26 april 2006 the same eyewitness was interviewed again. on 10 august 2006 a first written statement was taken from the driver. in statements given to the police on 11 may and 19 october 2006, the applicant mentioned that a new expert report would not be necessary in the case. according to three reports drafted between 2 october and 29 november 2006 by the police officer in charge of the investigation, the applicant could not be contacted, or had failed to come to the police station to give the name of her counter expert. the decision was upheld by a hierarchically superior prosecutor on 21 february 2007. the applicant’s complaint against the prosecutors’ decisions was allowed by the bucharest district court on 8 may 2007. the court held that the investigative authorities had failed to follow the instructions given in the previous judgment of 4 august 2005. the applicant appealed against that decision before the courts. the court held that because the limitation period for criminal responsibility in the case had expired it could not rule on the applicant’s claim for compensation. the judgment became final on 15 october 2008 when an appeal by the applicant was dismissed by the bucharest county court.
the applicant was born in 1955 and lives in pozuelo de alarcón (madrid). the applicant cohabited with another man in a homosexual relationship from 1990 until the latter’s death on 2 july 2002. on 22 september 2003 the national institute of social security (instituto nacional de la seguridad social, hereafter referred to as “inss”) refused to grant the applicant a survivor’s pension on the ground that since he had not been married to the deceased person, he could not legally be considered as his surviving spouse for the purposes of section 174 (1) of the general social security act. that decision was formally served on 13 june 2005. this law legalised same-sex marriage in spain. in accordance with its first additional provision all legal and regulatory provisions making reference to marriage should be understood thereafter as applicable to all marriages irrespective of the sex of its members (see paragraph 35 below). on 5 july 2005 the applicant filed an administrative complaint against the decision of 22 september 2003. this complaint was dismissed by the inss on 11 august 2005. in a judgment of 14 november 2005 the social tribunal ruled for the applicant. 13/2005, which was already in force and deemed constitutional by the tribunal. the social tribunal drew attention in this regard to the provisions and the explanatory memorandum of law no. the social tribunal further recalled that additional provision no. the social tribunal acknowledged, however, that whereas law no. 13/2005 and that, accordingly, additional provision no. 30/1981 was applicable to the applicant by force of additional provision no. 30/1981, the right thereby recognised shall currently be interpreted as providing a solution to factual situations such as the one in the instant case in which the impediment to access to a survivor’s pension is no other than the sexual orientation [of the claimant].” as regards the administration’s submission that in the area of social security benefits the governing principle was that of non-retroactivity of laws and that according to the law in force at the time the applicant’s partner died the former did not qualify for a survivor’s pension because they were not married, the social tribunal was of the view that this general principle was not absolute and that it did not apply where there was a specific rule giving retroactive effect to laws more favourable to the citizens, as is true of the instant case. 30/1981 should be read in the light of the first additional provision of law no. 13/2005 which created new rights and was effective only from the date it entered into force. the inss and the treasury general of social security appealed (recurso de suplicación) against that judgment to the madrid high court of justice (tribunal superior de justicia). on 18 september 2006 the madrid high court of justice upheld the appeal and reversed the first-instance judgment. 13/2005 that marriage between same-sex couples was recognised and that this law affected other rights for those persons who would wish to marry thereafter. the court further stated that even though law no. it had not been intended to govern future situations. secondly, that provision had been envisaged for a totally different situation from that of the applicant. the institution of marriage was open to them in their capacity as heterosexuals. 13/2005 since the institution of marriage was until then restricted to heterosexual couples. 13/2005, because before then they were ineligible for marriage as they were both male. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law seeking harmonisation of the case-law (recurso de casación para la unificación de doctrina). relying on articles 14 (principle of equality and prohibition of discrimination) and 24 § 1 (right to effective judicial protection), the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the constitutional court.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in warsaw. the applicant is a journalist working for the world of cars (auto świat) a weekly motoring magazine. it also summarized the results of the survey. it was divided into five parts: “you can make an official complaint” (tu można złożyc skargę), “brand names take care of the quality of fuel” (firmowe stacje dbają o jakość), “costly repairs” (kosztowne naprawy) and “we go public with the names of fuel crooks” (ujawniamy oszustów paliw). the station owned by the complainant in the subsequent criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 12‑26 below) was included into the list with the following information: “diesel – good quality, gasoline – bad quality”. raport: które stacje sprzedają fałszywe paliwo. brought a private prosecution against the applicant with the hrubieszów district court. he had therefore had good grounds to assume that it had been true. on 18 june 2009 the warsaw regional court allowed the appeal. it noted that the contested decision had been taken with the court referring to a civil case which had previously been lodged by the garage owner and which had been pending at that time. however, this decision had been premature as a hearing should have been held in order to establish all the relevant facts. the court acknowledged that the applicant had relied on the official report, but noted that phrases such as “fuel crooks” had not been included therein. the court remitted the case for reconsideration to the warszawa-mokotów district court. on 10 november 2009 the warszawa-mokotów district court found the applicant guilty of the offence of defamation under article 212 of the criminal code. it imposed on him a fine of 2,000 polish zlotys (pln, approx. 500 euros (eur)), ordered him to pay pln 500 (approx. ’s legal costs in the aggregate amount of pln 2,760 (approx. the court noted concordant testimony from a number of witnesses that the problem of selling adulterated motor fuel had been a serious one and that it had given rise to an ongoing discussion and to measures being taken by the state authorities in order to prevent and penalise it. it accepted that it had been an issue of public interest. it had regard to an expert opinion which confirmed that the petrol sold by b.j. adulteration of the petrol by the addition of heating oil had been one of them. at the time of the survey had not been significant and that it could not have damaged car engines. the applicant had not shown that this had indeed been the case. while it was true that an administrative fine had been imposed on b.j., by a judgment of 21 april 2011, served on the applicant’s lawyer on 7 june 2011, the warsaw regional court essentially upheld the contested judgment (save for a part amended for a technicality). it could be restricted for the purposes of, inter alia, the protection of the rights of others. in particular, it could not be accepted that the article had amounted to a mere retransmission of the information contained in the report of the competition and consumer rights office. the applicant had failed to do so and the information he had published had seriously damaged b.j. against the applicant, the editor-in-chief of the magazine and its owner. eur 2,500) to the plaintiff and to apologise to the plaintiff.
the case originated in an application (no. 71256/11) against hungary lodged with the court under article 34 of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms (“the convention”) by six hungarian nationals, mr lászló haraszthy, mr györgy lászló márton, mr gábor horn, ms nóra siska, mr zoltán pintér and ms  mária  terézia  oszter (“the applicants”), on 11 november 2011. the applicants were represented by mr i. p. horváth, a lawyer practising in budapest. the hungarian government (“the government”) were represented by mr z. tallódi, agent, ministry of justice. on 31 august 2015 the applicants’ complaints under article 1 of protocol no. 1 to the convention concerning the imposition of 98% tax on their severance payment were communicated to the government. it will be payable within three months from the date of notification of the decision taken by the court. in the event of failure to pay this sum within the said three-month period, the government undertook to pay simple interest on it, from the expiry of that period until settlement, at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage points. the payment will constitute the final resolution of the case in respect of these five applicants. the sixth applicant, ms mária terézia oszter was born in 1949 and lives in budakeszi. from 1 july 1997 she was employed at the state-owned national asset management ltd. her employment was terminated on 30 may 2011. a certain part of her severance payment was subject to special tax at a 98% rate. accordingly, special tax was levied on her severance payment in the amount of huf 2,195,835 (approximately eur 7,300).
the applicant was born on 30 august 1949 and lives in nicosia. the applicant was employed at the department of lands and surveys on 1 december 1971. on 13 may 2002 a complaint was made by the director following an irregularity in a compulsory acquisition case. a number of criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant and an accomplice. the proceedings against the applicant involved a total of 223 criminal charges. 18115/02) on a plea of guilty, following a plea bargain to twenty-
four charges concerning a number of offences. on 13 june 2005, the applicant, who was represented by a lawyer, was heard by the psc. on 13 june 2005 the psc decided to dismiss the applicant. in its decision the psc observed that this case had been one of the most serious cases it had been faced with. the psc also pointed out that the applicant had faced 223 charges in total, which was unprecedented for cyprus and which disclosed the seriousness and the magnitude of the case. in reaching its decision the psc observed that it had taken into account the circumstances and conditions under which the applicant had committed the offences. the psc also noted that it had taken into consideration what had been said by the applicant’s counsel in mitigation, in particular, the applicant’s personal and family circumstances, as well as the fact that he had undertaken to compensate for the damage and/or part of the damage suffered by the republic as a consequence of his criminal acts. pursuant to section 79(7) of the public service law (see paragraph 43 below), the disciplinary penalty of dismissal resulted in the forfeiture of the entire applicant’s public service retirement benefits (hereinafter “retirement benefits”). this entailed the loss of a retirement lump sum and a monthly pension. lastly, the psc decided that the part of the applicant’s salary that had been withheld during the period of his suspension from service would not be returned to him. on 23 march 2006 the applicant withdrew his appeal. this amounted to 15,600 euros (eur) per year. therefore, the decision on the penalty and the consequences were very closely linked, bringing to the forefront the principle of proportionality as the main aspect of the psc’s discretion. on 7 may 2007 the supreme court dismissed the recourse, but did not award costs against the applicant in view of the nature of the legal issues raised. 1, went on to examine whether or not there had been a violation of the applicant’s rights under this provision. in the end, however, the supreme court considered that the fact that the case in question arose and was heard on the basis of a different statutory regime from that in azinas as regards the consequences of dismissal entailing the loss of pension rights, tilted the scales, albeit slightly, in favour of the republic. the court stated that, if matters were otherwise, it was likely that it would have ruled differently. on 5 june 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal with the supreme court (appellate revisional jurisdiction; appeal no. he submitted that this section was contrary to article 23 of the cyprus constitution and article 1 of protocol no. in this respect the court referred to its judgment in the case of pavlou v. the republic (revisional appeal no. the psc had had a variety of available penalties at its disposal, such as compulsory retirement, which did not bring about the forfeiture of the pension. it decided, however, in view of the offences committed by the applicant, that such deprivation was justified. the relevant domestic law provision was aimed at discouraging public servants from committing serious offences and at protecting the smooth running of the administration. in the present case, although the applicant had been deprived of his retirement benefits as a public servant, he had been entitled to receive benefits from the social insurance fund, which were calculated on the basis of contributions made by the employer and the employee. the comments in question had been made on a hypothetical basis and did not apply to the present case.
the first applicant was born in 1978 and lives in tsentrelnye koryaki in the kamchatka region. on the same day at 3.00 p.m. he gave a confession statement. later on at approximately 6.00 p.m. a record of his arrest was drawn up. it further referred to the risk that the first applicant might continue his criminal activities on the grounds that, having been released on parole on 17 june 2005, he had been apprehended three days later on suspicion of an offence similar to that for which he already had a conviction. on 29 june 2005 the first applicant was charged with theft. on 19 july 2005 the detention order of 22 june 2005 was upheld on appeal. by a judgment of 1 march 2006, upheld on appeal on 2 may 2006, the district court convicted the first applicant as charged and sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment. the second applicant was born in 1976 and lives in vladimir. on 10 april 2005 ms f. complained of having been raped by three unidentified individuals. a criminal investigation into the rape was opened at 12 noon on 11 april 2005 and the second applicant was apprehended on the same day. he and the government provided differing versions of how he was arrested. according to the second applicant, at around 12 noon he was stopped in the street by police and escorted to the local police station. between 12.25 p.m and 12.33 p.m. he took part in an identification parade, as a result of which he was identified by the victim as one of the individuals who had raped her. a record of his arrest was not drawn up until 11.35 p.m. 17. according to the government, the second applicant was taken to the police station as a witness. they have provided no indications as to when he was taken there or why he was considered to be a witness for the purposes of the investigation. the government further claimed that the second applicant was interviewed as a witness between 3.10 p.m. and 4.20 p.m., and that the identification parade during which he was identified by the victim took place between 10.25 p.m. and 10.33 p.m. at 11.25 p.m. he was arrested as a criminal suspect and ten minutes later an arrest record was drawn up. during the above procedures, the second applicant waited in different offices of the police station. as soon as the record of arrest was compiled, he was incarcerated. at 6.25 p.m. on 13 april 2005 the gus-khrustalnyy town court of the vladimir region (hereinafter “the town court”) remanded the second applicant in custody on the basis of article 108 of the russian code of criminal procedure (hereinafter “the ccrp”) (see paragraph 34 below). on 15 april 2005 the second applicant appealed. among other things, he complained that his detention was unlawful, on the grounds that he had been brought before a judge more than forty-eight hours after his actual arrest and the town court had not established any “exceptional circumstances”, as required by the ccrp in order to place a suspect in detention (see paragraph 33 below). it considered that the second applicant had been apprehended as indicated in the arrest record. it further found that the town court had based its decision on sufficient grounds. otherwise, he should be immediately released.” in the meantime, on 19 april 2005 the second applicant was charged with aggravated rape. on 20 december 2005 the town court found him guilty as charged and gave him a custodial sentence. on 3 march 2006 the regional court upheld the judgment on appeal. between 20 april 2005 and 22 march 2006 the second applicant was held in vladimir prison t-2 in connection with the criminal proceedings against him. the detainees did not have access to fresh air, sunlight or drinking water.
the applicant was born in 1953 and lives in the village of patiltė (utena region). on 20 november 2006 the applicant began serving a prison sentence at the marijampolė correctional facility. the prison regulations were explained to him, which included a prohibition on prisoners growing beards (see paragraph 17 below). the applicant signed to confirm that he had read and understood the rules. on 4 october 2007 the applicant submitted a request to the prison department to allow him to grow a beard for health reasons. he stated that he had been diagnosed with tongue cancer and had undergone radiation treatment, and therefore shaving irritated his skin. on 17 october 2007 the applicant was examined by the correctional facility’s medical personnel. the subsequent medical report stated that no traces of irritation had been found on the applicant’s skin and that, according to the applicant himself, the main reason why he wanted to grow a beard was that his electric razor was almost broken and he could not afford to buy a new one. on 23 october 2007 the prison department denied the applicant’s request, based on the results of the examination. the applicant later submitted another request to grow a beard to the prison department, and on 19 november 2007 it was denied on the same grounds. on 5 december 2007 the applicant submitted a complaint to the vilnius regional administrative court. he argued that there was no law prohibiting beards in prison, so the marijampolė correctional facility did not have the right to establish such a prohibition in its internal regulations. he also contended that the prohibition, which had been applied to him regardless of his health problems, had caused him great mental suffering and had breached his rights. on 21 april 2008 the vilnius regional administrative court upheld the applicant’s complaint. the court acknowledged that prisons were in principle justified in having rules on prisoners’ beards in so far as it was necessary for hygiene-related reasons. however, it dismissed the prison department’s argument that the prohibition on beards was necessary for the purpose of the swift identification of prisoners, and held that such a restriction was contrary to the requirement to reintegrate prisoners into society. accordingly, the court concluded that the prohibition on the applicant having a beard was against the law and was neither necessary nor proportionate. however, on 24 march 2009 the supreme administrative court overturned the first-instance judgment. firstly, the court noted that the applicant had not proven that he had been unable to shave regularly because of health reasons (see paragraph 8 above). the court also noted that although prisoners’ human rights and fundamental freedoms could only be restricted by laws and not by legal acts of a lower order, the desire to grow a beard could not be considered as such a right or freedom. therefore, unless it was related to other rights, such as, for example, religious freedom, the growing of a beard could be restricted by internal prison rules. lastly, the supreme administrative court considered that a prohibition on growing beards could be justified by the prison authorities’ need to swiftly identify prisoners, and thus it was necessary and proportionate. on 15 december 2009 the applicant was released from the marijampolė correctional facility on probation.
the applicant was born in 1961 and lives in kyiv. on 30 june 2004 the darnytskyy district court of kyiv found that the applicant had committed the following crimes: appropriation of private property by means of fraud or abuse of trust, theft of property and theft of official documents. the court sentenced her to five years’ imprisonment suspended for three years with probation. on 23 december 2004 the applicant’s conviction was upheld by the kyiv court of appeal. she appealed on points of law to the supreme court. on 31 may 2005 a three-judge panel of the supreme court considered the applicant’s appeal on points of law in accordance with article 394 § 2 of the code of criminal procedure (by virtue of which it could either dismiss the appeal or assign the case for further consideration with the participation of all the parties). the supreme court did not notify the applicant or her lawyer of that hearing. the prosecutor was present and made oral representations during the hearing. having regard to his opinion and the material in the case file, the panel dismissed the appeal as unsubstantiated. in a letter dated 12 september 2005 the supreme court notified the applicant, enclosing a copy of its decision. she received the letter on 16 september 2005.
the applicant was born in 1982 and lives in baku. at the material time he was deputy chairman of the youth committee of an opposition party, musavat. demonstrations were planned to be held on 2 april 2011 and 20 october 2012 in baku. prior to the assemblies, on 18 march 2011 and 15 october 2012 respectively the organisers, members of the opposition, gave notice to the relevant authority, the baku city executive authority (“the bcea”). the organisers nevertheless decided to hold the demonstrations in the centre of baku. according to the applicant, the demonstrations were intended to be peaceful and were conducted in a peaceful manner. the participants were demanding free and fair elections and democratic reforms in the country. the applicant attended both demonstrations, but shortly after they had begun the police started to disperse those who had gathered. in both cases the applicant was arrested during the dispersal operation and was taken to a police station, where he was questioned. according to him, at the second demonstration he was arrested by people in plain clothes. in both cases on the day of the applicant’s arrest, an administrative offence report (inzibati xəta haqqında protokol) was issued on him. the reports stated that by deliberately failing to comply with a lawful order of the police, the applicant had committed an administrative offence under article 310.1 of the code of administrative offences (“the cao”). in the first case the applicant refused to sign the administrative offence report. according to the applicant, he has never been served with copies of the administrative offence reports or with other documents from his case files. in both cases he was not given access to a lawyer after the arrest or while he was in police custody. on the day of his arrest, namely 2 april 2011 in the first case and 20 october 2012 in the second case, the applicant was brought before a first-instance court, the nasimi district court and the binagadi district court respectively. according to him, the hearing before the court in both cases was very brief. members of the public, including human rights defenders and journalists, were not allowed inside the courtroom, even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public. according to the applicant, in both cases he was not given an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of his own choosing. at the hearing in the first case the applicant was not represented by a lawyer. according to documents submitted by the government, he refused the assistance of a state-funded lawyer and decided to defend himself in person. at the hearing in the second case a state-funded lawyer was invited to assist the applicant. according to the transcript of the court hearing in the second case, in his oral submissions the state-funded lawyer briefly asked the court to impose on the applicant a light punishment in view of his young age. the only witness questioned during the court hearing in the first case was a police officer who, according to official records, had arrested the applicant. he testified that the applicant had staged an unauthorised demonstration. at the hearing in the second case the court did not question any witnesses. on unspecified dates the applicant lodged appeals with the baku court of appeal, arguing that his convictions were in violation of his rights because the demonstrations in which he had participated or attempted to participate had been peaceful. the applicant also complained that his arrests had been unlawful and that the hearings before the respective first-instance courts had not been fair. in both cases the applicant was represented before the baku court of appeal by a lawyer of his own choosing. on 11 april 2011 and 29 october 2012 respectively, the baku court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeals and upheld the decision of the first-instance court.
the applicants, who are husband and wife, were born in 1932 and 1926, respectively, and live in bat-yam, israel. in 1990s the applicants emigrated from the ussr to israel and obtained israeli nationality. before emigrating, they were receiving old-age pensions from the soviet authorities. once the applicants left the ussr, the payments were discontinued in accordance with the ussr pension law in force at the material time. on 4 august 2006 the applicants brought civil proceedings against the competent regional department of the pension fund of the russian federation (пенсионный фонд российской федерации) (hereinafter “the pension fund”) seeking reinstatement of their right to the pension payments. on 4 december 2006 the kirovskiy district court of astrakhan found in the applicants’ favour and ordered the pension fund to set up monthly pension payments backdated to 15 june 1998. on 12 january 2007 the astrakhan regional court upheld the judgment on appeal and it became binding and enforceable. on 10 july 2007 the pension fund lodged an application for supervisory review, seeking to have the judgments quashed. the application was addressed to the president of the supreme court. on 27 july 2007 a judge of the supreme court requested the case file from the district court and subsequently suspended enforcement of the judgment of 4 december 2006. on 4 december 2007 another judge of the supreme court sent the case for supervisory review to the astrakhan regional court. on 22 january 2008 the astrakhan regional court dismissed the supervisory review application and endorsed the judgment of 4 december 2006, as upheld on 12 january 2007. on 8 april 2008 the pension fund lodged another application for supervisory review, again addressed to the president of the supreme court. on 24 june 2008 a judge of the supreme court sent the case for supervisory review by the civil chamber of the supreme court. on 1 august 2008 the civil chamber of supreme court quashed the judgment of 4 december 2006, as upheld on 12 january 2007, and rejected the applicants’ claims.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in petrozavodsk, in the republic of kareliya. she was a municipal unitary enterprise employee in petrozavodsk, working for auto transport column 1126 (“avtokolonna 1126”, hereafter “the company”). avtokolonna 1126 was set up in accordance with a decision of the administration of the town of petrozavodsk (“the town administration”), and provided public transport services in the town on a commercial basis. in order to carry out its statutory activities, the company had “the right of economic control” (право хозяйственного ведения) over the assets allocated to it by the town administration (see liseytseva and maslov v. russia, nos. 39483/05 and 40527/10, §§ 55-75, 9 october 2014 for further details on the company’s status). in accordance with several agreements between the company and the town administration, the company undertook to provide certain sections of the population with transport services free of charge, and the town administration was to reimburse it for the expenses incurred out of the budget allocated for that purpose by the ministry of finance of the republic of kareliya or the federal budget. a letter from the town administration to the applicant dated 19 march 2003 shows that at some point, owing to the relevant budgets lacking funds, the company was owed a significant amount of money. consequently, it was unable to pay its employees on time. in 2004 the town administration asked the legislative body of the republic of kareliya to consider allocating additional funds to cover the company’s debt, but to no avail. on an unspecified date the town administration ordered the restructuring of the company in the form of a spin-off as a new entity, and transferred the assets mentioned in paragraph 5 above to the newly created municipal unitary enterprise “avtokolonna 1126 plus”. the debt which had accumulated in respect of the unpaid salaries was not transferred, and remained with the applicant’s employer. on 6 july 2003 the commercial court of the republic of kareliya declared the debtor company “avtokolonna 1126” insolvent, and liquidation proceedings were commenced. on 18 may 2004 the petrozavodsk town court awarded the applicant 21,830 russian roubles (rub) in respect of salary arrears, default interest and non-pecuniary damage. the judgment became final ten days later. according to a payment note on a writ of execution of 20 july 2006, at some point the company paid the applicant rub 9,206. the remainder of the judgment debt has remained unpaid. on 10 april 2006 a justice of the peace of the 11th court circuit of petrozavodsk ordered the company to pay the applicant rub 614 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. the award became final ten days later, but was not paid to the applicant. on 4 october 2006 the commercial court of the republic of kareliya ordered the company’s liquidation. creditors’ claims which had not been satisfied during the liquidation proceedings, including the applicant’s remaining claims, were considered settled. on 15 october 2006 the liquidation was recorded in the register of legal entities, and the company ceased to exist. on 16 march 2005, in subsidiary liability proceedings, the petrozavodsk town court refused to hold the town administration liable for the company’s debts. the court found that the applicant had failed to adduce evidence to demonstrate that it had caused the company’s insolvency. it appears that the judgment was not appealed against.
the first applicant was born in 1941 and lives in amman (jordan). the applicants alleged that since that date their assets in switzerland had remained frozen. on 10 september 2002 switzerland became a member of the united nations. on 18 may 2004 the federal council also adopted, under article 184, paragraph 3, of the federal constitution, an ordinance on the confiscation of the frozen iraqi assets and economic resources and their transfer to the development fund for iraq (“the confiscation ordinance”; see paragraph 37 below). that ordinance was initially valid until 30 june 2010 and was then extended until 30 june 2013. the federal department further observed that the applicants had discontinued their discussions with the sanctions committee. the applicants took the view that the federal court, and before that the federal department for economic affairs, had jurisdiction to review the legality and the conformity with the convention and the iccpr of the 1518 sanctions committee’s decision to add their names to the list provided for in paragraph 23 (b) of resolution 1483 (2003). they further sought the opportunity to present oral argument on that point. a copy of these observations was sent to the federal department for economic affairs for information purposes. it also decided that the 1518 sanctions committee would have the task of identifying the individuals and entities referred to in paragraph 23. the procedure is then described in the following terms. the committee will reach decisions by consensus. if after these consultations, consensus still cannot be reached, the matter may be submitted to the security council. where the committee agrees, decisions may be taken by a written procedure. the decision taken on 16 november 2006 by the federal department for economic affairs to confiscate the appellant’s assets pursuant to the iraq ordinance and the confiscation ordinance is thus based on resolution 1483 (2003).” 7.2  article 190 of the constitution does not, however, provide for any rule of conflict between the various norms of international law that are equally binding on switzerland. 33 on article 30 vclt and the numerous references cited). moreover, neither the european convention on human rights nor the international covenant on civil and political rights contains clauses which would, in themselves or by virtue of another treaty, prevail over the conflict clause that is enshrined in both article 103 of the charter and article 30 § 1 vclt. however, according to legal opinion, this provision simply means that the international covenant on civil and political rights cannot hinder the task of the political organs and specialised agencies which have been entrusted under the charter with duties relating to human rights (see manfred nowak, u.n. covenant on civil and political rights, ccpr commentary, kehl 2005, no. he takes the view, however, that this principle is not absolute. 9 on article 53 vclt, p. 1910; this is a controversial matter in legal opinion, see inter alia: eva kornicker, ius cogens und umweltvölkerrecht, thesis basle 1997, pp. and the numerous references cited therein). as to the rights guaranteed by articles 29 et seq. being clearly ascertained, those assets must be transferred to the development fund for iraq. for that could have the effect of depriving article 25 of the charter of any effectiveness, as would be the case if the appellant’s frozen assets were not confiscated and transferred to the development fund for iraq (see eric suy and nicolas angelet in la charte des nations unies, commentaire article par article, jean-pierre cot, alain pellet and mathias forteau (eds.), it was also entitled to make available an administrative-law appeal against such decisions. as to that matter, falling as it does within the jurisdiction of switzerland, it should be noted that the applicant has not submitted any complaint of a violation of articles 26 and 36 of the constitution in respect of the confiscation procedure (see point 5.4). the appeal must accordingly be dismissed. in a favourable opinion issued by the seco on 26 september 2008, the applicants were informed that they would be authorised to make use of the assets frozen in switzerland to pay the fees charged by a lawyer in the united states, that lawyer’s activities being confined to their defence in connection with the swiss confiscation procedure and the delisting procedure.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in podgorica, but is currently detained at the institute for execution of criminal sanctions (zavod za izvršenje krivičnih sankcija; “iecs” hereinafter) in spuž. on 19 february 2011 the applicant was detained on suspicion that he had committed a murder. it is clear from the case file that the applicant’s detention was extended on 16 march 2011, 17 may 2011 and 18 july 2011. the decisions of 17 may and 18 july 2011 are in the case file. the decision of 17 may 2011 specified that the detention would last “until a further decision of the court” (ima trajati do dalje odluke suda). the decision of 18 july 2011 specified nothing in this regard. on 16 may 2011 the applicant was indicted for murder. the same day the applicant was served with a copy of a decision of 22 september 2011, sent by fax. 29/11 against [the applicant] for the criminal offence of aggravated murder under article 144 § 1 (1) and (4) of the criminal code. [the applicant] was detained pursuant to decision kri.br. the same day the applicant was served with the stamped and signed decision of 22 september 2011. on 29 september the applicant filed another appeal. on 4 october 2011 the court of appeals (apelacioni sud) in podgorica dismissed both appeals. it established that the decision delivered by fax was identical to the original which was signed and stamped. it further considered that the applicant had been served with a decision bearing no signature or stamp by an obvious mistake, which did not make the decision unlawful or cause a violation of his human rights guaranteed by the constitution and the convention. one of the judges involved in the ruling was s.v. by 4 november 2011 the applicant filed a constitutional appeal, submitting a number of complaints, one of them being that s.v. should have been excluded from the bench given that she was related to the representative of the injured party. the constitutional court quashed the said decision on the ground that s.v. had indeed to be excluded from ruling on the applicant’s appeals as she was the sister of the injured party’s representative. in view of this, the court did not consider it necessary to examine the other complaints. this decision was not submitted to the case-file. on 22 march 2012 the applicant filed a constitutional appeal complaining that his detention had not been extended within the statutory time-limit of two months, that the copy of the relevant decision had not been signed and stamped, and that the presumption of innocence had been violated by the high court’s decision. he relied, inter alia, on articles 5 and 6 of the convention. the courts had a duty to examine every two months if reasons for detention persisted and, depending on the circumstances, extend it or revoke it. there was no obligation on the courts to specify how long the detention would last, given their obligation to control the duration of the detention every two months. the court did not address the complaint about the lack of a stamp and signature on the copy of the decision extending the detention on 22 september 2011. it is clear from the case-file that the above decision of the constitutional court was not dispatched before 18 may 2012. on 22 march 2013, as submitted by the government, the high court issued a first-instance decision on the charges against the applicant. there is also no information in the case-file as to whether the criminal proceedings against the applicant have ended in the meantime and if so what the outcome was.
he is currently detained in kostroma region. on 21 september 2005 he was arrested by the ukrainian border police for an unlawful attempt to cross the border. according to the applicant, on 28 november 2005 he was arrested by the police in belgorod, a town near the ukrainian border, during a random identity search operation. he was taken to a police station and allegedly beaten up to force him to confess to the criminal offences. the following day the applicant confessed to having set a vehicle on fire on 9 august 2005. the investigator assigned a legal-aid lawyer and questioned the applicant in his presence. the applicant again confessed to the arson attack. on 1 december 2005 the request was granted. the defence argued that the applicant was in need of psychiatric treatment and that he therefore should be released and admitted to a mental institution. another extension, based on the same reasoning, followed on 9 february 2006. the applicant was to be detained until 16 april 2006. the doctors also noted that that serious emotional disorder made the applicant particularly dangerous and thus called for his detention under constant psychiatric supervision. referring to his diagnosis, the prosecution sought his admission to a psychiatric hospital. without submitting documentary evidence the applicant argued that he had been detained in ukraine between 22 september and 6 october 2005 and thus he had not committed any crime during that period. he noted that he had never met with his legal guardian. on 13 april 2006 the court held the preliminary hearing. while the applicant insisted on his transfer from the ordinary detention facility to a psychiatric hospital, his legal guardian and legal-aid lawyer agreed to the extension of his detention. as regards the necessity of his presence, the applicant’s counsel argued that it was desirable, but not necessary. it examined other documents and material evidence. two days later the oktyabrskiy district court returned the applicant’s appeal against the judgment of 3 may 2006, informing him that his lawyer or legal guardian were the only ones with the authority to appeal. on 11 october 2012 the presidium of the belgorod regional court acknowledged a violation of the applicant’s right to defence, quashed the judgment of 3 may 2006 and remitted the case to the oktyabrskiy regional court for a fresh examination on the merits. in the end of december 2005 he was examined by a psychiatrist. he had good relations with inmates and was respectful of the authorities. no aggressive outbursts or other incidents were recorded. a scheduled break in his treatment followed. in oryol psychiatric hospital his treatment continued. the submitted documents indicate that during his treatment the applicant was subjected to regular x-ray examinations, and blood and sputum tests. treatment with a regimen of drugs was prescribed. when asked by the doctor about the possible causes of the infection, the applicant stated that he had shared his safety razor with inmates in the temporary detention facility. it appears from the submitted documents that the illness has remained dormant ever since.
the applicant was born in 1955 in the village of z., the omsk region. the applicant suffers from various illnesses, including rectal cancer. two days later, the kuybishevskiy district court of omsk authorised his detention pending investigation. the applicant’s continued detention was therefore warranted. on 29 december 2006 the regional court, without addressing the defence’s arguments, found the detention order to be lawful and well‑founded. another extension followed on 29 october 2007 when the regional court ordered that the applicant had to remain in custody until 1 december 2007 because one of his alleged accomplices had not yet finished studying the case file. the court noted that there were no grounds for concern about the applicant’s access to medical aid since the authorities had made assurances about his transfer to an adequate medical facility if needed. in early 2008 the applicant sought release from detention on medical grounds. the criminal proceedings against the applicant were stayed. three days later the applicant was released from detention. the parties have not provided any information on subsequent progress in the case. a doctor called by inmates only gave painkillers to him. the applicant could only walk by taking small steps as walking caused a great deal of pain. he had to endure the pain each time he wanted to go to the prison shower room, which was located in the basement area of the prison. even toilet paper was supplied by his relatives. on 2 february 2007, again at the initiative of the applicant’s lawyer, a senior doctor from the state regional civilian hospital, dr z., visited him and recorded a further deterioration of his health in the form of an inflammation of the prolapsed part of his bowels. he was in need of urgent colorectal surgery. at the end of may 2007 dr n. examined the applicant and noted further progression of the inflammatory process and the aggravation of other illnesses. he had a sallow complexion, was thin and exhausted. on the following day the applicant was taken back to the regional hospital as an urgent case as his condition had become worse. on 26 november 2007 dr n. examined the applicant. the applicant was stained with faeces, being unable to control his defecation function. he had to wash himself with cold water as no hot water was available in the cell. lavatory pans in the cells had been separated from the living area by a partition. the government’s submissions may be summarised as follows:
 
period of detention

no. the applicant had been given a bucket for his daily washing needs. in 2012 the applicant’s lawyer questioned three inmates, mr p., mr. the partitions were low and therefore could not provide any privacy. no special arrangements had been made for him by the authorities. s. and mr r. also confirmed the applicant’s submissions about the lack of any possibility for him to take regular showers and about the conditions in which he had had to perform the daily washes caused by his illness.
the applicant was born in 1981 and is currently detained in giurgiu prison. on 30 december 2010 the applicant was detained pending trial, on suspicion of drug-trafficking offences. subsequently, he was sentenced to thirteen years’ imprisonment. the applicant was detained in rahova prison from: 17 july 2012 to 23 july 2013; 25 july to 17 october 2013; 31 october 2013 to 12 may 2014; and 14 may to 28 july 2014. on 28 july 2014 the applicant was transferred to giurgiu prison, where he remains to date. in his letters to the court the applicant stated that he had been detained in overcrowded cells in rahova prison. he had had to share a cell measuring twenty-four square metres with nine other detainees. the furniture and the ten beds in the cell had taken up part of the available living space. consequently, each detainee had been limited to only half a square metre of living space. according to him, this problem had lasted until 30 april 2013. the applicant further stated that warm water in the shower had only been available two days a week for ninety minutes for all ten detainees in the cell. the national prisons agency informed the government that the applicant had been detained in cells 2.31, 3.9, 3.10, 3.34, 3.44, 3.48, 5.36 and 6.9 during his incarceration in rahova prison. the cells measured between 18.8 and 24.6 square metres, excluding the bathroom and toilet areas. he had shared these cells with nine other detainees at most. all the aforementioned windows were fitted with bars and metal nets, but allowed for sufficient natural light and ventilation in order to comply with the relevant international standards. the cells had bathrooms with two sinks and a shower. detainees had permanent access to sanitary facilities. running water was always available, while warm water was available twice a week for one and a half hours, between 12 p.m. and 1.30 p.m. and between 5 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. also, detainees were provided with protection against sexually transmitted diseases. heating was available intermittently, depending on the outdoor temperature. during the cold season, the temperature in the cells would be 19˚c. cells had furniture, in particular, bunk beds, small tables, small benches and television stands. the prison authorities issued inmates with cleaning materials, and detainees cleaned the cells themselves. they were also allowed to buy these products from the prison shop if necessary. detainees were allowed to wash their underwear and bedlinen in the prison laundry room weekly. the operations carried out to disinfect and remove pests from the applicant’s cell were preventive, and neither he nor the other inmates sharing his cell had requested them. food quality and quantity was also checked by a detainee representative before it was distributed. moreover, when his visitors had brought him food from home, the prison authorities had only allowed him to receive canned food, fruits and vegetables. although he had complained to the prison authorities about the inappropriate diet, his complaints had been ignored. during his detention the applicant had been visited on several occasions, but had only received one parcel. he had never asked to receive religious objects, even though he had a lawful right to ask for them.
on 13 february 2009 the applicant was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of using drugs and providing drugs to third persons. on 16 february 2009 the applicant’s statement was taken by the istanbul assize court and she was released on the same day. on 19 february 2009 the public prosecutor lodged an objection to this decision and on 23 february 2009 the istanbul assize court issued an arrest warrant against the applicant. on 24 february 2009 the applicant was placed in detention on remand. on 4 april 2009 the public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment, charging the applicant with using drugs and providing drugs to third persons under articles 188 § 3, 188 § 4 and 191 § 1 of the criminal code. on 15 may 2009 and 24 june 2009 respectively the istanbul assize court on the basis of the case file dismissed release requests lodged by the applicant. on 9 june 2009 and 21 july 2009 respectively the istanbul assize court further dismissed the objections lodged by the applicant against the above-mentioned decisions, without holding oral hearings. on 1 october 2009 the istanbul assize court held its first hearing and the applicant appeared before the court. on the same day the trial court released the applicant.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in góis. of the arganil territorial post in accordance with what he had heard in a conversation with colleagues at the arganil territorial post. on an unknown date the general inspectorate of internal administration forwarded the email to the general command of the national republican guard (comando geral da guarda nacional republicana) and to the lousã public prosecutor’s office (ministério público). the general inspectorate of internal administration also conducted an inquiry into the applicant’s allegations. on 21 june 2010 the inquiry was discontinued. the general command of the national republican guard also started an internal inquiry into the allegations on 4 december 2009. he then became aware of the email of 7 november 2009 and its content. on 9 february 2010 the inquiry was converted into disciplinary proceedings against commander m.c. at the request of the official in charge of the inquiry on the grounds that the management of the cafeteria of the arganil territorial post showed signs of lack of transparency which required further investigation. on 30 july 2010 the disciplinary proceedings against commander m.c. were discontinued on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to take disciplinary action. the decision to discontinue the disciplinary proceedings also took into account the decision of the lousã public prosecutor’s office to discontinue the criminal proceedings against commander m.c. he alleged that the applicant’s email had disseminated injurious statements about him. ’s honesty, honour and professional reputation, which the applicant had intentionally attacked. lodged a claim for damages against the applicant in the amount of 5,000 euros (eur). in a judgment of 17 january 2012 the lousã criminal court convicted the applicant of aggravated defamation and sentenced him to eighty day-fines, totalling eur 720 euros. the court described its findings of fact and the manner in which it had assessed the evidence, and held as follows:
“... since the existence of such a rumor has not been proved in any way, the court is fully convinced that the defendant’s intention was to undermine the honour of the offended party, once he knew that this was just a rumour and that therefore he was making an allegation that was not true. ...
the disclosure of irregular situations has to be seen as a duty (as the performance of an obligation) when it falls within the competence and responsibilities of the whistle-blower and when it does not go beyond the facts which were effectively observed. [ whistle-blowing] cannot be used as a basis to cast suspicion which cannot be supported by any factual element. in the instant case, the defendant accuses the offended party of facts which are objectively dishonorable without having any evidence to substantiate them. he further knew that the allegation was inconsistent with the truth and that he could easily have clarified its authenticity with the restaurant owner. through such conduct, the defendant acted of his own free will and in the knowledge that ... [his actions] were not allowed.” on an unknown date the applicant appealed against the judgment to the coimbra court of appeal. it considered that there were no reasons to change the facts established by the first-instance court and, as such, no reasons to reach a different conclusion with regard to the applicant’s guilt and conviction. on 3 august 2011 the general command of the national republican guard instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant. in the report it was also taken into account that the applicant’s allegations had been investigated by different authorities, all of which had discontinued their investigations. the report further analysed the existence of a fine which commander m.c. had imposed on the applicant before the latter had sent the impugned email. however, the official responsible for the report considered that fact to be innocuous and irrelevant. on 27 march 2013, at the request of the official responsible for the disciplinary proceedings, the general command imposed on the applicant a disciplinary sanction consisting of suspension from duty for six days, its enforcement being suspended for a period of twelve months.
the applicants were born in 1947, 1976, 1973, 1983 and 1987 respectively. at the time of the application they were being held in detention in buca f‑type prison in i̇zmir. on 23 july 2007 the i̇zmir assize court decided to restrict access to the investigation file, under article 153 § 2 of the code of criminal procedure (the “ccp”), law no. on 24 july 2007 the applicants were arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of being members of a criminal organisation. on 27 july 2007 the applicants were questioned by the investigating judge, in the presence of their lawyer. according to their statements to the judge, the applicants denied being involved with the criminal organisation. they did not deny that they had had telephone conversations that had been intercepted, or that they had accepted the transfer of parcels and had possessed firearms, all of which were deemed to be evidence of making threats, of fraud and of smuggling, the offences that they were suspected of having committed. on 1 august 2007 the applicants’ representative objected to the order for the pre‑trial detention in respect of the first four applicants. the representative also applied for their release pending trial on 3 february 2008, 11 february 2008 and 13 february 2008 respectively. those applications were dismissed by the i̇zmir assize court on 4 february 2008, 11 february 2008 and 14 february 2008 respectively based the nature of the criminal charges and the state of the evidence. on 13 march 2008 the public prosecutor at the i̇zmir assize court filed an indictment, charging the first applicant with establishing a criminal organisation and the other applicants with being members of a criminal organisation. the applicants were further charged with committing fraud, making threats, and carrying out raids and smuggling, under article 220 and other related articles of the criminal code. on 17 march 2008 the trial court held an interlocutory session and, in the absence of the applicants, decided to extend their pre-trial detention. the first hearing was scheduled for 24 june 2008. on 2 may 2008 the applicants’ representative objected to that decision in respect of the first four applicants and applied for them to be released. on 7 may 2008 the i̇zmir assize court dismissed the objection. on 9 may 2008 the appeal court dismissed the appeal without holding an oral hearing. on 24 june 2008 i̇zmir assize court held the first hearing as planned and the applicants appeared before the court. the trial court decided to release the applicants from pre-trial detention on the same day.
the applicant was born in 1964 in egypt and currently lives in hamrun, malta. having overstayed this visa, he remained in malta illegally. three months later, on 13 october 1993, they married in a civil ceremony. on 18 november 1993 the applicant enquired about his “exempt person status” (see paragraph 34 below) and on 23 november 1993 started the process to obtain maltese citizenship on the basis of his marriage to a maltese national. the applicant’s exempt person status was confirmed on 2 march 1994. on 19 april 1994, following the processing of his application and consequent to the marriage, he was registered as a maltese citizen. on 12 september 1994, he therefore lodged an application to renounce his egyptian nationality (a copy of the relevant application form has not been submitted to the court). at the relevant time, dual nationality was not possible under either egyptian or maltese law. according to the government, in 1994 the applicant and mp had various marital problems, which led the applicant to leave the matrimonial home on two occasions. the applicant had behaved aggressively, and specifically on 5 june 1994 he had physically assaulted his pregnant wife, causing her a permanent disability. the applicant was charged, remanded in custody, and eventually tried and found guilty in respect of the act of assault. in the meantime, on 13 december 1994 a child, lr, was born of the marriage. the various family disputes continued between the couple. on 8 february 1995 mp instituted court proceedings to annul the marriage. the court delivering the judgment was satisfied (to the degree necessary in civil proceedings, namely on a balance of probabilities) that the applicant’s only reason for marrying had been to remain in malta and acquire citizenship; thus he was positively excluding marriage itself, and there had been a simulation of marriage. since no appeal was lodged against the judgment, it became final. two sons were born of this marriage, vr and vl, in 2004 and 2005 respectively. he was informed of his right to an inquiry. the applicant challenged that decision, claiming that it was not true that he had obtained his marriage by fraud and stressing that he had three maltese children. a number of hearings were held before the committee where the applicant was assisted by a lawyer. he was allowed to make oral and written submissions and submit evidence, including witness testimony. he also contested the findings of a court of criminal jurisdiction that had found him guilty of injuring his wife and causing her a permanent disability. by a letter dated 2 august 2007 from the director of the department of citizenship and expatriate affairs, the applicant was informed that the minister of justice and internal affairs had concluded that the applicant had obtained citizenship by fraudulent means and that therefore on 31 july 2007, in accordance with article 14(1) of the act, the minister had ordered that he be immediately divested of his citizenship. he was required to return his certificate of registration as a maltese citizen and his passport. he claimed that he had not had a fair trial and appropriate access to court for the determination on his right to citizenship. the prerequisites for such action had not existed as his first marriage had not been one of convenience. on appeal, by a judgment of 25 may 2012 the constitutional court overturned the first-instance judgment in part. no feedback, apart from an acknowledgment of receipt, was received concerning that letter. he has a trading licence, which is periodically renewed. he continued using a maltese passport to travel until 2014, when it expired, as he had failed to return it to the authorities despite their request.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in iași. on an unspecified date in 2006 the applicant brought proceedings against a third party, seeking the annulment of two sale/purchase agreements concerning an apartment. by a judgment of 25 january 2007 the iaşi district court, acting as a court of first instance, allowed the applicant’s action on the merits and declared the two contracts null and void. the third party appealed against the judgment. by a decision of 21 november 2007 the iaşi county court, sitting as a bench of two judges, allowed the third party’s appeal on the merits, quashed the judgment of 25 january 2007 and dismissed the applicant’s action. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (recurs) against that decision. by a final decision of 2 june 2008 the iaşi court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as inadmissible, without commenting on the merits of the case. it held that, under article 2811 of the romanian code of civil procedure, judgments delivered by first-instance courts in respect of disputes where the subject matter of the litigation had been valued at less than one billion romanian lei (ron) (approximately eur 27,000) were not subject to an ordinary appeal. the applicant had estimated the value of the disputed property to be ron 9,000. therefore, the judgment delivered by the district court could only be challenged by way of an appeal on points of law. moreover, the decision of the iaşi county court was final, even if the county court had erred and examined the applicant’s case in a composition of two rather than three judges.
the applicants were born in 1980 and 1971 respectively and live in zubutli-miatli, kizilyurt district, dagestan, russia. they are the wife and the sister of mr kamil mutayev who was born in 1976. eight masked men in black uniforms and armed with pistols and machine guns got out of the priora cars, knocked mr kamil mutayev off his feet and forced him into one of their vehicles. they threatened his son with firearms and ordered him to stay in the car. after the abduction the perpetrators drove away through the local traffic police checkpoint. the applicants submitted to the court the witness statements of ms ya.r. it does not appear that either of the witnesses provided a statement to the investigation. the government did not dispute the facts as presented by the applicants. at the same time they denied any involvement of state agents in the abduction. from the documents submitted, the investigation can be summarised as follows. on 2 may 2012 the police examined the crime scene. fingerprints taken from the vehicle on that date were submitted for expert examination on 18 may 2012. the applicants were informed thereof on 24 may 2012. on 19 may 2012 the investigators questioned the first applicant whose statement was similar to the applicants’ account submitted to the court. on 21 may 2012 the first applicant was granted victim status in the criminal case and questioned again. on 23 may 2012 the dagestan forensic expert examinations bureau informed the investigators that they did not have matches in their database for the fingerprints found on mr kamil mutayev’s car. on 7 june 2012 the investigators again questioned the first applicant who stated that her husband mr kamil mutayev did not have financial debts or enemies. those persons had visited their house and had thrown hand-written threats inside. the applicant did not specify whether she had had any suspisions or theories concerning the identities of those persons. on 29 june 2012 the investigators questioned five local residents, all of whom stated that they had not witnessed the abduction and found out about it from others. on 6, 7 and 12 august 2012 the investigators questioned police officers from the ovd: mr m.m., all of them stated that on the date of the abduction they had been on duty at the police station and neither mr kamil mutayev nor his car had been brought in. no information pertatining to his whereabouts or the perpetrators’ identities was obtained. on 14 september 2012 the investigation was suspended. it is unclear whether the applicants were informed thereof. on an unspecified date in 2013 the investigation was resumed. between march 2013 and february 2014 the investigators questioned a number of mr kamil mutayev’s relatives and neighbours, whose statements did not provide new information. they also questioned again his son muradis and the first applicant who reiterated their earlier statements. from the documents submitted it follows that between november 2012 and august 2015 the investigation was suspended and resumed on several occasions. the last resumption of the investigation took place on 10 september 2015.
the applicants were born in 1970 and 1965 respectively and live in moscow. on 13 june 2000 the prosecutor’s office opened a criminal investigation against the applicants on suspicion of fraud and tobacco smuggling. on 24 november 2000 the applicants were arrested. on 27 november 2000 the prosecutor authorised their pre-trial detention. they remained in custody during the investigation and study of the case file. on 12 january 2004 the city court set a trial date of 19 january 2004. the court ordered that the applicants remain in custody pending trial. the applicant’s detention was subsequently extended on several occasions. on 3 february 2005 the jury delivered a verdict of not guilty in the applicants’ case. on 4 february 2005 the city court pronounced the judgment and ordered the applicants’ release. on 22 july 2005 the supreme court quashed the judgment of 4 february 2005 on appeal and remitted the matter for fresh consideration. on 29 july 2005 the city court ordered the applicants to be remanded in custody pending a new trial. the court reasoned as follows:
“it can be seen in [the judgment of the supreme court] that the verdict was quashed in view of breaches of the rules of criminal procedure by both defendants, which influenced the opinion of the jury. therefore, the court considers that, if released, [the applicants] might interfere with the establishment of the truth and the administration of justice by putting pressure on witnesses. regard being had to the above, to the gravity of the charges and in order to ensure compliance with the objectives of the criminal proceedings, the court grants the prosecutor’s request to remand [the applicants] in custody.” on 20 september 2005 the supreme court upheld the decision of 29 july 2005 on appeal. on 13 february 2006 the jury delivered a verdict of not guilty in the applicants’ case. on 16 february 2006 the city court pronounced the judgment and ordered the applicants’ release. in the operative part of the judgment, the court noted that the applicants had a right to rehabilitation and could apply for compensation in respect of pecuniary damage by bringing a claim to the court which delivered the judgment in their criminal case. they could also bring a civil action seeking compensation in respect of non‑pecuniary damage resulting from the criminal prosecution against them. on 21 september 2006 the supreme court upheld the judgment on appeal. according to the official version of events, on 22 august 2002 the first applicant destroyed certain documents which had been admitted as evidence in the criminal case against him, and on 28 august 2002 he assaulted a trainee investigator. on an unspecified date a criminal case was opened against the first applicant on multiple charges, including the use of violence against a law‑enforcement officer and the destruction of official documents. on 30 july 2003 the tverskoy district court of moscow found the first applicant guilty and sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment. on 19 november 2003 the city court upheld the first applicant’s conviction on appeal. it appears that the first applicant finished serving his prison sentence on 29 july 2005.
the applicant was born in 1983 and lives in ordzhenikidzevskaya, ingushetia. he is the brother of mr abubakar (also spelt as abu-bakar) tsechoyev, who was born in 1978. managed to free himself; he untied the two others, went to the applicant’s house and informed him of his brother’s abduction. according to the applicant, as soon as he learnt of the abduction, he went to the sunzhenskiy district police station and informed the duty officer of the abduction of his brother from the water-pumping station. who bore the marks of the beatings and whose clothing was torn. then they drove away in a vehicle, presumably, a uaz. according to our information, the abductors drove through a checkpoint situated on the road between ordzhenikidzevskaya and sernovodsk. on 23 march 2012 investigators examined the crime scene. several pieces of evidence, including adhesive tape, pieces of fabric used by the abductors to tie-up the employees and a cut-off piece of the barbed wire from the pumping station’s fence were collected from the scene. he informed the investigators that the footage would be available for seven days as after that subsequent recording would automatically overwrite it. on 24 march 2012 the investigative department in sunzhenskiy district (следственный отдел по сунженскому району) (hereinafter “the investigations department”) initiated a criminal investigation into the abduction under articles 126 § 2 of the criminal code (aggravated abduction) and the case file was given the number 12600026. on 24 march 2012 the investigators took the applicant’s fingerprints to exclude them from the future expert examination of the adhesive tape collected at the crime scene. the replies received were in the negative. on 20 may 2012 the investigators obtained blood samples from ms r.ts. to search her house; this was carried out on the same date. on 24 august 2012 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators. whose scrappy statements were furnished to the court. then the three of them had seen that the intruders had taken mr abubakar tsechoyev along with their two-way radios, their mobile telephones and the battery from mr abubakar tsechoyev’s vaz‑21099 car which had been parked in the courtyard. when he had been taken to the control room, the abductors had pulled a plastic bag over his head leaving just a small opening for the air. several minutes later he had managed to free himself and gone to the other rooms to find his colleagues. the lights had been off in the entire station. then the witness had gone to the applicant’s house and informed him of the incident. on unspecified dates in 2012 (the pages with the dates and the names of the persons questioned were not furnished to the court) the investigators questioned twelve police officers who had been manning checkpoint assa situated between the settlement of nesterovskaya in ingushetia and the settlement of assinovskaya in chechnya between 11 p.m. on 22 march and 11 p.m. on 23 march 2012. who stated that he had learnt of the incident from mr i.g. and that he had quit his job after the abduction. and that her relatives had been detained and ill‑treated by state agents. the investigators also ignored the statement of the guard of the husbandry team who had seen that car at 5 p.m. on the day of the abduction ... i personally inspected the area and found the place where the car had pulled over leaving clear tyre tracks. no expert examination of the tyre tracks was carried out. the investigation failed to establish which state agency possessed such vehicles and in what quantity. i asked the investigator [g.], amongst other persons, about it, but the investigation obtained the disks only on 30 march [2012], when everything had already been erased.
on 31 january 2006 the applicant submitted a traffic accident report to an insurance company. according to that report she had been involved in a traffic accident in her car on 26 january 2006. she stated that she had not known the other persons involved in the accident, that she had completed the accident report in her vehicle after the accident and that her friend p. had come to pick her up at the scene of the accident. the insurance company suspected fraud and informed the police. the applicant was charged with insurance fraud and inciting p. knowingly to give false testimony. the other accused were p., k., t. and v. 6. it was established that the applicant together with the other accused had submitted false information to the insurance company concerning the occurrence of an insured event, the persons who had been involved in the traffic accident, and the circumstances of the accident. the applicant was therefore charged with insurance fraud. this had been confirmed by p.’s statement. it was noted in the statement of charges that no pecuniary damage had been caused by the offences because the insurance company had declined to make the corresponding payout when the suspicion of an offence arose. on the basis of this statement of charges the applicant was committed for trial. on 2 and 3 december 2008 the tartu county court held a hearing in the criminal proceedings against the applicant, p., k., t. and v. at this hearing the prosecutor asked the court to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the applicant and p. under article 202 (1) of the code of criminal procedure (kriminaalmenetluse seadustik). the applicant and her counsel explicitly accepted this reasoning put forward by the prosecutor in support of discontinuance of the criminal proceedings. they also consented to the prosecutor’s request that the applicant be ordered to pay the procedural costs and perform community service. the applicant was ordered to pay 1,178 kroons (eek) (75 euros (eur)) to the public purse and perform eighty hours of community service. the part of the ruling setting out the county court’s conclusion read as follows:
“the criminal proceedings in respect of the charges against [the applicant] ... have to be discontinued on the basis of article 202 (1) and (2) of the [code of criminal procedure] as all the legal requirements have been fulfilled. by a judgment of 3 december 2008, in settlement proceedings concerning the same criminal case, the tartu county court convicted k., t. and v. of insurance fraud. the insurance company rejected the claim, arguing that it had been established by the tartu county court’s judgment of 3 december 2008 that the traffic accident had been staged. on 2 june 2009 the applicant brought a civil suit against the insurance company. according to the judgment ... three individuals were found guilty of having staged a collision between an opel ascona, an audi a6 and a volvo s60 allegedly driven by the [applicant] at around 9 p.m. on 26 january 2006. according to the claim the [applicant] had been driving the car that was involved in the accident. it was established by the tartu county court’s ruling of 3 december 2008 ... that the [applicant] had not been at the scene of the traffic accident and that it had been staged. nevertheless, ... the [applicant] submitted to the [insurance company] a statement containing false information and a claim for compensation for damage caused by an alleged insurance event. in the present case it had been established by a judgment and a ruling of a court that no insured event had occurred and that the traffic accident had been staged. the [applicant] therefore had no grounds for claiming the payout ... from the [insurance company]. ... in the present case, no accident took place. she argued that her consent to pay the expenses relating to the criminal proceedings did not mean that she had committed the offence. ...
discontinuance of criminal proceedings under article 202 § 1 of the [code of criminal procedure] does not prove that the suspect or the accused has not committed the act he or she is accused of. the court of appeal finds that the fact that the applicant committed the act consisting of causing the insured event to happen and creating the illusion of the occurrence of an insured event with the intention of obtaining compensation from the insurer was established by the tartu county court’s ruling of 3 december 2008. if the [applicant’s] position was that she did not commit the act, she would have submitted evidence to prove her argument, but she has not done so.
the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in vienna. the applicant was a public official working for the vienna municipality (magistrat der stadt wien). on 2 february 1996 the personnel office (personalamt) of the vienna municipality accepted the applicant’s resignation (entsagung), and held that she was entitled to severance pay (abfindung) amounting to three monthly salaries. on 18 march 1996 the same authority amended the aforementioned decision, stating that the applicant was not eligible for severance pay. on 3 september 1996 the appeal panel of the vienna municipality (berufungssenat der stadt wien) dismissed her appeal as unfounded. on 9 october 1996 the applicant lodged a complaint against the appeal decision with the administrative court (verwaltungsgerichtshof). on 17 october 2001 the administrative court set aside the appeal decision of 3 september 1996 due to lack of jurisdiction of the personnel office of the vienna municipality. on 13 june 2002 the applicant filed a request for transfer of jurisdiction (devolutionsantrag), since the appeal panel had not rendered a fresh decision by then. however, on 7 august 2002, the appeal panel set aside the decision of 18 march 1996 and at the same time decided on the merits of the subject matter and stated that the applicant was not eligible for severance pay. on 19 september 2002 the applicant lodged a complaint with the constitutional court (verfassungsgerichtshof). on 30 november 2004 the constitutional court set aside the appeal panel’s decision on the merits due to lack of jurisdiction of the panel with regard to the subject matter. on 1 april 2005 the vienna municipal council (gemeinderat der stadt wien) rendered a decision declaring that the applicant was not eligible for severance pay. the applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with the constitutional court on 17 may 2005. on 12 october 2005 the constitutional court declared that the applicant’s constitutionally guaranteed right to have proceedings determining her civil rights conducted within a reasonable time had been violated. however, it dismissed her request to set aside the decision of the municipal council and refused to deal with the remainder of the complaint. the constitutional court conceded that the proceedings had already had an overall duration of approximately nine years, which resulted entirely from the conduct of the authorities and courts involved. furthermore, the subject matter of the proceedings was not particularly complex. however, setting aside the decision (preliminarily) concluding those overly long proceedings would not be capable of remedying the violation of the applicant’s rights; on the contrary, it would again delay the termination of the proceedings. on 16 december 2005 the applicant amended her complaint for the proceedings before the administrative court. on 13 march 2009 the administrative court dismissed the applicant’s complaint as unfounded. that judgment was served on the applicant’s counsel on 3 april 2009.
the applicant was born in 1966 and is currently detained in arad. by a final decision of 21 march 2001 the arad district court convicted the applicant of rape of a minor and sentenced him to thirteen years’ imprisonment. the applicant’s detention started on 21 january 2001 and lasted until 24 may 2011, when he was released from prison on probation. on 11 july 2013 the applicant was again detained, following a new conviction for the rape of two girls who were minors, and was incarcerated in colibaşi prison. in his letters to the court, the applicant contended that in arad and timişoara prisons he had been kept in overcrowded cells. despite the fact that he was a non-smoker, he had had to share a cell with smokers. he lodged several complaints with the domestic authorities in this respect, claiming that he had health problems because of the smoke he had inhaled from his inmates’ cigarettes. by a final decision of 12 april 2005, the arad county court allowed one of the applicant’s complaints and ordered the placement of the applicant in a non-smoking cell. from the information submitted by the applicant it is not clear whether that decision was enforced, but based on his written observations it could be inferred that he had been placed in a non-smoking cell. moreover, the applicant alleged that he had been transferred from one prison to another or from prison to court in vans with detainees who smoked. the applicant was mostly detained in arad prison, where he spent more than eight years. the prison authorities took into account the fact that the applicant had been convicted of the rape of a minor and for most of his stay he had therefore been placed alone in an individual cell of 10.40 square metres. the applicant was detained in timişoara prison on several occasions, for five hundred and sixty days in total. on these occasions he was detained in the medical unit of the prison or in cells used for transit. according to the information provided by the national prison administration and forwarded to the court by the government, the applicant was held in the following cells:
- cell no. 1 measuring 19.69 square metres, containing eight beds (that is 2.46 square metres per bed);
- cell no. 6 measuring 19.78 square metres, containing three beds (that is 6.59 square metres per bed);
- cell no. 7 measuring 17.71 square metres containing three beds (that is 5.90 square metres per bed);
- cell no. 12 measuring 7.60 square metres containing three beds (that is 2.53 square metres per bed);
- cell no 35 neasuring 20.84 square metres containing ten beds (that is 2.08 square metres per bed);
- cell no. 22 square metres containing nineteen beds (that is 2.43 square metres per bed);

the applicants were born in 1954, 1976 and 1971 respectively and live in lecco. the first applicant is the editor of a local online newspaper in the province of lecco. the other two applicants are journalists working for the newspaper. in the course of their activities, the applicants used radio equipment to access frequencies used by the police or the carabinieri. this enabled them to learn of any communications transmitted in that way, so that they could arrive quickly on the scene when wishing to report on specific incidents. on 1 august 2002 the applicants listened in on a conversation during which the merate carabinieri operations centre decided to send a patrol to a location where, according to anonymous sources, weapons had been stored illegally. the carabinieri accordingly went to the location mentioned, and the second and third applicants arrived on the scene immediately afterwards. having obtained a search warrant, the carabinieri searched the applicants’ car, finding two frequency-modulation transmitter/receivers that were capable of intercepting police radio communications. criminal proceedings were instituted against the first and second applicants for illegally installing equipment designed to intercept communications between law-enforcement agencies’ operations centres and patrols (articles 617, 617 bis and 623 bis of the criminal code). the third applicant was charged with accessing the aforementioned communications (articles 617 and 623 bis of the criminal code). on 9 november 2004 the lecco district court acquitted the applicants. it held that the relevant articles of the criminal code were to be interpreted in the light of article 15 of the constitution, which only protected communications of a confidential nature. accordingly, the interception of the communications in question did not constitute an offence. moreover, the possession and use of radio receivers were not prohibited as such. the milan principal public prosecutor and the lecco public prosecutor appealed. 12655 of 23 january 2001) and that the communications in issue were clearly confidential, bearing in mind the aims of ensuring public safety and protecting public order. in addition, the communications concerned the initial investigations following the commission of an offence. they were therefore subject to a confidentiality requirement pursuant to article 329 of the code of criminal procedure. in addition, the radiofrequencies involved had been exclusively assigned to operations centres by the ministry of defence. furthermore, in order to listen in on the conversations, the applicants had had to purchase special radio equipment, as ordinary equipment could not be used for this purpose. on the other hand, the fact that such devices were freely available on the market did not justify their use for intercepting conversations between law-enforcement officers. in addition, in accordance with presidential decree no. in a judgment of 15 may 2007 the milan court of appeal found the first and second applicants guilty and sentenced them to one year and three months’ imprisonment. the third applicant was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. the court of appeal suspended the applicants’ sentences. it observed that article 623 bis of the criminal code, as amended by law no. such communications were, moreover, clearly confidential. the applicants appealed to the court of cassation. in a judgment of 28 october 2008 the court of cassation found against the applicants, upholding the court of appeal’s position as to the confidential nature of the communications and reiterating that this interpretation was consistent with its own approach in similar cases, particularly in judgments no. however, that right could not take precedence in a case concerning the illegal interception of communications between law-enforcement officers.
the applicant was born in 1966 and is currently serving a prison sentence. these proceedings were eventually joined into a single criminal case (“the theft proceedings”). was arrested as a suspect in these proceedings. on 17 august 2001 the magdalynivsky district court (hereafter “the district court”) remanded the applicant in custody pending pre-trial investigation of the above charges. on the same day, whilst being interrogated in the theft proceedings, v.z. in a traffic accident and had killed her husband, a.g., ’s presence in order to cover this crime. later the same day, the applicant and v.z., repeated the statement he had made earlier that day. he repeated the statement he had made on 23 august 2001. on 10 october 2001 the investigation into the premeditated murder of a.g. was suspended because it had been impossible to establish the offender. no verdict was reached on the other charge (see paragraph 21 below). were convicted on various counts of theft in collaboration with the applicant and were sentenced to various penalties. on the same day, the applicant was charged with the premeditated murder of a.g. on 19 february 2003 the district court found the applicant guilty on several counts of theft and sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment. on 24 february 2003 the murder proceedings were resumed and joined to the criminal proceedings concerning the traffic accident. it noted, in particular, that the investigation was littered with deficiencies and procedural violations. on 26 september 2003 the prosecutor’s office asked the district court to remand the applicant in custody in connection with the murder proceedings. on 2 december 2003 the applicant and his defense counsel were granted access to the case-file. on 9 december 2003 a bill of indictment was drafted by the investigator. on 14 january 2004 the criminal case was sent to the court of appeal, acting as the first-instance court, for trial. the court noted, in particular, that after 23 august 2001 a number of investigative actions had been carried out in respect of the applicant without his procedural rights having been explained to him. the murder charges of 11 february 2002 were dropped. on 16 march 2004 the applicant was charged with aggravated murder and was questioned in the presence of his defence counsel. ’s death and of the aggravated murder of a.g. on 27 april 2004 the criminal proceedings concerning the theft charges were suspended. was found by the court to be inconsistent in its details and therefore not truthful. it found that the applicant’s guilt was proved by v.z. on numerous occasions the applicant complained to the court of appeal and other state authorities that his term of imprisonment had been calculated incorrectly in the judgment of 21 may 2004, and that the starting point should have been the date of his first arrest in connection with the theft charges, i.e. 15 august 2001, rather than 10 october 2003.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in the town of shargorod, ukraine. after he got up, one of the police officers gave him some water. that night the applicant complained of a headache and general sickness. he was told by the duty police officer that a doctor would come. according to the applicant, he had wanted to show the judge his injuries but the latter refused, advising the applicant to go to a hospital and file a complaint. the applicant came home and told his family what had happened. he was suffering from headache, nausea and fever which he claimed continued for eight months. the government did not provide a detailed description of the events of 30-31 december 2002 but it appears from their observations that they agreed with the findings of the national investigation authorities (see paragraphs 48-50 below). on 2 january 2003 the applicant was examined at a hospital and was hospitalised the next day. the applicant stayed in hospital until 11 february 2003. on his left thigh there was a large bruise measuring 12 by 6 centimetres. on 18 february and 3 march 2003 several factory employees (f., s., lo. – the police officer had chased after the man. l. had found the applicant in a coal bunker in the backyard of the applicant’s house and said that he had taken him to a police station. later she had heard a noise behind the barn and had seen l. aiming a blow with the handle of his gun at the applicant, who was lying on the ground. after that l. had taken the applicant to a police station. the internal police investigation concluded that since the submissions of the applicant, the police officers and the witnesses were contradictory, the case-file of material should be sent to a prosecutor’s office. on 10 april 2003 this decision was quashed by a higher prosecutor since it had not been established how the applicant’s injuries had been inflicted. those injuries were of medium severity and had been inflicted by a blunt, hard object possibly on 30 december 2002. by a letter of 5 may 2005 the vinnytsya regional prosecutor’s office informed the applicant that investigating officers k. and t. had been disciplined for delaying the investigation. on 18 may 2005 p. and l. were questioned as witnesses. similar requests were also submitted on 16 may 2006 and 11 january 2007. the answers to those requests were also negative. on 2 june 2005 the shargorod territorial medical unit (шаргородське територіальне медичне об’єднання), in reply to a request from vinnytsya regional prosecutor’s office, submitted that on 30 and 31 december 2002 the applicant had not received any medical assistance from an ambulance team. he submitted that when he had seen the applicant in court on 31 december 2002 the applicant had had no injuries to his head or hands, nor had he complained about any health problems. on 16 august 2005 this decision was upheld by the leninskyy district court of vinnytsya. on 22 september 2005 the vinnytsya regional court of appeal quashed these decisions and remitted the case for a fresh investigation. the case was remitted for further investigation. inside the building, l. and the factory employees found aluminium sheets torn from the ceiling and piled up against a wall. the forensic medical expert who participated in the reconstruction of events testified that the applicant’s injuries had most probably been caused as a result of his having fallen down several times, bearing in mind the frozen ground, the height of the conveyor belt and the fence, and the body’s acceleration when running.
the applicant was born in 1952 and lives in budapest. 55/2009 (vi.24) ogy, as president of the supreme court for a six-year term, until 22 june 2015. he was also president of the national council of justice. on 13 october 2011 the general assembly of the network of the presidents of the supreme judicial courts of the european union elected the applicant president of the network for a two-year term (2011 to 2013). this is a serious constitutional problem. ... on 7 april 2011, in relation to the proposal to reduce the mandatory retirement age of judges (from seventy years to the general retirement age of sixty-two) in article 26 (2) of the fundamental law of hungary, the applicant, together with other court presidents, addressed a letter to various actors in the constitutional process (the president of the republic, the prime minister, the speaker of parliament) in which they pointed out the possible risks to the judiciary posed by the given proposal. he refuted accusations of bias in favour of any political ideology within the judiciary, and continued:
“it is, however, unacceptable if a political party or the majority of parliament makes political demands on the judiciary and evaluates judges by political standards.” on the same day, however, parliament adopted the proposal (see relevant domestic law below). by 31 december 2012 a further 46 judges will have to terminate their careers. as a consequence of this decision, the rapidity of judicial proceedings will significantly deteriorate (nearly 40,000 cases will have to be reassigned, which may even result in several years’ delay in judicial proceedings, concerning tens of thousands of persons). the administration of the courts will be seriously hindered, since it is extremely difficult to replace dozens of retiring judges. the constitutional court, in its judgment no. t/4743) and the legal status and remuneration of judges bill (no. according to the explanatory memorandum to the bills, it was proposed that the national council of justice be abolished and replaced by a national judicial office and a national judicial council. the applicant also decided to express his opinion directly before parliament, as permitted by article 45 § 1 of parliamentary decision 46/1994 (ix.30) ogy on the rules of parliament. he said that it did not address the structural problems of the judiciary, but left them to “the discretion of the executive of an external administration (the president of the proposed national judicial office, which would replace the national council of justice in managing the courts), who [would be] assigned excessive and, in europe, unprecedented powers, with no adequate accountability”. in this connection, he maintained that the kúria’s main responsibility, that of ensuring consistency in the judicial application of laws, could be met only if that court were able to deliver judgments in an appropriate number and type of cases. the fundamental law of 25 april 2011 established that the highest judicial body would be the kúria (the historical hungarian name for the supreme court). the date of entry into force of the fundamental law was scheduled for 1 january 2012. on 19 november 2011 gergely gulyás submitted a bill (no. t/4996) to parliament, proposing an amendment to the 1949 constitution (then in force). the amendment provided that parliament would elect the president of the kúria by 31 december 2011 at the latest. the reasoning of the bill reads as follows:
 “in view of the fundamental law of hungary and of the modifications to the court system resulting from that law, in compliance with the bill on the transitional provisions of the fundamental law of hungary, and with a view to ensuring a smooth transition and continuity in the fulfilment of the tasks of the kúria as from 1 january 2012, this bill provides that parliament must elect, by 31 december 2011 and according to the rules laid down in the fundamental law, the president of the kúria who is to take office on 1 january 2012.” on 20 november 2011 two members of the parliamentary majority submitted a bill (no. pursuant to section 11(2), the mandates of the president of the supreme court and of the president and members of the national council of justice would be terminated upon the entry into force of the fundamental law. t/4996 on the amendment of the act xx of 1949 on the constitution of the republic of hungary and also to bill no. the transitional provisions were published in the official gazette on 31 december 2011. the applicant remained in office as president of a civil-law division of the kúria. in order for a new president to be elected to the kúria in due time, the constitution of the republic of hungary (amendment) act (act clix of 2011, adopted on 28 november 2011, see paragraph 31 above) entered into force on 2 december 2011. this provided that he or she would be elected by parliament from among the judges appointed for an indeterminate term and having served at least five years as a judge (section 114(1) of act clxi of 2011 – see relevant domestic law below).

[it] is pointless and not efficient to conduct training only for the traffic police officers of kherson and antonivka. a lieutenant-colonel, ... briefed those police officers who were due to participate in the training but failed to notify the head of the department of the time of the training and did not personally supervise the progress of the training ... 20. and a. should be dismissed and that the dismissal of police officer s. should be initiated before the ministry of the interior. however, it was decided not to dismiss but rather to demote os. it had been impossible to involve only the traffic police in the training since operation sirena had required joint action, involving both the police and the traffic police;
- s., a deputy head of the kherson regional department, testified that there had been no legal instruments governing the conduct of police training under operation sirena. during a confrontation held between k. and traffic police office ko., it was noted that this decision was not subject to appeal. on 19 may 2009 the kherson regional court of appeal upheld this decision. on 27 and 28 june 2000, citing the same reasons, the district prosecutor’s office refused to institute criminal proceedings against p. and o.  on 18 august 2000 those decisions were quashed by the kherson regional prosecutor’s office and the case was remitted for additional investigation. it had also not been established which legal instruments regulated police training exercises. 230 of the ministry of the interior (see paragraph 66 below), the relevant skills were “to be mastered during training [conducted] under realistic conditions”. the recommenced proceedings were again terminated on 29 march 2001. p. testified that, “under the department’s instructions regarding the ‘sirena’ training plan”, it had not been his responsibility to circulate the information that the announcement about the car hijacking was part of a training exercise. it was noted that a number of investigative actions had yet to be undertaken and a number of issues had yet to be clarified. 230 was not classified and should therefore be added to the case materials. the applicants instituted proceedings against the kherson regional department claiming compensation for damage inflicted by their son’s death. on 8 september 2006 the suvorovskyy district court, examining the case under administrative procedure, found for the applicants.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in odesa. on 22 january 2004, on the basis of a pre-investigation inquiry, criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant and two other persons in connection with a robbery committed the night before. he noted that the applicant had been suspected in having committed a serious crime and, if released, might abscond in order to avoid the investigation and prevent the establishment of the truth in the case. the applicant did not appeal against this decision. on 18 march 2004, in the presence of the prosecutor and in the absence of the applicant, the district court allowed the investigator’s request and extended the applicant’s detention for one month in view of the need to carry out certain investigative steps to complete the investigation. on 8 april 2004 the investigation was completed and the criminal case was sent for trial. on 5 may 2004, in the committal hearings, the district court made no ruling in respect of the applicant’s further detention. in reply to the applicant’s request of 7 november 2005, the court informed the applicant that all petitions should be “lodged and examined at a hearing”. on 2 june 2008 the supreme court of ukraine rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal on points of law. the parties provided different accounts of the events. thereafter, he had been forced to go to the police station. in view of the beating he had been given, he had been unable to resist and had had to go with the officers. the ruling further suggests that, when questioned as a witness, k. had stated that on 22 january 2004 whilst on duty as a security service officer, he had witnessed his brother being apprehended by the police. when the applicant opened the door, they had checked his documents, had apprehended him and had escorted him to the police station. k. submitted that the applicant’s sister had also been present in the apartment. by the aforementioned ruling of 29 march 2005, the district court ordered the prosecutor’s office to identify, by 11 april 2005, the persons who had apprehended the applicant and to question them and the applicant’s sister in relation to the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment. thereafter, she had woken the applicant, and the police officers had asked him to proceed to the police station, having informed him that two other individuals had committed a crime and he needed to present himself with a view to further inquiry. the applicant had got dressed and had gone with the police officers. she stated, however, that she had heard raised voices during the conversation between the applicant and the police officers. he claimed that k. and his three colleagues had come to his apartment. as they were demanding that the applicant go to the police station, the applicant’s sister ‒ who had been sleeping in another room – had come in. an hour later they had come back, accompanied by the police officer who afterwards questioned the applicant at the police station. lastly, the applicant alleged that k. had forced his sister to give false evidence. on 4 june 2007 the prosecutor questioned the police officer who had been identified as the one who had apprehended the applicant. after entering the apartment, the officer had identified himself and had informed the applicant that there had been testimony against him. the documents before the court indicate that on 26 january 2004 the applicant was admitted to odesa sizo. the x-ray of 25 january 2004 was mentioned as one of the documents in the applicant’s file upon his admission to the sizo. according to the information provided by the government, the applicant was held in the following cells:

on 24 february 1998 police carried out an initial forensic investigation of an apartment which a.m. and her son had shared with the applicants in june 1997, the date she had last been seen. however, a full forensic examination of the property does not appear to have disclosed any relevant evidence. following the interviews, neither applicant was arrested or charged with any offence owing to insufficient evidence. they were therefore returned to prison to continue serving their respective sentences. by november 1998 no progress had been made in finding a.m. and the police inquiry was scaled down. the scottish executive subsequently revoked their licences. they were returned to the united kingdom, where they were recalled to prison to serve the unexpired portion of their licence periods. between 1 and 4 april 2005 a decision was made by the procurator fiscal, following consultation with crown counsel, to place both applicants on petition in relation to the murder of a.m. the crown’s position was that a.m. had threatened to report the applicants to the police after discovering that they were sexually abusing her son. on 5 april 2005 the applicants were charged with the murder of a.m. and with concealing and disposing of her body in an attempt to pervert the course of justice. they appeared on petition at kilmarnock sheriff court were they were committed for further examination and remanded in custody. the police continued to pursue their investigation and enquiries. on 6 june 2005 the crown office provisionally fixed a preliminary hearing date for 12 september 2005. meanwhile, a proof of life report was produced on 18 november 2005 (supplemented on 5 january 2006), which concluded that a.m. had been dead since approximately june 1997. however, the decision would remain under periodic review. the twelve-month period for bringing proceedings expired on 4 april 2006 and the lord advocate did not seek an extension of time. it also contained a number of additional charges relating to various sexual offences. although the applicants were granted permission to appeal, their appeal was refused on 5 june 2009. the first applicant also argued that the murder charge against him should be dismissed for reason of delay. the first applicant appealed against the decision not to dismiss the charge against him. both appeals were dismissed on 26 november 2009. in dismissing the first applicant’s appeal, the appeal court accepted that the police had interrogated him “robustly” in 1998, but agreed with the high court that he was not “charged” until 5 april 2005. the court considered that the crown had acted without fault since that time, and, in the particular circumstances of the case, it could not be said that the matter would not be determined within a reasonable time. the applicants’ trial for the sexual offences took place between 19 april 2010 and 13 may 2010. both applicants unsuccessfully sought to appeal against conviction and sentence. the high court dismissed the minute as the arguments advanced by the second applicant related to unreasonable delay and not to missing evidence (which was the argument raised in the original minute). the applicants appealed against conviction and sentence. the first applicant lodged a note of appeal on 2 september 2010, containing numerous grounds and sub-grounds on a wide range of issues regarding all the charges. the sifting judges granted him leave to appeal against his sentence for murder, but not against his conviction. on 8 february 2012 the appeal court granted the first applicant leave to appeal against his conviction on one ground only, which alleged an error by the trial judge. the court concluded that the correct “starting point” in the applicants’ proceedings was 5 april 2005 and the case was remitted to the appeal court.
the applicant was born in 1948 and lives in belgrade. the applicant was employed by “pim – bagerovanje i vodni transport”, a socially-owned company based in belgrade (“the debtor”). on 30 march 2005 the belgrade second municipal court (drugi opštinski sud u beogradu) ordered the debtor to pay the applicant specified sums in respect of salary arrears, social security contributions and procedural costs. this judgment became final on the same date. on 22 june 2005 the belgrade fourth municipal court (četvrti opštinski sud u beogradu) issued an enforcement order with regard to the said judgement. on 29 march 2012, acting upon the applicant’s constitutional appeal, the constitutional court held that the applicant had suffered a breach of the “right to a trial within a reasonable time” with regard to the enforcement proceedings. the court ordered the acceleration of the proceedings and declared that the applicant was entitled to compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered in the amount of eur 700, converted into the national currency at the rate applicable at the date of settlement. the enforcement proceedings instituted on the basis of the judgment rendered by the belgrade second municipal court on 30 march 2005 continued and are still pending.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in węglówka. the car had been borrowed from the applicant’s friend. on a narrow section of the road they saw a police car trying to stop another car. they decided to stop the car to inspect it. they overtook the applicant and his wife, stopped the car and requested the relevant documents. they considered that the registration document of the car was partly illegible. he then requested that they all drive to the police station because he wanted to speak to the officers’ supervisor. they found that, apart from the light that did not work, the fire extinguisher in the car was too small. the applicant then told her: “do not sign anything for those beggars” (“nie podpisuj nic tym dziadom”). the officers felt offended and one of them told the applicant that he would be arrested for insulting police officers. when the applicant calmed down he was handcuffed. his wife informed the policemen that her husband had heart problems, so they called an ambulance. the doctor who came to the police station considered that the applicant needed to be examined in a hospital so he was taken to nowy targ. the note was marked “urgent” but bore no date. on 28 january 2009 the applicant lodged a complaint about his arrest with the nowy targ district court (“the district court”). he had been released from the police custody facility at about midday and let out by the back door without a jacket or any money. on 4 february 2009 the district court refused to allow the applicant’s complaint. on 22 february 2009 the police lodged an indictment against the applicant with the district court. he submitted that he had not intended to hit anybody. as he could not rule out that he had made the movements with his legs involuntarily, without the intention of hitting anybody. he submitted that he did not feel guilty; on the contrary, he had been a victim. he also considered that he could not have violated anybody’s personal inviolability because he had been pressed against the ground and two officers had been sitting on his back trying to handcuff him. on 28 january 2009 the applicant reported the two police officers who had arrested him on 26 january 2009 to the nowy targ district prosecutor for abuse of power. on 11 march 2009 the applicant and his wife were questioned. on 9 april 2009 the prosecutor questioned officers d.b. on 16 april 2009 the district prosecutor discontinued the investigation, finding that no offence of abuse of power had been committed. referring to the relevant provisions of domestic law, in particular the 1990 police act, the prosecutor found that the police had had the right to use force because “the applicant had not obeyed their orders, had behaved nervously and had tried to run away”. he argued, among other things, that the prosecutor had not properly examined the circumstances of the case; the officers had apprehended him for no legal reason. it found that the applicant had again repeated his version of events which the prosecutor had found not to be credible. the court did not refer in any way to his submissions as regards his injuries.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in warsaw. the applicant was detained from 15 june 2007 until 21 january 2009 after a conviction. neither the applicant nor the government contested them. more particularly, the applicant had between 1.9 to 2.6 sq. in 2008 or 2009, however, construction work started and the toilets were gradually enclosed by concrete walls with a door. all of the applicant’s cells were well-lit, ventilated and, when necessary, heated. they were equipped with enough bunk beds for each detainee to have a separate place to sleep, as well as a table, stools and cupboards. however, detainees continued to have access to a library and various forms of leisure and cultural activities. initially, the applicant had one hot shower per week. from 18 october 2007 that number was increased to five per month. he did not submit any documents to that effect. prisoners wishing to attend had to sign up with their supervisors (wychowawca). the system had been designed to select prisoners on a rotation basis, according to their classification groups and in a way so as not to mix prisoners classed as dangerous detainees with those who did not require any special security measures. at times, however, individual prisoners were rejected because they did not belong to the group authorised to attend mass on a particular day. during his detention in koszalin remand centre, the applicant often made appointments with the in-house doctor because of colds, back ache and prostate problems. on 15 november 2007 a drug called prostamol was prescribed for the applicant, in compliance with his wish. a generic medicine was offered to the applicant instead. eventually, doxar was sent to the prison by the applicant’s relatives. the applicant also received treatment for a scalp condition, tinea versicolor (łupież pstry). in addition to that treatment, from 18 october 2007 onwards, he was entitled to an additional monthly shower. consequently, the applicant’s treatment was changed slightly. the expert also concluded that the applicant had received the treatment which was usually prescribed in such cases by dermatologists. subsequently, throughout 2008, he made twelve medical appointments. in 2008 the applicant also obtained dentures. in 2007 and 2009 the applicant lodged a number of complaints with the ombudsman, the ministry of justice and the relevant penitentiary court, informing them of the allegedly deplorable conditions of his detention, his inadequate medical care and of unreasonable restrictions on the practice of his religion during his detention in koszalin remand centre. it was established that the applicant had received adequate medical care. the remand facility in dobrowo had not registered any overcrowding. he claimed 50,000 polish zlotys (pln) (approximately 12,000 euros (eur)) in compensation. it was also noted that detainees had been free to make individual appointments with the remand centre’s priest. the applicant submitted a hand-written appeal against the above-mentioned judgment, dated 24 january 2011.
the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in enschede. on 21 may 2010 the applicant was convicted of shoplifting. it took into account the statements of different police officers and probation officers who had had direct contact with the applicant. from these statements it appeared that the applicant was a drug addict who would not voluntarily cooperate with treatment plans. the regional court further decided that the measure would be reviewed six months from the date the judgment became final (5 june 2010). on 1 december 2010 the regional court reviewed the measure and decided not to terminate it, because it was deemed that there was still a high risk of the applicant reoffending. the applicant appealed against this decision on 6 december 2010, but on 19 april 2011 the arnhem court of appeal (gerechtshof) dismissed the appeal. the applicant’s personal case officer, issued a progress report about the applicant, containing, amongst other things, the following:
“[the applicant] is currently residing in fpa de cederborg. the placement is progressing reasonably well. (...) if the measure should be terminated, [the applicant] will immediately find himself in a situation where he has no income, housing or daily activities. the risk of reoffending is consequently high. to lower the risk of reoffending the measure should be continued.” the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision on 15 june 2011. on 8 november 2011 counsel for the applicant made inquiries with the court of appeal about the progress of the appeal and requested that its examination be given priority. prior to the hearing before the court of appeal, counsel for the applicant requested in a letter of 18 november 2011 that, for the benefit of the applicant, an interpreter be present who spoke aramaic or assyrian, and he gave the name of an interpreter who spoke the correct language. on 12 december 2011 a hearing took place before the court of appeal. it appeared that the applicant was unable to understand the interpreter who spoke assyrian. with the applicant’s agreement, the case was adjourned for a maximum period of three months to allow counsel for the applicant to put written questions to certain of the applicant’s counsellors. it was also determined that case officer g.d. should be heard as an expert witness and that an interpreter speaking aramaic should be present at the next hearing. after a period of three months had elapsed, counsel for the applicant inquired with the court of appeal into the progress of the proceedings on 13 march and again on 2 april 2012. the proceedings were resumed on 10 may 2012, when a hearing took place. declared the following:
“[the applicant] is no longer addicted to substances. the risk of reoffending is maximally reduced at this moment. the parole board has made several attempts to include [the applicant] in a treatment plan, but unfortunately this has not been sufficiently achieved. the applicant] is now residing in a halfway house and has been placed on the waiting list for sheltered accommodation.” it would appear that sheltered accommodation became available for the applicant on 11 may 2012. it took more than ten months after the appeal was lodged before it was dealt with on the merits. unlike counsel [for the applicant], the court is of the opinion that the decision to accept that a violation of the convention has occurred in itself constitutes sufficient satisfaction for the outrage to his sense of justice. termination
the court of appeal has held that the execution of the measure has not been sufficiently expeditious in all stages.
the applicants all live in žilina, except for mr kyška, mr p. lalinský and ms vestfálová, who live in turie, bytča and nemecká nad hronom respectively. 74258/01, 27 november 2007 (merits) and 27 january 2009 (just satisfaction)), jenisová (no. 58764/00, 3 november 2009), šefčíková (no. 6284/02, 3 november 2009), and salus (no. they acquired title to this land by way of inheritance from their predecessors. under section 22(2) thereof, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary with the applicants, the gardeners acquired a tenancy right in respect of the land in question with effect from the date of the act’s entry into force. the rent payable for such tenancy was regulated under section 22(3) of the land ownership act until this provision was replaced by the allotments act, which entered into force on 26 march 1997. in the case of the applicant ms l. kothajová, an agreement was reached that, as from 2004, she would be paid rent equivalent to eur 0.01168 per square metre and per year. the applicable statutory regime was amended ‒ after the court’s above-mentioned judgments had become final ‒ with effect from 1 april 2011 by law no. these formulae take into account what is known as the “general situation index” (“the gsi”), ranging originally from 0.70 to 2.00, normally depending on the geographical location of the property. however, prior to the entry into force of the amendments introduced by law no. 57/2011, regulation 492/2004 had been amended by regulation no. these amendments left the compulsory tenancy introduced by the allotments act unaffected. such a tenancy arrangement remains in place until the completion of what are known as land consolidation proceedings in a given area. such proceedings are also provided for under the act, their aim being to have the ownership and use of the land in the allotment area consolidated, principally by transferring title to the land to the gardeners and having the former owners compensated by means regulated under the act, the details of such consolidation being defined in what is known as a “land consolidation project”. in the applicants’ case, the gardeners initiated the requisite land consolidation proceedings on 7 december 1998. the parties disagreed as to the amount of rent payable for the applicants’ property. their positions and the documents submitted in their support may be summarised as follows. 05/2010 dated 29 march 2010, in which a sworn expert, a, estimated the general value of the rent in question by reference to the criteria laid down in regulation no. later, the applicants also submitted report no. 169/13 dated 5 november 2013 by another sworn expert, b, according to which the general value of monthly rent for a plot in the stated area belonging to the applicant mr leščinský was eur 0.773 in 2013, eur 0.782 in 2012, eur 0.789 in 2011 and eur 0.752 in 2010. 492/2004, taking into account the gsi resulting from the amendments introduced by regulation no. the government for their part submitted the following documents:
‒ a letter from the forensic engineering institute in žilina dated 17 december 2012, in which the institute pointed out what they considered to be methodological flaws in the calculations of expert a. on the basis of their pro forma recalculation of the available data, the value of the annual general rent would be eur 0.239 per square metre. ‒ a letter from the slovak real estate fund dated 24 april 2013 stating that, at that time, expert valuations of the general value of the land had been obtained for fourteen allotment colonies in the district of žilina. on the basis of the general value of the land as established in these valuations, which took into account legislative amendment no. 57/2011, the government contended that the average general value of the annual rent payable for land comparable to the applicants’ was eur 0.38. ‒ a full expert report drawn up by the institute in 2014, numbered 86/2014, which had been preceded by the institute’s own investigations. in this report, drawn up on the basis of amended regulation no. 492/2004, the institute calculated the general value of the annual rent payable for the property in question as of 31 march 2014 as eur 0.718 per square metre. 492/2004 could not be used in relation to the preceding periods.
the applicants were born in 1980 and 1964, respectively, and live in hajdukovo. on 12 february 2007 the applicants and their friend s.k. were indicted for allegedly having stolen a wine press (presu za grožđe). on 25 january 2008 the subotica municipal court acquitted all three defendants of these charges. in so doing, it explained that while there was evidence that they had been in possession of a press, there was nothing to suggest that they had obtained it through any criminal activity. the applicants themselves maintained that they had found the press abandoned, while s.k. denied the charge and thereafter exercised his right to remain silent. no material evidence was introduced during the trial and, apart from the statement by the alleged victim ‒ who maintained that the press worked and had been kept in a locked yard ‒ the statements of two witnesses supported the applicants’ defence. on 8 april 2008 the prosecution lodged an appeal against this judgment, emphasising, in particular, that the first-instance court had failed to take into account a statement given to the police by s.k. on 26 january 2006 (albeit in the absence of the applicants and their counsel, who had not been invited to attend). on 12 may 2008 the subotica district court quashed the impugned judgment and ordered a retrial. the court explained that the statement referred to by the prosecution was particularly important because on this occasion s.k. had confessed ‒ in the presence of his counsel ‒ that he had stolen the press together with the applicants. had subsequently revoked this confession claiming that it had been given under the influence of alcohol and then refused to answer any further questions, and all of these circumstances needed to be reconsidered by the municipal court, even though the prosecution itself had initially failed to request that s.k. ’s statement of 26 january 2006 be admitted as evidence. the court found this failure by the municipal court to be “unclear and inexplicable”. died and on 29 december 2008 the municipal court discontinued the proceedings against him. on 19 february 2009 the municipal court, having held a hearing and read out s.k. ’s statement of 26 january 2006 before the parties, found the applicants guilty. the first applicant was sentenced to an effective prison term of six months while the second applicant was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, suspended for a period of two years. in its reasoning the court primarily relied on s.k. no evidence different from that admitted during the first trial was introduced during the retrial. on 29 july 2009 the district court upheld this judgment on appeal, and on 7 october 2010 the supreme court rejected the applicants’ further appeal on points of law (zahtev za ispitivanje zakonitosti pravosnažne presude). in the meantime, on 11 september 2009, the applicants lodged a constitutional appeal with the constitutional court, alleging that their conviction had been based on the testimony of a person whom they had never had a chance to cross-examine and who had, in any event, revoked it subsequently. on 14 october 2010 the constitutional court rejected the applicants’ appeal as manifestly ill-founded, adding that ‒ as a consequence of the death of s.k. ‒ the lower courts had had no choice but to accept his prior statement given to the police and, clearly, could no longer accommodate the applicants’ objection regarding his cross-examination.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in zagreb. on 16 november 2009 the municipal court held a hearing, which the applicant attended. at the end of the hearing, the court scheduled the next one for 17 december 2009. on 31 december 2009 the applicant, on behalf of the plaintiff, lodged an appeal against that decision. he explained that suspending proceedings was an instrument for maintaining procedural discipline, the effect of which was to delay proceedings and thereby penalise the parties for their inaction. yet, in his case, he and his client had been penalised by a delay even though it was through no fault of his own that he had failed to attend the hearing. the parties’ representatives and the defendant attended the hearing held on 16 november 2009. such conduct from the judge is absolutely unacceptable. ...
the contested decision should therefore be quashed.” t]hat statement is certainly offensive to the court and the judge [concerned], and as such constitutes unacceptable communication between the court and the advocate representing one of the parties. by making that offensive statement, the advocate in question implies that the judge hearing the case proceeds pointlessly, and most likely proceeds pointlessly with all other cases, which represents a serious insult to both the court and the judge. for that insult, the court fined the advocate hrk 1,500. the applicant appealed against that decision, arguing that his statement had not been offensive or demeaning. in particular, in his appeal, the applicant wrote, inter alia, the following:
“the operative provisions [of the contested decision] indicate that the fine was imposed for offending the court in the appeal of 31 december 2009 by stating, ‘such conduct from the judge is absolutely unacceptable. in behaving in this way, he seeks to give the impression that he is proceeding with the case [i.e. that the case is being dealt with], whereas, essentially, hearings are being held which are devoid of substance’. i consider the contested decision to be without basis. the quoted statement does not represent an insult. [ rather,] it is an assessment of how usefully the proceedings in the present case were conducted. the statements quoted in the contested decision ... cannot in themselves, and especially having regard to the behaviour of the judge hearing the case, [be regarded as] disrespectful, which would justify the need to issue a decision on the fine. ...
in addition to the plaintiff’s representative, the defendant and [her] representative attended the hearing scheduled for 16 november 2009. beside this, nothing else happened at that hearing. ...
apart from acknowledging the facts as stated above, the judge hearing the case did not carry out any action intended to bring the proceedings to an end, except for scheduling the next hearing. at that hearing, he did not even oblige the defendant to provide evidence for the claims expressed in [her] response. ...
in the circumstances, it is evident that the hearing scheduled for 17 december 2009 would have been identical ... to the previous hearing. ...
given that the purpose of a hearing is concentrated deliberation, that purpose is frustrated when such concentrated deliberation is lacking. ...
no intention to offend was expressed in the submissions in question [that is, the appeal of 31 december 2009]. the quoted statement represents a view assessing how usefully the proceedings were being conducted. on 17 august 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the decisions of the ordinary courts. by a decision of 27 january 2011 the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible on the grounds that the contested decision was not open to constitutional review. that decision was served on the applicant on 11 february 2011.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in sebedražie. land in this area has been subject to land consolidation proceedings under the land consolidation act (law no. this land partly neighbours a road and is partly separated from that road by another plot belonging to the applicant. the title of the applicant’s father to this land was later transferred to the applicant. the interim arrangements provided that those concerned were entitled to make use of the existing road network. on 20 april 2001 a person to whom land neighbouring the applicant’s had been assigned lodged a civil action against the applicant. the exact formulation of the relief sought evolved in the course of the proceedings; the action ultimately sought to obtain an injunction ordering the applicant to (i) remove the fence, gate, vegetation and anything else obstructing passage over the property in question; (ii) re-establish the original track; and (iii) allow and not hinder the claimants’ passage by that track. on the merits, the action was examined twice by both the district court as the first-instance court and the regional court as the court of appeal. the courts’ reasoning may be summarised as follows. the latter finding was primarily based on a written representation made by the land authority, evidence from three witnesses, and written statements from four other persons. if the ownership of any plot of land in that area were to be transferred to another person, then any attendant “quasi-easements” would encumber the new owner. the applicant should have known this when he acquired the title to the land from his father. accordingly, the applicant was to enable and not to obstruct passage across the land. upon the expiry of the grace period accorded to the applicant for compliance with the judgment on the merits, the respective ruling became enforceable on 10 april 2010. this ruling became enforceable on 13 march 2010. in part, it was to be paid from the advance previously paid by the claimant (some 230 euros (eur)); the rest (some eur 480) was paid from the budget of the court. the applicant appealed, submitting that the expert’s report had been belated and flawed by errors. it should therefore have been disregarded and the expert should be paid either no or reduced remuneration. on 27 january 2010 the regional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of 24 october 2008. the applicant appealed against this order. no further appeal against the ruling of 16 april 2010 was available. after that ruling was served on the parties, the costs order against the applicant became final and binding on 31 may 2010. the decisions of 24 october 2008 and 4 february 2010 were issued with reference to the same file number of the district court as in the proceedings on the merits. despite being ordered to remove vegetation from the track in question, he has yet to do so. on 3 may 2010 the applicant lodged a complaint under article 127 of the constitution with the constitutional court. in that regard, he argued that there had been a restriction of his ownership rights and that that restriction had been neither lawful nor necessary, had not been in the public interest, and had been subject to no compensation. in the constitutional court’s decision, those observations were reflected as follows:
the president of the district court observed that the claimant and others involved had long been using the disputed track and that the state of affairs had been accepted by the applicant and his father until the applicant had arbitrarily barred the track in 2000, apparently guided by the mistaken belief that his title to the property concerned was absolute. the applicant’s assertions had been properly examined, the court had heard extensive evidence, and the complaint about the length of the proceedings had been belated. on 14 april 2011 the constitutional court declared the complaint inadmissible. on 16 july 2010 the applicant lodged a fresh constitutional complaint against the district court and the regional court, challenging the costs order against him (4 february and 16 april 2010), and alleging a violation of article 6 § 1 of the convention on the grounds that the courts had disregarded his arguments and had decided arbitrarily.
the applicant was born in 1973 and lives in bibice. on 16 january 2009 the applicant lodged a divorce petition with the kraków regional court (sąd okręgowy) together with an application for an interim contact order. his new partner, to collect n. from the nursery, which was a source of great conflict between the parents. it decided that the applicant was allowed to see his daughter every second weekend between 3 p.m. on friday and 5 p.m. on sunday, and also between 3 p.m. on tuesday and 3 p.m. on wednesday. in addition, he could spend every second christmas eve, every christmas day and every easter sunday with her. on 17 may 2011 e. asked the court to restrict contact between the applicant and n. owing to the child’s fragile emotional condition. that application was dismissed on 29 march 2011. on 20 may 2011 the psychologist treating n. suggested a change in the contact order so that n. would not have to stay overnight at the applicant’s house, as that was apparently causing her a lot of stress. contact meetings had resumed in may 2010 and had continued regularly until november 2010. the mother had been of the opinion that the applicant had wanted the contact meetings to take place regardless of the child’s needs and her after-school activities (ice skating practice). the applicant saw his daughter on her birthday and on a few occasions after school. on 11 january 2012 a hearing took place during which the applicant and e. agreed on access arrangements. on 31 july 2012 the kraków court of appeal upheld the first-instance judgment. on 14 and 20 december 2010 and on 17 january 2011 the applicant complained to the court that the mother had refused to comply with the access arrangements. however, e. failed to appear on that date (she was on leave to take care of her sick child). the applicant lodged numerous further applications for the court to impose fines on e. in particular, he lodged two applications on 1 june 2011, two on 7 june 2011, four on 24 june 2011, three on 25 july 2011, three on 8 august 2011 and one on 23 august 2011. at a further hearing held on 28 october 2011, with reference to the applicant’s motion of 7 march 2011, the kraków-krowodrza district court ordered the mother to comply with the interim contact order within two weeks on pain of a fine of 1,000 polish zlotys (pln). on 3 september 2012 the proceedings were further severed and the part concerning the applicant’s application of 23 august 2011 was assigned a new case number. in the guardian’s opinion, the father was ready and able to take care of his daughter and organise interesting activities for their meetings. however, when questioned by the guardian, n. had been unenthusiastic about seeing her father and had said only negative things about him. on the two later occasions, the guardian tried to mediate between the parents and talk to the child in order to make her change her mind, but the child refused to go with the father. on 23 august 2012 the kraków-nowa huta district court dismissed the applicant’s application because the interim contact order was no longer in force. the kraków regional court held that the district court had focused on the application to fine e. and had failed to consider the applicant’s other requests. she submitted that n. did not want to stay overnight at the applicant’s house. on 3 december 2012 a psychologist submitted his opinion to the court. the expert stated that the weakening of the emotional bond between the applicant and n. had been caused by a series of events. at a hearing held on 10 december 2012, the applicant informed the court that the day before, when he had arrived to see his daughter, she had not wanted to go with him. the father was determined to have a place in her life and play an important role. contact meetings should take place on neutral ground in the presence of a neutral person. on 24 april 2013 the kraków district court issued a contact order.
mr tadeucci (“the first applicant”) was born in 1965. mr mccall (“the second applicant”) was born in 1958. the applicants have formed a same-sex couple since 1999. they lived in new zealand, with the status of unmarried couple, until december 2003, when they decided to settle in italy on grounds of the first applicant’s poor health. during their first period of residence in italy the second applicant had a student’s temporary residence permit. he subsequently applied for a residence permit for family reasons, under legislative decree no. on 18 october 2004 the chief of the livorno police rejected his application on the ground that the statutory criteria were not satisfied. on 27 january 2005 the applicants appealed on the basis of legislative decree no. 286 of 1998, requesting that the second applicant be issued with a residence permit for family reasons. in a judgment of 4 july 2005 the florence civil court allowed the applicants’ appeal. the court observed that the applicants were recognised as a couple in new zealand, the first applicant having been issued with a residence permit in that country for family reasons in his capacity as an unmarried partner. in the court’s view, article 30 of legislative decree no. the court found that the right asserted by the second applicant also derived from articles 3 and 10 of directive 2004/38/ec of 29 may 2004 of the european parliament and of the council ..., which recognised the right of the partner of a citizen of the european union (eu) to obtain a residence permit where the existence of a durable relationship was duly attested. the minister of foreign affairs appealed against the judgment of the florence civil court. in a judgment of 12 may 2006 the florence court of appeal allowed the appeal. it observed that the new zealand authorities had recognised that the applicants had the status of “unmarried cohabiting partners” and not that of “members of the same family”. 286 of 1998, according to which the “cohabiting partner” was regarded as a “member of the family”, was not compatible with the italian legal system, which, according to the court, ascribed a different scope and meaning to those two legal concepts. secondly, the court of appeal pointed out that the constitutional court had repeatedly held that a relationship based on cohabitation alone, and lacking stability and legal certainty, could not in any circumstances be regarded as a legitimate family based on marriage. the applicants appealed on points of law. in a judgment of 30 september 2008, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 17 march 2009, the court of cassation dismissed the applicants’ appeal. the court of cassation observed first that, according to the terms of article 29 of legislative decree no. 286 of 1998 ..., the concept of “family member” extended only to spouses, minor children, adult children who were not self-supporting for health reasons, and dependent relatives who lacked adequate support in their country of origin. the court of cassation also considered that articles 8 and 12 of the convention did not require such an interpretation either. in its view, those provisions left a wide margin of appreciation to the states regarding the choice of means of exercising the rights they guaranteed, particularly in the area of immigration control. it observed in that connection that the non-eligibility of unmarried partners for a residence permit for family reasons applied to opposite-sex couples as well as same-sex partners. after being notified of the court of cassation’s judgment, the applicants left italy in july 2009. they moved to the netherlands, where the second applicant was issued with a five-year residence permit on 25 august 2009 as a de facto partner in a long-term relationship with an eu national. on 8 may 2010 the applicants married in amsterdam. they added that the marriage contracted in the netherlands did not allow them to live together in italy. on 22 august 2014 the second applicant obtained a second five-year residence permit in the netherlands, valid until 22 august 2019.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in mingachevir. the applicant worked as the executive director at the “mingachevir technical rubber” joint stock company, which was an enterprise under the control of the department for privatization and management of state property (“the dpmsp”) of the ministry of the economic development. on 15 march 2005 the applicant was dismissed from his job by an order of the dpmsp of the ministry of the economic development. the applicant lodged an action against the dpmsp, seeking reinstatement in his previous job and payment of his unpaid salaries. on 25 august 2005 the sabayil district court granted the applicant’s claim, ordering his reinstatement in his previous job. the court also ordered the dpmsp to pay the applicant his unpaid salary for the period from 15 march 2005 (date of dismissal) until the date of his reinstatement, without specifying the due amount. on 25 november 2005 the court of appeal upheld the judgment of 25 august 2005, dismissing the dpmsp’s appeal. the judgment became enforceable immediately after its delivery. on 13 december 2005 a writ of execution was issued and sent to the dpmsp. on 12 april 2006 the supreme court upheld the court of appeal’s judgment and dismissed the cassation appeal lodged by the state committee for management of state property (“the scmsp”), which was the legal successor of the former dpmsp. it appears from the documents in the case file that in spite of the issuance of the writ of execution and numerous letters of the enforcement officers requesting the execution of the judgment, the scmsp took no action to comply with the judgment in question. following the scmsp’s continuous failure to comply with the judgment, on 14 july 2006 the sabayil district court decided to refer the case to the sabayil district prosecutor’s office for institution of criminal proceedings against the scmsp’s responsible official for non-execution of an enforceable judgment. however, it transpires from the case file that on an unspecified date the prosecuting authorities returned the case to the enforcement officers without taking any formal decision as regards the institution of criminal proceedings. at the time of the latest communication with the parties in june 2011, the judgment delivered in the applicant’s favour remained unenforced.
the applicant was born in 1939 and lives in dnipro. he was formerly a shareholder in two private companies, o. and l., which were liquidated on the basis of decisions by other shareholders. accordingly, the local authorities struck the companies out of the list of legal entities. the applicant instituted several sets of court proceedings in that regard. on 21 april 2003 the applicant instituted proceedings in the zhovtnevyy district court of dnipro (“the district court”) against the local council and three private persons, challenging the company’s liquidation, claiming back his shares and seeking compensation. the applicant made changes to his claims on a number of occasions. in the course of the proceedings, about twenty of the approximately fifty hearings were adjourned at the request of one or more of the parties, or owing to their failure to appear. between july 2005 and february 2007 no hearings were held pending the outcome of appeals in cassation against a procedural decision by one or other of the defendant parties. between may 2007 and july 2008 courts at three levels of jurisdiction examined the question of whether the case should be considered within the framework of civil or commercial proceedings. eventually, it was decided that the case should be examined under the rules of civil procedure and examination on the merits resumed in august 2008. overall, the proceedings lasted for over seven years and eight months, the final decision being taken by the supreme court on 29 december 2010. that court upheld decisions of the district court of 30 june 2010 and of the dnipro regional court of appeal (“the court of appeal”) of 16 september 2010 rejecting the applicant’s claims as unsubstantiated. the courts found that there had been no violation of the applicant’s rights as a shareholder of o. 10. in january 2005 the applicant brought a civil claim with the district court against the local council and a number of private persons, challenging the liquidation of company l. and the authorities’ decisions in that regard. he also sought the restoration of the company as a legal entity, recovery of his shareholding and an order to declare the minutes of the shareholders’ general assembly invalid. on 2 june 2006, the court decided, in the applicant’s presence, to leave his claim without examination, finding that it concerned essentially the same issue as one which it had examined in proceedings concerning the applicant’s administrative claim (see paragraph 15 and 16 below). on 7 june 2006 the applicant lodged a statement of intent with the court of appeal to appeal against the decision of 2 june 2006. on 16 june 2006 he lodged an appeal, stating, inter alia, that that decision had been incorrect, as his administrative claim had concerned only a part of the issues raised in the civil claim. on 25 july 2006 the court of appeal left the applicant’s appeal without examination, finding that the statement of intent to appeal had been lodged outside the five-day time-limit envisaged by article 294 § 2 of the code of civil procedure of 2004 (see paragraph 20 below). according to the appeal decision, the time-limit in question had started to run from the date of the pronouncement of the contested decision. on 9 october 2006 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal in cassation, finding no fault on the part of the lower courts. in november 2005 the applicant brought an administrative claim in the district court against the head of the local council, seeking the annulment of the decision striking l. out of the list of legal entities. on 17 april 2006 the court, having examined the case pursuant to the code of administrative justice of 2005, rejected the applicant’s claim as unsubstantiated, finding that the contested decision had been lawful. the court further noted that the applicant had made allegations of the unlawfulness of the shareholders’ decision to liquidate the company, which could not be examined in the framework of administrative proceedings. it also noted that the applicant’s claim had been brought out of time, though it did not consider it necessary to reject it on that ground. on 20 september 2006 the court of appeal upheld the decision of 17 april 2006. on 28 october 2008 the higher administrative court quashed the decisions of the lower courts and terminated the proceedings. it found that the claim should not have been examined within the framework of administrative proceedings, as it essentially concerned a property dispute. the higher administrative court noted that the applicant’s claim could be heard under the code of civil procedure of 2004.
the applicants’ dates of birth and places of residence are given in the appendix. at the material time many of them were members of opposition political parties or groups. demonstrations were planned to be held on 20 october and 17 november 2012 in baku. the bcea also refused to authorise the demonstration of 17 november 2012. the bcea further noted that the square where the organisers proposed to hold the assembly was a designated public leisure area and that the assembly itself would be impractical. the organisers nevertheless decided to hold the demonstrations as planned. according to the applicants, the demonstrations were intended to be peaceful and were conducted in a peaceful manner. all applicants were arrested during the dispersal operations and were taken to various police stations. according to most of the applicants, they were arrested by people in plain clothes. the applicants were questioned at the respective police stations. some of the applicants refused to sign the administrative offence reports. according to the applicants, they were never served with copies of the administrative offence reports or with other documents from their case files. they were not given access to a lawyer after their arrest or while they were in police custody. according to most of them, the hearing before the court in each case was very brief. members of the public were not allowed inside the courtroom, even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public. according to all applicants, they were not given an opportunity to appoint lawyers of their own choosing. state-funded lawyers were invited to represent most of them. 8204/13, 31201/13 and 51930/13 were not represented by a lawyer. 8204/13 and 51930/13 refused the assistance of a state-funded lawyer and decided to defend themselves in person. according to the transcripts of the hearings, in their oral submissions the state-funded lawyers stated in general terms that the applicants were not guilty or briefly asked the respective courts to adopt a fair decision. with respect to the applicants in application nos. 8468/13, 17569/13 and 45211/13 the state-funded lawyers did not make any oral or written submissions. 8204/13, 8468/13, 14226/13, 17569/13, 31201/13, 45211/13 and 51930/13 the respective courts did not question any witnesses. with respect to the applicant in application no. 17575/13, the first-instance court stated in general terms that he had deliberately failed to comply with a lawful order of the police. 8468/13 was additionally convicted under article 298 of the cao. on various dates the applicants lodged appeals with the baku court of appeal, arguing that their convictions were in violation of their rights because the demonstrations in which they had participated or attempted to participate had been peaceful. they asked the baku court of appeal to quash the first-instance courts’ decisions in their respective cases. the applicants were represented before the baku court of appeal by lawyers of their own choosing. on various dates the baku court of appeal dismissed the applicants’ appeals and upheld the decisions of the respective first-instance courts (see appendix).
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in riga. on 18 february 2008, in the course of a first set of criminal proceedings against the applicant for fraud in relation to means of payment, the riga regional court decided to relieve him of criminal liability, and imposed on him a compulsory measure: outpatient medical treatment. on 7 may 2009 the applicant signed an information sheet – drawn up and certified by the riga psychiatric hospital (vsia “rīgas psihiatrijas un narkoloģijas centrs”, hereafter “the psychiatric hospital”) – regarding the rights and obligations of people receiving compulsory outpatient medical treatment. among other things, this information sheet stated that a patient had to visit a doctor once a month and attend a panel meeting of doctors every six months, on the date indicated by the relevant doctor. it also stated that if a patient missed more than three doctor’s appointments in a row, that patient would be reported to the police so that he could be taken to the doctor. the necessity of continuing the applicant’s compulsory treatment was reviewed on several occasions, and on 8 april 2013 the vidzeme district court, having examined the medical panel’s conclusion of 25 february 2013 in relation to his state of health, decided to continue the treatment. the applicant was summoned, but did not attend the hearing, and on 10 april 2013 the decision was sent to him. on 21 april and 24 june 2013 the applicant sent letters to the vidzeme district court, asking it to revoke the compulsory measure. on 2 july 2013 the court informed him that, following his requests, it had asked the medical experts concerned to report on his medical condition. on 28 may 2012 the riga regional court decided to continue the applicant’s outpatient medical treatment. it relied on a medical report filed on 28 march 2012, which, among other things, noted that he was regularly attending appointments with a doctor, was not showing stable improvement, did not accept that he had health issues and had no remorse regarding the offence he had committed. the applicant was represented by a state‑appointed defence lawyer, and on 10 april 2013 the decision was sent to the applicant. according to the information the riga psychiatric hospital submitted to the government, since 2005 the applicant had been admitted to the psychiatric hospital for inpatient treatment on eight occasions, including on an emergency basis. since 2010 he had visited doctors every two to three months. in 2013 he had voluntarily visited his doctor on 24 january and 15 april, and had missed an appointment on 24 april. observing that the applicant had not attended a doctor’s appointment, and considering that a longer period without treatment could cause his health to deteriorate, on 10 june 2013 the head of unit at the psychiatric hospital asked the police to bring the applicant to the outpatient section of the hospital, relying on section 11 of the law on police. that request referred to the court’s decision of 18 february 2008 in the first set of criminal proceedings. on 17 june 2013 several police officers arrived at the applicant’s home and took him to the outpatient section of the riga psychiatric hospital. according to information submitted by the riga psychiatric hospital, on 17 june 2013, in the outpatient section of the riga psychiatric hospital the applicant declared that he would only visit a doctor if given a written summons. in line with a doctor’s decision, the applicant was put under observation as an inpatient (novērošana stacionārā). the applicant, accompanied by police officers, was taken to the inpatient section of the hospital, where he displayed dissatisfaction and anger and refused to admit himself to hospital voluntarily. on the same day he was involuntarily admitted for inpatient treatment, as provided for by section 68(1) of the medical treatment law (see paragraph 25 below), where he received medication and on 18 june 2013 asked a doctor to be released. he was informed that he would be examined by a medical commission, as provided for by section 68(3) of the medical treatment law (see paragraph 26 below). on 19 june 2013 the medical commission drew up a report, which stated that the applicant did not display any psychotic symptoms, therefore there was no need for inpatient treatment. in the afternoon he was discharged from hospital. having examined the above report, on 20 august 2013 the riga regional court and, at a later date the vidzeme district court, revoked the compulsory outpatient treatment measures which had been imposed on the applicant in both sets of criminal proceedings. on 19 july 2013 the internal security office of the state police (valsts policijas iekšējās drošības birojs) dismissed a complaint by the applicant that police officers had taken him to the psychiatric hospital unlawfully. in its decision, it stated that the police officers in question had acted in accordance with section 11 of the law on police following the request received from the psychiatric hospital. the applicant appealed that decision to the office of the prosecutor general, which on 16 august 2013 upheld it, stating that on 28 may 2012 the riga regional court had decided to continue the applicant’s compulsory medical treatment. as the applicant had failed to comply with the measure, representatives of the psychiatric hospital had had grounds to ask for police assistance in executing it.
the applicant was born in 1953 and lives in kassel. he is a lawyer and was appointed insolvency administrator of the german limited partnership m.k. on 12 july 2002 the applicant, in his position of insolvency administrator of the company, took legal action against ms b., a former limited partner (kommanditist) of the kg, to seek the reimbursement of close to 56,000 euros (eur), which had been paid to her as advance payment on profits (vorauszahlungen auf gewinne) by the kg. the applicant declared that he had refrained from introducing an action concerning these claims at that point in time because of the costs involved. ms b. was notified of the legal action on 17 july 2002. the statutory time‑limit for those latter claims was 31 december 2004. this request for legal aid was placed in the case file. it was neither examined by a judge nor was notice given to ms b. 10. on 29 august 2005, he sent another letter, to which he received no response. the applicant claimed that, in addition, he had also made telephone calls to the regional court on 10 june 2005 and on 14 november 2005 to find out whether he had been granted legal aid and that, both times, he had been informed by the registry that the file was at the judge’s office and that, therefore, no information could be given. on 11 may 2007 the regional court granted the applicant’s request for legal aid, following another written inquiry of that same day. the decision to grant legal aid was served on ms b. on 16 may 2007. on 20 july 2007 the applicant introduced the additional action concerning the said claims. that court likewise dismissed the applicant’s additional action for reimbursement of approximately eur 1.7 million in its entirety, finding that the claims were time-barred. it considered that the exception foreseen by domestic law allowing for the retroactive effect of arranging for notice to be given was not applicable in the instant case. it found that the applicant – who, as a lawyer, must have known that arranging for notice to be given to the defendant of his request for legal aid “shortly after” its submission was required to prevent his claim from becoming time‑barred – had in a reproachable manner contributed to the delay and thus not acted with the necessary diligence required. the regional court observed that the applicant had not asked the regional court to notify immediately the defendant of his request for legal aid, irrespective of its prospects of success, which he could have done without additional costs and without suffering any procedural disadvantages. also, rather than enquiring whether the notification of the request had been arranged, the applicant limited himself to enquiring whether his request for legal aid had been successful. the regional court added that, in any event, the claim concerning the reimbursement of approximately eur 1.7 million was ill-founded and thoroughly reasoned this finding. on an unspecified date the applicant requested legal aid in order to lodge an appeal. on 22 june 2009 the frankfurt/main court of appeal dismissed his request, finding that the appeal lacked prospects of success as the regional court had rightly considered the applicant’s claims to be time-barred. it observed that the regional court had arranged for notice to be given to ms b. of the applicant’s request for legal aid at the earliest in 2007 and argued that notice two and a half years after the request’s introduction could not be considered as having taken place “shortly after” that introduction. furthermore, there must not be legitimate interests of the defendant that conflicted with such retroactive effect (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 26 below). it confirmed the regional court’s finding that the applicant had not acted with the necessary diligence. the court of appeal likewise considered that the subsequent steps taken by the applicant were not sufficient, because he had not asked for the notification to be effected immediately. the court of appeal based its decision to refuse legal aid exclusively on the finding that the claims were time-barred. on 19 july 2010 the federal constitutional court, sitting as a formation of three judges, declined to accept the applicant’s constitutional complaint for adjudication (1 bvr 1873/09). it found that the period of processing the request for legal aid and the delay in arranging for notice to be given to the defendant constituted gross negligence (grob fehlerhaft) by the regional court. nonetheless, it considered that the decision of the court of appeal was in conformity with the case-law of the federal court of justice, according to which a notification could only be “shortly after” the submission of a request for legal aid if the applicant concerned acted with the necessary diligence to effect the immediate notification, and if there were no legitimate interests of the defendant that conflicted with such retroactive effect (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 26 below). referring to the case-law of the federal court of justice (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 28 below), it considered that a litigant with sufficient financial means must not limit himself to submitting a lawsuit, but rather had to remind the court to ask him to pay the necessary court fees or even to pay the fees on his own initiative, if the court had failed to ask him, in order to effect the service of the legal action.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in gdańsk. at the relevant time, the applicant was a member of the polish parliament and a member of the law and justice party. on 8 may 2006 the applicant and several other politicians, experts and journalists, participated in a live television programme, warto rozmawiać (“it’s good to talk”), shown on tvp2. the programme was also broadcast on tvp polonia on two consecutive days. out of modesty i will not mention that a horrible piece about me, full of lies, is on the first page. on the second page, a frenzied attack on kaczyński and the polish families league. but let’s go further, to page thirty-five. however, the applicant continued with his statement. it claimed that the applicant’s statements during the television programme on 8 may 2006 had harmed its good name and credibility and asked that the applicant be made to have an apology published in gazeta wyborcza and broadcast on tvp2 and to pay 25,000 polish zlotys (pln) to a charity. on 12 june 2007 the warsaw regional court granted the claim and ordered the applicant to issue an apology via gazeta wyborcza and tvp2 for the statements he had made. i confirm that those allegations caused negative consequences for agora s.a in conducting their business activities, in particular a loss of indispensable credibility and trust. the above statement is made as a consequence of losing a civil case. ” during the proceedings the applicant submitted that it had not been his intention to offend the plaintiff. the court further observed that an accusation that a newspaper had published articles ordered by a sponsor was clearly offensive to the publisher. likewise, it was offensive to the publisher to be associated with a company that allegedly conducted morally doubtful activities. had at the relevant time placed advertisements in several newspapers and magazines. however, the applicant had not alleged that those other newspapers or magazines had been involved in the alleged agreement (układ). moreover, as a rule, a publisher was not responsible for the content of advertisements. the court did not agree with the applicant that he had not wished to infringe the plaintiff’s rights. it noted that the applicant had prepared in advance to make the statement in question. the applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment. he argued, amongst other things, that the regional court had wrongly classified his statements as facts and not as value judgments. on 25 june 2008 the warsaw court of appeal upheld the first‑instance judgment and ordered the applicant to pay 270 pln (about eur 67) in court fees for the proceedings at second instance. the programme had concerned different issues and the statement had not been a response or reaction to the discussion between the participants. during the programme the applicant had kept a copy of gazeta wyborcza under his chair, which he had shown to the cameras at the relevant moment. the court considered that the statement in question, in so far as it had concerned relations between j&s s.a. ’s advertisement in a completely different, negative light. noting the case of feldek v. slovakia (no. 29032/95, echr 2001‑viii), it further reiterated that where a statement amounted to a value judgment, the proportionality of the interference may depend on whether there existed a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive. in the present case, the defendant had not even attempted to prove the accuracy of his statements about the alleged connections of which he had accused the plaintiff.
the applicant, mr rahmi şahin, was born in 1985 and lives in hakkari. the applicant refused to sign the arrest report. as a result, the fırat news agency published another article containing instructions for further serhildan acts and for demonstrations. the group had attacked the police with stones when the police had moved against the gathering. the officers stated that they had arrested the applicant after he had attempted to avoid arrest. the patient is conscious and co-operating. there is a slight swelling between the upper lip and the teeth (he stated/it was stated[1] that it was due to a fall). on 13 december 2009 the applicant was examined by the same doctor. on the same day, the hakkari magistrates’ court decided to restrict access to the investigation file concerning the applicant and two other people. on 15 december 2009 the hakkari magistrates’ court dismissed the request. meanwhile, on 14 december 2009 the applicant had made a statement to the hakkari public prosecutor. he denied any involvement in the demonstration. one of the officers had insulted him and taken him to a hill close to their neighbourhood. an officer had hit him on his right ear with a plastic tube. he stated that he still had pain in several parts of his body, particularly around the heart. after the questioning, the public prosecutor ordered a medical examination of the applicant. later that day, the applicant was brought before the hakkari magistrates’ court, where he pleaded innocent and asked to be released. on 16 december 2009 the applicant’s legal representative lodged an application with the hakkari magistrates’ court for his client’s release. he further requested the medical reports issued in respect of the applicant. his eyes and his mouth had been covered with blood as a result. finally, the lawyer requested that the public prosecutor take a statement from his client in person and communicate to him the date and the time for taking such a statement. secondly, he noted that the applicant had acted with a group of people who had chanted slogans in favour of the pkk and that he had been arrested after he had attempted to escape and had fallen. the public prosecutor noted in that respect that two police officers had identified the applicant. the public prosecutor observed that although the applicant had sustained minor injuries on his face and body, he had failed to substantiate his claims that he had been beaten and insulted by the police officers. he also noted that there was no evidence in the case file indicating any deficiency in the medical reports drafted by the doctors. on 31 march 2010 the applicant’s legal representative lodged an appeal against the decision of 17 march 2010. he noted, in particular, that the hakkari public prosecutor’s assessment had been based on incorrect facts such as the “minor nature” of the applicant’s injuries and his involvement in violent acts during the events of 12 december 2009. the government submitted two sets of photographs taken by the security forces with regard to the demonstrations and disturbances of 11 and 12 december 2009 in hakkari. the remaining photographs show people demonstrating in different parts of the city centre. in some photographs, the demonstrators are seen burning tyres and blocking streets.
the applicants were born in 1952, 1947, 1973 and 1980 respectively and live in bratislava. they are co-owners of a residential house located in the bratislava-staré mesto municipality. the house was built in 1929 by their familial predecessors, who during the previous regime donated it to the state under circumstances that would later be accepted as constituting duress. the ownership of the house was restored to the first and second applicants on 10 december 1991 under special legislation on restitution. consequently, each of them acquired a 4/12 share of the ownership of the house. the third and fourth applicants each acquired a 2/12 share of the ownership of the house on 25 january 1995 and 29 march 1999 respectively. at the time the applicants acquired the ownership of the house five flats were inhabited by tenants with regulated rent. under the relevant legislation this meant that (i) the applicants had to accept that their flats were occupied by these tenants, (ii) they could charge them no more than the maximum amount of rent fixed by the state, (iii) they could not unilaterally terminate the leases, and (iv) they could not sell the flats other than to the tenants (“the rent-control scheme”). the rent-control scheme applies, or has applied, to the flats in question, as follows: a four-room flat with a surface area of 129 sq. m which had been subject to rent control until january 2006 (“the first flat”); a four-room flat with a surface area of 130 sq. m which had been subject to rent control until september 2008 (“the second flat”); a two-room flat with a surface area of 87 sq. m and two four-room flats measuring 126 sq. m each (“the third, fourth and fifth flats”), to which rent control still applies. the monthly rent chargeable for the flats under the applicable legislation was equivalent to some 10 to 17.5 euros (eur) between 1992 and 1999. after several increases in the regulated rent, in june 2007 the applicants were able to charge some eur 73.5 monthly in respect of the two-room flat and approximately eur 125 monthly in respect of the four‑room flats. according to the government’s calculations the regulated rent reached eur 236 and eur 400 respectively in 2014. the parties provided differing figures as to the market rent. the applicants relied on data from the national association of real estate agencies (“the narea”) and claimed that the monthly market rent for comparable two‑room flats in the area reached around eur 662 and for comparable four‑room flats some eur 1,296 between 2004 and 2007. the government submitted an expert valuation according to which the monthly market rent for the applicants’ flats in 2010 amounted to eur 561 and eur 772 to eur 797 respectively.
the applicant was born in 1959 and is currently detained in chișinău. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. on 23 december 2013 the applicant was arrested and charged with embezzlement and organising the attempted murder of two businessmen. since that date he has been detained in prison no. according to the applicant, he has been detained in a cell measuring 6 square metres with five other inmates, which left very little space for each detainee. due to overcrowding, detainees had to share beds. he was not provided with bedding or a pillow. there was no sink or running water in the cell. the food was of poor quality and inedible. the squat toilet was not separated from the rest of the cell and gave off a foul odour. there was also a lack of daylight and poor ventilation. the applicant asserted that he had been detained with inmates diagnosed with tuberculosis, hiv/aids and other infectious diseases. as a result of being held in inhuman conditions of detention, he had been ill with mycosis, gastritis and a respiratory infection. he was not provided with any medical assistance and was forbidden from receiving herbal medicine from his wife. the applicant complained of inhuman conditions of detention to the chișinău prosecutor’s office and court of appeal. on 14 april 2014 the prisons department replied that after examining his allegations, it had not found any violation of domestic law. the government submitted that the applicant’s cell (no. 130) measured 10 square metres and was designed to accommodate four people. the cell was equipped with a sink and running water. the applicant was provided with bedding, hygiene products tailored to his needs and hot food three times a day, in accordance with government decision no. 609 concerning the minimum daily food requirements for detainees. the government contended that the cell in question had not accommodated people with infectious diseases. they added that the applicant had been provided with medical assistance and submitted evidence of various medical check-ups. the court refers to the relevant material cited in its previous case‑law concerning the republic of moldova (see, for instance, shishanov v. the republic of moldova, no. in its reports for 2013, 2014 and 2015 on conditions of detention following several visits undertaken in chișinău prison no. 13, the centre for human rights in moldova (“the human rights centre”, which also acts as the moldovan ombudsman) found serious problems, notably concerning overcrowding, food quality, ventilation and access to daylight. in view of its findings, it recommended in its reports for 2014 and 2015 that prison no. 13 be closed or if that was not possible, that the conditions of detention there be urgently improved.
the applicant was born in 1947 and lives in comrat, republic of moldova. those intermediary companies also had ties with his sons. later, when his company was faced with a court claim from the intermediary companies amounting to 594,067 united states dollars plus penalties, he had acknowledged that debt in court proceedings. he submitted that all national gas importers used the same method of importing gas and that the price of the gas purchased by his company was lower than that on the free national market. he also denied that his sons were in any way involved in the intermediary companies. the applicant was summoned on several occasions and in each case appeared before the investigating authorities and cooperated with them. in october 2006 the applicant’s house was searched, his personal computer was seized and various documents were extracted from it. the applicant objected and argued that there was no reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence. in particular, he submitted that the criminal proceedings against him were nothing but a means of influencing the outcome of pending civil proceedings concerning the debt owned by the state-owned company and the intermediary companies. he had a permanent residence, had been cooperating with the investigation since july 2006 and had never attempted to abscond or hinder the investigation. moreover, he relied on his age and on his poor state of health, submitting that he had suffered a heart attack and a stroke. he reiterated his previous statement to the effect that the criminal proceedings pursued the ulterior motive of influencing the outcome of pending civil proceedings between the company at which he worked and a third company. he further argued that the ground relied upon by the court to order his detention on remand, namely the risk of his colluding with his sons, had not been invoked by the prosecutor. the applicant also relied on his serious medical condition and submitted that he was a well-known individual with a family, a residence and a job in moldova, who had appeared before the investigating authorities whenever he had been summoned during the period from july 2006 to may 2007. on 11 may 2007 the prosecutor in charge of the case applied to the court for the prolongation of the applicant’s detention on remand by thirty days. he also emphasised that he had cooperated irreproachably with the investigation before his arrest and that he had a permanent residence. he therefore asked the court to order the replacement of the measure of detention with another less severe measure. after recapitulating the parties’ positions and citing the applicable provisions of the law, the court found that:
“... the grounds relied on when applying the preventive measure [of detention] remain valid, the majority of the investigative actions have been carried out, but a number of additional measures requiring [the applicant’s] participation are still necessary in order to send the case to the trial court. the applicant appealed, relying on essentially the same arguments as he had done previously. on 22 may 2007 the chişinău court of appeal upheld the decision of 16 may 2007. the applicant objected and asked the court to replace the measure of detention with another measure. the court also noted that the applicant was accused of a particularly serious offence punishable by imprisonment from ten to twenty-five years and that the investigation was still ongoing. the doctor recommended treatment in a neurological clinic. on 26 june 2007 the buiucani district court rejected the prosecutor’s application and accepted the applicant’s request, ordering that he be placed under house arrest for thirty days. the applicant was immediately taken home, where he remained for three days. on 29 june 2007 the chişinău court of appeal quashed the decision of 26 june 2007 and adopted a new one, ordering the applicant’s detention pending trial for twenty days. on 14 september 2007 the comrat district court examined the prosecutor’s application to prolong the applicant’s house arrest by ninety days. the only reason given by the court was the seriousness of the offence imputed to the applicant. on 12 march 2008 the comrat district court decided to release the applicant on bail, observing that he had been detained for over ten months and had never breached any of the restrictions imposed on him. neither the applicant nor the prosecutor appealed against that judgment, which became final.
the applicant was born in 1966 and has been in the netherlands since 2003. on 20 august 2003, he was interviewed about his identity, nationality and travel itinerary (eerste gehoor). on 21 august 2003 the applicant was interviewed about his reasons for seeking asylum (nader gehoor). the applicant stated that he had joined the youth branch of the pdpa in 1978 and that in 1981 he had served as a volunteer for twenty days in the revolutionary guard. he had been discharged after he had stepped on a mine during combat. the day after it had been broadcast, the applicant had been arrested by the mujahideen faction ittehad-al-islami (islamic union) then led by abdul rasul sayyaf. in return, the applicant had had to work for hezb-e wahdat. his tasks had included trading prisoners and seized goods, and mediating between parties. one of the persons taken in custody, mr s., had been interrogated by the applicant himself, who had ill-treated mr s. during interrogation. he had been released in a prisoner exchange organised by hezb-e wahdat. the applicant had stayed behind in kabul and had not been persecuted by “khalili” (see paragraph 39 below). the applicant had been tortured several times during his incarceration. mr s. had been present on one of those occasions. this guard had told the applicant that he should leave afghanistan forever. after his escape, the applicant had first hidden in his house in kabul for about 15 days and had subsequently stayed with a distant relative until he had left afghanistan for pakistan in may 2002. on 18 september 2003, the minister for immigration and integration (minister voor vreemdelingenzaken en integratie) informed the applicant that his case had been transmitted to the 1f unit (see a.a.q. during this interview, he declared, inter alia, that in 1981, as a member of the revolutionary guard, he had participated in a purge action – ordered by the pdpa central committee and the ministry of defence – aimed against persons active on behalf of hezb-e islami and jamiat in a specific area and that prisoners of war had been handed over to the former afghan communist security service, khad/wad (khadimat-e atal’at-e dowlati/wezarat-e amniyat-e dowlati). he had become disabled when the tank on which he had been standing had hit a mine. it was correct that hezb-e wahdat had committed many crimes and had shed much blood. he also stated that, at present, he had no proof that he was being searched for but that it was clear to him, having been released upon payment of a bribe, that he could not show himself in afghanistan. in her notice of intention, the minister analysed, on the basis of elaborate argumentation based on various international materials and on the prescribed and so-called “knowing and personal participation” test, the nature of the acts imputed to the applicant in the framework of article 1f of the 1951 refugee convention, as well as his individual responsibility under that convention. the minister further did not believe that the applicant had been ignorant of the criminal character of hezb-e wahdat when he had started to work for it as this had been widely known at the material time. on 17 june 2005 the applicant submitted written comments (zienswijze) on the minister’s intended decision. the applicant’s appeal against this decision was rejected on 25 january 2007 by the regional court (rechtbank) of the hague, sitting in roermond. consequently, the ruling of 25 january 2007 became final when the four week time-limit for filing an appeal with the administrative jurisdiction division expired. the actual decision to impose this exclusion order on the applicant was taken on 24 september 2007 by the deputy minister of justice. the applicant challenged this decision in administrative law proceedings. it noted that, in its ruling of 25 january 2007, which had obtained the force of res iudicata, the regional court of the hague, sitting in roermond, had concluded that there existed serious reasons for assuming that the applicant had been involved in acts referred to in article 1f of the refugee convention. the applicant, who was represented by a lawyer throughout these proceedings, could have filed a further appeal with the administrative jurisdiction division, but he did not do so. consequently, the ruling of 10 february 2009 became final after the expiry of the four-week time-limit for filing an appeal with the administrative jurisdiction division.
the applicant was born in 1962 and is detained in daugavpils prison. on 25 april 1998 the applicant and another individual, a. vovruško, were arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed, inter alia, aggravated assault against p.m. 12. criminal proceedings were initiated in that connection, throughout which the applicant and his co-defendant pleaded their innocence. as a result, criminal proceedings (case no. 50207598) were initiated against the police officers for abuse of official power. on 8 october 2001 the applicant lodged an application (no. being aware of that, the government undertake to adopt all necessary measures in order to avoid similar infringements in future, as well as to provide an effective remedy. taking into account that the parties have failed to reach a friendly settlement in this case, the government declare that they offer to pay ex gratia to the applicant compensation in the amount of 4,500 eur ([approximately] 3,163 lvl]), this amount being the global sum and covering any pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage together with any costs and expenses incurred, free of any taxes that may be applicable, with a view to terminat[ing] the proceedings pending before the european court of human rights (hereinafter – the court) in the case [of] jeronovičs v. latvia (application no. ...
this payment will constitute the final resolution of the case.” the relevant paragraphs of the decision read as follows:
“48. in accordance with article 38 § 2 of the convention and rule 62 § 2 of the rules of court, the court will proceed on the basis of the government’s unilateral declaration and the parties’ observations submitted outside the framework of the friendly-settlement negotiations, and will disregard the parties’ statements made in the context of exploring the possibilities for a friendly settlement of the case and the reasons why the parties were unable to agree on the terms of a friendly settlement (see tahsin acar v. turkey (preliminary objection) [gc], no. 53507/99, § 24, 18 july 2006; kalanyos and others v. romania, no. 57884/00, § 25, 26 april 2007; kladivík and kašiar v. slovakia (dec.)

( 36378/97, §§ 23-32, echr 2003‑iii; and staroszczyk v. poland, no. in view of the nature of the undertakings contained in the government’s declaration, the court considers that it is no longer justified to continue the examination of the complaints in question. the same applies to the complaint under article 2 of protocol no. accordingly, the case should be struck out of the list in so far as it concerns the complaints referred to in paragraphs 28, 37 and 38 of this decision.” in the same decision, the court declared admissible the complaints concerning the applicant’s conditions of detention (article 3) and the refusal to grant him leave to attend the supreme court hearing (article 6), and dismissed all the other complaints, including the complaint that the criminal proceedings had been unfair owing to the admission of evidence obtained under duress (article 6). he maintained in that connection that a confession had been obtained from him under duress and that the courts had refused several requests made by him for a confrontation. on 1 december 2009 the court adopted a judgment – jeronovičs v. latvia (no. on 11 october 2010 the applicant requested the public prosecutor’s office to reopen the criminal proceedings in which he had been convicted (see paragraph 13 above) as well as the proceedings concerning his alleged ill-treatment by police officers (see paragraph 16 above). in an appeal lodged on 9 december 2010 the applicant reiterated that there was a legal basis for reopening the criminal proceedings concerning his ill-treatment, on account of the fact that the government’s unilateral declaration had expressly recognised the violation of article 3 of the convention, a circumstance which had led the court to strike out that complaint. in a final decision of 20 december 2010 a higher-ranking prosecutor upheld the decision of 17 november 2010. 06725198 and 50207598 on the basis of newly disclosed circumstances. as already mentioned, the criminal procedure law prescribes in detail all the circumstances which shall be recognised as newly disclosed and on the basis of which criminal proceedings ending in a valid court judgment or decision may be reopened. the criminal procedure law does not make any provision for these circumstances to be expanded. in examining your complaint i did not find established any of the newly disclosed circumstances prescribed by section 655(2) of the criminal procedure law. in your application you emphasised that the criminal proceedings in cases nos.
the applicant was born in 1982 and currently lives in budapest. the applicant crossed the hungarian border from serbia clandestinely in the evening of 24 june 2014. apprehended by a border guard patrol, he was taken into custody, since he was unable to show documentary evidence of his identity or right to stay in the country. at the hearing held on 25 june 2014 by the immigration office, the applicant declared that he had fled from his country of origin, iran, because of his homosexuality. he stated that he had been forced to leave iran and, with the help of a human trafficker, he had entered hungary without documents, because he had had no other way of doing so. at the hearing, he again applied for recognition as a refugee. in view of his request, on 25 june 2014 the csongrád county police department suspended the alien administration procedure. on the same day the office of immigration and nationality commenced asylum proceedings. he stated again that he had had to leave iran because he was homosexual and that criminal proceedings had been instituted against him for this reason, attracting very severe penalties. lxxx of 2007 on asylum (the “asylum act”). in its decision the asylum authority observed that the applicant’s identity and nationality had not been clarified. on the basis of section 31/c (3) of the asylum act and section 36/c (1) of the relevant government decree (see in paragraph 22 below), the applicant could have submitted an objection to the ordering of his asylum detention. on 26 june 2014 the asylum authority applied to the debrecen district court for an extension of the asylum detention for a maximum of 60 days. the asylum authority pointed out in its application that iranian asylum seekers tended to frustrate the procedure and leave for unknown places. it noted that the applicant’s identity was unclear, that he had arrived in hungary unlawfully, and that he had no connections in the country or any means to subsist on. without referring to other individual circumstances or the applicant’s sexual orientation, the court held that less stringent measures – such as an obligation to check in regularly with the authorities, to stay at a designated place of residence, or to pay asylum bail (menekültügyi óvadék) – were not suitable in the case to secure the applicant’s availability to the authorities. on 8 and 11 july 2014 the applicant applied to the asylum authority to be released from detention or transferred to an open facility. in its reply, the asylum authority informed the applicant that an asylum hearing would be held in a few days: he would have the opportunity to prove his citizenship there. because of this consideration, the asylum authority did not forward these requests to any other authority. at the asylum hearing held on 18 july 2014 the applicant made the same statements as before. referring to his sexual orientation, he explained that it was difficult for him to cope with the asylum detention for fear of harassment. at the hearing he provided the asylum authority with relevant and up-to-date information relating to his country of origin. on 11 august 2014 the asylum authority again sought extension of the asylum detention by another maximum of 60 days, relying on section 31/a (1) a) and c) of the asylum act. in its application, the asylum authority did not give any detailed explanation as to why no other, less stringent measures could be applied in the case. in her submission of the same day to the debrecen district court, the lawyer asked the court to hear the applicant and not to extend the asylum detention. on 13 august 2014 the court appointed another legal representative for the applicant. on 19 august 2014 the court heard the applicant and dismissed the application for extension of the asylum detention. on 22 august 2014 the asylum authority terminated the asylum detention and ordered a designated place of residence for the applicant in debrecen with measures securing his availability during the proceedings. on 31 october 2014 the applicant was recognised as a refugee. his asylum detention lasted from 25 june 2014 to 22 august 2014.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in leonding. on 10 july 2001 the applicant applied to the regional governor (landeshauptmann) of upper austria (oberösterreich) for the granting of a licence to run a pharmacy in leonding. on 25 september 2002 the governor dismissed the application. on 14 june 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal with the federal minister for health and women (bundesministerin für gesundheit und frauen, “the minister”). on 14 june 2004 he filed a complaint with the administrative court (verwaltungsgerichtshof) against the minister’s failure to give a decision (säumnisbeschwerde). on 30 september 2004 the administrative court set a time-limit of 31 march 2005 for the minister to make a decision. on 24 march 2005 the minister dismissed the applicant’s appeal. on 11 may 2005 the applicant filed a complaint with the constitutional court (verfassungsgerichtshof) against that decision. on 12 october 2005 the constitutional court refused to deal with the complaint and, upon the applicant’s request, referred the case to the administrative court. already on 22 april 2005 the applicant lodged a request for re‑opening of the proceedings with the minister, who allowed the request on 10 may 2005. thereupon, a number of owners of other pharmacies in the area, who had been parties to the administrative proceedings, lodged a complaint with the administrative court challenging the minister’s decision. while the complaints against the minister’s decision of 24 march 2005 and concerning the re-opening decision of 10 may 2005 were still pending before the administrative court, the minister granted the applicant a licence to run a pharmacy on 5 december 2005. the applicant challenged parts of the minister’s decision before the constitutional court, which dismissed his complaint on 27 february 2007. a request to transfer his complaint to the administrative court was dismissed. on 16 july 2009 the administrative court, dealing with the complaints of the first and the second sets of proceedings at the same time, decided that neither of the minister’s decisions of 24 march and 10 may 2005 had been lawful, and quashed them. as a consequence, the administrative court also had to quash the minister’s decision of 5 december 2005. the proceedings were thus referred back to the minister. on 19 march 2010 the minister granted the applicant’s appeal against the decision of the regional governor of upper austria of 25 september 2002. the applicant was granted a licence to establish and run a new public pharmacy in leonding. the complaint against that decision raised by the owners of an existing pharmacy was dismissed by the administrative court on 28 may 2013 and the applicant was awarded compensation for costs in the amount of 1,106.40 euros (eur).
the applicant was born in 1945 and lives in zvolen. in 1929 the applicant’s grandfather built a house in piešťany. his predecessors retained ownership under the communist regime. ownership was transferred to the applicant from his mother on 21 december 1998. m each in size, while the other two measure 123 sq. at the time the application was lodged, the flats were inhabited by tenants with a regulated rent. their or their predecessors’ right to use the flats had been established by decisions taken by the municipal authorities between 1953 and 1986. after 1 january 1992 their right of use had been transformed into tenancies with regulated rent for an indefinite period. under the relevant legislation, the applicant had to accept that his flats were occupied by those tenants and that he could charge them no more than the maximum amount of rent fixed by the state (“the rent-control scheme”). the applicant had no possibility of unilaterally terminating the leases on his flats. under the applicable legislation, the maximum monthly rent chargeable for the flats in 1999 was the equivalent of some 13 to 33 euros (eur). after several increases in the regulated rent, in 2004 the applicant was able to charge eur 115 monthly in respect of each of the smaller flats and eur 124 monthly in respect of the larger ones. the applicant contended that he, in fact, received from the tenants less than the maximum amount of rent set by the applicable legislation. to this end he led several property disputes with them and the local municipality. the parties provided differing figures as to the market rent. the applicant relied on data from the national association of real estate agencies (“the narea”) and claimed that the monthly market rent for similar flats reached eur 600 to 800 between 2004 and 2007. the government submitted an expert valuation according to which the monthly market rent for the applicant’s flats in 2010 amounted to eur 265.50 and eur 325 respectively. in submissions made on 16 june 2014 the applicant informed the court that the rent control in respect of his four flats had been terminated. the first flat had been subject to rent control until may 2007, the second and third flats until august 2007, and the fourth flat until april 2008.
the applicant was born in 1946 and lives in bratislava. the applicant’s parents built a house in bratislava-ružinov in 1937. in the second half of the 1950s they were compelled to donate the house to the state. on 31 july 1992 it was restored to the applicant’s mother (a three-quarters share) and the applicant (a one-quarter share) under the special legislation on restitution. since 30 september 1996 the applicant has been its sole owner. at the time of its restitution to the applicant and his mother, the house comprised nine flats subject to rent control. under the relevant legislation (i) the applicant had to accept that his flats were occupied by the tenants, (ii) he could charge them no more than the maximum amount of rent fixed by the state, (iii) he could not unilaterally terminate the leases, and (iv) he could not sell the flats to anyone other than the tenants (“the rent-control scheme”). in 1996 and 2000 two of the bigger flats became vacant, as a result of which the rent‑control scheme ceased to apply to them. the rent control ceased to apply in respect of another two 70 sq. m flats in january 2008 and november 2012 respectively. currently, five flats are under the rent control regime. under the applicable legislation, between 1992 and 1999 the maximum permissible monthly rent chargeable for the flats was equivalent of some 3 to 8 euros (eur). after several increases in the regulated rent, in 2007 the applicant could charge some eur 35 for the smaller flat and eur 65 for each of the larger ones. the parties provided differing figures as to the market rent:
the applicant relied on data from the national association of real estate agencies (“narea”) and claimed that in 2007 the monthly market rent for similar flats with a surface area of 70 sq. m reached eur 553 and for flats measuring 30 sq. the government submitted an expert valuation according to which the monthly market rent for the applicant’s flats in 2010 amounted to eur 330 and eur 160.50 respectively.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in chișinău. at the time of the events, he was a bank armoured vehicle driver. at around 10.55 a.m. on 12 august 2005 the applicant went around an illegally parked bus while driving an armoured vehicle. as a result of the sudden stop a bus passenger, c., fell from her seat and suffered moderately severe injuries. on 1 september 2005 a criminal investigation was initiated. the prosecutor heard the applicant, the victim c., the bus driver d., a witness who had been sitting in the applicant’s vehicle and another two witnesses who had been passengers on the bus (s. and v.). on 10 october 2005 the applicant and d. were interviewed face-to-face. according to the applicant, he had completed the manoeuvre around the stationary bus and taken the lane in front of it after making sure the bus was still stationary. he had then signalled to turn right and used the horn to alert the driver of his intentions. according to d., the applicant’s car had turned right without any warning and he had been forced to stop abruptly to prevent an accident. the same day the prosecutor discontinued the criminal proceedings against d. for lack of evidence and instead interviewed him as a witness. on 21 october 2005 the applicant was charged with violating traffic rules, resulting in c.’s injuries. during the course of the proceedings the botanica district court heard the same witnesses as the prosecutor. the court considered the testimony of c. and the two bus passengers unreliable. they claimed that the applicant had performed a sudden manoeuvre which had obliged d. to suddenly stop the bus. the court considered that none of them had seen any of the events themselves and that their impression that the applicant was guilty was because the bus driver blamed him. the court also considered d.’s testimony unreliable because the same charges had been previously brought against him. the court also noted that the site investigation report and the sketch map had not been drawn up immediately after the incident, that the police had gone to the scene several hours later and had been joined only by d., that the applicant’s objections had not been reflected in the documents, and that the sketch map did not correspond to the statements given by all the witnesses shortly after the incident. in a judgment of 27 march 2006 the botanica district court acquitted the applicant for the reasons given above. on 23 may 2006 the chișinău court of appeal dismissed the prosecutor’s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment. it noted that the first-instance court had correctly scrutinised all the evidence and had provided reasons supporting the findings about the unreliability of the witness statements, referring to the testimony of the two passengers. the prosecutor appealed on points of law. on 17 october 2006 the supreme court of justice held a hearing at which the applicant, his representative and the prosecutor were present. the court upheld the prosecutor’s appeal on points of law, quashed the appellate judgment and ordered a rehearing of the case in accordance with the provisions of article 436 of the code of criminal procedure, namely that any examination had to be in accordance with the rules applicable in proceedings before the first-instance court. the court analysed the witness testimony and the site investigation report and the sketch map, providing reasons why the evidence was unreliable. the court upheld the prosecutor’s appeal on points of law and ordered a rehearing of the case. the court provided reasoning similar to that in its judgment of 17 october 2006. the court referred to a list of evidence, including the disputed statements of c., d. and the two witnesses, without providing any additional reasons. on 13 february 2008 the supreme court of justice examined the applicant’s appeal in the absence of the parties and declared it inadmissible. the applicant was served with this judgment on 24 may 2008.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in budaörs. in connection with the criminal complaint, investigations were opened in respect of two individuals on suspicion of forgery of public documents and aggravated fraud. on 8 june 2012 the applicant voluntarily appeared at jászfényszaru police station, where he was questioned as a suspect on charges of aggravated fraud. he was suspected of having been hired as a part-time truck driver by a transport company, and instead of transferring the goods to their assigned destination, he had left them at an unidentified location. he had had no intention to circumvent the investigations and had resided at the same address for years. the applicant was placed in police custody on the same day on the grounds that a warrant had been issued for his arrest. he complained against the measure, arguing that he had not been present at his permanent address as he worked as a truck driver abroad. he also stated that he had steady employment and a permanent address, that the alleged offence of which he was suspected was of a minor nature, that he had voluntarily appeared before the investigation authorities, and that he had given a detailed account of events. therefore, there were no grounds to believe that he would abscond or commit any other crime. in those and the ensuing proceedings the applicant was represented by a lawyer of his choice. it further stated, without any additional reasoning, that less restrictive measures could not be applied. he reiterated that he had voluntarily cooperated with the police, both as regards his arrest and the giving of evidence. he further submitted that he had not been informed of any evidence justifying his detention on remand. on 3 july 2012, on the application of the public prosecutor’s office, the applicant’s detention was extended until 9 september 2012 by the district court. the court found that there remained a well-founded suspicion that the applicant had committed aggravated fraud. furthermore, the risk of his absconding remained since the applicant had been arrested under a warrant. in parallel, on 2 july 2012 the applicant applied for release from pre-trial detention or, alternatively, to be placed under house arrest or under an obligation not to leave a certain area. he reiterated that he had no criminal record, gave financial assistance to his elderly parents and his brother, who had down syndrome and with whom he also shared a house, had a permanent job and that his residence had not changed for forty years. he also submitted that he had voluntarily cooperated with the police giving a detailed account of the events and handling over documentary evidence in his possession. it reiterated in essence the same reasoning as in its decision of 3 july 2012 without any consideration for the application of a less restrictive measure. nonetheless, the high court upheld the first-instance decision to prolong the applicant’s pre-trial detention owing to a risk of collusion, adding that there were no grounds for choosing another, less restrictive, preventive measure. on 25 june 2015 the tatabánya district court acquitted the applicant. the applicant was detained in székesfehérvár prison from 9 june to 7 september 2012. during that time he was held in a cell measuring 41.09 sq. on 31 july 2012 there were eight inmates (5.1 sq. m per person); between 12 and 21 june, 20 and 30 july and 11 and 25 august 2012 there were eleven inmates (3.7 sq. m per person); and between 15 and 20 july 2012 there were thirteen inmates (3.1 sq. during the summer, the temperature in the prison cell rose to 30˚c during the day time, occasionally reaching 35˚c. the applicant could only leave the cell for one hour of outdoor exercise every day. inmates were able to take a shower once a week for about five to ten minutes.
the applicant was born in 1944 and lives in kłomnice. he is a numbskull posing as the people’s tribune. the only panacea, or universal cure, for such a person is to recognise his intentions and take up a bloodless fight using arguments. at the same time he declared that he would continue doing his job, that is, condemning farmers to breeding nice little birds in order to collect their eggs. his boss considered the quail business very important, because it would eliminate the need for viagra. there has not been a sideshow like it in the radomsko district for a long time. so the time is approaching when pilgrimages of men from all over poland, and maybe even the european union, will come to radomsko to taste quail eggs and later begin procreating. i wonder who has gone mad in the district, and why mad ideas, supported by even madder arguments, can be accepted by our officials. every dull boss can be convinced by any rubbish. the applicant went on to describe in general terms a local economic development programme, which had been presented to him by a businessman. he finished his article with the following paragraph:
“this is not a venture of the quail variety by some smart poser or populist who is able to sell his dull bosses dung nicely wrapped in words. the mayor of the radomsko district (starosta), g.d., an employee of that department, lodged a private bill of indictment against the applicant with the radomsko district court. the private prosecutors sought an order requiring the applicant to publish an apology in the weekly newspaper. on 8 february 2006 the piotrków trybunalski district court gave its judgment. had amounted to insult (zniewaga) committed through the mass media, within the meaning of article 216 § 2 of the criminal code. the mayor of the radomsko district, and his officials. the newspaper was particularly critical of k.h. ’s initiative to develop quail farming in order to tackle the impoverishment of the local population. was an official in the district’s marketing department. in june 2004 a journalist at the same newspaper had published a detailed article on the same subject. the conflict between the applicant and the private prosecutors had intensified with each successively published article. had received, the applicant had decided once again to mock the two officials, as well as their superior, m.d. the court established that there was no doubt that the words “numbskull”, “dim‑witted official” and “poser” had referred to k.h., the latter behaviour was not only unethical and unprofessional, but also incompatible with the role of the media, which was to serve the state and society. it is difficult not to agree with the position that the word “numbskull” (“palant”) in the analysed context, although its literal meaning is legally irrelevant, fulfils all the criteria of insult within the meaning of article 216 of the criminal code. it would be hard to find a person who would not feel offended by similar epithets, especially if formulated in the press. dull” meaning not sharp, unintelligent, intellectually retarded. however, the court found no grounds to hold that the impugned words had the effect of lowering the private prosecutors in public esteem, or undermining the public confidence necessary for the discharge of their duties as local government officials. it further held that, although fair criticism of public authorities and officials was socially desirable and legally accepted, the protection afforded by law did not extend to the use of insulting words which offended human dignity.
in 1996 the applicant and his wife started a family business which involved, among other things, the replication of digital data and the sale of blank data storage devices. after the inspection the police seized seven computers, sixty-six optical disc recording devices, a printer, a modem, over three thousand optical discs with recordings, some thirty thousand blank optical discs and some seven thousand printed disc covers. this deed has been completed in duplicate and read out. ...” the questions related to the applicant’s family business and the observance of copyright law in the business’s use of software and in its replicating activities. these two [individuals] organised an entire underground production [facility] in their office. in his decision, he referred to the search of the office of the applicant and his wife and the seizure of their belongings on 20 august 2002. declared the property seized from the applicant and his wife as physical evidence to be stored by the police pending the investigation of the case. on 21 november 2002 the shevchenkivsky district court of kyiv (hereinafter “the district court”) issued search warrants in respect of the applicant’s and his wife’s flats, noting that they were suspected of breaching criminal legislation concerning copyright protection. on 23 november 2002 these flats were searched pursuant to the warrants. it appears from the case file that no items were seized. they noted, in particular, that proceedings could only be terminated on such grounds in cases in which a particular person had been indicted. there was insufficient evidence that he had unlawfully replicated copyrighted materials or distributed counterfeit products. in march 2006 the criminal proceedings were still pending. on an unspecified date the applicant and his wife instituted defamation proceedings against the police authorities for publishing an inaccurate crime report on their website (see paragraph 11 above), seeking the retraction of the information contained therein. on 27 october 2003 the district court allowed the claim. on an unspecified date the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the shevchenkivskyy district court in kyiv to reclaim his computer equipment, optical discs and other property seized by the police. in court the applicant reformulated his claims. he requested that the investigator’s decision of 15 november 2002 (see paragraph 13 above) be set aside. in this respect the applicant submitted, in particular, that on 20 and 21 august 2002 kecu officers had conducted an arbitrary search and seizure of his property without a court warrant or any other lawful grounds for taking such actions. it rejected them, finding that the applicant lacked standing to bring the proceedings. he could not therefore claim that his rights had been breached by the institution of the proceedings. as he had been denied formal status as a suspect, he could not defend himself properly. in addition, as the proceedings had been artificially protracted, he had been deprived of the opportunity to reclaim his seized property pending resolution of the case. on 17 september 2003 the court of appeal quashed the district court’s decision and decided to discontinue the proceedings. on 13 july 2004 the supreme court of ukraine quashed the previous decisions and remitted the case to the lower courts for fresh consideration. on 14 october 2004 the district court allowed the applicant’s complaint and revoked the decision of 15 november 2002. by assessing the lawfulness of the investigative actions, the district court had in fact touched upon the admissibility of evidence, a matter which could only be examined in the course of a criminal trial. it further found that by instituting the criminal proceedings “into the matter” rather than “against the applicant”, the police had not caused irreparable damage to the applicant’s constitutional rights such as would necessitate the setting aside of their decision by way of judicial proceedings. any irregularities in the formulation of the decision to institute criminal proceedings could be more appropriately addressed by the prosecution authorities. the applicant appealed on points of law, alleging in particular that the court of appeal had breached procedural rules in admitting the appeal of the prosecutor’s office.
mrs marinova was born in 1972 and lives in tervel. in february 2006 she complained to the child protection agency that the school teacher of her son, then aged fourteen, had on several occasions ill-treated and humiliated him. mrs marinova argued that this had amounted to harassment, and said that her son had become demotivated. the teacher had brought a private criminal prosecution against the father in relation to that, and the proceedings were pending. in april 2006 mrs marinova complained to the school’s headmaster and the police that the teacher had taken her son’s mobile telephone in class and had later refused to give it back. the prosecuting authorities opened criminal proceedings against an unknown perpetrator in connection with this allegation and in august 2006 suspended them on the ground that the perpetrator had not been identified. in july 2006 the teacher brought a private criminal prosecution against mrs marinova in connection with these three complaints. she submitted that she had not read them because the authorities dealing with them had not shown them to her. at the first hearing of the case in september 2006, the teacher brought a civil claim against mrs marinova, seeking 5,000 bulgarian levs (bgn) (2,556 euros (eur)), plus interest, in non-pecuniary damages. having examined the findings of the child protection agency and the prosecuting authorities in relation to mrs marinova’s complaints, the court concluded that her allegations, the first of which had become known to the school’s headmaster and a pedagogical counsellor in the school, had been false and therefore defamatory. such complaints could, in some cases, be seen as false accusation contrary to article 286 of the code (see paragraph 54 below). mrs marinova also emphasised that she had not made her allegations publicly. on 28 july 2008 he was stopped by two road traffic police officers. one of them recorded that mr zlatanov had failed to obey a stop sign. mr zlatanov objected, noting down in the record that the officer had refused to present himself, smelled of alcohol and staggered. mr zlatanov’s allegations triggered an internal inquiry which exonerated the officer of any wrongdoing. the court replaced his criminal liability with an administrative fine of bgn 500 (eur 256). in a final judgment of 20 november 2009, the dobrich regional court upheld the lower court’s judgment. it found it established that the officer had not displayed any signs of inebriation, which in the court’s view meant that mr zlatanov had been fully aware that the officer had not been drunk but had nevertheless chosen to make his allegations, thus acting with a direct intent to discredit the officer. he then called the police and informed the officer on duty of the incident. according to mr findulov, on 14 september 2009 he found his identity card in his mail box. in a judgment of 11 may 2010, the burgas district court found mr findulov guilty of defaming a public official, contrary to articles 147 and 148 §§ 1 (3) and 2 of the criminal code (see paragraphs 49 and 50 below). it sentenced him to a fine of bgn 5,000 (eur 2,556) and a public reprimand. it partly allowed the officer’s claim for damages, ordering mr findulov to pay him bgn 3,000 (eur 1,534). it entirely agreed with the reasons given by that court, adding that mr findulov had been fully aware that his allegations against the officer were false but had nevertheless chosen to defame him. mr and mrs dinchevi sent copies of the complaint to the lovech district prosecutor’s office, the head of the lovech fire brigade, and the minister of internal affairs. on 4 december 2009 the head of the lovech district police directorate informed mr and mrs dinchevi that an internal inquiry had established that their complaint was ill-founded. the reprimand was to be executed by announcing the conviction and sentence on the local radio station. he submitted that the statements in their complaint against the officers had not been defamatory but simply an expression of their disapproval of the way in which the officers had carried out their duties. in a final judgment of 7 march 2013 (реш.
the applicants were born in 1978, 1980 and 2007 respectively. they fled armenia on account of fears of persecution related to the first applicant’s activity as a journalist and his political activism. after arriving in france on 4 october 2009 they filed applications for asylum, which were rejected by the french office for the protection of refugees and stateless persons (office français de protection des réfugiés et apatrides – ofpra), on 21 december 2009, then by the national asylum court (cour nationale du droit d’asile – cnda), on 28 february 2011. their subsequent requests for re-examination were also rejected. on 3 may 2011 the prefect of loiret issued orders rejecting the applicants’ requests for leave to remain and obliging them to leave french territory. on 18 october 2011 the orleans administrative court, on an appeal from the applicants, refused to overturn those orders. the first applicant was arrested by the police in connection with a theft on the evening of 16 february 2012 and was taken into police custody that same day. the applicants were taken that same day to the administrative detention centre (centre de rétention administrative – cra) of toulouse-cornebarrieu. they claimed that they had a fixed addressed at the reception centre (cada), that a friend was prepared to accommodate them and that, in any event, their detention would be incompatible with the best interests of their child. the prefect asked the liberties and detention judge of the toulouse tribunal de grande instance to extend the detention, after which the first two applicants tried to obtain the third applicant’s voluntary intervention in the proceedings. that decision was upheld on 24 february 2012 by the president of the toulouse court of appeal, who found in particular as follows:
“... the administrative detention centre of cornebarrieu, where the child is held, has been authorised to receive families and contains all the necessary facilities to ensure the comfort of a family with children. thus the whole family is together and they have, in an autonomous area and separated from the rest of the detainees, rooms for them alone and for their exclusive use. in addition, there is a playground on the site, like those to be found in town squares. lastly, a doctor and a nurse are available every day in the toulouse administrative detention centre and mr and mrs a.b. have not shown that they met with a refusal when they asked to present their child – a request of which the existence has not been established. the convention provisions, especially article 8, do not therefore appear to have been breached.” on 24 february 2012 the applicants submitted to the court, under rule 39 of the rules of court, a request for the suspension of the detention orders concerning them. on 29 february 2012 the court decided not to indicate the requested interim measure. on 5 march 2012 the applicants were released, after expressing their wish to return to armenia, and after seeking voluntary return assistance for that purpose. however, they did not leave france, on account of the third applicant’s state of health. on 13 july 2012 the first applicant was granted leave to remain as the parent of a sick child. its judgments contained the same wording for each spouse:
“4. under provision 3o of part ii of article l. 511-1 of the same code, such risk must in particular be regarded as established, save in specific circumstances, in cases where the alien has already evaded the execution of a removal measure. as regards aliens who are the parents of minor children and who do not have sufficient guarantees of compliance, such aliens being provided for by article l. 562-1 of the said code, and in accordance with the aims of article 17 of directive 2008/115/ec, recourse to placement in detention can only constitute an exceptional measure in cases where the alien does not have a stable place of abode at the time when the prefectoral authority takes the necessary measures to prepare for the removal. for the purposes of transposition of the above-mentioned directive, article l. 562-1 of the entry and residence of aliens and right of asylum code, as inserted by law no. the measure of curfew with electronic tagging is decided by the administrative authority for a period of five days. accompanied by his wife and four-year-old son [a.b.], in deciding on their placement in detention the prefect of loiret merely stated that mr [a.b.] it transpires from the foregoing that, without there being any need to examine the other arguments in the application, mr [a.b.] is justified in submitting that the judge appointed by the president of the toulouse administrative court, in the judgment appealed against, had been wrong to reject his request for the annulment of the decision of 17 february 2012 placing him in administrative detention.”
the applicant was born in 1940 and lives in gelgaudiškis, šakiai region. had unlawfully carried a mobile phone into detention. most of the information on that phone, including any text messages sent by v.ž., had been deleted but police officers found several text messages which v.ž. “give me their number, i’ll arrange for us to give it later. “mother doesn’t give anything, i’m telling you the customs office is watching everything.” was detained, to bring him food and clean clothes. at 4 p.m. that day the applicant was informed by a senior investigator that she was being placed under provisional arrest (laikinas sulaikymas), on the basis of article 140 of the code of criminal procedure (see “relevant domestic law” below). the decision to arrest the applicant indicated that she was suspected of unlawful possession of narcotic substances with the purpose of distribution (see paragraph 27 below). provisional arrest had been deemed necessary in order to prevent her from fleeing, interfering with the investigation or committing further crimes because it was suspected that she had previously hidden drugs from the investigators (see paragraph 9 above). at that time the applicant was sixty-nine years old. on 4 march 2010 the applicant was served with the official notice that she was a suspect (pranešimas apie įtarimą). the notice stated that in february 2010 she had allegedly acquired drugs from unidentified persons, kept them in her daughter v.b. she denied having committed any crimes and refused to answer any further questions. at some point during the day the applicant started feeling weak, and felt a headache and a pain in her chest. an ambulance was called to the police station and the applicant was given first aid. on the same day the applicant’s lawyer submitted a request to the šakiai district prosecutor to release the applicant from provisional arrest. at 3.50 p.m. that day the šakiai police released the applicant. according to the applicant, she did not appeal against that decision because she had already been released. on 30 september 2010 the šakiai district prosecutor discontinued the pre-trial investigation against the applicant on the grounds of insufficient evidence that she had committed the crime outlined in article 260 § 1 of the criminal code. the šakiai police continued the pre-trial investigation concerning the applicant’s son v.ž. on 4 november 2011 the šakiai district court convicted v.ž. of unlawful possession of narcotic substances with the purpose of distribution under article 260 § 1 of the criminal code. thus, she claimed that it had been unlikely that she would have attempted to flee or hide from the investigation. the applicant noted that the investigation against her son had been instituted on 17 february 2010, and there had been no indication from that day until her arrest that the police suspected that she had committed any crimes or attempted to interfere with the investigation ‑ on the contrary, she had voluntarily come to the police station to see her son. the applicant argued that the real purpose of arresting her had been to force her to testify against her son. she stated that the cell in which she had been detained had been damp and dilapidated and that there had been smells emanating from the toilet which had made her nauseous. the court noted that the termination of the pre-trial investigation against the applicant did not make the investigation unlawful ab initio, and found that there had been sufficient grounds for suspicions against her: plastic bags had been found in the apartment where she lived together with her son v.ž., the court did not address the applicant’s complaints concerning the conditions of her detention. having found that the applicant’s arrest had been lawful, the court held that there were no grounds to award the applicant any damages.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in sevojno. on 30 may 2001 the užice department of the central employment office (republicki zavod za tržiste rada – nacionalna služba za zapošljavanje – organizaciona jedinica užice, hereinafter “the employment office”) granted unemployment benefits to the applicant until he found a new job or became eligible for retirement (novčana naknada do zaposlenja ili ispunjavanja uslova za starosnu penziju). on 1 june 2001 the law on changes and amendments to the law on employment and rights of unemployed persons (“the 2001 law”) came into force. the law provided for different coefficients and a different methodology for calculating such benefits. it also provided, in article 20, that any administrative proceedings which had not been concluded by the date on which the new law came into force were to be finalised in accordance with the new law (article 17 of the 2001 law provided that article 20 was applicable as of 1 september 2001). the applicant was receiving the full amount of the benefits he was entitled to until october 2001. from that date the benefits were decreased to 70-80% of the amount he had initially been awarded, although the decision of 30 may 2001 had not been amended or superseded by a new decision. consequently, on 12 november 2007 the applicant brought a civil claim against the employment office in the užice municipal court (opštinski sud u užicu), seeking payment of the difference between the benefits he had received and those he had been granted by the employment office and which had been due from 1 november 2004 (a claim for any earlier sum was statute-barred), plus statutory interest and legal costs. on 26 december 2007 the municipal court rejected the applicant’s claim. it found that his benefits had been correctly calculated, in accordance with the 2001 law, as the employment office’s decision in his case had not yet been final on the date on which the relevant law had come into force. on 18 march 2008 the užice district court (okružni sud u užicu) upheld that judgment following an appeal by the applicant. the applicant’s lawyer brought separate claims on behalf of numerous individuals (hereinafter “the plaintiffs”), seeking outstanding benefits. on 22 november 2007 the same municipal court ruled in favour of m.ð., one of the plaintiffs, whose claim was factually and legally identical to that of the applicant (m.ð. ’s administrative decision had also been delivered on 30 may 2001). that judgment became final on 19 december 2007. the municipal court ruled in favour of several of the plaintiffs in nine judgments delivered between 24 august 2007 and 17 april 2008, although it appears that the dates on which the respective administrative decisions had come into force differed. on 26 february 2008 and 19 may 2008 the arilje municipal court delivered two judgments in which it ruled against plaintiffs whose claims were identical to the applicant’s. the užice district court upheld those two judgments on 20 march 2008 and 15 september 2008 respectively. a number of plaintiffs who were in an identical situation to that of the applicant lodged constitutional appeals with the constitutional court of serbia. between 4 november 2010 and 1 march 2012 the constitutional court adopted a number of decisions in those cases, finding a violation of the right to a fair trial. it quashed the civil judgments and ordered the reopening of the civil proceedings. acting upon the decisions of the constitutional court, the kragujevac court of appeal (which became the competent court of second instance for the applicant’s case after a reorganisation of courts in serbia in 2010, instead of the užice district court) and the belgrade court of appeal reopened proceedings in cases in which the constitutional court had made such an order and ruled in favour of the plaintiffs. on 1 april 2014 the supreme court of cassation adopted a detailed action plan aimed at ensuring the general harmonisation of case-law throughout the serbian judicial system. the plan contained a series of measures to be taken at various levels of jurisdiction, and, inter alia, included the following: (i) the adoption of guiding legal opinions based on the principles developed in the case-law of the european court of human rights; (ii) the dissemination of such opinions; (iii) regular information sharing between the courts; (iv) an increased number of thematic discussions and training programmes; (v) the adoption of specific action plans by the courts at various levels; and (vi) the development of various it tools and related intranet databases.
the applicant was born in 1981 and lives in veshenskaya, a village in the rostov region. he saw p. there, a police officer and former schoolmate who was drunk and making indecent suggestions to a girl. the applicant was able to walk but was suffering from memory loss, was disoriented and did not understand what had just happened. at 12.20 a.m. on 10 july 2002, m. arrived at the hospital in p.’s father’s car and took samples of the applicant’s blood. the applicant was unconscious when m. took the samples. the applicant alleged that the results of the tests had been falsified by m. he referred to the testimony of two staff members of the hospital, who later testified that he had not been drunk. furthermore, the entries made by the hospital personnel about his condition and the nature of his injuries were incomplete. his condition, however, remained very unstable and continued to worsen. the police did not mention the windscreen in their report. the applicant alleged that the investigator in charge of the case, m., had been a schoolmate and close friend of p. he also alleged that the date the decision was taken to open an investigation was incorrect, as the case had in fact been opened on 18 july 2002. on 19 july 2002 the investigator examined the car again. on 1 august 2002 a forensic expert drew up a report examining the nature of the applicant’s injuries and making conclusions as to the speed and direction p.’s car had been travelling, the position of the applicant’s body at the time of the accident, and other relevant factors. on 2 august 2002 the investigator questioned p.’s father who explained, among other things, that the dent on the bonnet of the car was not related to the accident involving the applicant. he asked the investigator to summon and question them. on 4 december 2002 a team of experts produced a report analysing the applicant’s injuries and the mechanics of the accident. on 10 january 2003 the applicant lodged a civil claim against p. in connection with the health problems he had suffered as a result of the accident. on 24 march 2003 the investigator questioned the deputy head of sholokhovskiy police station, ch., as to the civil claim lodged by the applicant within the criminal proceedings, the court awarded him 50,000 russian roubles (rub) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. in particular, it ordered the lower court to clarify whether the road sign could have been visible to p. on the night of the accident. on 8 april 2005 the sholokhovskiy district court found p. guilty under article 264 § 1 of the criminal procedure code. its findings of fact can be summarised as follows. p. had been able to avoid collision by manoeuvring or stopping his car, but for whatever reason he had not done so. he had applied the brakes a while after the collision. the applicant’s relatives also lodged separate claims within the same proceedings. in those proceedings the plaintiffs (the applicant and his relatives) amended their claims. as to non-pecuniary damages, the applicant claimed rub 4,320,000 under this head, referring mostly to the same facts and the suffering caused by the accident, the subsequent surgery, his participation in the proceedings, and lost opportunities related to his disability. where damage was caused in the context of an economic activity, it should be compensated in the ordinary way, by the immediate wrongdoer. on 5 june 2006 the verkhnedonskoy district court gave judgment in the civil case. the applicant tried to challenge the refusals in the courts but to no avail. but the investigator did not find any grounds on which to prosecute him.
the applicants were born in 1955 and live in poreč. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. on 5 february 2009 the applicants and their company, m.n., and their company’s debt of hrk 180,000 to company e. in order to secure the overall loan, the applicants used their house as collateral, allowing m.g. it was stipulated that unless the applicants and their company paid their outstanding debts by 1 may 2009, the creditors were entitled to institute enforcement proceedings for payment of the debt through the sale of the applicants’ house. on 17 november 2009 the poreč municipal court granted that request and issued an enforcement order against the applicants. the applicants did not appeal and the enforcement order became final on 17 december 2009. both applicants were properly summoned, but only the first applicant appeared. the creditor asked the municipal court to commission an expert for that purpose. the first applicant did not comply with his undertaking. on 16 june 2010 the valuation of the house was carried out on site by a civil engineer and a surveyor, in the presence of the first applicant. the civil engineer submitted his report on 20 august 2010, stating that the value of the house was hrk 2,463,092.48 (approximately 323,860 euros). the applicants made no objections to the valuation. on 7 october 2010 another set of enforcement proceedings against the applicants was joined to the proceedings at issue. on 25 january 2011 a first public auction was held. however, there were no interested buyers. the applicants, though properly summoned, did not appear. a further set of enforcement proceedings against the applicants was joined to the proceedings at issue on 13 may 2011. since the applicants had not lodged an appeal, the enforcement order had become final on 31 march 2011. the second public auction was eventually held on 30 march 2012 and the applicants’ house was sold to m.g. for hrk 821,040 (approximately 109,000 euros). title to the applicants’ house, on condition that he paid hrk 821,040 as the purchase price. on 23 april 2012 the applicants lodged an appeal against that decision, arguing that the judicial sale had been disproportionate since the true value of their house had been about 700,000 euros (eur). ’s title to the applicants’ house in the land register. on the same day the poreč municipal court issued the interim measure, prohibited m.g. from having the electricity and water cut off and ordered hep to reconnect the electricity. on 17 september 2013 the poreč municipal court ordered the eviction of the applicants. however, the eviction was postponed for three months. on 20 january 2014 the pula county court dismissed the applicants’ appeal against the decision of 17 september 2013 (see paragraph 32 above), finding that the municipal court had acted in accordance with the law, namely the provisions of the enforcement act. the applicants have not yet been evicted.
the applicant organisation, sia akka/laa (sia “autortiesību un komunicēšanās konsultāciju aģentūra/latvijas autoru apvienība” –copyright and communication consulting agency ltd./latvian authors association) is a non-profit organisation founded in riga by a separate non‑profit organisation, the latvian authors association, whose members are various latvian artists. at the end of the 1990s the applicant organisation, acting as a representative of approximately 2000 domestic and two million international authors who had entrusted the applicant organisation to manage the copyright of their musical works, was concluding licence agreements with several broadcasters in latvia. as a result some broadcasting organisations continued to use the protected musical works without a written agreement, either without paying any remuneration or paying the amount the broadcasting organisations unilaterally considered equitable. in 2002 the applicant organisation instituted civil proceedings against several broadcasters operating in latvia. the applicant organisation further asked that the court award compensation for unauthorised use of musical works. by relying on the authors’ exclusive rights to control the use of their musical works, the applicant organisation asked the court to apply an injunction precluding the defendant from using the authors’ works before a valid licence agreement between the parties had come into effect. they asked the court to order the applicant organisation to conclude a licence agreement with the defendant organisation and to lay down an equitable royalty rate. on 16 january 2003 the first-instance court partly upheld the claim and fully upheld the counterclaim. it established that between 1 january 1999 and 31 december 2001 the defendant had infringed the authors’ rights by broadcasting the protected works without authorisation, contrary to the provisions of the copyright law. the first-instance court ordered the defendant to pay to the applicant organisation compensation for the above period in the amount of 78,000 latvian lats (lvl, equivalent to 111,500 euros (eur)), which was 1.5% of the defendant’s net turnover over this period. furthermore, the first-instance court ordered the applicant organisation to conclude a licence agreement with the defendant for the next three-year period with a royalty rate set at 2% of the defendant’s monthly net turnover (ikmēneša neto apgrozījums). by referring to the testimonies of two authors represented by the applicant organisation, the first-instance court concluded that the authors themselves were interested in their musical works being publicly broadcasted. on 23 october 2003 the civil cases chamber of the supreme court, acting as an appellate court, upheld the part of the first-instance judgment concerning the compensation for copyright infringement and the injunction. the appellate court noted that it was partly due to the applicant organisation’s inconsistent negotiating that a licence agreement could not be concluded. the appellate court accordingly recognised that the licence agreement was to be considered concluded in the wording as agreed by the parties on 7 october 2003. on the question of remuneration, the appellate court established that in the negotiation process the applicant organisation had changed the royalty rate from 6% to 4% and then to 3.5%, whereas the defendant had insisted on 1.6% of the income from which royalties should be calculated. the appellate court took note of the characteristics of the defendant’s activities and concluded that an equitable remuneration would be 2% of the income from which, as agreed by the parties, the royalties should be calculated. on 11 february 2004, following an appeal on points of law, the senate of the supreme court upheld the appellate court’s findings that after the expiry of the earlier licence agreement on 31 december 1998 the de facto contractual relationship between the parties had continued mainly owing to the fact that the applicant organisation had failed to reach an agreement with the defendant on the terms of the licence agreement. the senate of the supreme court further observed that the parties did not contest that the authors had a right to receive equitable remuneration, but that to that day the parties had not reached an agreement on the rate of the royalty payments. in their claim against latvijas radio, a state-owned limited liability company, the applicant organisation asked the riga regional court, acting as a first-instance court, to find that by broadcasting the rightsholders’ musical works without a valid licence agreement between 1 january 2000 and 31 december 2001, the defendant had violated economic interests of the authors represented by the applicant organisation. by lodging a counterclaim the defendant in essence asked the court to recognise that in the disputed period the parties had a de facto contractual relationship. on 2 april 2003 the riga regional court dismissed the applicant organisation’s claim and upheld the counterclaim. the court established that even though the licence agreement concluded between the parties with the royalty rate set at 3.2% of the defendant’s annual income had expired in 1999, the applicant organisation had continued receiving royalty payments from the defendant, which continued to pay at a lower rate. it considered that it would be fruitless to issue an injunction prohibiting the defendant from broadcasting the works. as a result, over a prolonged period of time the authors’ rights had been unprotected. as the parties had not asked the court to decide on the exact terms and conditions of a licence agreement, the appellate court decided to impose on the parties a general obligation to conclude a licence agreement by 1 march 2004. given that the parties had been unable to agree on a royalty rate, the appellate court set the rate at 3% of the defendant’s net turnover. in reaching this conclusion the appellate court took into consideration such elements as, inter alia, the royalty rate set in other court proceedings and the existing practice in certain other eu member states. the applicant organisation appealed on points of law arguing that by, inter alia, ordering the parties to conclude a licence agreement and setting its terms, the court had overstepped its powers and acted in breach of section 11bis of the berne convention and section 15 of the copyright law. on 17 march 2004 the senate partly upheld the lower court’s judgment with similar reasoning as in the first set of proceedings.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in sofia. on 29 march 2006 the kazanlak district court convicted the applicant of wilfully using a forged document and falsely accusing another person of criminal conduct, and sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment. the court ordered that the applicant be detained pending any appeal against his conviction and sentence. after his detention, the applicant appealed against his conviction and sentence to the stara zagora regional court. in his appeal, he included the following statement:
“the [judge-rapporteur] is a pupil of mine and is seeking revenge, using his functional immunity. everything is being decided on the basis of power and connections, not on the basis of laws.” the judge‑rapporteur at the kazanlak district court became aware of that statement when processing the appeal, which, in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure, had been filed with that court with a view to being sent to the higher court for examination. when i asked him which subject i had taught him, the reply was that it had been ‘electrical materials’ and that i had given him an average grade ... i believe that there exist grounds for the recusal of the judge-rapporteur ... i have personal relations with [him]. my request was however turned down and my fate was left in the hands of the court.” on 16 may 2007 the stara zagora regional court quashed the lower court’s judgment and remitted the case for re-examination, citing a number of breaches of the rules of procedure. in particular, it found that the lower court had not given reasons why it had accepted that the applicant had committed the offences and had in effect reversed the burden of proof, placing it on the applicant. in this case, the request was based on personal relations between the [applicant] and the [judge-rapporteur] that pre-dated the opening of the criminal proceedings against the [applicant]. the bias displayed by the judge‑rapporteur constituted grounds for him to recuse himself.” he did not have any personal bias against the applicant, and had never been asked to recuse himself from the case. in a judgment of 14 december 2007, the stara zagora district court convicted the applicant of defaming a public official, contrary to articles 147 and 148 §§ 1 (3) and 2 of the criminal code (see paragraphs 20 and 21 below), in relation to both statements. it sentenced him to a fine of 5,000 bulgarian levs (bgn) (2,556 euros (eur)) and a public reprimand, and ordered him to pay bgn 150 (eur 77) in court costs. the court did not accept the applicant’s argument that he had not acted with intent. it noted that he had repeated the allegations twice and that, as evident from a psychiatric expert report obtained in the course of the defamation proceedings, he had been fully aware of the meaning of the statements and capable of controlling himself in spite of his emotional state. the form of mens rea had been oblique intent (recklessness): the applicant had been aware that his allegations might not be true but had nonetheless chosen to make them. the applicant appealed to the stara zagora regional court. in his brief, he submitted that his first statement had been read out of context; that the lower court had not taken due account of his perturbed emotional state, resulting from his having to spend time in custody pursuant to an unlawful conviction and sentence; that his statements had only been addressed to the appellate court and not intended for publication; and that he had not acted wilfully or recklessly. in an additional brief, the applicant’s counsel submitted, inter alia, that the lower court had failed to explain why it had found that the applicant’s statements had been “disseminated”, given that the appellate judges to whom they had been addressed had been under the duty not to disclose professional secrets and that no third parties had access to the file containing the statements. nor had the lower court given reasons as to why it had found the statements disparaging. moreover, the statements were truthful – the judge had been a pupil of the applicant, and his bias against the applicant had been acknowledged in the appellate judgment. he had made the statements while conducting his defence in a criminal case against him, and it was wrong to read them out of context. lastly, his sentence, although set at the statutory minimum, was still unduly harsh. it held that the applicant had “disseminated” the first statement by including it in his appeal. the fact that he had been in a fragile emotional state when doing so was irrelevant. in view of the court’s ruling in relation to the second statement, it was necessary to reduce the applicant’s sentence. bearing in mind the applicant’s clean criminal record and the fact that he was experiencing financial difficulties because he was unemployed, the court found that it had to opt for a sentence below the statutory minimum and reduce the applicant’s fine to bgn 2,500.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in jonava. the guard refused to comply and kept shouting and jostling. submitted an identically worded report the same day. was questioned as a witness in the investigation. i told them that i had been at my workplace, that i had not gone anywhere and had not tried to escape from anyone. my arms were hurting ... i told the officers that i could go to the administrative area and get my car keys, so that they could check if my car’s engine was hot. i crouched down because of that and the shorter officer kneed me in the stomach about four times. before being handcuffed i did not jostle. i did not intend to punch the officers ...” 19. stated that the applicant had sworn at the officers when he had been asked to identify himself. had taken the applicant by one arm and v.b. when i was examining the car, [the applicant] was nearby, i don’t remember if he was saying or doing anything. insisted that he had been present:
“i was at the scene of the incident, i was with a dog, i saw [the applicant’s] arrest and i helped two police officers to twist [the applicant’s] arms (padėjau užlaužti rankas) ...
i went to the guard booth with the officers. then we explained to him that if he didn’t identify himself he would be forcibly taken to the police station. i don’t remember what time we went to the guard booth. he also stated that he had not seen whether the applicant had been beaten or kicked by the officers. on 30 september 2008 the prosecutor arranged a confrontation between the applicant and police officer v.b. his fist barely touched my mouth but didn’t cut it (jo kumštis vos palietė mano lūpą, jos neprakirto) because i managed to step back. the applicant appealed against the prosecutor’s decision. accordingly, the applicant complained that the pre-trial investigation had not been thorough and had not objectively established the circumstances of his arrest and injury. the court upheld the applicant’s arguments that the previous prosecutor, who had decided to discontinue the investigation, could not be seen as impartial, and ordered the jonava district prosecutor’s office to appoint a different prosecutor. after twisting his arms the officers led him to [the guard booth]. the applicant] punched me inside the premises, that is in the guard booth. in september 2009, at the prosecutor’s request, a court medical expert carried out an additional assessment of the applicant’s medical file. ’s statements (see paragraph 21 above), he could not have tied his dog to a fence because there was no fence at the garage complex, nor was it possible to tie the dog to the brick wall of the garage. he also went to the booth and was standing in the doorway because the door was open. when [the applicant] was led out of the booth, he was handcuffed ...
my dog was further away the whole time, tied to the garage wall ...
as for the punch ... i can only say that it appeared to me that [the applicant] had attempted to punch an officer. on 6 september 2010 the kaunas regional court upheld that judgment. on 30 june 2011 the kaunas district prosecutor discontinued the investigation. the prosecutor relied on essentially the same grounds as the jonava district prosecutor in its earlier decisions (see paragraphs 23, 35, 39 and 42 above), and concluded that the applicant’s statements had been inconsistent, whereas the consistent statements of all the police officers had shown that the use of force had been a lawful and proportionate response to the applicant’s resistance and his refusal to comply with the officers’ lawful orders.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in chita. on 2 september 2004 the applicant was arrested on the charges of fraud and forgery of official documents. on 4 september 2004 the tsentralnyy district court of chita authorised the applicant’s pre-trial detention. the court reasoned as follows:
“the evidence collected ... incriminated [the applicant] ... in a serious crime which entails a custodial sentence exceeding ten years. ... the court takes note of the [applicant’s] character. however, ... it considers that, if at large, [the applicant] might put pressure on victims and witnesses or otherwise interfere with administration of justice or continue criminal activities, accordingly, ... the court considers it necessary to remand [the applicant] in custody.” on 11 november 2004 the chita regional court upheld the decision of 2 september 2004 on appeal. the applicant remained in custody pending investigation and trial. the court extended his pre-trial detention on several occasions reiterating, in substance, the reasoning employed by the district court on 2 september 2004. on 4 june 2007 the district court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment.
the applicant was born in 1926 and lives in novi sad. it transpires from the judicial decisions and the case file that the explosion was caused by the covert production of composite solid rocket fuel under the auspices of the state intelligence service. its explosive characteristics depend on particle size and granulometric composition. it is a class 4 oxidiser (it can cause an explosive reaction) when particles measure over 15 micrometres. it has been apparently involved in a number of accidents. ap is stable when properly stored, transported and handled at temperatures below 150 degrees celsius (oc). at a series of meetings, an intelligence service executive had apparently agreed to the production of rocket fuel with a private company, jpl systems (hereinafter “jpl”). all those activities and the relevant documentation were to form an integral part of the incident report. on 13 september 1995 the applicant sought to be granted victim status. the experts’ report of 9 august 1995 was served on the applicant on 15 april 1996. the investigating judge endorsed the experts’ request to be provided with all questions in writing and to be given another month to answer. on 14 may 1997 the applicant amended his criminal complaint, relying on article 194 § 2 in conjunction with article 187 § 4 of the criminal code (see paragraph 76 below). the expert stated that the collected data were incomplete and did not contain quantitative figures of the samples examined to allow any deeper analysis of the collected evidence or its compliance with the account of the events that had allegedly led to the explosion. following the prosecutor’s proposal of 13 june 1998, the investigating judge heard evidence from a number of witnesses to and surviving victims of the accident (eighteen out of the nineteen were from belgrade) on ten occasions between 10 november 1998 and 15 october 1999[2]. to bring the premix to grmeč, and whether they had known what it contained and what safety measures had been taken. on 27 july 1999 and 18 february 2000 respectively the investigating judge also interviewed mr radosav lukić and mr jovica stanišić, deputy head and head of the state intelligence service. on 1 march 2000 the investigating judge returned the case file with the collected evidence to the prosecutor. the applicant appealed on 21 october 2000. the academy refused, claiming that it did not have the power to do so. it explained that it would be inappropriate to proceed with a subsidiary indictment without first carrying out an investigation, even with the investigating judge’s permission to file a direct indictment, if the suspects had never been questioned. on 29 october 2002 the investigating judge again appointed the military technical academy to draw up a report establishing in a clear and conclusive manner the cause of the explosion and which irregularities in the production process had led to the blast. in a short report drawn up in december 2002, the academy stated this time that their task was apparently to examine the cause of the explosion, not the possible failure of any of the suspects to protect those involved from the risk of explosion. the beginning of the trial was scheduled for 12 december 2003 and then for 22 march 2004, but was adjourned on both occasions by the court because it had been unable to secure the proper composition of its bench and/or some of the defendants had not been properly summoned. and adjourned to decide on further objections to the indictment. the court heard the defendants and two witnesses. on 6 july 2010, the court discontinued the proceedings against r.l. on 10 september 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal with the constitutional court (ustavni sud), complaining about the length of the criminal proceedings described above. on 14 may 2014 the belgrade court of appeal (apelacioni sud), decreased the award to rsd 300,000 (approximately eur 2,580). its vinfleks factory was apparently registered for the production of bituminous materials. jpl was registered as a privately-owned company in 1995 for other services than the production of rocket fuel.
the applicant, mr vladimir nikolayevich ruban, is a ukrainian national, who was born in 1972 and is currently serving a life sentence. on 13 august 1996 the voznesensk local prosecutor’s office in the mykolayiv region started an investigation into the murder of four persons on 12 august 1996. on 18 october 1999 the donetsk regional prosecutor’s office started investigating the murder of a. 8. on 10 november 1999 the slavyansk police department of the donetsk region started an investigation into hooliganism concerning r. 9. on 22 november 1999 the above three investigations were joined. several persons were suspected of committing the above crimes as a group, one of them being the applicant. on 14 december 1999 the donetsk regional prosecutor’s office formally charged the applicant in absentia with the above crimes. he was also placed on the list of wanted persons. the same day the investigation in respect of the applicant was suspended until he was apprehended; the criminal proceedings continued in respect of the other suspects. on 23 december 2002, the donetsk regional court of appeal convicted and sentenced g., p. and f. for the above mentioned crimes. on 2 february 2004 the slavyansk local court ordered the applicant’s detention. on 28 june 2007 the applicant was apprehended by the yartsevo prosecutor’s office in the smolensk region, russia. on 31 march 2008 the investigation was resumed after the applicant had been extradited to ukraine. the same day the applicant was formally charged with participation in an organised criminal group together with g., p., f. and two other persons, who had died in the intervening time. the applicant was accused of strangling a., of killing four persons together with g. in 1996 and inflicting grievous bodily harm on r. in a murder attempt, the latter crime in the context of the extortion of r’s brother. all these crimes had been committed as a group. on 22 may 2008 the investigation was completed and on 26 june 2008 the case was transferred to the donetsk regional court of appeal. on 10 july 2009 the court of appeal, acting as a first-instance court, found the applicant guilty of aggravated murder and banditry and sentenced him to life imprisonment. the applicant and his lawyer appealed, considering that the applicant’s guilt had not been proved. on 15 july 2010 the supreme court of ukraine upheld the judgment of 10 july 2009. on that day the applicant’s lawyer submitted an additional appeal claiming that the court of appeal had to apply the most favourable wording of the relevant provisions of the criminal code, which was that between 29 december 1999 and 29 march 2000 when the death penalty had already been abolished and life imprisonment had not yet been introduced. the supreme court in its decision noted that the applicant had been sentenced correctly.
the applicant was born in 1964 and lives in perm. the applicant’s son n. was born on 23 august 2005. it ordered compulsory psychiatric treatment for the applicant in a psychiatric hospital. on 11 may 2011 the childcare authority rejected the applicant’s request. on 16 august 2012 the dzerzhinskiy district court dismissed the application by the childcare authority and v. to deprive the applicant of his parental responsibility over n. it also dismissed the applicant’s counterclaim to end v.’s guardianship over n. and to return n. to him. in taking that decision the dzerzhinskiy district court relied on the report of a psychological examination of the child carried out on 6 july 2010 by a municipal centre for children’s psychological, medical and social adaptation. the court noted, however, that the applicant still had the possibility to communicate with n. and meet him. on 27 march 2013 the regional court upheld the above judgment on appeal. on 28 may 2012 the applicant applied to the motovilikhinskiy district court of perm (“the district court”) for contact rights. he was ready to change his place of work to be able to adapt better to his son’s schedule. he also stressed that he paid child maintenance and supported him financially. he was under psychiatric supervision and his mental health had improved. the applicant should not be allowed to see n. as it would undermine his health and psychological development. the experts were also asked to establish whether contact between n. and his father could damage n.’s health or psychological development. on 14 may 2013 the district court held a hearing. failed to appear: plaintiff, defendant, notified. [ [representative of childcare authority]: [i] consider it possible. the court ... held: continue examination of the case ...” 29. on the same day the district court dismissed the applicant’s application. the applicant often left on long business trips, which would prevent weekly meetings. in view of the incompleteness of the data [failure to examine n. in view of v.’s refusal to give the experts access to n.], the experts consider that at the present time only short meetings between [the applicant] and the child are possible (not more than two hours 2-3 times per month) in public places on condition that the child has a positive or neutral attitude towards the father. he enclosed a list of telephone calls provided by his mobile operator showing that he had not received any calls from the court. the regional court upheld the judgment of 14 may 2013, finding that it had been lawful, sufficiently reasoned and justified. it noted that an expert opinion could not be obtained because v. had avoided the experts. she noted, in particular, that the expert opinion of 17 may 2013 could not lead the court to change its findings because the experts had not been able to examine n. 35. despite the court’s decisions, the applicant resumed contact with n. over time, meeting the boy at school, and having telephone and skype conversations with him. on 23 december 2014 the applicant brought new proceedings against v., seeking to have her guardianship of n. terminated and for n. to be returned to him. the district court noted that n. lived with his maternal grandmother and guardian v. and that his housing conditions were adequate. the applicant’s housing conditions were also adequate. the applicant regularly visited n. at school.

the applicants, whose years of birth are summarised in the appendix, live in troitsko-pechorsk of the komi republic. they were municipal unitary enterprise employees working for “troitsko-pechorskoye zhkkh” («муп «троицко-печерское жкх», “the company”) in the komi republic. the company was set up in 2003 in accordance with a decision of head of the troitsko-pechorskiy district (“the district administration”) as a commercial organisation performing the following activities, among others: renovation and maintenance of the municipal housing stock; heating and water supply to the district population and enterprises; maintenance of the sewage systems; maintenance services in respect of municipal housing and adjacent territories; and providing real estate registration services in the troitsko-pechorskiy district. in order to carry out its statutory activities, the company had “the right of economic control” (право хозяйственного ведения) over the assets allocated to it by the town administration (see liseytseva and maslov v. russia, nos. 39483/05 and 40527/10, §§ 55-75, 9 october 2014 for further details on the company’s status). in 2004-2006 the district administration withdrew the company’s several assets, including “housing and objects of the engineering infrastructure” and transferred them to the municipal district treasury. on the dates tabulated in the appendix below the justice of the peace of the troitsko‑pechorskiy court circuit of the komi republic by separate judgments and court writs ordered the company to pay the applicants salary arrears. on the dates listed in the appendix the awards became enforceable. it appears from the parties’ observations of 2011 that ms lyubas (application no. 10742/09) obtained at least two other judgments in her favour which had been issued on 22 june and 2 november 2007 against the debtor enterprise. between april 2007 and september 2008 some applicants received the amounts specified in the “enforcement status” column of the appendix. the government submitted, without further details, that ms lyubas was paid 56,021 russian roubles pursuant to unspecified domestic judicial decisions in her favour. ms lyubas, interviewed in the domestic proceedings, maintained that the award of 21 december 2006 had not been paid to her. on 11 december 2006 the supervision procedure was put in place in respect of the company. on 14 may 2007 the commercial court of the komi republic declared the company insolvent and the liquidation proceedings commenced. at some point before 9 november 2007 the prosecutor’s office conducted an inquiry and, having analysed the manner of the assets’ withdrawal and transfer by the owner, concluded that the owner’s actions contained elements of deliberate bankruptcy. during the insolvency proceedings the liquidator lodged numerous actions on the company’s behalf claiming, inter alia, unpaid communal charges from local population. the amount recovered proved insufficient to settle all creditors’ claims. at some point the liquidator lodged an action on the company’s behalf against the district administration under article 56 § 3 (subsidiary liability) of the civil code of the russian federation. he argued that the insolvency of the company had been caused by the administration. he submitted that, as a result of a series of the asset transfers in 2004-2006, the company had become unable to meet the creditors’ claims and to continue to carry out its statutory goals. on 3 march 2010 the federal commercial court of the volgo‑vyatskiy circuit rejected the claim in the cassation instance, and on 12 july 2010 the supreme commercial court refused to accept for examination a request for supervisory review of that judgment. the domestic courts at all instances accepted that the assets had indeed been transferred from the company’s economic control to the district treasury. however, they found no evidence that the insolvency had been caused by the owner’s actions. the housing and objects of the engineering infrastructure on 30 january 2006 had been withdrawn “in order to apply the housing policy” and to “reduce the company’s expenses for the maintenance of the infrastructure objects”. in particular, the ministry of architecture and communal services of the komi republic had recommended the municipalities to withdraw objects of housing and engineering infrastructure from unitary enterprises in order to optimise taxes of housing and communal services providers. on 28 december 2011 the commercial court of the komi republic ordered the respondent company’s liquidation. creditors’ claims which had not been satisfied during the liquidation procedure due to the debtor’s shortage of funds, including the applicant’s claims, were considered as settled. on the same date the liquidation was recorded in the register of legal entities, and the company ceased to exist. the judgments in the applicants’ favour have remained unenforced either in full or in part, as indicated in a relevant part of the appendix below.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in vinkovci. by a judgment of 1 june 2006 the vinkovci municipal court (općinski sud u vinkovcima) ordered the applicant’s former employer, the company md profil d.o.o. ( hereinafter “the debtor company”), to pay him 20,921.18 croatian kunas (hrk)[1] as remuneration for overtime work, together with accrued statutory default interest, and hrk 19,495.90[2] in costs. on 10 march 2008 the vukovar county court (županijski sud u vukovaru) upheld the first-instance court’s judgment, which thereby became final. it sentenced him to ten months’ imprisonment, suspended for a period of two years provided that in that period he did not commit a further offence. the next day, on 15 april 2008, that court issued a writ of execution (rješenje o ovrsi) whereby it ordered the seizure of funds in the debtor company’s bank account in order to satisfy the applicant’s claim. the debtor company lodged an appeal, and on 28 august 2008 the osijek county court (županijski sud u osijeku) quashed the writ of execution and remitted the case to the first-instance court. it found that the judgment sought to be enforced had not been stamped with a certificate of enforceability and that a grace period for voluntary compliance (paricijski rok) had not been set. at the same time, he asked the court to set a grace period for voluntary compliance, pursuant to the law. on 7 november 2008 the court issued a new writ of execution. by a decision of 19 february 2009 the osijek county court dismissed the debtor company’s appeal and upheld the writ of execution. on the same day, 9 march 2009, the debtor company informed the court that it had received the above-mentioned final judgment of the criminal court and that it had executed the set-off described above (see the preceding paragraph). by a decision of 27 march 2009 the đakovo municipal court decided on the debtor company’s motion for postponement, instructing the debtor company to institute separate civil proceedings for the enforcement to be declared inadmissible (in full or in part). at the same time it postponed the enforcement pending the final outcome of those proceedings. the debtor company instituted those civil proceedings on 14 april 2009. the second-instance judgment was served on the debtor company on 11 may 2011 and on the applicant a day later. it dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance decision in the remaining part. in the resumed proceedings, by a decision of 17 june 2010 the đakovo municipal court again postponed the enforcement. on 3 february 2011 the osijek county court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against that decision and upheld it. on 24 may 2011 the applicant informed the đakovo municipal court that the judgment declaring the enforcement inadmissible in part had become final (see paragraph 17 above) and asked it to continue with the enforcement in the remaining part. by a decision of 2 june 2011 that court decided to resume the enforcement in the remaining part. by another decision of the same date that court ordered the debtor company to pay the applicant: (a) hrk 599.40[5] for unpaid overtime work, together with statutory default interest accrued since 11 march 2009, (b) hrk 19,495.90[6] in costs of civil proceedings, together with statutory default interest accrued since 1 june 2006, and (c) hrk 2,606.25[7] in costs of enforcement proceedings, together with statutory default interest accrued since 7 november 2008. this decision became final on 17 june 2011. on 20 june 2011 the court informed the domestic payments agency (financijska agencija – fina) of its second decision of 2 june 2011 (see the preceding paragraph). by a decision of 9 november 2010 the osijek county court dismissed the applicant’s request. it held that, while the case was indeed important for the applicant, the proceedings complained of were complex and he had contributed to their length in that he had not initially submitted a copy of the judgment he was seeking to enforce stamped with a certificate of enforceability (see paragraphs 8-11 above). on 25 november 2010 the applicant appealed against that decision. on 23 september 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the second-instance decision. by a decision of 12 december 2012 the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) declared inadmissible the applicant’s constitutional complaint and served that decision on his representative on 31 december 2012. it held that the contested second-instance decision was not open to constitutional review.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in košice. the applicant, the father of a child, has been involved in domestic litigation concerning numerous claims on upbringing and maintenance of the child since 1993. the present application concerns three interrelated claims brought before the čadca district court on 12 march 2003 and subsequently on 3 july and 16 december 2003. these claims were all registered under the same case file no. p 170/93 and concerned the applicant’s rights of contact with his child and his request for custody of the child. the action of 3 july 2003 related to child maintenance and had been brought by the national authority, acting as a guardian ad litem for the child. in the course of the proceedings, the district court examined extensive evidence. this included the assessment of several reports from the appointed guardian ad litem, an opinion from a psychology expert seeking to establish the circumstances of the relationship between the applicant and the child, personal and financial circumstances of the applicant, his medical condition as well as the medical reports of the child. the district court held nine hearings on the merits, out of which the applicant attended two. it also decided on an interim measure in relation to the contact between the applicant and the child, which was challenged and quashed on appeal twice. during the course of the proceeding, the applicant asked for a court fee exemption. he also lodged seven motions, by which he had challenged the judges of the district court as well as the regional court for bias. when he had challenged the judges of the latter court on ground of bias, the supreme court dealt with those motions. the district court twice ruled on the merits of the case, on 20 august 2008 and 31 march 2011 respectively. this was due to the fact that the judgment was partly upheld and party quashed on appeal on the first occasion. it also stayed the proceedings in respect of the applicant’s right to contact with his child because the child had reached the age of majority in the meantime. the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint relying on several convention as well as constitution articles. he challenged among others the length of proceedings held before the district court. on 6 october 2011 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s constitutional complaint in respect of the length of the proceedings on the ground that the matter at stake was complicated due to the three aforesaid interrelated claims. the constitutional court took into account the sensitive nature of the case and the district court’s repeated requests for an expert opinion in order to assess the best interest of the child. it also considered the applicant’s behaviour during the proceedings, his seven absences during the nine scheduled hearings, as well as his seven challenges of the domestic courts’ judges for bias, which protracted the proceedings by three years and eight months. in the light of the above, the constitutional court found no unreasonable delays in the district court’s procedure. subsequently, on 21 march 2012, the žilina regional court dealt with the applicant’s second appeal and delivered the judgment on the merits of the case, which became final on 2 april 2012. it partly upheld the district court’s judgment and partly amended it. the applicant then lodged an application for reimbursement of a court fee he had paid for one of his challenges of the judge for bias. this motion was dismissed by two levels of jurisdiction and the decision became final on 8 february 2013.
the applicants were prosecuted in russia for various crimes. they were arrested and detained while the crimes were investigated and pending trial. their detention was ordered and extended by the courts. the detention orders were essentially based on the gravity of the charges, the primary grounds being the risk of the applicants’ absconding and interfering with the course of justice. the detention and extension orders used stereotypical formulae, without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures. the first applicant was born in 1982 and was detained in irkutsk. on 23 december 2008 the first applicant, a police officer at the material time, was arrested and placed in pre-trial detention. on an unspecified date he was formally charged with banditry, kidnapping, abuse of power, robbery (four counts), preparing to commit robbery, intentionally damaging another’s property, and stealing and damaging official documents. on 19 april 2010 he, along with thirteen co-defendants, was committed for trial before the irkutsk regional court. on 7 november 2011 the irkutsk regional court convicted him of abuse of power, and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment and disqualification from holding public office for one year. the second applicant was born in 1967 and was detained in penza. on 14 february 2009 a criminal case was opened into an incident of fraud involving an apartment, which had caused damage in the amount of 440,000 russian roubles (rub). on 24 june 2009 the second applicant was arrested. on 8 june 2010 the leninskiy district court of penza found him guilty as charged and sentenced him to eleven months’ imprisonment.
the applicant was born in 1981 and lives in hotarele, vâlcea county. on 12 november 2004, in spain, the applicant gave birth to a girl. the applicant remained with her daughter in romania until september 2008 and subsequently returned to spain to work, leaving the child in romania with her maternal grandmother. no longer lived in romania and that she did not know his whereabouts. ’s whereabouts and to secure his presence in court. on 21 november 2008 the district court heard two witnesses for the applicant. it sent the case back to the district court. ’s counsel’s office on 17 may 2010 and the latter added to the case file the final report of that investigation in both bulgarian and romanian on 2 september 2010. the court also noted that on 22 december 2008 r.e.n. had instituted similar proceedings in bulgaria. the father lodged an appeal and the case was heard by the county court. informed the applicant that the said notarised consent was not sufficient for the bulgarian authorities. the applicant offered to travel to bulgaria to assist in the formalities necessary to obtain a passport. the court of appeal delivered its final ruling in the case on 9 january 2012. on 26 july 2011 her application was rejected by the district court on the ground that as at that time the child had already been living with her paternal grandparents in bulgaria for over three years, it would not be in her interests to temporarily remove her from her usual environment and place her with her mother until the end of the custody proceedings. on 30 august 2010 the applicant applied to a bulgarian enforcement officer, who brought enforcement proceedings immediately. on 20 january 2011 the enforcement officer appointed a lawyer to represent r.e.n. ’s request for the reopening of the proceedings for the recognition of the romanian judgment on custody. the supreme court of cassation found that r.e.n. ’s cassation appeal; the decision therefore became final on that date. had in the meantime brought proceedings in bulgaria for a change of custody in respect of the child. following a telephone conversation between the applicant and an employee of the romanian ministry of justice, the applicant was invited to lodge a request for the return of her daughter under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction of 25 october 1980 (“the hague convention”; see paragraph 43 below). on 26 july the ministry of justice further informed the applicant that she could request the return of her child either under the terms of the hague convention or under the terms of the brussels ii bis regulation (see paragraph 46 below). they advised her to lodge her request either directly with the competent bulgarian authority or through the romanian ministry of justice. on 12 december 2011 the romanian ministry of justice transmitted to the bulgarian ministry of justice a request lodged by the applicant under the brussels ii bis regulation, which in its view took precedence over the hague convention. unsuccessfully brought proceedings in bulgaria seeking custody of the child. brought a second set of proceedings in bulgaria before the pazardzhik district court in which he sought custody of the child. asked the court to terminate the second set of proceedings he had brought, and the court did so on 28 november 2012. in a final decision of 25 march 2013 the pazardzhik regional court granted his request, quashed the termination of those proceedings and remitted the case to the first-instance court for examination. his request was granted on 9 july 2014 (see paragraph 28 above).
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in novokuznetsk, the kemerovo region. in the morning of 14 june 2007 policemen came to the applicant’s flat and took him to the police station in pospelikha village in the altay region (“the police station”) for an interview. he was questioned about the circumstances of a theft which had occurred the day before and made self‑incriminating statements. during the questioning the investigator had to answer a telephone call and stepped out of the office. left alone, the applicant attempted to walk out but was stopped at the door by a policeman who told him to stay inside and wait. he spent around four hours in the investigator’s office before he was allowed to leave. according to the government, the applicant came to the police station voluntarily and stayed there for no longer than forty minutes. on 18 june 2007 the investigators charged the applicant with theft but dropped the charges one month later. in 2009 the applicant brought a civil claim for compensation for unlawful criminal prosecution and deprivation of liberty. on 20 october 2009 the pospelikhinskiy district court of the altay region examined the case in the applicant’s absence. the court noted that the applicant had been informed about the date and place of the hearing but, as he was serving a term of imprisonment, his presence in person could not be ensured. on the merits, the court held that the applicant was entitled to compensation for the unlawful criminal prosecution. it also considered that the questioning of 14 june 2007 had not amounted to a deprivation of liberty and could not give rise to any form of compensation. the applicant was awarded 1,000 russian roubles (rub) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. the applicant appealed against the judgment, arguing that the court award was too low and that it did not take into account the deprivation of liberty. he also requested leave to appear before the appeal court. on 10 february 2009 the altay regional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal in his absence, endorsing the district court’s reasoning. the judgment of 20 october 2009 was enforced on 5 march 2011. in 2007 ms i. brought a civil action against the applicant, seeking to recover a contractual debt. on 5 july 2007 the justice of the peace of the pospelikhinskiy district of the altay region examined the case in the applicant’s absence. the judgment indicated that the applicant was serving a term of imprisonment and that he had been informed in a timely way about the date and place of the hearing. the justice of the peace granted the claim and ordered the applicant to pay rub 11,311 to ms i. 13. the applicant appealed to the pospelikhinskiy district court and sought leave to appear before the appeal court. by an interim decision of 12 september 2007, the district court refused the applicant leave to appear, finding that the code of civil procedure did not provide for escorting detained litigants to courts hearing civil cases. on 10 october 2007 the pospelikhinskiy district court upheld the judgment on appeal, endorsing the findings of the justice of the peace. the applicant received a copy of the appeal judgement in november 2007.
the applicant was born in 1943 and lives in niš. on 28 april 2010 the applicant brought an enforcement action before the smederevo court of first instance (osnovni sud u smederevu) against a socially/state-owned company “fžv želvoz a.d. on 15 december 2010 that court ordered direct enforcement of the outstanding invoice (izvršenje na osnovu verodostojne isprave). on 15 june 2011 the privatisation agency ordered the restructuring of the debtor as part of privatisation process. on 25 october 2011 the enforcement proceedings were stayed because the debtor was undergoing restructuring. on 3 november 2011 the applicant appealed the decision to stay the enforcement proceedings. on 10 february 2012 the applicant’s appeal was rejected by the enforcement court. on 21 march 2013 the applicant urged the court to continue the enforcement proceedings. on 7 june 2013 the court informed the applicant that the debtor was still undergoing restructuring and that therefore the enforcement proceedings could not be continued. it would appear that the applicant did not appeal against this decision. on 11 january 2010 the applicant brought an enforcement action before the niš commercial court (privredni sud u nišu) against a socially/state-owned company “vagonka a.d. on 29 january 2010 that court ordered direct enforcement of the outstanding invoice. on 4 november 2009 the privatisation agency ordered the restructuring of the debtor as part of privatisation process. on 4 february 2010 the enforcement proceedings were stayed because the debtor was undergoing restructuring. the applicant did not appeal against this decision which became final on 17 february 2010. on 20 march 2013 the applicant urged the court to continue the enforcement proceedings. on 22 march 2013 the court informed the applicant that the debtor was still undergoing restructuring and that therefore the enforcement proceedings could not be continued.
the applicant was born in 1961 and lives in mississauga, canada. they continued living in canada and their son was born there in september 2010. the child obtained canadian nationality at birth. the applicant worked full time and was the sole financial provider for the family. in april 2011 the family went to poland on holiday. they agreed to return to canada in july 2011 and aeroplane tickets were purchased to this end. soon afterwards the applicant went back to canada alone. he briefly returned to poland in july 2011 when his son underwent emergency surgery. on 27 november 2012 the kielce district court decided to obtain an expert report from the family consultation centre (rodzinny ośrodek diagnostyczno-konsultacyjny “the rodk”). were invited to appear at an interview at the rodk which was scheduled for 30 november 2012. it appears that the domestic court’s decision to order the rodk report contained an instruction that the examination should go ahead whether or not the applicant was present. as a result, the report was based only on the statements of the child and his mother and on four volumes of the domestic court’s case file. had ensured the child’s security, well-being and development. and the members of both families and medical reports. the applicant did not show any interest in the child. he had also stopped paying child support and had not shown any interest in him. the hague convention stipulated only a maximum age requirement for children whose return could be sought under its provisions (the age of 16). the domestic court relied on the following elements of the case: the applicant’s son had arrived in poland with both parents at the age of six and a half months, in april 2011; since then the child had been taken care of solely by his mother; the most important element in his life was his contact with the mother; he did not have any memories of his life in canada; and the applicant had not considered the child’s remaining in poland illegal prior to october 2011. since july 2011, the applicant has visited his son once, in march 2012 during a month-long stay in poland. copies of these applications have not been submitted to the court. in the government’s submission, the applicant had not enquired about or sought contact with the child. on 23 february 2012 the applicant lodged an application with the competent domestic court for arrangements to be made to secure the effective exercise of his right of contact during the hague convention proceedings. on 2 march 2012 the kielce district court, with i.g. the details of this decision are unknown to the court. on 3 june 2014 the kielce regional court issued a decision, presumably concerning the applicant’s right of contact with his son (ic 2240/11). a copy of this decision has not been submitted by the court. to be in contempt of court for, inter alia, failing to comply with the interim order described above. no sentence was pronounced on that occasion. on 22 may 2013 the ontario superior court of justice allowed the divorce between the applicant and e.n. 30813/14, §§ 33-38 and 41-41, 1 march 2016.
at the material time all the applicants were detained in russian penal facilities. while in detention, the applicants mr baban, mr barkov and mr bogatyrev sought compensation for inadequate conditions of their detention and substandard medical care; the applicants mr davydov, mr pflyaum and mr yakovlev were involved in contract disputes; mr fedchenko was the respondent in a divorce claim; mr starodubtsev challenged the decision by which he had lost the status of a disabled person; and mr shavayev was the defendant in an action for damages brought by the federal customs service. none of the applicants, apart from mr yakovlev, were able to attend the hearings before the courts of first instance. the domestic courts refused the applicants leave to be present at the hearings, on the ground that there was no domestic legal provision for bringing detainees to courts. in some of the cases they quoted article 77.1 of the code on the execution of sentences (see paragraph 10 below) and the relevant provisions of the code of civil procedure. in the other cases the issue of the applicants’ presence was left unaddressed. in the first-instance proceedings mr shavayev and mr starodubtsev were represented by their relatives. mr barkov and mr davydov were interviewed at courts located near the places of their detention. the applicants appealed, raising the question of their appearance in court in their appeal statements. some submitted separate requests seeking leave to appear before the appeal court. the appeal courts either dismissed their arguments and endorsed the findings of the first-instance courts or concluded that their absence from court was in line with the legislation and did not contravene the principle of fairness. none of the applicants were present or represented at the appellate hearings. the dates of the final judgments are set out in appendix i.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in sofia. the applicant had been employed by the national security service as a system operator since 1981. she submitted that, on account of the nature of her duties, she had held a security clearance permitting her access to classified information constituting state secrets. according to the applicant’s job description, being in a possession of such a security clearance had been a prerequisite to her holding her post. on 30 april 2002 the classified information protection act (hereinafter “the act”) was promulgated in the state gazette. under the classified information protection act, permits granting access to classified information that had been issued under the legal provisions existing before the entry into force of the act were to remain valid until their replacement by security clearance allowing access to classified information. the heads of organisational units employing persons who possessed an access permit and whose positions required that they have access to classified information were to request the issuance of security clearance, in accordance with the requirements of the act. non-compliance with that provision would result in the invalidation of the respective existing access permits. on 3 june 2003, in compliance with that obligation, the director of the national security service issued a decision refusing the applicant security clearance allowing access to classified information. the applicant submitted that that decision had been based on a psychological test. the decision did not contain any reasoning in respect of the refusal, apart from a reference to section 57 of the classified information protection act. the applicant lodged an appeal against the refusal with the state commission for information security. the latter, by a decision of 5 february 2004, upheld the refusal. that decision was final and not amenable to judicial review. on 27 april 2004, the director of the national security service ordered that the applicant be dismissed. the reason given for the termination of her employment was the refusal to grant her security clearance, possession of which was an indispensable condition of her being able to perform her duties. the applicant challenged her dismissal at three levels of jurisdiction. she contested the objectivity and the lawfulness of the dismissal procedure, arguing that she had fulfilled all conditions for the issuance of security clearance and that she had been dismissed on account of the negative personal relationship between her and her direct supervisor. in the applicant’s view, the clearance had probably been refused because she had suffered from depressive neurosis in 1995, a condition which according to her was no longer relevant. the applicant’s request that a report by a psychiatric expert be commissioned was refused by the sofia district court. by its judgment of 11 may 2005 the sofia district court rejected the applicant’s claims, reasoning that the refusal of the director of the national security service to grant security clearance to the applicant was a final and valid administrative act, and it rendered the applicant’s dismissal inevitable because she was no longer able to perform her duties. the court added that the refusal was not amenable to any judicial review; therefore, the court was not competent to examine, within the framework of the dismissal proceedings, any substantial or procedural questions related to its lawfulness. on appeal, the sofia city court, by a ruling of 6 april 2006 upheld the lower court’s decision, endorsing its reasoning. on 19 june 2008, the supreme court of cassation upheld those rulings.
the applicants were born in 1950 and 1957 respectively and live in sofia. on 19 february 1993 the applicants, at the time a married couple, bought a plot of land of 1,000 square metres in the village of kranevo, on the black sea coast. the seller, mr o., had acquired the property in 1967 from the agricultural co-operative that existed at the time, in exchange for another plot of land of his. the applicants’ possession of the land remained undisturbed until 2003, when other persons took possession of it. the applicants discovered then that the land had been collectivised after 1945 and that in 1991 the heirs of the pre-collectivisation owner, mr k., had instituted restitution proceedings under the relevant provisions of the agricultural land act (“the ala”, see paragraph 13 below). their restitution request had been allowed in a court judgment of 7 december 1995 and in a decision issued by the competent administrative body ‒ the local agricultural land commission ‒ on 4 april 1996. thereafter, the heirs of mr k. had transferred the land to the persons who had later taken possession of the plot. on an unspecified date in 2003 the applicants brought a rei vindicatio action against these individuals. in a judgment of 25 may 2005 the balchik district court dismissed their claim. it relied on the provision of section 10(13) of the ala (see paragraph 15 below), holding on its basis that of the two rival claims to the same land the law gave priority to the one based on restitution. upon appeal, on 25 january 2007 the dobrich regional court reversed that decision and allowed the applicants’ action. it considered in particular that section 10(13) of the ala was not applicable to the case as it had only been introduced in 1997, that is to say after the restitution decision in favour of mr k.’s heirs and after the applicants had bought the plot of land. upon further appeal, in a final judgment of 12 december 2008, the supreme court of cassation quashed the regional court’s judgment and dismissed the applicants’ rei vindicatio claim. it took the view that section 10(13) of the ala, introduced in 1997, had to be considered to be applicable with effect from the ala’s entry into force in 1991 because it was merely clarifying its general restitution provisions. as to the exception contained in section 18z(3) of the regulations for the ala’s implementation, also introduced in 1997 (see paragraph 16 below), the supreme court considered it inapplicable to the case; in its view, section 18z(3) only precluded the restitution of properties which had been the subject of transactions prior to the ala’s entry into force in 1991, whereas the applicants had bought their plot in 1993.
mr shahanov, who was born in 1977, is serving a life sentence in plovdiv prison. mr palfreeman, who was born in 1986, is serving a sentence of twenty years’ imprisonment in sofia prison. in 2011, when serving his sentence in plovdiv prison, mr shahanov was sharing a cell with eight other inmates. on 24 october 2011 he made two complaints to the minister of justice: one written by him personally and one written on his behalf by his wife. in the complaints he stated, inter alia, that another inmate in his ward, x, was bragging that two prison officers, y and z, were relatives of his; was threatening and intimidating the other inmates and fomenting intrigues and tension among them; was often making unwarranted complaints to get special attention and treatment; and was planning to escape from prison with the help of his relatives. mr shahanov requested that steps be taken to move x to a prison where he did not have relatives. an inquiry was opened pursuant to mr shahanov’s complaints, and written statements were taken from x, other inmates, y, z, and other prison officers. in a letter of 28 november 2011, the head of the chief directorate for the execution of sentences informed the governor of plovdiv prison that the inquiry had not found familial relationships or improper contacts between x and any of the prison officers, or a risk for mr shahanov. on 30 november 2011 mr shahanov sought judicial review of the order. the plovdiv district court heard mr shahanov’s claim on 2 december 2011 and, in a final decision of the same date (опр. the court went on to say that the punishment matched the seriousness of the offence. mr shahanov asserted that his correspondence was routinely opened and read by the prison authorities. in support of his assertion, he submitted seven letters sent in 2012, six of which were addressed to his counsel, whose envelopes bore the stamp “checked” on their backs. for their part, the government submitted a letter from the administration of plovdiv prison according to which mr shahanov’s correspondence was being controlled in the manner envisaged in the applicable regulations, which meant that the prison authorities only checked the physical content of the letters, not their text. all letters were sealed and opened by a prison officer in front of the prisoner. the stamp “checked” affixed on the back of an envelope only meant that the letter had been physically inspected for the presence of prohibited items. on 23 may 2012 mr palfreeman was visited by two journalists. at the same time, a fellow inmate of israeli nationality also had a visitor. after the visits, mr palfreeman learned that his visitors had been treated rudely, and that his fellow inmate’s visitor had had personal items stolen from lockers in the prison where he had left them during the visit. the stolen items are a mobile telephone case, mp3 headphones, a mobile telephone battery, and a sum of money. also, the guards behaved very rudely and coarsely with the visitors, yelling at them and insulting them for no reason. could you please carry out an inquiry into the conduct of that shift, and take measures to ensure that the guards work in a disciplined way and with respect towards inmates and others.” disciplinary proceedings were opened against mr palfreeman in relation to that complaint. on 11 june 2012 a hearing took place before the prison’s disciplinary commission. there was no evidence that they had been treated rudely by prison staff either. mr palfreeman appealed to the head of the chief directorate for the execution of sentences and sought judicial review. on 14 august 2012 the head of the chief directorate for the execution of sentences dismissed the appeal. noting that the inquiry into mr palfreeman’s allegations had not confirmed any of them, he found that, by deliberately making false allegations, the applicant had committed the disciplinary offence under section 100(2)(7) of the 2009 act. the sanction fully corresponded to the nature and the gravity of his act, his attitude towards it, and his previous conduct. in a final decision of 19 july 2012 (опр.
the applicant was born in 1953 and lives in skopje. the applicant was employed by the state intelligence agency (агенција за разузнавање, “the employer”). on 28 february 2001 she was dismissed from work as redundant given that internal regulations (правилник за систематизација на работните места, “the regulations”) of 27 february 2001 provided for reduced number of employees for posts such as the post held by the applicant. on 9 april 2001 the applicant challenged her dismissal before the skopje court of first instance (“the first-instance court”). after three remittal orders, on 29 november 2005 the first-instance court dismissed the applicant’s claim, finding that she had been dismissed on 28 february 2001 on the basis of the regulations, which had been adopted by the employer and approved by the government on 27 february 2001. it further found that the government’s approval had been received by the employer on 2 march 2001, but that had been irrelevant given that it was only the date when approval had been given by the government that was important for the entry into force of the regulations. on 14 december 2005 the applicant appealed, arguing inter alia that the regulations could not have applied to her case, as it could only be adopted after the employer had received the government’s approval. the applicant relied on another final judgment of the skopje court of appeal (“the appellate court”) in a similar case concerning a former colleague of the applicant, in which it had been established that the regulations had not entered into force at the time of the dismissal (see paragraph 17 below). she contended that under the relevant law (see paragraph 16 below) the regulations could only be adopted after the government’s approval had been obtained. on 23 february 2006 the appellate court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. it found that the government had approved the regulations on 27 february 2001, that they had entered into force the same day, and that the applicant’s dismissal of 28 february 2001 was therefore lawful. on 7 april 2006 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the supreme court. in it she argued, inter alia, that the regulations could only be adopted after the government’s approval had been obtained, and that they had thus not entered into force at the time of her dismissal. she referred to the earlier judgment of the appellate court (see paragraph 17 below), and argued that it had deviated from its established practice on the matter without providing any reasons. she further contended that the dismissal of her former colleagues, which had been based on the same grounds, had been quashed and they had been reinstated to their posts. on 25 october 2007 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law. it found that on 27 february 2001 the government had approved the regulations, which had thus entered into force the same day. on 15 january 2008 the applicant was served with the supreme court’s judgment.
the applicant was born in 1994 and lives in bidovce. the perpetrators of the mugging were not known to him. the boy and his parents subsequently reported the incident to the local county police. the parties dispute the circumstances of the arrest. the applicant, for his part, denied that he had shown any resistance or that the police had used any measures of restraint. the applicant and his companions were then taken to the county police station. as to the rooms in which they were kept, these were used as offices, were fitted out with the usual office equipment and were not furnished as detention cells. however, the decision was not implemented as no room was available in such a facility within a reasonable distance. subsequently, a legal-aid lawyer was appointed for the applicant and a copy of the document containing the charges was sent to, inter alia, the child protection services. no mention was made of any ill‑treatment. according to the government, the cell was equipped with, inter alia, a washbasin and drinkable water from the tap. there was no mention of any ill-treatment. according to the applicant, her complaint was not registered and she was orally advised to submit it in written form. the applicant also submitted that he had been subjected to slapping in the face and on the head until he had confessed. the persons inflicting that treatment had worn uniforms. throughout the entire time in police custody, the applicant had had to stand, without being allowed to sit or lie down, and he had not been given any food or water. the applicant submitted a medical report dated 19 december 2010. the doctor who issued the report observed that the applicant had “allege[d] that he had been beaten by police officers the day before” and “had received a slap on the right half of a cheek”. his injury could therefore not be explained as the cis had done. he had not complained of the ill-treatment before the investigator because nobody had asked him about it and because he had been concerned about possible repercussions. the pps fully endorsed the findings of cis, considering as crucial the fact that before the doctor on 19 december 2010 the applicant had only alleged slapping, that the doctor’s observations on the applicant’s injury did not correspond to the applicant’s subsequent allegation of sustained beating, and that the applicant had not raised any ill-treatment allegation with the investigator on 19 december 2010. without any explanation, the pps also concluded that there was no indication of any racial motive behind the treatment complained of by the applicant. on 10 april 2012 the constitutional court rejected the complaint as manifestly ill-founded. 74832/01, §§ 57-63, 14 december 2010); v.c. 18968/07, §§ 78-84 and 146-49, 8 november 2011); and koky and others v. slovakia (no. the european commission against racism and intolerance (ecri): report (fifth monitoring cycle) of 19 june 2014 on slovakia (cri[2014]37) 33. ecri reiterates its recommendation that... the slovak authorities provide for a body which is independent of the police and prosecution authorities, entrusted with the investigation of alleged cases of racial discrimination and misconduct by the police. european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment: report of 25 november 2014 on its visit to slovakia in 2013 (cpt/inf [2014] 29) 34. the alleged ill-treatment mostly consisted of slaps, punches and kicks to various parts of the body. in one case, the head of a detained juvenile was allegedly repeatedly banged against a wall by a police officer during questioning, apparently in an attempt to extract a confession.
the applicant was born in 1991 and lives in vladivostok. he lived in the town of osh in kyrgyzstan. on 4 july 2010 the applicant arrived in russia. on 12 july 2010 the applicant’s name was put on a national wanted list, and on 16 september 2010 on an international wanted list. on 23 january 2014 the applicant was apprehended in vladivostok, primorsk region, and placed in detention. shortly after his arrest, the applicant gave an explanation (объяснение) in which he admitted having participated in the beating of one of the law-enforcement officers in june 2010 but denied his involvement in other crimes for which he was to be prosecuted in kyrgyzstan. on 24 january 2014 the frunzenskiy district court of vladivostok decided to remand the applicant in custody. his detention was subsequently extended several times. on 16 january 2015 a judge of the primorsk regional court extended the applicant’s detention until 23 july 2015. the applicant’s lawyer appealed, arguing that the applicant would be deprived of judicial review of his detention for a long period of time. on 11 february 2015 the primorsk regional court upheld the extension order on appeal. on 27 july 2015 the applicant was released. it appears that the applicant is currently at large. on 11 february 2014 the kyrgyz general prosecutor’s office requested the applicant’s extradition. the request was accompanied by assurances that the applicant would not be subjected to torture or inhuman treatment and that russian diplomats would be granted the opportunity to visit him. on 17 october 2014 the deputy prosecutor general granted the extradition request submitted by the kyrgyz authorities. on 6 november 2014 the applicant appealed, arguing that as an ethnic uzbek charged with serious crimes in relation to the mass disorders of june 2010 he would face a serious risk of torture and ill-treatment if extradited. he also referred to the principle of non‑refoulement of asylum seekers pending the examination of his application for refugee status. on 12 december 2014 the primorsk regional court rejected his appeal in the light of the diplomatic assurances given by the kyrgyz authorities and the improvement of the situation in kyrgyzstan. on 25 march 2015 the supreme court rejected the applicant’s appeal and the extradition order became final. for instance, on 30 and 31 july 2014 russian diplomats had visited some such detainees, who had made no complaints in relation to their transfer, detention, prosecution or treatment. in the supreme court’s view, such a monitoring mechanism was effective in observing compliance by the kyrgyz authorities with their obligations to ensure the rights of the extradited persons, including the right not to be subjected to torture and inhuman treatment. the supreme court noted that the applicant belonged to a vulnerable group whose members were at risk of being subjected to torture by the law‑enforcement agencies, according to international reports. it considered, however, that in the absence of specific evidence submitted by the applicant that he would personally be subjected to torture or inhuman and degrading treatment, these circumstances were not in themselves enough to reject an extradition request, since he had been charged with ordinary criminal offences to some of which he had confessed on 23 january 2014. on 7 february 2014 the applicant applied to the primorsk region department of the federal migration service (управление федеральной миграционной службы по приморскому краю) (hereinafter the “primorsk region fms”) seeking refugee status. although it referred in its decision to inter‑ethnic conflicts existing in kyrgyzstan, it considered that the applicant’s arrival in russia had rather been motivated by the unemployment situation existing in his country of origin and his wish to escape from criminal prosecution. the applicant appealed to the federal migration authority, (федеральная миграционная служба (фмс)) (hereinafter the “fms”). he claimed that he was being persecuted on the grounds of his ethnic origin and, if extradited, would be subjected to torture. on 13 november 2014 the basmannyy district court of moscow upheld the refusal of the fms to grant the applicant refugee status, referring in particular to his protracted failure to apply for refugee status. it also indicated that the applicant was not a member of any political, religious, military or public organisation, had neither served in the army nor taken part in any military activities, had never been prosecuted or threatened by the authorities, and had not been involved in any violent incidents.
the applicant was born in 1969 and lives in kovel. she was diagnosed with acute enterocolitis with concomitant illnesses. at 3.45 p.m. her condition aggravated, and acrocyanosis of the lips and nose were noted. at 4 p.m. the resuscitation specialists performed artificial pulmonary ventilation and cardiac massage. at 5.40 p.m. the doctors stated that the applicant’s daughter had died. on 9 september 2003 the applicant complained to the kovel inter‑district prosecutor’s office (“the prosecutor’s office”) about the death of his daughter in hospital. on 19 september 2003 the prosecutor’s office, having conducted a pre-investigation inquiry, decided not to institute criminal proceedings against the doctors of the hospital for lack of corpus delicti. the next day that decision was quashed by the supervising prosecutor and further inquiry was ordered. the experts considered that the principal cause of death was the nature and seriousness of the illnesses, which had caused the patient’s brain to swell. if her family had sought medical aid in due time, her life and health prognosis could have been more favourable. on 24 july 2008 dr g. was charged with the offences of failure to provide medical aid to a patient by a medical practitioner and violation of the right to free medical aid. on 7 august 2008 the investigation was completed. the case was referred to the court for trial. on 5 november 2008 the turiysk district court returned the case to the prosecutor’s office stating that the prosecutor had not complied with procedural requirements when submitting the case file to the court. on 8 january 2009 the prosecutor’s office decided that additional investigative steps should be carried out in the case. on 30 march 2009 the turiysk district court committed dr g. for trial. on 26 october 2009 the turiysk district court found that on 27 august 2003 dr g. had committed the offence of failing to provide the applicant’s daughter with medical aid. it also released her from any punishment due to the expiry of the time-limit for criminal responsibility. the applicant and the prosecutor appealed against that judgment. on 23 february 2010 the volyn regional court of appeal upheld the judgment of 26 october 2009 as regards dr g.’s partial acquittal. as regards her conviction, it stated that the trial court had failed to specify the punishment from which she had been released. the court of appeal therefore quashed the judgment in that part and remitted the case to the trial court for fresh consideration. on 30 june 2010 the turiysk district court held that dr g. was guilty of failing to provide medical aid to the applicant’s daughter. it found that between 3.45 p.m. and 4 p.m. on 27 august 2003 she had failed to carry out artificial respiration and cardiac massage and that those failures had reduced the chances of success of the resuscitation measures carried out subsequently by the other doctors. the court sentenced dr g. to a fine and a three-year ban on medical practice. it nevertheless released her from that punishment due to the expiry of the time-limit for criminal responsibility. on 24 september 2010 the volyn regional court of appeal upheld that judgment. dr g. was admitted to the proceedings as a third party. on 18 april 2012 the volyn regional court of appeal upheld the decision of 7 march 2012. on 25 may 2012 the higher specialised court for criminal and civil matters refused the applicant leave to appeal in cassation against these decisions.
the applicants, a married couple and their son, were born in 1964, 1965 and 2000 respectively. the applicants were brought up in baghdad. on 26 october 2004 the first applicant was the target of a murder attempt carried out by al-qaeda. there, unknown men asked for him, after which he was treated in three different hospitals. his brother was released through bribery a few days later and immediately fled from iraq. the applicants fled to jordan and stayed there until december 2006, before returning to iraq. in october 2008 the first applicant and his daughter were shot at when driving. the first applicant’s business stocks were attacked four or five times by al-qaeda members, who had threatened the guards. the son (the third applicant) had spent most of his time indoors for fear of attacks and had only attended school for his final examinations. the applicants maintained that, in the event of their return to iraq, they risked persecution by al-qaeda and that the first applicant appeared on al-qaeda’s death list. on 25 august 2011 the first applicant applied anew for asylum and a residence permit in sweden, as did the other applicants on 19 september 2011. the applicants were assisted by state-appointed counsel. during the past few years the police authorities have taken numerous measures to fight against corruption, clan and militia connections and pure criminality within the police. one of the reasons is probably that many police officers are relatively new and lack experience, and that it takes time to introduce a new method of investigation based on technical evidence. nevertheless, the current country information shows that the number of suspects who have been prosecuted during the past few years has increased significantly. instances of police infiltration, which were previously widespread, have decreased significantly. the current country information also shows that it has become more difficult for al-qaeda iraq to operate freely in iraq and that there has been a significant decline in sectarian violence. during this period they were not exposed to any direct abuses. [ in those cases in which the alleged risk of persecution or other abuses does not emanate from the authorities, which as a rule is the case in iraq, the applicant must show what efforts he or she has made to be afforded protection by the authorities. the applicant can do this either by relying on evidence or by giving a credible account of events which appear plausible. the first applicant] has stated that the iraqi authorities lack the capacity to protect the family. against the background of the fact that [the first and second applicants] have not even tried to seek the protection of the iraqi authorities, the migration agency considers that they have not made a plausible case that they would not have access to protection by the authorities in the event of potential threats from al-qaeda upon returning to iraq. the migration agency notes in this context that there is no armed conflict in iraq. the migration agency notes that fierce tensions between opposing factions are prevalent in baghdad. they had contacted the police following the fire to their home and the first applicant’s business stock in 2006 and 2008 and the murder of the first and second applicants’ daughter in 2008, but thereafter they had not dared to contact the authorities owing to the risk of disclosing their residence. the migration agency made submissions before the migration court. therefore, an individual assessment of the grounds for protection invoked by the applicants must be made. on 29 august 2012 the applicants submitted an application to the migration agency for a re-examination of their case. they maintained that the first applicant was under threat from al-qaeda because he had been politically active. on 26 september 2012 the migration agency refused the applicants’ application.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in narva, estonia. called an ambulance to the police station at the request of the applicant. he was diagnosed with concussion and being in a state of alcoholic intoxication. the findings on examination were that he had a haematoma around the left ear, an oedema in the area of the left eye, and was in a state of alcoholic intoxication. on 13 may 2009 the applicant made a statement to the police investigator and gave his account of events (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above). to cuff the applicant’s hands behind his back as the applicant was still putting up physical resistance. the officers therefore kept the applicant on the ground until the police van arrived to transport him to the police station. the person had attempted to stand up, but had not been allowed to do so as he had been knocked off his feet. the applicant’s hands were put behind his back and he was handcuffed, lifted onto his feet and moved towards the van. he was put in the van and taken to the police station. he gave a statement against the applicant because he was afraid as he had seen how the police officer had beaten his friend. on 18 may 2009 the police investigator also took a statement from p.s., he explained that when he had arrived at work at 8 p.m. on 29 april 2009 officer e.v. had told him that the person who had been put in a temporary detention cell, that is, the applicant, might request that an ambulance be called and that he should be checked from time to time. asked who had beaten the applicant, he replied that it had been the police officers who had taken him to the police station. when the applicant calmed down a little, he was taken to another room to take his statement and was put on a chair with his hands still handcuffed behind his back. two other officers, who had arrived by car, helped the first police officer to cuff the applicant’s hands behind his back. when the applicant reached the officers, e.v. further stated that at the police station the applicant shouted that the police were beating him, while s.b. held his feet and hands, while another officer knelt on the applicant to keep his head down. the applicant constantly resisted the officers, used bad language and behaved aggressively. stated that he did not get out of the van. he did not hear the applicant banging against anything while he was being put in the van. on 9 june 2009 the police investigator took a statement from d.r., he had called the police after seeing the young men and the knife as he considered them to be clearly dangerous and was worried about the safety of passers-by. on 2 september 2009 the forensic expert gave an oral statement to the police investigator about his written opinion. he requested that he be sent a copy of any expert reports if one had been carried out without his knowledge. sounds from the transportation compartment made it seem like the applicant had hit himself against something. who had said during the presentation of the identification photos that there had been no beating at the playground, that the applicant’s hands had simply been forced behind his back and that he had been forced to the ground. the state prosecutor’s office was of the view that the applicant had a duty of diligence regarding his mail because he knew that there were proceedings pending where decisions concerning his situation might be made.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in i̇zmir. at the time of the events giving rise to this application, the applicant was working as a watchman on a construction site located in the vicinity of a military compound housing the 7th gendarmerie commando regiment in foça, i̇zmir. while walking towards his friends, the applicant suddenly collapsed for an unknown reason; his friends immediately took him to hospital. however, a lung x-ray taken subsequently showed that a foreign object, which appeared to be a bullet, was lodged between his eleventh and twelfth ribs. the applicant was transferred to the karşıyaka state hospital to receive further treatment for serious injuries sustained to his lungs and liver. according to a medical report issued on 30 december 2008 by the karşıyaka state hospital, it had been decided for medical reasons to leave the bullet inside the applicant’s body, to be extracted only in the event of deterioration in the applicant’s condition. at 2.30 a.m. on 15 october 2008 two gendarme officers from the crime scene investigation unit of the menemen provincial gendarmerie command arrived at the site of the incident, which was located by a farm by the name of “dürüs” (“the dürüs farm”), to carry out a preliminary investigation and to prepare a scene-of-incident report (on the instructions of the foça public prosecutor). no gunshots had been heard at the site of the incident, but a firing practice had been underway at the relevant time at the nearby military compound housing the 7th gendarmerie commando regiment. the altitude of the dürüs farm was forty metres. there were three hills between the dürüs farm and the first shooting range; the first two hills had an altitude of fifty-five metres, and the third hill had an altitude of ninety metres. firing practice was carried out with g3 rifles at the first shooting range and with 5.56 mm rifles at the second shooting range. at approximately 10.15 a.m. on 15 october 2008 the foça public prosecutor visited the site of the incident together with a police expert, h.ö. according to the information provided by the applicant’s three friends to the public prosecutor, the applicant had collapsed right before their eyes and there had been no one else present at the relevant time. it is not clear whether this office was located inside the hospital or outside. then, all of a sudden, he had felt a sharp pain in his back and had collapsed to the ground. the applicant also stated that he did not wish to press charges against anyone regarding the incident. having regard to the witness statements, and to the absence of any other factors that might explain the applicant’s injury, the police expert opined that the injury had probably been caused by a bullet that had ricocheted during the firing practice at the military compound. he submitted a simple sketch map of the site of the incident along with his report. on 13 november 2008 the i̇zmir criminal police laboratory issued a report on the analysis carried out on the applicant’s jacket. the applicant was reminded of his right to request the assistance of a lawyer, which he once again declined to do. the applicant largely reiterated the statement he had made to the gendarme officers earlier. he also repeated that he did not want to press charges against any particular person, as he did not believe that he had been shot intentionally. he did, however, reserve his right to claim compensation. on 24 november 2008 the foça public prosecutor delivered a decision not to prosecute. since the prosecution of the offence of causing bodily harm through negligence required a formal complaint to be made by the victim (which was lacking in the instant case), the foça public prosecutor decided to close the investigation. there had also not been an attempt to establish whether the bodily harm had been caused through negligence, recklessness, lack of experience or breach of duty or with intent. this decision was served on the applicant on 20 may 2009. the criminal investigation into the incident had been closed on account of the applicant’s decision not to bring an official complaint, and the bullet extracted from his body after the closing of the investigation had therefore not been subjected to a ballistic examination. in the administrative court’s opinion, the applicant had thus not proved his allegations. on 22 october 2015 the supreme administrative court upheld the judgment of the i̇zmir administrative court.
the applicant was born in 1983 and lives in chisinau. on 14 august 2009 he was involved in an accident with a car in which no one was injured. according to the findings of the police, the driver of the other vehicle involved in the accident, p.c., had changed lanes without paying attention to the applicant’s bus, which had been overtaking it in the other lane. the applicant had not had enough time to brake and had hit p.c. on the same date the chief inspector of the traffic police issued a decision finding p.c. responsible for the accident under article 242 § 1 of the traffic code (see paragraph 12 below), fined him 800 moldovan lei (mdl) (the equivalent of 50 euros (eur)) and gave him five penalty points. by a judgment of 29 september 2009 the anenii noi district court dismissed p.c. ’s objection and upheld the decision of the chief inspector of the traffic police. the applicant was not involved in the proceedings. and the police officer who had been present at the site of the accident were present and the latter opposed p.c. challenged the district court’s decision. on 19 november 2009, the bender court of appeal reversed the decision of the first-instance court, finding the applicant guilty of causing the accident. the court found that the applicant had not kept a safe distance between his bus and the vehicle in front of him and stated as follows:
“... according to article 49 of the route code, the driver of a vehicle shall keep a safe distance between his vehicle and the vehicle in front of him, in such a manner as to avoid collision in case of sudden braking by the foregoing vehicle. these rules were not observed by the driver of the vehicle which was behind, namely by the driver of the bus [...], mr igor pascani, and by no means by mr p.c.” the applicant was again not involved in the proceedings and only found out about them at a later date. under domestic law he was not able to challenge the court of appeal’s decision. as a result of the above judgment and based on its conclusions, on 22 january 2010 the chief inspector of the traffic police issued a new decision by which he found the applicant guilty of the breach of article 49 of the traffic code causing the accident of 14 august 2009. the operative part of the decision stated as follows:
“...pascari igor is declared guilty of having committed the offence provided by article 242 § 1 of the code of administrative offences (cao), however, according to article 30 § 3 of the cao no sanction shall be applied in view of the statutory limitation period.” it appears from the documents submitted by the parties that following the accident the owner of the bus recovered the cost of its repairs from p.c. after the judicial proceedings in which the applicant was found responsible, p.c. attempted to recover the cost of the repairs of his car from the other party’s insurance company. however, it appears from the case file that the company suspended payment until the case has been finally determined by the court.
the applicant is a company limited by shares registered under hungarian law. on 31 may 2000 a property claim was brought against the applicant requesting it to pay mandate fees in the amount of 275 million hungarian forints (huf) (approximately 1,057,000 euros (eur) at the time). on 6 june 2000 the budapest regional court ordered the applicant, under section 187(1) of act no. liii of 1994 on court execution, to deposit on the bailiff’s trust account a security in the amount of huf 275 million. the applicant appealed against the decision but this was to no avail. the money was deposited on the bailiff’s trust account on 27 march 2001. under the law, such deposits yield no interest. the applicant requested to have the money released arguing that its financial situation was satisfactory, there was no need for such a deposit and that this measure contradicted the principle of economic rationality. the applicant’s request was dismissed on 8 may 2001. the supreme court as second-instance court upheld the decision on 8 november 2001. the applicant’s subsequent requests to have the money released, in exchange for other securities offered, were also turned down. after remittals on 27 november 2002 and 8 june 2007, on 16 october 2008 the regional court adopted a judgment, partly found for the plaintiff and ordered the applicant to pay huf 137,280,000 (eur 514,000 at the actual rate) plus interest accrued as of 6 january 2000. on 16 october 2009 and 29 april 2010, respectively, the budapest court of appeal and the kúria upheld this judgment. although the plaintiff succeeded only partly in the litigation, the amount actually payable by the applicant exceeded the amount of the entire deposit. this outcome was the consequence of the fact that whilst the applicant was ordered to pay accrued interest on the money due to the plaintiff in the amount of approximately huf 189,500,000 (eur 700,000 at the actual rate), its own money deposited on the bailiff’s trust account had yielded no interest. ultimately, the applicant had to surrender the whole deposit and pay about another huf 90 million (eur 330,000). the applicant challenged the impugned provisions of act no. liii of 1994 on court execution before the constitutional court; but its constitutional complaint was dismissed on 7 june 2011. this court held that ‘interest’ as such was consideration for the ‘use’ of another person’s money; however, the authorities had not in any way ‘used’ the deposited amount. furthermore, the constitution did not provide any safeguards against the depreciation of an asset, including a deposit of money subject to inflation, and that such depreciation for economical or other reasons did not amount to a deprivation of property.
the applicant was born in 1944 and lives in sliema. by a deed of partition of 30 april 1980 the property was assigned to the applicant as sole owner. in 1976 the property was requisitioned and allocated to p.s. in 1987 the applicant became aware that on an unspecified date p.s. who had no title to it (since it had not been allocated to him by the authorities). obtained a development permit to carry out alteration work to the property. the work was carried out without the consent of the applicant, as owner. that amount was increased to mtl 80 (approximately eur 185) in 2010 or thereabouts. according to the government, the applicant has never requested such payment from the authorities. he requested the court to find that the requisition orders had breached his rights under article 1 of protocol no. consequently, he sought to annul the order, and requested the release of the property in his favour with free and vacant possession. lastly, his first request to the court was to the effect that the court should “declare the abovementioned requisition ... as being in breach ...” and his second request read “to annul all requisition order issued against the applicants” (tannulla l-ordni ta’ rekwizzjoni kollha rilevanti maħrugin kontra tagħhom). according to the government, when giving evidence in court on 30 november 2009, the applicant mentioned the deed of partition of 30 april 1980. at the same time he acknowledged that he did not contest the requisition order issued in 1976 (no record of this has been provided). according to a report of 21 january 2010 the expert considered that the annual rental value of the property on the market in 1987 was mtl 249 (approximately eur 580), and that in 2010 it was mtl 1,223.50 (approximately eur 2,850). its sale market value was estimated at eur 95,000. by a judgment of 14 july 2011 the civil court (first hall), in its constitutional jurisdiction, found in favour of the applicant. suffered from a physical disability and lived on social benefits. the court held that given that the violation had arisen solely from a lack of fair balance, it was not necessary to annul the requisition order and release the property. the court awarded the applicant eur 21,000. had paid the housing authority mtl 40 per year and it was only recently (sic.) he also complained that the compensation was far too low and had not been determined in accordance with the applicable market value. he further argued that the attorney general had been the correct defendant given that the amount of rent depended on the law, which in consequence was also an issue in the case. it does not transpire from the written pleadings that the applicant explicitly raised the issue of compensation in relation to the years before 1988, during which he had already been an owner of the property. the housing authority and the attorney general also appealed. and before which he had had no ties with it. the constitutional court also refused to annul the order, given that it had been issued lawfully and had pursued a legitimate aim. the same had also been held by the european court of human rights. compensation in cases of a constitutional nature was not equivalent to civil damage, which could be pursued before the courts of ordinary jurisdiction. the constitutional court further confirmed that the proper defendant was solely the housing authority, and not the attorney general, as the applicant was not contesting the constitutional validity of the law itself, but solely the requisition order issued in respect of his property.
the applicants are owners of a house at 4, wagon street, rabat, malta, which they inherited from their late father in 1997. it is a corner house with an area of around 82 square metres. broke into the house and started to live there, with his family, without legal title. attempted to validate his position by soliciting the authorities to take action. 1031) under the housing act, chapter 125 of the laws of malta, in respect of the property. the authorities assigned the property to c.c. that case was withdrawn due to a clerical mistake in the name of the complainant. on 8 june 1988, pending a judgment by the ordinary court concerning the eviction, the maltese government again requisitioned the property, under an order carrying the same reference as the first requisition (no. the rent fixed by the authorities amounted to approximately 35 euros (eur) annually. as a tenant, in order to avoid prejudicing their case. the estimate was, however, based on the premise that the expert had only seen the property from the outside and had relied on the applicants’ descriptions. a government expert (who acceded to the property) valued it at a sale price of eur 153,000. the impugned restrictions did not apply to leases entered into after 1 june 1995. they lodged an action against the director of social housing. they further asked the court to order the release of the property free and unencumbered or, if that were not possible, to establish fair conditions in respect of the property and a fair rent for the future. lastly, they asked the court to give any other orders or directions to ensure that their fundamental rights were respected. furthermore, the applicants had no other remedies available to them. 1 to the convention in so far as the applicants had been affected by the measure for numerous years during which they had been owed only eur 35 annually. the court also expressed doubts as to the public interest of the measure. the court considered that it had the power and the duty to take such action under article 4 (2) of the european convention act (see relevant domestic law), in order to bring an end to the consequences of the violation suffered by the applicants. the situation would persist in the absence of legislative intervention. the defendants appealed both in respect of the preliminary pleas and on the merits. according to the applicants, before the constitutional court they orally invited the president of the constitutional court to withdraw from hearing the case (on the basis of article 734 of the code of organisation and civil procedure). however, according to the applicants, the president of the constitutional court refused to withdraw. this situation had lasted for more than twenty-two years. according to the applicants, on an unspecified date, c.c. with alternative housing, which she moved into. the applicants claimed that the above information had come to their attention in january 2014. they had therefore filed a judicial protest objecting to the conduct of the authorities and l.b. ’s unlawful occupation of their property.
the applicant was born in 1932 and lives in domitrovec. in the ensuing two sets of criminal proceedings instituted by i.m. hrk 2,660[2] for the costs of the proceedings. in subsequent civil defamation proceedings which i.m. instituted against the applicant, the civil courts also found in favour of the plaintiff and awarded him damages. the property in question consisted of the house, a yard and arable land (fields) measuring 150, 500 and 204 square meters respectively (hereinafter “the property”). on 10 march 2008 and 2 june 2009 the varaždin county court dismissed appeals lodged by the applicant and upheld the writs. by a decision of 18 march 2010 the municipal court joined the two sets of enforcement proceedings. at a hearing on 8 april 2010 the court, on the basis of information provided by the tax authorities, determined that the value of the applicant’s share in the property was hrk 131,200[7]. since he did not do so, on 12 january 2011 i.m. asked the court to schedule a second public auction. reiterated his request for a second auction and stated that, by repeatedly promising to gradually pay the debt within self-imposed deadlines he did not observe, the applicant was merely protracting the enforcement proceedings which had thus far lasted three and a half years. this was the minimum price allowed by law and corresponded to one-third of its value. on 21 march 2011 the applicant paid hrk 21,450[11] of the debt. it specified that the property would be surrendered (transferred) to i.m. after he deposited the purchase price, within three months of the decision becoming final. had been adopted earlier, on 17 march 2011 (see paragraph 21 above). it noted however that the fact that the applicant had paid off the debt would be taken into account when distributing the proceeds of sale (see paragraph 32 below). had got it both ways” as he had both been paid the debt and acquired the share in the property. there had been no reason to sell his share in the property to pay the same debt. by a ruling of 24 april 2012 (zaključak o predaji, see paragraph 51 below) the municipal court surrendered (transferred) the applicant’s share in the property to i.m. on 17 september 2012 the municipal court issued a distribution decision (rješenje o namirenju, see paragraph 54 below), distributing the hrk 43,734[14] deposited with the court by i.m. for the applicant’s share in the property. on 14 december 2012 the county court dismissed an appeal by the applicant against that decision. an appeal by the applicant against that decision was dismissed by the county court on 26 march 2013. instituted non-contentious proceedings in the municipal court against the applicant’s wife by lodging a petition for partition of co-ownership. to institute separate civil proceedings against her to that end. he sought a partition of co-ownership in the same way as in his petition of 23 may 2013. he explained that the applicant had remained living in the house even after he acquired the applicant’s share. these proceedings are still pending before the first-instance court.
she is the paternal grandmother of the second applicant, who was born in 1997. as a result of the crash, seventy‑seven people died and over 290 sustained injuries. stationed in mirgorod, as the aerobatic performance director. the commission also established that v.t. he made a technical mistake in its performance and, as the second pilot did not intervene when appropriate, the pilots lost control of the aircraft and it started falling. the tragedy was also the result of the absence of a system of effective supervision of the execution of orders ... by the respective air force officials – from its commander-in-chief to the members of the crew of the su-27. the 14th corps commander) and his subordinates, in particular major-general a.t. had had no relevant experience or clearance for such a mission. the mayor, having learned of the military authorities’ initiative to organise the air show, took little action to coordinate the relevant preparatory activities. it also recognised that the organisation of the air show had been marked by significant shortcomings, including an unsatisfactory land and air safety precautions plan; refusal to arrange at least one training flight for the crew over the sknyliv aerodrome; and poor supervision by the air force headquarters and the 14th corps command of the preparatory activities. in addition, colonel‑general v.s., the air force commander-in-chief, was also dismissed from the military service on disciplinary grounds, and the new air force commander-in-chief was instructed to impose disciplinary sanctions on “other officers guilty of breaches of duty during the preparation and staging of the air show”. in addition, the report featured an assessment of v.t. ’s piloting techniques by s., a civil aviation pilot, who had lost family members at the sknyliv air show. of the air force headquarters was at variance with the aircraft specifications. on 15 april 2003 the group produced its report, in which it concurred with the earlier findings made by the special commission and other entities concerning the principal causes of the accident. on 2 june 2003 the prosecutor’s office solicited an opinion from two other experts, both retired ussr air force officers, who at the material time had been on the staff of the air force scientific centre for combat application, to clarify the matters in dispute and other questions. on 11 june 2003 the investigation obtained a conclusion by these two experts, in which they reported of numerous shortcomings in the air show organisation. who directed the flight, had the proper clearance, experience, and qualifications; and there was no assessment of the quality of the first pilot’s piloting technique during the training flight in ozerne on 24 july 2002. 249 of the deputy minister of defence on 25 december 1998 (настанова по виконанню польотів в авіації збройних сил україни, нвп-99); air force navigation service guidelines of the armed forces of ukraine, enacted by order no. proposed six other candidates in their stead. in the group, having found that they were sufficiently independent. during the trial, the defendants pleaded innocent of any wrongdoing. having been appointed to this position created by order of the 14th corps commander, he had developed his own reference document listing his duties for the commander’s approval and had done his best in performing them. however, having been told that the relevant parameters had been approved by the higher command and it was too late to change anything, he had executed the orders of his superiors and directed the flight as best he could. the first pilot) alleged, in particular, that during the flight the aircraft had become uncontrollable due to forces beyond his control. lacking a body of relevant legislation and regulations, the air force command had been obliged to develop specific documents adapting the military training rules for this purpose before planning the show. on 23 june 2005, contemporaneously with the verdict in the “performers’ case”, the court awarded each applicant uah 50,000 in non‑pecuniary damage, to be paid by the ministry of defence. they presented a copy of the decision of the bailiffs’ service dated 28 december 2012 terminating the enforcement proceedings, in view of the fact that the judgment had been duly enforced. these judgments were not appealed against and became final. they submitted that the debt under the first judgment amounted to the hryvnia equivalent of 7,786.27 euros (eur) at the time of the exchange of observations between the parties.
the applicant was born in 1945 and lives in riga. in the summer of 2007 a book called “kitchen of litigation” (tiesāšanās kā ķēķis) was published, which contained transcripts of allegedly authentic telephone conversations between the lawyers of a well‑known law office in latvia and judges working in various courts, including the senate of the supreme court. the judiciary’s allegedly unlawful and unethical behaviour provoked considerable public debate and attracted wide media coverage. the supreme court and the prosecutor general’s office launched an inquiry (pārbaude). on 17 september 2007 the supreme court established a working group consisting of five judges. on 8 october 2007 the working group received transcripts of the alleged telephone conversations from the prosecutor general’s office. on 7 november 2007, during the annual conference of judges, the chairman of the supreme court made a speech about the effects of the book and the public debate which followed. he stated:
“more than two months have passed since information emerged about alleged telephone conversations between judges and a particular lawyer. that event further confirmed the conviction of at least some people in society that doubts about the impartiality and the independence of courts, and therefore the lawfulness of their judgments, are justified. ... i think that the information about the alleged conversations between judges and the lawyer [...] should be treated as a signal or a call to look at the problems in the judiciary in a wider context ...
... in relation to this particular situation, i think it was caused by the attitude to the rule of law and the code of ethics which regulate judges’ behaviour. on an unknown date the inquiry carried out by the prosecutor general’s office concluded that the alleged telephone conversations had taken place between november 1998 and april 2000. as there were no audio records of the conversations, the authenticity of the content of the transcripts could not be established. in the course of the inquiry the prosecutor general’s office questioned several judges mentioned in the book. had arranged a meeting in the judge o.d.j. the impugned conversation had not referred to any specific civil case so the prosecutor general’s office concluded that there were insufficient grounds to investigate judge o.d.j. on 30 november 2007 the working group established by the supreme court published a report on their inquiry into alleged ethical wrongdoing by judges. the working group identified that two of the fifteen judges, whose conduct had been assessed, had violated the code of ethics of judges, but that judge o.d.j., whose conversation with the lawyer had been published in the book, had not. it stated:
“... [12.5] in his submissions [5.5] o.d.j. did not deny that he might have had conversations [with the lawyer] but that they had only concerned german compensation claims, however in those cases [the lawyer] had not been representing any of the parties, and therefore the working group concluded that o.d.j. in 2004 the applicant and another person brought a civil claim against a third party. on 25 january 2005 the riga regional court, as a first‑instance court, dismissed the claim and on 21 november 2006 the supreme court, acting as an appellate court, dismissed an appeal by the applicant. the hearing before the cassation court was held on 29 august 2007. the senate sat as a panel of three judges, including o.d.j. the applicant’s representative raised objections to o.d.j., arguing that the applicant had reasonable doubts as to his impartiality on the grounds that the judge was under several inquiries at the time for allegedly unethical or unlawful behavior. the applicant also alleged that the defendant’s representative was a former employee of the supreme court. on 29 august 2007 the other two judges, referring to article 19(1)(4) of the civil procedure law (see paragraph 16 below), dismissed the objections. in the particular case were reasonable in the terms of the above provision. on the same day the senate of the supreme court upheld the appellate court’s judgment on the merits by which the applicant’s claim was dismissed and it became final in that part, but referred the case back for reconsideration in part on the implementation of the judgment.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in rheine. as a preliminary measure he was confined to a psychiatric hospital. the court appointed defence counsel to the applicant, who had a previous history of psychiatric treatment going back as far as 1999. according to the court’s psychiatric expert, he was psychotic and aggressive, did not show any awareness of his illness and it was likely that he would commit further, even more serious crimes. he was informed that this was not possible on the spot. he was then returned to the forensic hospital where, when in contact with others, he showed no more signs of agitation. on friday 21 december 2012 the applicant received a letter from the court‑appointed lawyer, dated 19 december 2012, who advised him as follows:
“... you already announced immediately after the hearing that you wanted to appeal against the court’s decision and also to mandate new defence counsel. we respect your wish for new counsel and hereby terminate the mandate. appeal on points of law may be lodged either with the record of the registry or in writing. since you are not at liberty, the special provision of article 299 of the ccp applies to you. this means that you can make statements relating to appellate remedies to the record of the registry of the district court in whose district the institution is located. thus, the rheine district court would be competent. in your own interest you should take care that the appeal is lodged in time. still, on 21 december 2012 the applicant typed and signed an appeal letter to the rheine district court and asked the clinic’s staff to post it. this was done on the following day (saturday 22 december). on 8 january 2013 the regional court informed the applicant that his appeal was belated. it underlined that the applicant had been instructed after the judgment’s delivery that an appeal could only be recorded by the registry of the district court but could not be lodged in writing. on 14 january 2013 the court‑appointed lawyer, who had resumed his activity for the applicant, requested a reinstatement of the proceedings in accordance with article 44 of the code of criminal procedure (wiedereinsetzung in den vorherigen stand - see paragraph 19 below) and lodged an appeal on points of law. he could also have expected the appeal, posted on 22 december, to reach the rheine district court by 27 december 2012. on 11 march 2013 the federal prosecutor general observed, inter alia, that:
“he [defence counsel] referred to article 299 of the code of criminal procedure by using wording which was not per se wrong but potentially misleading because it could be understood that the appeal on points of law might be lodged either (by the applicant himself) with the record of the rheine district court’s registry or in writing with the same court.” communication between the applicant and his defence counsel was impossible. the applicant was obviously in an exceptional mental state. in such a situation, taking into account the applicant’s psychiatric illness, it must be assumed that he had not understood the oral instructions on the right to appeal which were given immediately after the delivery of the judgment.” on 24 april 2013 the federal court of justice rejected the applicant’s request for reinstatement and consequently dismissed his appeal on points of law as inadmissible because it had been lodged out of time. it held that it was not necessary to examine whether, with regard to the christmas holidays, the applicant should have expected his letter to be delivered only on 28 december 2012. an accused who misunderstood the oral instruction and therefore lodged an appeal out of time was himself responsible for this. according to the federal court of justice, the content of this letter was not misleading but reflected correctly the applicable law. there was nothing to show that the applicant might not have understood the oral instructions by the presiding judge for mental health reasons. he misunderstood the subsequent written instructions of his defence counsel in the same way. the applicant filed a constitutional complaint to the federal constitutional court.
the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in west drayton. her application was rejected by the secretary of state for the home department on 26 april 2004. she then absconded for a period of over two years. in march 2005 a residence order was made in favour of s’s father and the child was returned to nigeria. she was convicted and on 12 december 2007 she was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment. on 12 august 2008 the applicant appealed against the decision to deport her. in her notice of appeal she reiterated her claim that she was at risk of being killed in nigeria and that she had no family connections there. the applicant was refused bail on 12 january 2009 and again on 17 march 2009 on the grounds that she could not be relied on to comply with bail conditions, she offered no sureties and she represented a danger to herself and to others. on 30 april 2009 the applicant obtained a report from professor k, a medical expert, on her mental health. she was taking medication and if necessary could be admitted to hospital on a voluntary basis. additionally, the applicant claimed that her family life with m would be irrevocably disrupted. he expressed the opinion that the applicant would now benefit from hospital assessment and treatment and recommended her transfer under the provisions of section 48 of the 1983 act. the applicant was not transferred as there was no agreement about whether she fulfilled the relevant criteria. on 8 december 2009 the united kingdom authorities contacted the responsible clinicians to request another mental health assessment of the applicant. in or around february 2010 the applicant was admitted to the acute assessment wing of a hospital after attempting suicide. she assessed the applicant’s risk of harming children as grade three on a scale of zero to three. she was also at a risk of suicide, deliberate self-harm and other offending behaviour at grade two. this gave the applicant a summary risk to herself of two and to others of three. although that risk could only be contained by constant supervision, this need could be met at yarl’s wood. hospital admission would not provide management different to that. on 13 august 2010 the judicial review application was dismissed by a high court judge, who found that while the secretary of state had failed to take into account paragraph 55.10 of her own policy, enforcement instructions and guidance (see paragraphs 58-63 below), when considering the justification for the applicant’s detention between 8 august 2008 and 28 april 2010 (“the first period of detention”), that failure had not caused any damage since the decision to detain would have been the same even had the policy been correctly considered and applied. the judge therefore dismissed the claim for false imprisonment. he therefore found that continuing detention was lawful during this second period. in this regard, he noted that, taking an analytical approach to each of the periods of detention following 8 august 2008, the applicant’s detention was explicable by steps she had taken, or failed to take (for example, cooperation in relation to emergency travel documents, and the conflicting advice in the hands of the authorities as to the effect of detention on her mental condition and the possibility of treating it while in detention). the initial conduct of the claimant was her commission of the offence on her son. relevant to the decision to deport and to detain pending deportation were her conviction for absconding and her conviction for fraud. the applicant appealed to the court of appeal against the dismissal of her judicial review claim on 13 august 2010. the only intermittent delaying factor was the applicant’s legal challenges but that did not oblige a finding that the prospects of removal were fanciful. finally, in relation to the secretary of state’s refusal to treat the new representations as a fresh claim, the court found that he had been entitled to reach the conclusion he did. in the meantime, the applicant has brought further judicial review claims (not related to the present application).
at the time of lodging his application, he was detained in kaisheim prison. the applicant has been continuously addicted to heroin since 1973, when he was aged 17. he has also been suffering from hepatitis c since 1975 and has been hiv-positive since 1988. he has been considered 100% disabled and has been receiving an employment disability pension since 2001. on 3 june 2009 the augsburg regional court convicted the applicant of drug trafficking, sentenced him to three years and six months’ imprisonment and, having regard to a previous conviction, to another two years and six months’ imprisonment. it further ordered the applicant’s placement in a drug detoxification facility, to be executed after a period of six months’ detention in prison. the applicant was still not provided with substitution treatment for his heroin addiction. on 19 april 2010 the memmingen regional court declared the applicant’s detention in the detoxification facility terminated and ordered his retransfer to prison. in a decision dated 25 june 2010 the munich court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. he had secretly consumed methadone at the clinic and lacked motivation to lead a drug-free life. the applicant was transferred back to kaisheim prison on 30 april 2010. during his detention, the pain in his feet, neck and spine became such that, at least during certain periods, he spent most of his time in bed. having regard to the applicant’s chronic pain linked to his long-term drug consumption and polyneuropathy, he suggested that the prison medical service reconsider the possibility of drug substitution treatment. he subsequently confirmed that the applicant should be examined by a doctor specialised in drug addiction therapy to that end. the applicant also obtained, on his request, an opinion drawn up by an external doctor specialised in drug addiction treatment (b.) dated 27 july 2011, on the basis of the written findings of doctor h. and the kaisheim prison doctor’s and authorities’ findings and statements, but without having been able to examine the applicant in person. b. considered that from a medical point of view, drug substitution treatment had to be provided to the applicant. the applicant claimed that drug substitution treatment was the only adequate treatment for his medical condition. the applicant claimed that, as confirmed by doctor h., the serious chronic neurological pain from which he was suffering could be considerably alleviated by drug substitution treatment, as had been the case during his previous substitution treatment. his rehabilitation could therefore better be furthered by providing him drug substitution treatment. while undergoing such treatment previously, he had been able to lead a relatively normal life and to complete training as a software engineer. after the prison authorities’ first decision dismissing the applicant’s application was quashed by the augsburg regional court on 4 october 2011 for lack of sufficient reasoning, the prison authorities, on 16 january 2012, again dismissed the applicant’s request. after three years in detention, he no longer suffered from physical withdrawal symptoms. moreover, the applicant had also consumed drugs while in detention. on 26 january 2012 the applicant, relying on the reasons he had submitted to the prison authorities, appealed against the decision of the prison authorities to the augsburg regional court. he further submitted that the authorities of kaisheim prison, where no substitution treatment had ever been provided, had omitted to examine the medical necessity of drug substitution therapy under the relevant criteria laid down, in particular, in the federal medical association’s guidelines for the substitution treatment of opiate addicts, which were clearly met in his case. on 9 august 2012 the court of appeal dismissed the appeal as ill‑founded. on 10 september 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the federal constitutional court. on 17 november 2014 the kaisheim prison authorities rejected the applicant’s fresh request to be provided with substitution treatment in preparation for his release. on 3 december 2014 the applicant was released. the doctor confirmed that the applicant would receive drug substitution treatment from 8 december 2014 onwards.
the first applicant, born in 1953, is the sister of the second applicant, born in 1946, the aunt of the third applicant, born in 1984, and the daughter of the fourth applicant, born in 1920. the first, second and third applicants live in lviv. both pilots had successfully ejected before the explosion. as a result of the crash, seventy-seven people died and nearly three hundred sustained injuries. the third applicant suffered a post-traumatic stress reaction. they also attempted to prevent people from photographing and filming. senior air force staff and civilian authorities occupying the vip lounge fled in panic, causing a traffic jam and obstructing access to the site for police and medical professionals. according to them, they were obliged to wait long hours in the heat before being allowed to enter the premises. on 5 august 2002 a panel of forensic experts examined the bodies of mr and mrs mykhayliv and their daughters, and concluded that they had sustained fatal cerebral trauma and numerous other injuries. they further submitted that the head of mrs mykhayliv had been extracted from the crashed aircraft engine and, in spite of their pleas, had not been returned to them along with some other unspecified body fragments. on various dates several concurrent investigations were opened to establish the circumstances of the accident, including investigation by a special government commission set up for this purpose, the ministry of defence, the lviv city council, the prosecutor’s office, and sknyliv tragedy, a non-governmental organisation founded by survivors of the accident and those who had lost relatives at the air show. stationed in mirgorod, as the aerobatic performance director. he made a technical mistake in its performance and, as the second pilot did not intervene when appropriate, the pilots lost control of the aircraft and it started falling. in september 2002 the ministry of defence produced a report on the internal investigation, largely reiterating the findings of the special commission. deputy air force commander-in-chief on military training) was dismissed from the military “for unsatisfactory performance of service duties in respect of the preparation for and supervision of the air show at the sknyliv aerodrome, and for personal irresponsibility”; major-general v.a. similarly to the reports produced by the governmental authorities, the authors of this report concluded that the immediate cause of the crash was error by the first pilot in performing a manoeuvre, which had been neither envisaged by his mission order nor practised by him before the show, while the second pilot and ground crew did not take the opportunity to intervene in respect of the first pilot’s conduct. notwithstanding the aforementioned findings, in the opinion of the authours of the report, the accident had largely resulted from a structural problem. of the air force headquarters was at variance with the aircraft specifications. on 30 may 2003 the civilian expert engaged in the above assessment issued a separate opinion in which he stated, inter alia, that in his view the aerobatics zone had been too small; its location had been inherently dangerous and the pilots’ mission order had been incompatible with the su‑27 specifications. 249 of the deputy minister of defence on 25 december 1998 (настанова по виконанню польотів в авіації збройних сил україни, нвп-99); air force navigation service guidelines of the armed forces of ukraine, enacted by order no. of the air force headquarters; the commander of the 14th corps (s.o.); in the group, having found that they were sufficiently independent. were serving at the material time in the faculty of the national military academy and the fifth expert was deputy director for flight safety at a military aircraft repair company belonging to the ministry of defence. on 11 may 2005 the two civilian experts also produced a report, which largely replicated the findings and the language of the report issued by their military counterparts. having been appointed to this position created by order of the 14th corps commander, he had developed his own reference document listing his duties for the commander’s approval and had done his best in performing them. of the 14th corps flight safety service likewise asserted that he had properly performed his service duties and had prepared sufficient documentation concerning flight safety during the air show. however, having been told that the relevant parameters had been approved by the higher command and it was too late to change anything, he had executed the orders of his superiors and directed the flight as best he could. in the meantime, on an unspecified date the general prosecutor’s office decided to continue with the “organisers’ case”, having disagreed with the expert conclusions of 8 february and 11 may 2005, and on 25 january 2006 suspended s.o. gave permission for the flight to go ahead;
the decision to hold the show was taken by the 14th air force corps commander [s.o.]: moreover, they were inconsistent with the court’s own position adopted in the judgment of 23 june 2005, where it heavily relied on the conclusions of the special commission and the aviation expert assessment in examining various aspects of the case and had referred to the relevant findings concerning poor organisation of the show in its reasoning.
the applicants were born in 1973 and 1975 respectively and live in p. 7. the applicants lived with their parents in a, croatia. on 7 january 1992 the a police carried out a search of a flat occupied by x in a and found an automatic gun, a hand gun and some bullets. had been on duty at a checkpoint in r. street in a between 7 p.m. on 6 january 1992 and 7 a.m. on 7 january 1992. said that on 6 january 1992 at about 7 p.m. police officer x had asked him, r.b., the driver had been dressed in the uniform of the civil police. ’s attention had been diverted by a vehicle which had come from the opposite direction and he had stopped it. noted down the registration number of that vehicle. stopped a vehicle which had arrived from the direction of k and asked the other police officers on duty whether it was the same vehicle they had stopped at about 8 p.m., which d.j. asked them who the other passengers had been and where they had taken them. and that they had left them in a village. on the outskirts of a the police had stopped them. had attempted to take it from him, resulting in a commotion in which the weapon had fired and killed s.c. on 19 september 2000 the c police interviewed m.m., who said that on 6 january 1992 he had been on duty, together with m.b., none of the officers on patrol dared go to the crime scene. he had heard that x had moved to bosnia and herzegovina. on 21 september 2000 the c police interviewed the applicants, who had learned from b.ž., on 4 january 2001 an investigating judge of the c county court (županijski sud u c) ordered an investigation concerning x and y, who were not available to the croatian authorities, on suspicion of killing s.c. on 20 january 2004 the ministry of justice asked the c county court for the relevant documents with a view to seeking y’s extradition from the united states authorities. on 10 january 2007 the ministry of foreign affairs informed the ministry of justice that the us department of justice had requested some additional documents. it appears that on 12 and 13 february 2008 the croatian and us authorities held consultations in zagreb in connection with the extradition of y. 29. on 8 april 2008 the c county state attorney’s office again asked the ministry of justice to seek y’s extradition. in april 2009 the us department of homeland security asked the croatian ministry of justice for legal assistance in connection with the criminal investigation pending against y in the united states on charges of attempted procurement of united states citizenship by fraud, and fraud and misuse of visas, permits and other official documents. they asked for all documents related to any criminal offences y might have committed. had been instituted in 1992 in the b municipal court and that they had been acquitted. on 3 march 2009 his statement was forwarded to the croatian authorities. however, having regard to the correct establishment of the facts by the first-instance court, which found that the events at issue had occurred on 7 january 1992 in the village of j, in the then occupied territory of the republic of croatia which at that time was under the control of illegal formations of the “serbian republic of krajina” and outside the control of the republic of croatia and its lawful bodies, the appellant’s submission that [the killing of the plaintiffs’ parents] ... amounted to war-related damage is well-founded. section 2 of the act on the assessment of war-related damage ... provides that war-related damage is damage caused by enemy or illegal groups, or legal bodies of the republic of croatia, as well as accomplices of these groups and bodies, where that damage occurred directly or indirectly at the time specified in section 1 of that act (from 15 august 1990 until the end of hostilities and war operations conducted against the republic of croatia). this judgment was upheld by the supreme court on 19 june 2012.
the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in gaziantep. in 2010 the applicant and his family left uzbekistan to escape the oppression they faced on account of their religious beliefs. after spending some time in kazakhstan, in 2010 they entered turkey by legal means. subsequent to their arrival in turkey, the applicant and his wife made a request for asylum. the applicant, therefore, resided illegally in gaziantep. he was also banned from entering the country for five years. on 4 may 2012 the applicant and his family attempted to re-enter turkey through sabiha gökçen airport in istanbul. the applicant was notified of this decision on 31 may 2012. he was also informed on that date that he could lodge an objection to the ministry’s decision within seventy-two hours, that he would be deported in the event of the dismissal of his objection and that he would continue to be accommodated in the airport detention facility in the meantime. on 1 june 2012 the applicant lodged an objection to the ministry’s decision. on that date, he was granted a temporary residence permit pending his asylum request. the applicant claimed that the detention facility at sabiha gökçen airport where he had been kept for sixty-eight days between 4 may and 10 july 2012 had been a room of about 20 square metres and that, while the numbers had fluctuated, the room had accommodated up to fifteen people at times. there had been no furniture in the room suitable for sleeping on, but only five chaises longues, which had been impossible to rest on. he had also been denied any access to natural light and fresh air, as the room in question had had no windows. according to the applicant, the detention facility had been designed for holding inadmissible passengers for short periods and had been unsuitable for long-term detention. all other passengers in his situation had either been released or repatriated after one or two days of detention at most. the applicant further alleged that the overcrowding of the removal centre had led to hygiene problems. the building had been infested with insects and there had been frequent outbreaks of contagious diseases. the quality and quantity of the food provided had also been fairly poor. the room had been equipped with five beds for men, as well as a ventilation system, a television, a toilet and a shower. they did not, however, submit any documents in support of that submission, such as a list of the detainees kept in the detention facility during the relevant period. the government stated that the kumkapı removal centre’s capacity had been reduced from 560 to 300, in line with recommendations made by the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (“the cpt”), following its visit in june 2009. they did not, however, submit the registers recording the occupation rates during the period in question. they submitted, however, that there had been fifteen to twenty beds in each room. the detainees had had access to medical care in cases of emergency and a doctor had visited the removal centre once a week. although the total number of beds cannot be ascertained from the photos, it can be determined that there were at least twenty‑two beds (that is to say eleven bunk beds) in both rooms. no other furniture, such as tables and chairs, was present in the rooms; there were blankets on the beds in only one of the rooms and the other room had no bedding at all. moreover, a metal sit‑up bench and an exercise bike were shown in the photograph of the hallway. no photos of the toilets or the showers were provided. there were no men amongst these detainees – only women and children.
he was detained at the gaziantep foreigners’ removal centre (“the gaziantep removal centre”) at the time of the events giving rise to this application. in 2000 the applicant fled to turkey because he was being searched for by the russian authorities. it appears that shortly before his escape, he had lost his right leg in a bomb attack that struck a mosque in chechnya. subsequent to his departure from russia, criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant by the russian authorities before the cerkessk city court on the following charges: (i) participation in an armed insurrection and membership of an armed organisation with the purpose of overthrowing the constitutional order and violating the territorial integrity of the russian federation and (ii) possessing firearms and ammunition. it appears that the cerkessk city court issued a detention order in respect of the applicant in his absence. on 24 january 2008 the applicant was taken into police custody in istanbul in the context of an operation against al-qaeda. he was subsequently taken to gaziantep, where he was placed in pre-trial detention at the gaziantep h-type prison upon the order of the gaziantep magistrate’s court. on an unspecified date criminal proceedings were commenced against the applicant before the adana assize court. on 28 january 2009 the adana assize court ordered the applicant’s release from the gaziantep h-type prison. there is no further information in the case file as regards the outcome of the criminal proceedings. following his release from prison on 28 january 2009, the applicant was placed in detention at the gaziantep removal centre, which is attached to the gaziantep security directorate. on an unspecified date the russian authorities requested the extradition of the applicant. on 3 april 2009 the gaziantep assize court refused that request, holding that the offences in question were of a political nature and that under international and national laws, alleged perpetrators of such offences could not be extradited. on 23 october 2009 the applicant applied to the gaziantep governor’s office with a request for asylum. on 26 april 2010 the applicant was notified that his request had been rejected. in the meantime, on 8 april 2010 the applicant submitted a petition to the ministry of the interior (“the ministry”), where he requested to be released and to be granted a residence permit. the applicant’s requests were dismissed by the ministry. the applicant’s objection to that decision was further dismissed by the ministry on 10 june 2010. on 24 july 2010 the applicant was released from the gaziantep removal centre, on the condition that he leave turkey within fifteen days. it appears that the applicant left turkey shortly after his release. according to the information in the case file, the applicant met with his lawyer a total of nine times between 3 march 2009 and 27 july 2010 during his detention at the gaziantep removal centre.
the applicant was born in 1967 and lives in stari bar, montenegro. at the relevant time he was a professional basketball player. on 9 july 1997 the applicant brought a claim against the basketball club for which he had been playing, vojvodina bfc (košarkaski klub vojvodina bfc), based in novi sad. the club had the status of a citizens’ association. on 17 february 1998 the novi sad municipal court (hereinafter “the municipal court”) ruled in favour of the applicant, ordering vojvodina bfc (hereinafter “the debtor”) to pay him, within fifteen days, the sum of 110,550 dinars (rsd – approximately 10,000 euros (eur) at the time) and rsd 8,500 (approximately eur 730) in costs, together with statutory interest. the judgment became final on an unspecified date in 1998. following a request by the applicant on 15 october 1998 for enforcement, on 19 october 1998 the municipal court issued an enforcement order. on 25 december 1998 the applicant informed the court that the debtor did not have sufficient funds in its bank account and proposed that the judgment be enforced by the sale of the debtor’s immovable assets situated on the premises of the vojvodina sports and business centre. on 17 march 1999 an enforcement order to that effect was issued. in the meantime, a new basketball club, nis-vojvodina, was formed. on 25 december 2002 the central bank in novi sad informed the court that the debtor’s bank account had been frozen. on 14 march 2003 the applicant informed the court of another bank account in the debtor’s name. on 9 may 2003 he asked the court not to carry out the enforcement by sale of the debtor’s immovable assets as he had asked previously, because it appeared that assets did not belong to the debtor, but to the basketball club nis-vojvodina. on 12 may 2003 the municipal court ordered enforcement in accordance with the applicant’s request of 14 march 2003. on 25 june 2003 the central bank in novi sad informed the court that the account details the applicant had provided did not concern the debtor but the basketball club nis-vojvodina, and that the debtor’s account was still frozen. on 14 july 2003 nis-vojvodina appealed against the enforcement order of 12 may 2003. it claimed not to be the debtor’s legal successor. on 1 april 2004 a three judge panel of the municipal court (hereinafter “the panel”) refused to hear the appeal until the enforcement judge determined the debtor’s liabilities. on 24 june 2004 nis-vojvodina filed a submission, denying any connection with the applicant’s debtor. on 19 october 2004 the municipal court asked the applicant to comment on nis-vojvodina’s submission and propose another method of enforcement. as the applicant failed to do so, on 11 january 2005 the municipal court suspended (obustavio) the enforcement against nis-vojvodina. on 14 february 2005 the panel instructed the enforcement judge to establish if there was any relationship between the debtor and nis‑vojvodina before transferring the file back to it again. on 30 may 2005 the ministry of education and sport informed the municipal court that the applicant’s debtor had appeared on their register of sports organisations since 3 august 1999, while nis-vojvodina had never been registered. in the proceedings that followed, the enforcement judge, relying on the ministry’s information note of 30 may 2005, found that nis-vojvodina was not the debtor’s legal successor and transferred the case file to the panel on 1 september 2005. on 16 march 2006 the panel upheld the decision of 11 january 2005, finding that there were no grounds to continue enforcement against nis-vojvodina. on 1 september 2011 the novi sad commercial court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor and adopted the restructuring plan it had devised. according to the plan, the debtor would pay the applicant rsd 1,229,332.42 (approximately eur 10,000) over five years, paying him one fifth of the total amount each year. on 17 september 2012 the debtor paid the applicant one fifth of the above-mentioned sum, that is to say rsd 245,866.48 (approximately eur 2,000). there is no information in the case file as to whether the applicant received any payments thereafter.

the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in diyarbakır. at the time of the events in question the applicant was the vice‑president of hak-par (hak ve özgürlükler partisi – the rights and freedoms party). on 4 january 2004 the party held its first ordinary congress at a restaurant in ankara, where the applicant was elected by the delegates to act as the meeting’s chairman. on 28 february 2005 a public prosecutor at the ankara public prosecutor’s office filed an indictment with the ankara criminal court of first instance against thirteen members of hak-par, including the applicant, for acting in violation of section 81 (c) of law no. 2820 during the congress on the grounds, inter alia, that there had been banners in kurdish and that most of the speeches given by the delegates had been in kurdish. the applicant acknowledged before the first-instance court that he had not intervened as the chairman when certain delegates had spoken in kurdish. in this connection, he submitted that, as a founder member of hak‑par, he believed that kurdish should be used in all areas of life; that those who spoke kurdish were speaking in their mother tongue; and that he believed that it was neither legal nor ethical for him to intervene to force people to speak in a language other than their mother tongue. he maintained that such speeches could not have constituted an offence, when taking into account laws that had been enacted in compliance with the conditions for membership of the european union, and the provisions of the european convention on human rights. in this connection, the applicant also submitted that the relevant provisions of law no. on 7 december 2005 the first-instance court dismissed an application from the defendants to suspend the proceedings and transfer the case to the constitutional court for examination of the compatibility of the relevant provisions with the constitution. on 14 february 2007 the ankara criminal court of first instance convicted the applicant of the charges. in particular, the court considered that the applicant had, despite warnings from a government superintendent present at the congress, continued to allow certain delegates to give their speeches in kurdish, in breach of section 81 (c) of law no. the applicant was sentenced to one year’s imprisonment. on 23 march 2011 the court of cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on the ground that the latter had failed to give any consideration to whether the conditions for suspending the delivery of the judgment against the defendants, pursuant to article 231 of the code of criminal procedure, had been met. on 6 december 2011 the ankara criminal court of first instance ordered that the criminal proceedings against the applicant and the other defendants be terminated, on the ground that the statutory time-limit prescribed under domestic law had expired.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in moscow. on 1 february 1994 f. bought a 19.3 square metre flat at 22-2-68 nagatinskaya naberezhnaya, moscow. on 23 july 1997 f. died intestate and without heirs. according to the government, his flat was locked and sealed by the housing maintenance company. on an unspecified date n. brought a civil action seeking recognition as f.’s heir-at-law. the city of moscow authorities took part in the proceedings as a respondent. on 8 february 2010 the simonovskiy district court of moscow granted her claim and recognised her title to f.’s flat. the judgment came into force on 19 february 2010. on 14 may 2010 n. sold the flat to k. the transaction was registered by the federal registration service. on 24 june 2010 the moscow city court quashed the judgment of 8 february 2010 on appeal and dismissed n.’s claims. on 6 july 2010 k. sold the flat to the applicant. on 21 july 2010 the federal registration service registered the sale agreement and the transfer of the title to the flat to the applicant. on an unspecified date the housing department brought a civil action claiming that n. had been erroneously recognised as f.’s heir-at-law and that the city of moscow should inherit his property instead. on 8 november 2012 the district court granted the housing department’s claims. it ordered the transfer of title to the flat to the city and the requisition of the flat from the applicant. the court also considered that the applicant had not demonstrated due diligence when buying the flat from k. and could not be recognised as a bona fide purchaser. on 4 february 2013, following an appeal by the applicant, the moscow city court upheld the judgment of 8 november 2012. on 15 april 2015 the district court granted the housing department’s claims against the applicant and ordered her eviction. according to the government, the applicant has not been evicted and continues to reside in the flat. on 9 december 2013 the perovskiy district court of moscow granted a claim by the applicant for damages against k. and awarded her, inter alia, 4,060,006 russian roubles (rub). on 20 march 2014 the moscow city court upheld the judgment of 9 december 2013 on appeal. according to the government, the bailiff failed to establish k.’s whereabouts or locate any of his assets. the judgment in the applicant’s favour remains unenforced. the enforcement proceedings are still pending.
the applicant was born in 1945 and lives in ankara. attempted to light the wood-burning stove used to heat the office area by pouring petrol onto it. serpil i̇mren sustained serious injuries as a result of the fire. they reported that she was not in a condition to make a statement regarding the incident. serpil i̇mren’s colleague who had apparently started the fire, and k.n.y., m.y described the incident as noted in paragraph 5 above. for starting a fire and causing bodily harm by negligence. on the same day the ankara public prosecutor delivered a decision not to prosecute in relation to k.n.y. relying on the inspectors’ findings regarding the lack of precautions necessary for the prevention of fires in the deceased’s workplace, on 18 april 2003 the applicant lodged a new complaint with the ankara public prosecutor’s office against the owner of the company, k.n.y. on 26 may 2003 the ankara public prosecutor issued an additional indictment against k.n.y. on 16 september 2003 the second hearing was held, during which the court heard the statements of the defendants and two prosecution witnesses. it appears from the information in the case file, however, that the on-site inspection was carried out on 12 april 2004. on 16 april 2004 the court-appointed experts issued their report, where they largely repeated the findings of the ministry’s inspectors noted in paragraph 12 above. on 9 july 2004 the insurance company submitted the requested documents. the defendants appealed against this judgment. 5237) that had entered into force in june 2005. on 17 november 2006 the ankara assize court convicted the defendants once again as charged and issued the same sentence and fine. on 13 october 2008 the court of cassation quashed the ankara assize court’s judgment of 17 november 2006. 5271), as amended on 6 december 2006, was applicable in the circumstances. the labour court accepted that request and on 24 october 2007 it appointed three experts. bore 70 % and 5 % responsibility, respectively, for serpil i̇mren’s death. according to the experts, the remaining responsibility lay with m.y., who was not a party to the proceedings before the labour court. relying on the findings of the experts, on 3 march 2009 the applicant brought an additional compensation claim before the ankara 7th labour court against k.n.y. between 14 april 2004 and 28 december 2010 the labour court held twenty-three hearings. however, the expert was not officially appointed until 9 october 2012. on 4 june 2014 the labour court delivered its judgment on the case. it rejected the applicant’s claims in respect of pecuniary damage, except for funeral costs in the amount of 1,306 turkish liras (try) (approximately 455 euros (eur)), plus interest (try 40 to be paid by k.n.y. it appears from the information in the case file that the applicant has not yet received payment of the damages ordered by the labour court. it also appears from the applicant’s undisputed allegations that during the time it took to reach a decision on her civil claim, the company had closed down and the damages ordered by the court against that company could therefore not be collected.
the applicant was born in 1970 and currently lives in london. she argued that her objection was not time-barred as the penal order had not been served on her on 7 november 2008. the applicant claimed that she was sure that no penal order had been served on her on 7 november 2008. in the afternoon she had bade farewell to her counsel. she had found neither a penal order nor a notice that a penal order had been deposited in another place. on 6 february 2009 the applicant’s counsel supplemented the applicant’s submissions. the applicant’s husband had arrived shortly before them and had been waiting for them, together with the applicant’s mother. they would have noticed the doorbell ringing, as the applicant had dogs, which were outside and would have barked. at that moment the applicant had taken the mail out of her mailbox. she had immediately checked the contents. there had been no official letter from a court. in december 2008, hence shortly after the alleged delivery, the company had had to register as insolvent. the applicant’s counsel added to his submissions the affirmations in lieu of an oath of the applicant’s mother, the applicant’s husband and himself confirming his submissions. the applicant’s husband declared that when the applicant had taken out the mail he had paid special attention because he had formerly also lived at that address and sometimes mail addressed to him was still sent there. on 9 april 2009 the frankfurt am main district court rejected the applicant’s objection against the penal order as inadmissible and dismissed her application for reinstatement of the proceedings. the court found that the record of service had probative value for the fact that the penal order had been put into the applicant’s mailbox by the courier on 7 november 2008 (article 418 of the code of civil procedure, see paragraph 29 below). in accordance with the settled case-law, this could only be disproved if facts were presented that convinced the court that there was no possibility that the facts certified by the record of service were correct. she confirmed that she always rang the doorbells of the addressees. if they did not respond she would deposit a “letter of notification” (benachrichtigungsschreiben) in the mailbox. she did not specially remember either the service on 7 november 2008 or the applicant’s house. the courier had had no incentive to embezzle the applicant’s mail. it further noted that the applicant had not mentioned all the persons who had allegedly been present when she checked her mail in her first submission of 27 december 2008. moreover, it was not in accordance with general experience in life for someone to check his mail in front of all his family members. on 22 april 2009 the applicant, represented by her lawyer, appealed against the decision of the frankfurt am main district court. in contrast, the record of service certified service by way of placing the penal order itself in the applicant’s mailbox, which constituted substituted service in accordance with article 180 of the code of civil procedure (see paragraph 29 below). on 10 june 2009 the frankfurt am main regional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of the frankfurt am main district court. the regional court considered that the applicant had not furnished the court with sufficient counter-evidence. the court did not have to decide whether j. company had been reliable in all cases. furthermore, it could not be ruled out that the applicant had been inattentive when going through the mail because of the presence of guests. it was likely that the penal order had been hidden among other mail and had probably inadvertently been thrown away or simply ignored.
the applicant was born in 1945 and is currently detained in hmp long lartin. the following day the container was searched by customs officials and certain drums – purportedly containing molasses – were found to contain 700 kg of high purity cocaine worth gbp 35 million. the officials refilled the drums with dummy contents and the ship continued to antwerp where the container was offloaded. the trial judge therefore made the order requested. it was suggested by the prosecution that the previous three shipments had been practice runs for the fourth shipment, which contained the cocaine. although there was one witness in guyana who stated that the drums containing the cocaine were to be offloaded in antwerp and transported to the netherlands (see paragraph 31 below), the prosecution argued that this had been an attempt by the applicant to set up a defence should he be caught. he made three separate statements between 30 june 2004 and 20 january 2005. he also supplied the prosecuting authorities with the original files relating to all four shipments from guyana. they also tried to reach him through his employer but were told that he was on leave and could not be contacted. leave was then given for vo’s statements to be read to the jury pursuant to section 116 of the criminal justice act 2003. premier molasses had already applied for an import licence for the united kingdom for the job relating to the container and sent it to us. he also gave evidence of his previous dealings with “david keen”. a united kingdom customs officer, bt, referred in his evidence at trial to a conversation between the belgian shipping agents and a woman from premier molasses who he believed was called “n”. the applicant claimed that bt could only have obtained this information by the interception of the telephone call. the discussion touched on issues of intercept evidence and on the “n” call. the prosecution neither confirmed nor denied that any interception had taken place, or that they had or had not sought any intercept material. however, they confirmed that they had revisited their duty of disclosure and had nothing further to add. he continued to deny the main count on the indictment, which concerned the attempted importation of drugs to the united kingdom. those licences had been returned by premier molasses using registered delivery and replaced with the appropriate licences for the netherlands. these precautions exist to protect both you, you the jury, and the defendant from any outside interference. it just demonstrates how careful we must be and assumptions can often be wrong.” instead, the trial judge re-read the relevant part of his summing-up summarising those statements. he appealed against his conviction to the court of appeal. first, it was argued that the admission of vo’s statements had violated article 6 of the convention and, in particular, that the trial judge would never have allowed the statements to be read had he been aware that bt’s evidence regarding the “n” telephone call would cast doubt on vo’s reliability. however, after remonstrating with the official she was allowed to enter. when she asked if anyone else had complained about the arrangements, she was told that she was the first person to try to attend the trial. in respect of vo’s non-attendance at trial, the court of appeal acknowledged that the prosecution’s failure to mention this fact until late in the proceedings was a cause for concern. while the statement by him that the container was intended for the united kingdom was damaging to the applicant’s case, the applicant had the evidence that was available before the jury to the effect that he had identified particular pallets that were to come out of the container at antwerp [the evidence of the guyana shipping agent aa]. finally, as far as the security measures were concerned, the court began by noting a concession by counsel for the applicant that this ground alone, even if successful, could not compromise the safety of the applicant’s conviction. the court acknowledged that the security measures clearly caused difficulties but had not been raised by the journalist or anyone else at the time.
on various dates, criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicants in uzbekistan on suspicion of sedition; of creating, leading and of being members of a religious fundamentalist, extremist, separatist or other prohibited organisation; and, in respect of the first applicant, of the distribution of material threatening public order and causing incitement to ethnic or religious hatred. orders for their arrest were issued by the uzbek authorities and they were placed on an international list of wanted persons. they left uzbekistan on various dates and eventually arrived in ukraine. on 15 june 2010 the first applicant was arrested by the ukrainian police as a person appearing on the international list of wanted persons. on 9 august 2010 the kyiv city court of appeal upheld that order. on 14 december 2009 the unhcr recognised the second applicant as a refugee under its mandate. on 23 december 2009 the migration authorities dismissed the second applicant’s application for asylum in ukraine as being groundless. on 2 july 2010 the bila tserkva court ordered the applicant’s provisional arrest for up to thirty days, until the receipt of an extradition request. on 28 july 2010 the unhcr issued a certificate stating that it had recognised the applicant as a refugee. on 29 july 2010 the applicant lodged that certificate, together with his objections to the detention request, with the shevchenkivsky court. on 25 june 2011 the kyiv circuit administrative court quashed the migration authorities’ decision of 23 december 2009 and ordered them to re-examine the applicant’s application. on 29 january 2012 the applicant was released. in his submissions to the kyiv-svyatoshyn court, the applicant opposed the police request on the grounds, in particular, that the proceedings concerning his request for asylum were still pending. in his submissions he stated that he had been arrested at 2 p.m. on 9 july 2010 and did not make any complaint in that regard. on 19 july 2010 the kyiv regional court of appeal quashed the order of 12 july 2010 and remitted the request for provisional arrest to the first-instance court for fresh examination. according to the government, on 14 july 2011 the kyiv circuit administrative court upheld the migration authorities’ decision of 4 november 2009. extradition inquiry in respect of the first three applicants and applications for asylum in sweden and the united states of america 37. the gpo asked the kyiv regional prosecutor’s office to conduct an extradition inquiry into the applicants’ cases. on 29 and 14 july 2010 similar requests were sent concerning the second and third applicants. on 24 august and 16 november 2010 the gpo, in response to its previous request, received copies of documents from the uzbek authorities describing the nature of the charges against the third and first applicants in uzbekistan. the reports recommended that the applicants’ extradition be refused, pursuant to paragraph 4 of article 466 of the code of criminal procedure which provides that extradition can be refused where “the competent authority of the foreign state has not provided, at the request of the central authority, additional materials or data, without which a decision on the extradition request may not be taken”. on 8 april 2011 the gpo wrote to the us embassy. on 5 july and 2 september 2011 the gpo again requested information from the us embassy, indicating that no response to its previous requests had been received. it requested assistance in arranging such a visit. on 16 december 2011 the unhcr informed the gpo that it had recognised the first three applicants as refugees under its mandate and invited the gpo to give due weight to this decision in examining uzbekistan’s extradition requests. the unhcr added that it could not facilitate the second applicant’s resettlement because he was in a polygamous marriage. as of the date of the submission of the applicants’ observations in reply to those of the government, that is 9 december 2013, no such decision had been made. he was released on the same day but re-arrested on 6 july 2010. on 5 august 2010 the applicant was released as no extradition request had arrived by that date. on 16 august 2010 the gpo received an extradition request from the uzbek authorities.
the applicant was born in 1988 and lives in ikaria. on 24 september 2012 he interrupted the deferral. as a result, he was required to report to the recruitment centre on 23 january 2013. on 22 january 2013 he applied for leave to perform alternative service on the grounds that he was a conscientious objector. 3421/2005) to explain the nature of his conscientious objection. he stated that his objection was based on moral values stemming from the religious education he had received from his mother, a jehovah’s witness, and on his own approach to life, involving the rejection of anything linked to war, violence or destruction in all its forms. the following is an extract from his interview:
“question: tell us about your beliefs. answer: i grew up in a home where we were respectful of god. question: so you are citing religious reasons to justify your refusal to perform armed service. that is why i am also relying on moral grounds. question: why have you not yet been baptised? my behaviour is not yet completely suitable. i have decided to get baptised, but to do so i still need to make further progress and study the scriptures and the word of god in more detail. question: how have you come to the conclusion that god has nothing to do with war? answer: i have not drawn that conclusion, but if i do enlist and serve worldly power, i will find myself on the wrong side when god decides to take action. question: have you ever witnessed a violent incident, and if so, how did you react? i tried to keep my response to a minimum by immobilising the attacker. question: so you acknowledge that there is a lawful authority and that some entities may potentially use force where necessary? answer: yes, i acknowledge lawful authority. the law of mankind exists until the divine law arrives. but there is a difference between submitting to it and becoming part of it. question: are you a member of a non-violent organisation? answer: no; for me, religious reasons take priority over reasons linked to morals ...” 10. on 27 may 2013 the special committee decided unanimously to propose that the applicant’s application be rejected. on 30 july 2013 the minister of national defence rejected the application on the grounds proposed by the special committee. secondly, the applicant argued that the minister’s decision had not contained sufficient reasons, seeing that (a) it had incorrectly mentioned that he had cited religious grounds without being an adherent of a religion; and (b) the members of the committee had displayed prejudice by asserting that conscientious objectors had to be activists and anti-authority or to publicise their views, whereas the law did not lay down any such conditions. 1289/2014 of 7 april 2014 the supreme administrative court dismissed the applicant’s application. with regard to his second argument, the supreme administrative court explained that, after examining whether the applicant was a follower of a religion that prohibited the use of force, whether he had taken part in non-violent movements and whether his philosophy of life prevented him from handling weapons, the committee had concluded that his conscientious objection was not accompanied by corresponding behaviour. such an exemption had to be subject to the conditions laid down by law, including the submission of sound and convincing reasons to justify it. the case is still pending, but the authorities have seized a sum from his bank account.
the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. more than 200,000 gurkha soldiers fought in the two world wars, and in the past fifty years they have served in hong kong, malaysia, borneo, cyprus, the falklands, kosovo, iraq and afghanistan. they have served in a variety of roles, mainly in the infantry but also as engineers and in signals and logistics units. in 1971 the brigade’s base moved to hong kong. consequently, the majority of gurkhas are currently stationed in the united kingdom, although since 1962 a section of the brigade has been stationed in brunei. gurkha soldiers are required to retire after fifteen years’ service, subject to the possibility, dependent on rank, of one or more yearly extensions. in comparison, other soldiers in the british army are entitled to serve for twenty-two years. historically, gurkha soldiers were discharged to nepal and it was presumed that they would remain there during retirement. (a)  the 2004 amendments to the immigration rules 13. on 25 october 2004 the immigration rules (hc 394) were changed to permit gurkha soldiers with at least four years’ service who retired on or after 1 july 1997 (the date that the gurkha’s home base relocated to the united kingdom) to apply for settlement in the united kingdom. approximately 90 per cent of the 2,230 eligible gurkha soldiers have since applied successfully to settle in the united kingdom with their qualifying dependants. on 21 may 2009 the secretary of state for the home department announced a new policy under which all former gurkhas who had served in the british army for at least four years would be eligible for settlement in the united kingdom. the tripartite agreement provided that the pensions of gurkhas serving in the british army would also be set by reference to the rates applied by india to indian soldiers. pension entitlements under the gps were index-linked to the cost of living in nepal as it was presumed that the gurkhas would retire there. pensions were immediately payable upon retirement and could not be deferred. a gurkha who retired without having served fifteen years would be entitled to no pension whatsoever. as the life profile of the typical gurkha approaches that of his uk/commonwealth counterpart, there can be little to be said in favour of providing them with such different pension benefit profiles.” in march 2007 the united kingdom formulated the gurkha offer to transfer (“gott”) and this was given effect in the armed forces (gurkha pension) order 2007 (“the 2007 order”). gurkhas who retired before 1 july 1997 did not qualify for the gott. however, the gott enabled gurkha soldiers who retired on or after 1 july 1997 to transfer from the gps to either afps 75 or afps 05 depending on when they first enlisted in the british army. in respect of service rendered before 1 july 1997 the explanatory memorandum to the 2007 order explained that
“although gurkha service from 1 july 1997 is transferable on a one-for-one basis, article 2 l4 provides that pre-1997 gurkha service counts proportionately depending upon the rank of the transferee. it represents broadly the value of the pre-1997 benefits accrued in the gps. transfer to the relevant afps occurred at 60 or 65, when they received the preserved pension. his pension continues to be governed by the gps and, as such, is valued at approximately fifty per cent of that which a british soldier of equivalent rank would receive for the same period and type of service. the applicants were granted permission to pursue their judicial review application. on 11 january 2010 the high court dismissed the application on all three grounds. in respect of the age discrimination challenge the high court relied on its earlier decision in r (gurung) v. ministry of defence [2008] ewhc 1496 (admin) (summarised at paragraphs 45 – 49 below), in which it held that the difference in treatment did not occur due to the difference in age but due to the dates at which service had been rendered. the applicants were granted permission to appeal to the court of appeal. on 13 october 2010 the court of appeal dismissed the applicants’ appeal. 56721/00, 29 january 2002, held that even if a relevant comparison could be drawn between older and younger gurkhas, the ministry of defence could easily justify the difference in treatment.
the applicant was born in 1979 and is currently serving a prison sentence in ukraine. on 29 october 2004 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder, robbery and attempted murder. he remained in police custody until 17 january 2005. the applicant alleged that during his stay in police custody between 29 and 31 october 2004 he had been tortured by unspecified police officers, as a result of which he had confessed to having committed the crimes of which he was suspected. the applicant stated that he had subsequently brought his allegation of ill-treatment by the police before the trial courts but the courts had not responded to it. on 1 november 2004 the applicant was taken to court; the court ordered his remand in custody pending completion of the criminal investigation against him. on 17 january 2005 the applicant was placed in a cell in kyiv temporary investigative isolation unit (“sizo”) no. from that day onwards the rules applicable to this latter category of detainees had also been applied to the applicant. the applicant complained to the courts about the allegedly unlawful execution of his sentence. on 24 march 2006 the shevchenkivskyy district court refused to consider his complaint for lack of substantiation and failure to pay the court fee. the applicant did not appeal against that ruling. in march 2012 the applicant was transferred to the sizo in lviv, which was later reorganised as a detention centre for convicted prisoners. according to the applicant, the conditions of his detention in the colony were debasing. in particular, he alleged that the drinking water and food had been of poor quality, that he had not received adequate medical assistance and that he had been subjected to psychological pressure by the colony staff. the applicant raised those allegations before the prosecutors. according to the medical information submitted by the applicant, while in detention he had been medically examined and had been given the necessary treatment. the applicant did not raise those allegations before the authorities. between 24 march and 4 august 2005 the applicant had four one‑hour visits from his mother and father. he provided no further details in that regard. during his first interrogation, on 30 october 2004, the applicant had the assistance of a lawyer of his own choosing. on an unspecified date the applicant hired a new lawyer, who continued to defend him during the investigation and trial. the applicant’s mother also took part in the proceedings as the applicant’s representative. in the course of the investigation and trial, the applicant admitted that he had committed the murders and the attempted murder of which he was suspected. subsequently, the criminal case was referred to the kyiv regional court of appeal for trial. the applicant was held to be exceptionally dangerous to society and was sentenced to life imprisonment, together with the confiscation of all his property. the same judgment ordered his continuing detention in the kyiv sizo. he contended that he had committed the crimes whilst of unsound mind and requested an additional psychiatric examination. in his appeal, the applicant’s lawyer contested the first-instance court’s finding that the applicant had committed the murders with the aim of stealing the victims’ property. on 4 august 2005 the supreme court upheld the judgment of 24 march 2005 and it accordingly entered into force on that date. in a letter dated 19 january 2006, a court of appeal judge informed the applicant that his request had been refused, pointing out that the procedure governing applications to the european court of human rights did not require the submission of the documents of which the applicant had sought copies.

the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in naberezhnyye chelny. it appears that the applicant was then taken to the police station and remained there for some time. in the police station, z. compiled an administrative offence record, thereby instituting administrative offence proceedings against the applicant. the record read as follows:
“4 march 2012
i have made the following findings under article 28.3 of the code of administrative offences:
[the applicant] was drunk and used foul language against passers-by, waving his arms in the air; he was trying to start a fight, and did not rectify his behaviour despite remarks from passers-by. thus, he gravely offended public order and committed an administrative offence under article 20.1 of the cao. ...
decision: to submit to a court
signature: deputy chief officer, 5 march 2012” 8. officer z. also issued a written report stating that the applicant had used foul language against passers-by. on 5 march 2012 the police officer submitted the record to his superior, who decided that the case should be transferred to a court for examination. on an unspecified date, the administrative offence file was submitted to a justice of the peace for adjudication. it appears that the file contained the offence record, z.’s report and n.’s statement. it is unclear whether there was any written statement from k. at that time. on 29 march 2012 the justice of the peace held a hearing. it is unclear whether it was a public one. the applicant made a written statement that he had been apprised of his procedural rights. the applicant, who is himself a lawyer, did not appoint a legal representative. he pleaded not guilty and made oral submissions on the charge against him. after a request, officer z. was present at the hearing and made an oral statement. the court also heard n. and k.. it appears that the justice of the peace asked z. and n. a couple of questions. by judgment of 29 march 2012 the justice of the peace found the applicant guilty and imposed a fine of 500 russian roubles (the equivalent of 13 euros at the time) on him. moreover, the defendant continued to use foul language during his arrest and while being taken to the police station ...” 18. the applicant appealed to the naberezhniye chelny town court. on 16 april 2012 the town court held a hearing. it is unclear whether it was a public hearing. the appeal court examined the applicant and upheld the judgment of 29 march 2012. on that date, the appeal decision and the trial judgment became final. the offence of disorderly conduct is constituted by actions breaching public order and peace. such actions include using foul language in a public place, insulting people, destruction of or damage to others’ property ... each of these actions may amount to disorderly behaviour if it breaches public order and discloses a manifest disregard to society ...
certain factual contradictions between the information in the administrative offence record, z.’s report and n.’s testimony (as regards use of foul language on account of low culture rather than in respect of passers-by) were dispelled during the trial following the interview of the witnesses ...” 20. the applicant applied to the deputy president of the supreme court of the tatarstan republic for judicial review under article 30.12 of the cao. having examined the file, by decision of 15 june 2012 the deputy president upheld the court decisions of 29 march and 16 april 2012. the applicant did not seek further review before the supreme court of russia.
the applicant was born in 1973 and lives in belgrade. v.s. continued living with his father and his paternal grandparents. this interim access order was immediately enforceable. it appears that the interim access order was respected, with some resistance on the part of the child, until 13 august 2008, when the child ran away from the applicant during a visit and went back to the respondent’s house. after receiving the report, the enforcement judge scheduled an enforcement hearing for 5 december 2008. on 19 june 2009 the social care centre, with the approval of the enforcement judge, applied the same measure to the applicant so as to enhance the parents’ collaboration with a view to satisfying the child’s emotional needs. the psychologist advised the judge that interviewing the child within the proceedings would not be in his best interest. on 5 october 2009 the competent second-instance court rejected the respondent’s appeals against the fines. it would appear that the applicant and the respondent did not accept this recommendation. the enforcement proceedings were later formally terminated by the enforcement judge on 28 february 2011. on 11 november 2008 the first-instance court granted interim custody to the applicant and ordered the respondent immediately to surrender the child to her. the rest of the interim access order remained in force. on 4 december 2008 the enforcement court ordered enforcement of the interim custody order. the judge and the centre’s representatives explained to the child in front of the others that he should leave and go with his mother to her house, but the child rejected the planned reunion and went back inside. the applicant refused forceful removal of the child. on 15 january and 4 february 2009 the enforcement judge adjourned the custody transfer scheduled for those dates as it was awaiting an opinion from the social care centre regarding the formal corrective supervision of the respondent, as requested in the interim access enforcement proceedings (see paragraph 14 above). the child again refused to be separated from his father. the enforcement of the custody transfer was postponed. on 13 july 2010 the custody judgment of 24 november 2009 became final and the decision on interim custody rights came to an end. on 24 november 2009 the first-instance court dissolved the applicant’s marriage, granted her sole custody of v.s. and specified the respondent’s access rights. on 13 july 2010 and 18 january 2011 the second-instance court and the supreme court of cassation, respectively, upheld this judgment. on 22 july 2010 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s appeal. it also found that the non-enforcement of the interim access and custody orders during the same period had been attributable to the particular complexity of the case, as the child had objected to being reunited with the applicant. the court noted that the respondent had failed to prepare the child for reunion. the psychologist’s assessment, after working with the child, was that such a transfer would be impossible or highly traumatic for the child and the enforcement was postponed once again. on 24 june 2011 the social care centre provided the first-instance court with an expert opinion. on 29 august 2008 and 23 june 2009 the applicant filed criminal complaints against the respondent for parental child abduction and continuous non-compliance with the interim access and custody orders. the applicant subsequently took over the prosecution as subsidiary prosecutor. it would appear that they have been meeting every weekend for at least an hour without supervision. the child still lives with the respondent.

the applicant was born in 1967 and lived before his arrest in the town of yoshkar-ola in the mariy el republic. in 2010 the applicant was convicted of murder, possessing firearms and aggravated robbery. he was sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment. according to a medical certificate, on 25 july 2012 he underwent ablation in the prison hospital. a month later he was discharged and transferred to a correctional colony, despite complaining of deteriorating health. an mri performed a month later confirmed that he had metastases in the lungs. on 28 march 2013 the applicant was examined by another medical panel. 54 of the government of the russian federation of 6 february 2004. on 21 november 2013 the district court dismissed another request for early release by the applicant. the decision of 21 november 2013 was appealed against and became final on 14 may 2014. she requested that the court authorise the applicant’s transfer to the prison hospital. relying on statements by a representative of the applicant’s correctional colony and ms artemyeva, the court found that the applicant was not receiving anti-cancer treatment in the colony as such treatment had to be prescribed by an oncologist. the colony medical unit did not employ this type of specialist. the expert also noted that since august 2012 his treatment had been merely symptomatic and that his drug regimen was limited to painkillers. the applicant responded in november 2014, maintaining his claims of absent or sporadic medical assistance. the government were also asked to ensure his immediate transfer to a specialist hospital if the medical experts concluded that such admittance was required. on 4 december 2014 the government responded, submitting various documents. the acting head of the unit nevertheless noted that any illness, including those suffered by the applicant, could be life-threatening. (iii)  a certificate dated 24 november 2011 issued by the head of the applicant’s correctional colony setting out his criminal record and convictions and indicating that since 23 august 2014 he had been detained in the correctional colony as there were no grounds to keep him in the prison hospital. in a one-page document the government also answered the three questions which on 12 november 2014 the court had asked to be addressed to independent medical experts. he had thus been placed under regular medical supervision in relation to his illnesses. they concluded that his condition did not call for admittance to a specialist hospital or release. the applicant also submitted an alternative expert report commissioned by his lawyer. on 17 january 2015 two forensic medical experts from st. the experts noted that the drug “reodoron” mentioned in his medical record did not exist. the government included the applicant’s medical record drawn up between december 2014 and april 2015 in a letter to the court dated 24 september 2015. the acting head of the colony laid down the details of the applicant’s criminal record, indicated that he had not made any complaints to the colony administration between 21 november 2014 and 8 april 2015 and that a request he had made for early release had been dismissed by the ingodinskiy district court on 16 march 2015. the applicant’s condition had been considered particularly serious between 18 december 2014 and 1 february 2015, and then between 24 march and 8 april 2015. the assessment had been changed to moderately serious for the period 1 february to 23 march 2015, although no changes in the long list of conditions had been recorded. the lawyer enclosed a birth certificate as proof of the applicant and ms artemyeva’s relationship and copies of letters sent by various russian authorities to ms artemyeva in response to complaints alleging that they had failed to properly treat the applicant.
the applicants were born in 1967 and 1970 respectively and live in rostov-on-don. on 26 december 2006 the applicants were arrested and placed in a detention centre operated by the rostov-on-don police. on 1 january 2007 and 31 december 2006 respectively, the applicants were transferred to remand prison no. iz-61/1 in rostov-on-don, where they were held until 23 march 2012. the first applicant, mr reznik, submitted that between 1 january and 15 may 2007 he had been held in cells 117 and 118 of the remand prison, which measured 6 square metres and had six sleeping places but accommodated up to nine inmates. in cells 42, 44 and 45, where he stayed from 15 may until november 2007, the surface area was approximately 11 square metres for twelve sleeping places and up to eleven inmates. for the next few years he was in cell 111, the largest of all the cells he was held in at 14 square metres, with up to five people sharing. on some occasions he and his cellmates had to take turns to sleep. the first applicant produced written statements by mr f., mr k. and mr s., with whom he had been detained in the same cells in 2007-2009, 2009, and 2006-2010, respectively. the statements corroborated his account of the conditions of detention. the government did not contest the fact that the applicant’s former cellmates had been held in the same remand prison as the applicant or the veracity of their statements. because of a lack of sleeping places she had to take it in turn to sleep, not only in bed but also on the floor. the government provided a description of the applicants’ conditions of detention, relying on certificates issued in june 2015 by the director of the remand prison, photographs of the cells, prisoner transfer logs (суточная ведомость учёта лиц, временно выбывших из следственного изолятора) and registration logs (журнал количественной проверки подозреваемых, обвиняемых и осуждённых). they submitted that the number of prisoners in the cells where the applicants had been held had not exceeded the occupancy limit. the prisoner transfer log shows that the applicants were detained in the following cells:

44 14. the registration logs did not contain the names of prisoners but listed numbers that could be interpreted as the cell number, its maximum occupancy and the actual number of prisoners on a given date. all the cell numbers and maximum occupancy figures were pre-printed, except for the maximum occupancy figures of the applicants’ cells, which were written by hand. for example, in the log of 9 june 2008, the maximum capacity was handwritten for cells 42, 44, 45, 111, 117, and 118 (see mr reznik’s cell numbers above); and for 184 and 192 (ms guzeyeva’s cells), and matched the actual number of prisoners in those cells. the government also provided undated photographs of cells 42, 44, 45, 111, 117, 118, and 192, which were taken from the corridor through the door, which was ajar. one of the photographs shows cell 44, with the list of cell equipment on the door indicating that it contains “six two-tier beds”. the applicants denied that the photographs showed the cells in which they had been held because those cells had not had the vaulted ceilings that were visible in the photographs. on 14 december 2010 the kirovskiy district court of rostov‑on‑don convicted the applicants and their co-defendants of illegal banking operations and forgery, and sentenced them to six years’ imprisonment and a fine. the court ordered the forfeiture of the applicants’ money as “the proceeds of crime”. on 13 march 2012 the rostov regional court amended the judgment on appeal, reducing the sentences and revoking the forfeiture order on the grounds that the relevant provisions of criminal law had been enacted after the commission of the crimes. the applicants lodged several claims for the return of their property. the court considered that the rest of the money was to be forfeited to the state. the applicants recovered the remaining amounts on 20 january and 18 february 2016.
the applicant was born in 1991 and lives in moscow. the police searched the vehicles delivering the equipment and seized three tents found amid the gear. the march began at 4.30 p.m. at kaluzhskaya square. it went down yakimanka street peacefully and without disruption. the turnout exceeded expectations, but there is no consensus as to the exact numbers. at the same time the ombudsman of the russian federation, at the request of police, attempted to persuade the leaders of the sit-in to resume the procession and to head towards the meeting venue at bolotnaya embankment where the stage had been set up. the live television footage provided by the parties contained no mention of her announcement. at 6.15 p.m. at the same corner of malyy kamennyy bridge the riot police began breaking into the demonstration to split up the crowd. the two criminal cases were joined on the same day. they received prison sentences of between two and a half and four years; one of them was released on parole. it reduced the applicant’s prison sentence to two years and three months. there is no information as to whether he was detained on that day. the applicant asked for another preventive measure pending trial. this extension order was upheld by the moscow city court on 6 august 2012. on 22 october 2013 the applicant applied for release on the grounds of his child’s medical condition, as well as the deterioration of the applicant’s own health. on 17 december 2013 the moscow city court upheld the extension order of 19 november 2013. according to a 2009 medical certificate, his eyesight in the right eye was minus 10 dioptres, and on the left eye minus 6 dioptres. the parties agree that on most days the number of inmates in the cell did not exceed the design capacity. according to the applicant, the cells were inadequately lit and ventilated, excessively hot in summer and cold in winter, all with a lavatory pan separated from the living space by a chin-high plastic partition providing insufficient privacy. on 11 july 2012 the applicant applied in writing to the head of the facility for a medical examination. this decision read as follows:
“... the performance of a medical examination ... falls outside the competence of the investigating bodies ...
however, given that the state of health of the accused mr belousov is of importance to the present criminal case, the investigating bodies have sent the relevant request to the administration of [iz-77/5] stating the need to carry out, in the shortest possible time, the medical examination of the accused mr belousov, the results of which are to be submitted to the investigating bodies for inclusion in the criminal case file.” it appears that the medical examination was not carried out. on 3 september 2013 the applicant had a hypertension crisis during a court hearing. according to the government, the applicant’s trial involved ninety-one court hearings, and it appears that the applicant was transferred to attend all of them. a typical schedule on a hearing day is represented by the following two-week extract submitted by the applicant:

the applicant was born in 1948 and lives in split. she is the owner of a flat in zagreb with a surface area of 80.58 square metres. the flat is occupied by a “protected lessee” (zaštićeni najmoprimac), a certain ms s.š. under the lease of flats act (zakon o najmu stanova), which entered into force on 5 november 1996, such lessees are subject to a number of protective measures, such as the duty of landlords to contract a lease of indefinite duration, payment of protected rent (zaštićena najamnina), the amount of which is set by the government and significantly lower than the market rent; and better protection against termination of the lease. who had been living in her flat since 1975, as a holder of a specially protected tenancy (“stanarsko pravo”) and to conclude a lease contract with her. brought a civil action against the applicant before the zagreb municipal civil court (općinski građanski sud u zagrebu) relying on sections 33(3) and 37(2) of the lease of flats act (see paragraph 18 below), seeking recognition of her legal status of a protected lessee and obtaining a judgment in lieu of the lease contract. shortly afterwards in 2007 the applicant brought a counterclaim before the same court seeking to obtain a judgement ordering s.š. and the members of her household to vacate the flat in question. be ordered to pay her 500 croatian kunas (hrk) per month[1] together with the accrued interest, for the period between june 2002 and december 2006. the applicant specified that the said amount represented her estimate of a freely negotiated rent (“slobodno ugovorena najamnina”) as provided by section 6 of the lease of flats act and the government of croatia’s decision on the determination of the level of freely negotiated rent (odluka o utvrđivanju slobodno ugovorene najamnine, official gazette no. by a judgement of 5 december 2011 the zagreb municipal civil court found in favour of s.š. it recognised her legal status of a protected lessee and substituted the lease contract stipulating protected rent in the amount of hrk 190.25 per month[2]. the court dismissed the applicant’s counterclaim as unfounded. on 11 december 2012 the zagreb county court (županijski sud u zagrebu) dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the first-instance judgement, which thereby became final. the applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) alleging violations of her right to equality before the law guaranteed by article 14 of the constitution and of her ownership rights guaranteed by articles 48, 49 and 50 of the croatian constitution (see paragraph 17 below). by a decision of 12 september 2013 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint. this decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 23 september 2013. the applicant submitted a document dated 11 may 2007 from which it follows that the protected rent for her flat was set at hrk 178.73[3]. the government submitted a document dated 16 april 2015 from which it follows that the protected rent was set at hrk 217.57[4]. according to the documents submitted by the parties, the applicant was not obliged to pay the condominium fee into the common reserve fund for the flat. that fee was incumbent on another individual. according to the applicant, she never paid any income tax on the income generated by renting her flat subject to the protected lease scheme. the government did not contest this information. the applicant furnished information as regards the monthly market rent for renting out flats in the vicinity of hers. she submitted an advertisement from the internet dated 2 june 2014 offering for rent a flat of a similar size as hers (80 m²) for eur 700 per month, and another one dated 17 december 2014 of 36 m² for eur 420 per month. in addition to this she submitted a copy of a lease agreement of 30 january 2014 for a flat with the surface area of 44.94 m² rented out for hrk 1,600 per month[5]. the government did not furnish any information in this respect.
the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in sibinj. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. the applicant was a civil servant of the city of slavonski brod, working in its office for public relations and protocol (grad slavonski brod, ured za odnose s javnošću i protokol – hereinafter “the city of slavonski brod”). in 2007 he was suspended from the civil service on account of having been accused of severe breaches of his official duties. for the duration of his suspension, that is to say between september 2007 and september 2008, the applicant was entitled to monthly salary compensation in the amount of 60% of the salary remitted in the month prior to his suspension from the civil service. on 5 september 2008 the osijek civil service tribunal (službenički sud u osijeku) found the applicant guilty of severe breaches of his official duties and fined him 10% of the salary paid to him in the month in which the said sanction was imposed. on 14 october 2008, after the applicant lodged an appeal, the superior civil service tribunal (viši službenički sud) amended the impugned decision and fined the applicant 5% of his salary paid in the month in which the said sanction was imposed. on 3 november 2008 the applicant lodged an application for the reimbursement of the portion of his gross salary – in the total amount of 78,428.47 croatian kunas ((hrk), approximately 10,900 euros (eur) at the time) – withheld during the suspension period between september 2007 and september 2008, together with accrued default interest running from the date of his suspension until payment of the said portion. he was of the opinion that by withholding 40% of his salary for a period of 12 months and imposing a fine on him the administrative bodies had punished him twice. by a decision of 17 november 2008 the city of slavonski brod dismissed that application. the applicant then lodged an appeal, which was dismissed as ill-founded by the same administrative body that delivered the above-mentioned decision (that is to say the city of slavonski brod). however, in its decision of 22 december 2008 it gave the instruction that the applicant had a right to bring an administrative action against it before the administrative court. on 22 january 2009 the applicant brought an administrative action, in accordance with the city of slavonski brod’s ruling. on 1 january 2012 certain amendments to the court act entered into force and the administrative court became the high administrative court. by a decision of 4 january 2012 the high administrative court, relying on sections 9 and 30(1), point 5, of the administrative disputes act, declined jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter, stating that an ordinary municipal court (redovni, općinski sud) was the appropriate court to hear the applicant’s case, and declared the applicant’s action inadmissible. on 16 february 2012 it served its decision on the applicant’s representative. on 12 march 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint. he complained, inter alia, that his right to a fair hearing, in particular his right of access to court, as guaranteed by article 29 of the croatian constitution and article 6 § 1 of the convention, had been violated when the high administrative court had declared his action inadmissible. in particular, he argued that according to the supreme court’s case-law, ordinary municipal courts did not have jurisdiction over disputes arising from legally binding decisions of administrative bodies. he also argued that even if he had brought a civil action, it would have been time-barred because it had taken the high administrative court more than three years to declare his administrative action inadmissible. by a decision of 5 july 2012 the constitutional court declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible on the grounds that the case raised no constitutional issue. on 17 july 2012 it served its decision on the applicant’s representative. on 6 september 2012 the applicant brought a civil action in the slavonski brod municipal court (općinski sud u slavonskom brodu) for reimbursement of salary arrears withheld between september 2007 and september 2008. by a judgment of 20 march 2013 the first-instance court dismissed the applicant’s claim as time-barred. it held, inter alia, that given that the high administrative court had declared the applicant’s administrative action inadmissible, it could not be deemed that the statutory limitation period had been interrupted. it relied on section 242(2) of the civil obligations act. by a judgment of 12 august 2013 the slavonski brod county court (županijski sud u slavonskom brodu) dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment of 20 march 2013.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in lisbon. at the relevant time he was also a columnist for o independente, a national weekly newspaper. the article also contained statements by a.s., my declarations focused on two issues of extreme gravity since they undermine the operational functioning of the project: the lack of a cost centre for the financial management and the non-recruitment of the necessary elements for its execution. he could have either confirmed my statements or lie shamelessly. [ in relation to the financial management, the president of the im stated that ‘both the im and the ‘manager’ of the project are aware of all the expenses and funding involved’. and it would be desirable that the reports were signed by the financial controller of the project, the existence of which is envisaged in the [project] plan but was never hired. clear and objective questions require clear and objective answers and the only question that arises is whether the proposed contracts were in fact made. i say that no financial report was ever made nor any contract despite the existence – since october 2004! – by denying these facts – which are easy to demonstrate – the president shows that he is a liar ... unlike the president of the im – who without the political support he has wouldn’t be anything else other than an a. [referring to the president of the im’s first name] – in the world in which i engage professionally, i don’t need to be a “coordinator” in order to have my expertise recognised. lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant, accusing him of defamation. sought leave to participate in the proceedings as an assistant (with victim status) to the public prosecutor (assistente) and lodged a claim for damages against the applicant. the lisbon criminal court reviewed the documents which had been submitted to the proceedings and took oral evidence from witnesses and established that the applicant’s professional capacity and expertise in meteorology and climatology were highly recognised at the national and european levels. it further established that from 2004 to 2006, when the applicant had been coordinating the project, he had written various emails and memoranda which had been addressed to the manager of the project, c.t., by a judgment of 14 july 2010, the lisbon criminal court convicted the applicant of aggravated defamation. according to the judgment, by making the impugned statements the applicant had wilfully defamed a.s. by making disparaging allegations in respect of him. ... the phrases in question are objectively offensive. [ the truth is that [the applicant] exceeded himself by writing and addressing those phrases in respect of the assistant in an opinion article in a newspaper which, at the time, had a wide circulation. they are value judgments and not statements of fact ...
...
the instant case does not fall in a political context. as a person exercising a leadership position in a public body, he is subject to criticism ...
however ... there cannot be a total squeezing of the right to honour of the person concerned. if throughout the article in question in the instant case [the applicant] objectively criticised the assistant’s professional performance, even in reply to the previous article published on 3 march 2006, he [the applicant] drifted into a personal attack motivated by a feeling of revenge when he stated that ‘the president of the im is nothing more than a petty liar and a poor wretch’. ...
in the instant case, [the applicant] knew that the offended was the president of the im, a public body, and wrote those words about him in order to address the duties performed and the activity performed in relation to those functions. the right to criticism has to remain within the objective criticism of the duties performed by the person concerned and not displace into personal criticism, into personal attack. the lisbon criminal court sentenced the applicant to 250 day fines, totalling 2,000 euros (eur). on 17 february 2011 the lisbon court of appeal upheld the first-instance decision. however, that did not happen as he added an adjective to the expression in such a way as to make a sharper negative evaluation of the person concerned. and, in our opinion, [he did so] in an unnecessary and disproportionate way. what happens must be precisely the opposite. ...
even within this context of tense professional relationship, there can be doubt that the phrases “petty liar” and “poor wretch” are objectively defamatory, capable of undermining one’s character and how one is considered ...
in this regard, [the applicant]’s desired freedom of expression went much further than the limits covered by criticism by entering into the sphere of the offence of honour (an indivisible feeling, referring both to the professional and personal aspect [of the individual]) and into the scope of defamation.”
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in rijeka. as a professor of theology he was qualified to teach catholic religious education and courses in ethics and culture, as provided under the relevant domestic law (see paragraph 36 below). 492/08-2002) authorising him to teach catholic religious education. at the time, the applicant was married to t.f. they had married in a religious ceremony on 14 december 2002 and their marriage had been recognised at the same time by the civil authorities, as provided for under the relevant domestic law (see paragraphs 33 and 38 below). the applicant’s subsequent divorce from t.f. was registered before the civil authorities, and in march 2006 he married another woman in a civil ceremony. the local catechetical office of the rijeka archdiocese issued you a mandate to teach catholic religious education in school. the new situation does not enable you to do this. on the same day the rijeka archdiocese informed the two schools in which the applicant was employed of the new situation. the relevant part of the letter read:
“we should inform you that on 31 august 2006 canonical mandate no. the canonical mandate was withdrawn under article 3 § 2 of the agreement between the holy see and croatia on education and cultural affairs (official gazette-international contracts no. the applicant was given two months’ notice and the right to an indemnity. on 22 february 2007 the opatija municipal court dismissed the applicant’s civil action on the grounds that as stipulated in the agreement between the holy see and croatia and the related agreement between the government of croatia and the croatian episcopal conference on catholic religious education in state schools and pre-school institutions, he could not teach catholic religious education without a canonical mandate. the applicant challenged the judgment of the opatija municipal court by lodging an appeal before the rijeka county court (županijski sud u rijeci). he argued that he had not breached the labour act or any other relevant legislation and that the agreement between the government of croatia and the croatian episcopal conference did not require that a person whose canonical mandate had been withdrawn should be dismissed. on 17 october 2007 the rijeka county court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, endorsing the findings and reasoning of the opatija municipal court. he contended, in particular, that the conclusion of a second marriage contract in a civil ceremony could not be a reason for dismissal under the labour act or any other state laws. by this agreement the republic of croatia undertook certain obligations which must be abided by and respected. although the appellant relies on an erroneous premise that the canonical mandate, as a condition for employment as a teacher of religious education, has been stipulated (only) by the agreement between the government [of the republic of croatia] and the croatian episcopal conference, it could be held that in essence he considers that the consequences of the withdrawal of the canonical mandate on his contract of employment, and his position of teacher of religious education, are contrary to the constitution. 163/03);
- the islamic community in croatia (official gazette no. it therefore follows that the appellant also entered the state education system without participating in an open competition. however, he could have expected, irrespective of the internal instructions of the minister, that the schools where he was employed would take all necessary measures to employ him in another post. 1/86 and 80/99), a degree in theology [opens the possibility] of teaching courses in ethics and culture. in so doing, the defendants acted in the usual manner for terminating a contract of employment by so-called regular dismissal. against the above background, in view of the defendants’ conduct following the withdrawal of the appellant’s canonical mandate and in view of the manner in which the competent courts provided him with judicial protection in terms of the state’s obligations under the vatican agreements, the constitutional court finds that the appellant has been afforded sufficient protection of his [employment rights].” appended a concurring opinion to the decision, agreeing with the findings of the majority. ’s application and annulled her religious marriage to the applicant. on 4 december 2009 was admitted as evidence. this way, if [he] managed to get rid of only one, which, as [they] both knew, never existed, [his] heart would be happier.”
the applicant was born in 1953 and lives in split. the applicant is the owner of a commercial building in split, which he uses as a car repair workshop. the building in issue was bought from the state in 2001. at the time of purchase, no limitation on its use was registered or apparent. on 28 march 2003 the split department for the conservation of cultural heritage (ministarstvo kulture, uprava za zaštitu kulturne baštine, konzervatorski odjel u splitu, hereafter “the split department”) ordered a measure of preventive protection relating to cultural heritage with regard to the applicant’s building, pending the final evaluation of its cultural value. it explained that the building, which was being used as a car repair workshop at that point, appeared to be a rare example of early industrial architecture in split, and therefore this warranted a measure limiting its use by the applicant. under section 10 of the protection and preservation of cultural heritage act (zakon o zaštiti i očuvanju kulturnih dobara, hereafter “the cultural heritage act”) the measure would remain in place for a period of three years, and, in accordance with section 11 of the same act, would afford the same protection as a final protective measure (see paragraph 21 below). the decision ordering the preventive protection was not transmitted to the applicant. it was forwarded to the land registry of the split municipal court (općinski sud u splitu) and duly registered in the land register. on 10 january 2007, after the expiry of the three-year period, the split department again ordered a measure of preventive protection with regard to the applicant’s commercial building, reiterating the same grounds as those specified in its previous decision. the applicant was not informed of the above decision relating to the second measure of preventive protection in respect of his building. on 3 september 2007 the measure was registered in the land register. on 16 october 2007, after becoming aware of the second measure of preventive protection following an enquiry with the land registry, the applicant challenged the extended application of that measure before the ministry of culture (ministarstvo culture, hereafter “the ministry”). he contended, in particular, that he had not been informed of the decision ordering the preventive protection, and that the protection could no longer be ordered, since the maximum duration of such a measure under the cultural heritage act was three years. the applicant also enquired about compensation in respect of the pecuniary damage he had sustained as a result of the measure of preventive protection. on 8 january 2008 the split department forwarded the applicant’s appeal to the ministry. it stressed that the decision of 10 january 2007 extending the preventive protection after the expiry of the first three-year period had been necessary, owing to the fact that it had not been possible to obtain an excerpt from the land register from the split municipal court, and that the building represented an important example of early industrial architecture in split. on 31 january 2008 the ministry dismissed the applicant’s appeal as unfounded, on the grounds that there was nothing in the law preventing the competent authority from applying the measure twice for periods of three years, and that the measure of preventive protection had not limited the applicant’s ownership rights. it also pointed out that it was necessary to extend the preventive protection in respect of the building, as the determination of its heritage value required further comprehensive assessment. on 9 march 2008 the applicant lodged an administrative action in the administrative court (upravni sud republike hrvatske), challenging the lawfulness and reasonableness of the measure of preventive protection, and emphasising the passivity of the competent authorities in finally resolving the matter. he also contended that the decisions of the lower authorities had been arbitrary. he pointed out that, contrary to what the ministry had stated, his ownership rights had been significantly limited, as his freedom to deal with the property as he wished had been restricted. in particular, his several attempts to sell the building and set up another business cooperation had failed, owing to the existing preventive protection. the applicant also asked the administrative court to award him 200,000 euros (eur) in respect of the damage he had sustained as a result of the conduct of the administrative authorities. meanwhile, the split department found that the applicant’s building should not be registered as an object of cultural heritage. on 15 april 2010, after the expiry of the measure of preventive protection, the split municipal court ordered that the entry concerning the measure be deleted from the land register. on 18 may 2011 the administrative court dismissed the applicant’s administrative action as unfounded, endorsing the reasoning of the lower authorities. in particular, it pointed out that there had been solid evidence suggesting that the building was an important object of cultural heritage, and that the measure of preventive protection was therefore justified given the need to carry out further assessments. moreover, the administrative court considered that nothing in the relevant domestic law prevented the adoption of the second decision on preventive protection following the expiry of the first three-year time-limit. on 14 december 2011 the constitutional court declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded.
the applicant was born in 1964 and lives in chelyabinsk. in 1971 a local factory, which was the owner of a block of flats, assigned the flat at 125-56 ulitsa kommuny, chelyabinsk, to p. under a social housing agreement. in 1992 the title to the building was transferred to chelyabinsk municipality. p. resided in the flat as a tenant until his death on 3 december 2010. however, it turned out that, according to the documents, the flat was no longer municipal property and that it belonged to l. the federal registration service sent the relevant data to the head of the municipality’s administration on 16 february 2011. the head of the administration asked the regional prosecutor to look into the situation with the flat. the prosecutor established that the flat had been subject to a number of transactions. on 3 december 1992 the transaction was registered by the registration service. sold the flat to l., who sold it on 21 april 2011 to ya. those transactions were also registered by the registration service. who denied having anything to do with the flat. accordingly the materials have been forwarded to the [police] for further inquiry ... .

the applicants were born in 1953 and 1957 respectively and live in the village of savelyevskaya, in the naurskiy district of the chechen republic. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. upon the arrival of the military in savelyevskaya, the local residents did not flee but remained in their homes. having witnessed the attack, a civilian, mr d., tried to approach the servicemen, but was shot dead in the presence of the applicants and mr m.r. managed to crawl away and inform the local authorities about the incident. according to the first applicant, as a result of the incident she lost sixteen head of cattle and the second applicant four head of cattle. 54262 had changed its stationing location from the vicinity of savelyevskaya to a site elsewhere, the applicants and their relatives found the remains of seven cows whose meat had been consumed by the military unit; nine head of cattle were missing completely. towards september 2000 the law-enforcement bodies in other parts of chechnya started to function again. she further stated that after her release the cattle had remained in the hands of the military and that all her efforts to recover them had been to no avail. had gone to the pasture where cattle had been grazing, including a number of cows belonging to her. at the military unit the applicants had been given medical assistance. the applicant had asked the unit commander to drive her cattle over to pasture land lying closer to the village. the commander had promised to do that but he had not kept his promise and her cattle had gone missing. on 23 october 2000 the investigators granted the second applicant victim status in the criminal case and questioned him again. his statement concerning the incident was similar to the ones given by the applicants (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). on 20 and 23 october 2000 respectively both applicants were granted victim status in the criminal case. two months later, on 12 december 2000, the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators. on 28 december 2005 the naurskiy district prosecutor’s office (hereinafter “the district prosecutor’s office”) replied to her, stating that she could access the file only upon the completion of the criminal investigation. on 28 january 2006 the investigators examined the envelope seized from the first applicant (see paragraph 21 above). as a result, the name and the address of officer b. (to whom it had been sent at an address in the town of kostroma) were established. on 20 february 2006 the investigators again questioned the first applicant, whose statement was similar to the ones she had given previously (see paragraphs 17 and 20 above). stated that he did not know what military unit it was. on 22 february 2006 the investigators questioned mr kh.s., his statement was similar to those given by the applicants. he had no information concerning the attack on the applicants and had no idea who had been the commander of the military unit at the material time. the reasoning for the decision stated, inter alia, the following:
“... the investigation established that an unidentified person had opened fire and wounded in the arm [the first and the second applicants], causing them medium and minor gravity bodily harm, respectively [...]
... it was also established that unidentified persons had committed the theft of sixteen cows belonging to [the applicants] and of two cows belonging to mr m.r. on 14 may 2008 the investigations department adopted a decision terminating the investigation in criminal case no. the decision criticised the investigators’ failure to take basic steps and stated, amongst other things, the following:
“... at the same time, the investigation established that the shooting had been aimed at them [the applicants, mr m.r., the military commander of the naurskiy district, officer a.s. on 19 june 2008 each applicant lodged a complaint before the district court challenging the investigations department’s refusal of 7 may 2008 to initiate a criminal investigation.
the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in hatay. who was around the same age, after falling into a water-filled hole on a construction site where they had apparently been playing. the cause of death was determined as drowning. during the course of the criminal proceedings the hatay criminal court of first instance obtained three different expert reports with a view to determining liability for the death of the applicant’s son. the first report, dated 16 april 1998, was drawn up by three civil engineers. the report noted at the outset that the hole in question, which measured 5 x 15 metres with a 2 metre depth, had been dug in the side yard of the construction for use as a shelter and no safety measures had been taken to enclose it. the experts noted that the municipality also bore 25% responsibility for the two children’s deaths, as (i) they had failed to duly inspect whether the construction, for which it had issued a permit, had complied with the rules on work safety, and to ensure that the construction site had been properly closed off with wooden panels as a safety measure, and (ii) it was not clear on what legal ground it had allowed the digging and the use of the hole in question as a shelter, as such shelters had to be built beneath buildings and not in open spaces. on 25 may 1998 a second report was prepared by three occupational safety experts. had disregarded all their warnings, saying that parents were responsible for attending to the safety of their children. relying on the information and evidence they had gathered, the experts concluded that h.c. the experts considered, lastly, that while the municipality had a general duty to inspect construction sites and impose penalties for breaches of the laws, they could not be held accountable for failing to conduct inspections, impose safety precautions or issue penalties unless it could be proven with conclusive evidence that the authorities had overlooked the deficiencies on the construction site despite having been aware of them, or had otherwise neglected their duties, which evidence was lacking in the instant case. that is why the hole was not closed off. [ on a previous occasion, we had pumped the rainwater out. i was in ankara at the time [of the incident]. ...
in view of the size and depth of the hole, it was not possible to cover it. we had therefore put planks around it... there were no warning signs around the hole. i was in ankara when the incident took place, and the construction had stopped while i was gone. and the municipality were 75% and 25% at fault respectively and that no liability could be attributed to the deceased children. were 25% and 75% responsible for the incident respectively. accordingly, the court found the accused guilty as charged. 4616, which provided, inter alia, for the suspension of criminal proceedings in respect of certain offences committed before 23 april 1999. the applicant and his family claimed 5,000,000,000 turkish liras (trl)[1] in respect of pecuniary damage and trl 3,000,000,000[2] in respect of non-pecuniary damage, together with interest accrued from the date of the incident. on 5 november 2004 an expert report was prepared by a mechanical engineer, who was also an expert on occupational safety, and an architect at the request of the hatay civil court of first instance. as for the alleged responsibility of the municipality, the experts stated that the latter had had no involvement in the construction, apart from issuing the necessary permits. accordingly, on 11 december 2007 the hatay civil court of first instance dismissed the case against the municipality. and his construction company had become final and that there was no need to render a new judgment in respect of that part of the case. the applicant did not appeal against that judgment, which eventually became final on 16 february 2009. and his company and the deceased children, had also been upheld by the court of cassation. on 15 november 2011 the adana district administrative court upheld the judgment of the first-instance court, and on 26 april 2012 it rejected rectification requests lodged by the applicant and his family. and his company, nor had they commenced enforcement proceedings against the latter.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in warsaw. on 30 march 2007 the applicant, who was at that time a journalist of the weekly magazine wprost, contacted a.c., the then rector of the university of gdańsk, in order to inform him that she considered him to be a long-term informant for the communist secret services in the past. she did not refer to any relevant documentary evidence in her possession. on 2 april 2007 the applicant published an article in wprost entitled “agents wearing ermine”, alleging that during the communist times a.c. had been an informant for the communist secret police. the article did not quote its sources, referring in general terms to unspecified documents. on 10 may 2007 the regional prosecutor in warsaw refused to institute a criminal investigation and informed a.c. on 15 may 2007 the magazine refused to do so. brought a private bill of indictment against the applicant and s.j., the editor-in-chief of the magazine at that time. it was submitted that this publication could discredit him in the eyes of the public and result in him losing the confidence necessary to perform his duties as a public university rector, a criminal offence punishable under article 212 of the criminal code. had made a true vetting statement to the effect that he had not been an informant for the communist secret services. she had neither informed him about any ipn documents on which she would be basing her allegations nor sought to meet him in person. he had never declared willingness to become one. in these files he was only referred to as being on the staff of the university in the 1970s. in the light of the documents available, the thesis advanced by the applicant was not only devoid of factual basis, but also incompatible with her obligation to show proper journalistic diligence. she had only received a decision from the director of the ipn allowing her to access the documents on 9 may 2007, after the article had been published and created a considerable media stir. prior to the publication to try to check the veracity of the information, apart from her telephone call to him whereby she had only informed him that she would be publishing the article. the warsaw district court concluded that the applicant had failed to show the journalistic diligence required of her under section 12 of the 1984 press act. the impugned articles contained unreliable information, which she had assessed in a superficial manner. being an informant for the communist secret police was perceived in society in an extremely negative manner. in the light of that material, it had to be concluded that the statements made in the article were untrue, or at least unfounded. it was limited by the criterion of truthfulness on the one hand, and the necessity to protect important values such as dignity, reputation, honour and the private life of individuals on the other. in the present case, the applicant had not had sufficient knowledge at her disposal to support the factual thesis she had advanced in the articles. she had therefore overstepped the limits of acceptable criticism, defamed the plaintiff and thereby committed a criminal offence. the court observed that the amount of the fine had been determined with regard to the degree of the applicant’s guilt. the publication of the articles had been her idea and she had written them. the applicant and her co-accused appealed, raising many procedural arguments. the defendants’ appeals were considered by the court to be unfounded.
the applicant, mr andrzej klibisz, is a polish national who was born in 1968 and is currently detained in włocławek prison. on 14 march 1996 the warsaw regional prosecutor issued another decision to retain the applicant in custody. they did not have access to the case file. on 2 june 1999 the warsaw regional court rejected an application for release lodged by the applicant’s lawyer. the latter decision was upheld by the same court on 13 may 2003. the applicant was present at the hearings and accompanied by his counsel. on 14 january 2003 the warsaw court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s motion. on 13 october 2005 the applicant brought a civil action under article 417 of the civil code, seeking compensation for the fact that in the official letter of 27 december 2004 the deputy governor (zastępca dyrektora) of radom remand centre had stated that the applicant was guilty of uttering threats against judge b. p.
on 8 june 2006 the radom regional court dismissed the applicant’s action. the envelope also bears a stamp reading “letter censored date ...” (“list ocenzurowano dnia ...”). the date of 18 december 2002 has been handwritten on the dotted line and an illegible signature is visible next to it. it appears that the applicant complained about the interference with his correspondence to the penitentiary authorities. the domestic court examined the case under article 23 of the civil code in conjunction with article 448 of that code. in this facility (200 km from his hometown) the applicant was detained during the following periods: (1) from 26 march 1997 until 14 january 1998; and (2) from 11 september until 9 october 2002. he did not make any specific submissions in respect of the conditions of his detention there. the applicant had one hour of outdoor exercise per day. (a)  description of the living conditions 112. it was also noted that one day after the applicant had been transferred to radom remand centre, the deputy director general of the prison service informed the remand centre’s administration that the applicant had been uttering threats against judge b.p. ( in addition 180 telephone conversations which the applicant had in 2004 in radom remand centre were controlled. because the applicant’s actions had been perceived as a serious violation of the remand centre’s internal discipline and order, an application for his disciplinary punishment had been filed with the remand centre’s governor on 23 november 2004 (see paragraphs 176 - 178 below). he considered that the governor’s decision to confiscate the brochure in question had been justified in the light of the fact that the applicant, in his letter to k.s., on 23 november 2004 the applicant lodged an appeal with the radom regional court to challenge the governor’s decision to impose a disciplinary punishment by placing him in solitary confinement. on 3 december 2004 the applicant filed with the lublin court of appeal via the radom regional court a complaint under the 2004 act alleging an unreasonable delay in the above-mentioned proceedings concerning the challenge to his disciplinary punishment. (iv)  conditions of the applicant’s detention during his disciplinary punishment
(α)  description of the living conditions 187. the applicant was detained in this prison (287 km from his hometown) from 8 until 24 april 2008. (b)  the applicant’s disciplinary punishment 211. in the applicant’s submission, the cell was like a dungeon, dark and not ventilated. it appears that the applicant made a number of penitentiary complaints in relation to his detention in pińczów prison under high‑security. the applicant submitted that on 20 may 2010 the wardens at tarnów prison had taken away all his documents concerning his proceedings before the domestic courts and the echr and his own law books. moreover, the applicant complained about the inconvenience of being frequently transferred between different prisons. instead, he had been sent to detention facilities across the whole country.
the applicant was born in 1995 and lives in kaunas. he was approached by a police car in which there were three officers a.r., they asked the applicant to stop and take his hands out of his pockets. the officers informed other police patrols in the neighbourhood that they were chasing a young man who fitted the description of one of the suspected robbers. he did not respond to our order to stop ... soon he was noticed ... close to the railway station ... and he was apprehended. she claimed that one of the officers had hit the applicant with a truncheon in the police car numerous times, and that afterwards his body had been covered in bruises and he had had difficulties walking. on 4 may 2012 the kaunas district court found the applicant guilty and fined him 150 lithuanian litai (ltl, approximately 43 euros (eur)). he didn’t complain about anything, so we didn’t take him to a doctor ... we delivered [the applicant] to his mother ... she began scolding her son and even thanked us for bringing him to her. was also questioned as a witness and the written record of his interview was almost identical to that of a.r. he took out a truncheon and began to hit me on various parts of the body. on 22 november 2011 the investigator examined twenty-two photographs of the applicant which had been taken by his mother on 23, 25 and 29 october 2011. several of the photographs showed a shoe with stains similar to bloodstains. the written record of the interview was almost identical to his previous statements (see paragraphs 13 and 23 above), and added:
“... i arrived at the place where [the applicant] had been apprehended ... he was actively resisting: he was kicking out and had fallen on the ground. after being asked to calm down and get into a police car, he continued disobeying those lawful orders and resisted being apprehended, he started biting, so he was warned that physical coercion would be used against him. we asked him why he had fled from the police. i can’t remember my exact words, but i let it be known that he must not hurt my daughter. i didn’t see the other officers acting inappropriately in respect of [the applicant] either.” on 28 november 2011 the investigator submitted a report to the head of the criminal investigation unit of the kaunas district police department, suggesting that no pre-trial investigation should be opened. she also asked for several investigative actions, such as interviews with her and with the applicant, and for the officers who had allegedly ill-treated the applicant to be identified. the following day the kaunas city prosecutor dismissed the request for the investigation to be transferred to the prosecutor’s office, finding no grounds to doubt the impartiality of the police investigator. he confirmed that on the night of 22 october 2011 he had been on duty together with officers o.k. on 3 august 2012 the applicant’s mother r. was questioned as a witness. around 3 a.m. that night, when we were eating in the trolleybus, my son undressed and i saw that his body was covered in bruises ... my son told me that one of the officers (the one with the shaven head) had beaten him up. that same day the applicant was granted victim status and further questioned. no other officers were in the car at that time. approached me and said, “now i will show you”. led me behind a wall, put an electroshock device on the left side of my stomach and threatened to use it if i didn’t defend his daughter from my friends; he also said that if he caught me one more time, he would beat me even more. the applicant denied having resisted the police officers or having sworn at them. the prosecutor held that physical force had been used against the applicant only to the extent that was strictly necessary to arrest him, and that the applicant’s allegations that he had been beaten up in the police car with a truncheon had not been proven. on 11 april 2013 the kaunas regional court upheld that judgment.
the applicant was born in 1958 and lives in prague. on 18 february 2008 the applicant was granted the right to reside permanently in the czech republic (a permanent residence permit). on 15 september 2008 the applicant re-registered his domicile in croatia. meanwhile, on 16 june 2008 the customs administration of the ministry of finance had instituted administrative proceedings (upravni postupak) with a view to establishing whether the applicant was liable to pay taxes on the importation of his vehicle and if so, in what amount. by a decision of 5 june 2009 the ministry of finance, as the second-instance administrative authority, dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the first-instance decision of 23 february 2009. in the proceedings it was established beyond doubt that on 15 june 2008 the accused was found operating the vehicle in question with foreign licence plates of the czech republic on the territory of croatia as if he satisfied the conditions for temporary admission, and that conduct was contrary to the conditions for temporary admission of goods set forth in the customs act or in the [istanbul] convention because he was a croatian national who at the time of the commission of the offence had his domicile in croatia. on the basis of these findings of fact, and in accordance with the foregoing provisions, this authority has established beyond doubt that the accused did not satisfy the conditions for temporary admission, and that, by handling the vehicle in question contrary to [those] conditions, he committed the administrative offence defined in section 241(1) subparagraph 10 of the customs act. and not to the accused, whereas the solemn statement of erc of 13 august 2008 suggested that it provided miljenko žaja with accommodation at the address [in prague]. however, by that evidence the accused did not prove that he had been living abroad. in particular, the applicant argued as follows:
“in the decision [of 29 october 2008] the high court for administrative offences totally wrongly quoted the text of article 5 subparagraph (b) ... of annex [c] to the convention on temporary admission by stating [that it] ‘provides that means of transport for private use must be registered in a territory other than that of temporary admission, in the name of a person having seat or domicile in a territory other than that of temporary admission, and [must] be imported and used by persons having domicile in such a territory’ [emphasis added]. the constitutional court considers that the relevant administrative authority and the high court for administrative offences, relying on the facts established in the proceedings, gave reasons for their views expressed in the contested decisions, which undoubtedly do not result from an arbitrary interpretation and application of the relevant substantive law. [in the present case] the administrative and judicial authorities acted within their jurisdiction established by law. it is evident from the case-file that the first-instance administrative authority took evidence in accordance with the administrative offences act and that the high court for administrative offences decided on the complainant’s appeal on the merits. the relevant provisions of the customs act (carinski zakon, official gazette, no. persons having domicile – seat in the customs territory are:

“a citizen’s residence [boravište] may be habitual or temporary. however, once established, domicile is not lost by the mere loss of one of its constituent elements. while a person may have only one domicile, it is clear (see section 1 of the domicile and residence of citizens act in paragraph 32 above) that he may at the same time have his domicile and (habitual) residence in different places (for example, students, army recruits, prisoners, long-term hospital patients, who study, serve or are being treated in a place different from the place of their domicile). 107/07 with subsequent amendments), which has been in force since 1 january 2008, are as follows. 326/1999 on the residence of foreigners in the territory of the czech republic (zákon č. it was incorporated into the croatian legal system by the government’s decree on accession to the convention on temporary admission (uredba o pristupanju konvenciji o privremenom uvozu, official gazette – international agreements, no. in particular, the court found that the plaintiffs had domicile in croatia not only because they had their registered domicile in the country, but also because they had had health and pension insurance there. 413-01/12-01/379 of 20 september 2012, no. in the case of customs control [aimed at] establishing whether the aforementioned conditions for the use of vehicles with foreign licence plates are met, it is necessary to provide as evidence a residence permit, residence registration [form] or [proof of] accommodation, employment, study or the like, abroad.” (ii)  the customs administration’s press release of 4 april 2011 53. the relevant part of that instruction reads as follows:
“the following instruction is given with a view to removing doubts and uncertainties and [in order to] harmonise procedures relating to the application of annex c to the convention on temporary admission and the use of cars with foreign licence plates in the customs territory of the republic of croatia:
lawful use of foreign means of transport within the customs territory of the republic of croatian is granted under the temporary importation procedure. this means that the right to the temporary importation of vehicles with foreign registration for private use may be exercised by persons who have a seat, domicile or habitual residence in the territory of another state. us-9157/2006-16 of 9 september 2009 the administrative court dismissed the subsequent action for judicial review against those decisions, relying on the fact that the plaintiff had registered domicile in croatia. us-11421/2005-7 of 31 july 2008 the administrative court relied on the definition of fiscal domicile and habitual residence provided in the general tax act (see paragraph 31 above) when interpreting the term “person resident” referred to in annex c to the istanbul convention . ...

the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in daugavpils. he stabbed another individual with a knife, as a result of which the latter died. the same day the police opened a murder investigation into the death. on 6, 7 and 13 october 2004 the police questioned the applicant as a suspect. during his first interview the applicant denied any involvement in the fight or the murder. afterwards, two other young men had joined in the fight, and the applicant had been kicked to the ground. at some point the applicant had noticed that a woman was restraining o. and not letting him approach the applicant. another unknown young man, who had not taken part in the fight, had restrained the applicant. on 24 december 2004, between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m., the applicant familiarised himself with the case file in the presence of s. he wrote in the relevant record that he had no remarks or requests, and also asked to be provided with a lawyer for his trial. on 3 january 2005 the public prosecutor transferred the case to the daugavpils court (daugavpils tiesa) for trial. on 18 february 2005 s. was assigned to the applicant’s case to assist him in the proceedings before the daugavpils court. on the same day s. familiarised himself with the case file. furthermore, s. had not been present when he had familiarised himself with the case file. on 7 april 2005 a first-instance hearing was held. on 16 june 2005 the applicant was provided with a state-appointed lawyer, d., to assist him in the proceedings before the daugavpils court. the applicant also asked d. to guarantee that he would persuade the trial court to order three new measures in order to obtain evidence. on 1 september 2005 the applicant submitted several written applications to the daugavpils court. the court further dismissed the applicant’s second application to end his pre-trial detention. in his subsequent written application (“a refusal” (отвод)), the applicant relied on article 99 of the code of criminal procedure and asked the court to release d. from his duties. the written application stated that the applicant was refusing the services of d. on the grounds that all applications made to the court on 1 september 2005 had been drafted by the applicant, and d. had not shown any interest in asking the court to order the examination of witness statements about the scene of the crime, new psychiatric expert evidence, or the correction of the motive in the bill of indictment. d. had merely supported the above applications. in reply to the applicant’s application, d. presented the applicant’s letter of 20 june 2005 to the court and invited it to establish whether the applicant needed a lawyer at all. on the same day the daugavpils court decided to uphold the applicant’s application to release d. from his duties and rejected his application for appointment of another legal aid lawyer. during the hearing of 1 september 2005, when invited by the court to put questions to witnesses, he refused to do so, stating each time that he would either ask questions when represented by a lawyer or not ask questions at all. in reply to a question put by the court, the applicant confessed that he had stabbed the victim, but stated that he had not intended to kill him. during the same hearing the daugavpils court verified that the applicant had duly received the document setting out the charges against him. in addition, the court relied on documentary evidence, such as the conclusions of the forensic psychiatric examination. the court dismissed that application, because the applicant had not made it in his appeal. on 8 november 2006 the regional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment. having examined the content of the applicant’s submissions, applications and complaints in the criminal proceedings, it did not find that any of the conditions of section 83 of the criminal procedure law had been fulfilled.
the applicant was born in 1947 and lives in tirana. by a final judgment of 21 june 1996 the tepelenë district court ordered the tepelenë district council (këshilli i rrethit) to pay the applicant 530,941 albanian leks (all) as compensation for the nationalisation of her house by the state in 1967. the judgment became final on an unspecified date in 1996. on 15 july 1998 an enforcement writ was issued. by a final judgment of 25 april 2008 the gjirokastër district court ordered the gjirokastër regional council (këshilli i qarkut) to pay the applicant all 1,237,336 as compensation for the delayed enforcement of the tepelenë district court decision of 21 june 1996. the judgment became final on 25 may 2008. on 27 june 2008 an enforcement writ was issued. from 1996 to 2009 the applicant had continuously addressed letters to the authorities for the enforcement of the final judgments. she also instituted enforcement proceedings before a bailiff. on 23 january 2009 the constitutional court acknowledged that there had been a breach of the fair trial as a result of the non-enforcement of the final judgments. on 8 december 2009 both judgments were enforced and the sums were paid to the applicant.
were born in 1939 and 1942 respectively and live in lauf. in 2006 the german secret service (bundesnachrichtendienst) bought a data carrier from a certain k. for a considerable amount of money. the data carrier contained financial data from the liechtenstein l. bank relating to 800 people. k., who had formerly been an employee of the l. bank, had illegally copied the data. the data carrier was submitted to the german tax investigation authorities, which subsequently instigated proceedings against, inter alia, the applicants, in relation to tax evasion crimes. the applicants were suspected of having made financial investments via these two associations with the l. bank in liechtenstein, for which they were liable for tax in germany. in their tax returns for the years 2002 to 2006. it indicated that the applicants had evaded tax payments of eur 16,360 in 2002, eur 24,270 in 2003, eur 22,500 in 2004, eur 18,512 in 2005 and eur 18,000 in 2006. on 23 september 2008 the applicants’ flat was searched and one envelope containing l. bank documents and five computer files were seized. the applicants appealed against the search warrant. they argued that the warrant had not been granted in accordance with the law. the acquisition of the data had also violated domestic law, as the secret service had no authorisation to obtain tax data. furthermore, the secret service was not authorised to forward tax data to the financial authorities and the prosecution, as this infringed the german legal principle of separation of the secret service and the police/prosecution (trennungsprinzip). on 8 april 2009 the bochum district court dismissed the appeal. the court had no doubt that it had been lawful to base the search warrant on the information contained in the liechtenstein data carrier, as, in its view, the data had neither been seized in direct violation of international law nor by circumventing international treaties. according to the court, there was no indication that the secret service had incited a third person to steal the data, and it had merely accepted the data from a third person when this person had offered it. thus, the liechtenstein data was not excluded as evidence and the search order could be based on it. on 11 september 2009 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with the federal constitutional court. they were of the view that the regional court and the district court should have decided that the search warrant had not been in accordance with the law, as the use of the liechtenstein data as a basis for a search warrant had violated international treaties and the sovereignty of liechtenstein, which had protested against the use of the data. the data purchase from k. had constituted a criminal act. moreover, the secret service had no authority under german law to purchase such data. they would thus have been obliged to declare the search warrant illegal. on 9 november 2010 the federal constitutional court dismissed the constitutional complaint as manifestly ill-founded. even if evidence was considered inadmissible in criminal proceedings, this did not automatically mean that the same was true for all stages of criminal investigations. in applying these general principles to the case at hand, the federal constitutional court ruled, at the outset, that it was not necessary to decide upon the question whether the acquisition of the data had been in breach of national or international law or violated the principle of the separation of the secret service and the prosecution in germany, as the regional court had departed in its decision from the applicants’ allegation that the evidence might in fact have been acquired in breach of domestic and international law, including criminal law. its finding that the applicants could not invoke international law in their favour only showed a different legal opinion without disregarding the applicants’ basic rights. furthermore, the federal constitutional court considered reasonable the district and regional court’s legal assessment that the principle of separation of the secret service and the prosecution had not been infringed, as the facts of the case did not show that the secret service had either ordered or coordinated the “data theft”, but had been offered the data on k.’s own initiative. acquiring data in such a way and passing it on to the prosecution could not violate the principle of separation, and hence could not render a search warrant unconstitutional. the federal constitutional court further considered that the regional court had struck a fair balance between the different interests at stake. the alleged breach of national and/or international law did not entail an imperative prohibition to use the evidence in the proceedings at issue.
at the time of lodging his application, he was detained in a centre for persons in preventive detention in hamburg-fuhlsbüttel prison. on 28 march 1994 the lübeck regional court convicted the applicant of rape and sexual assault. the court found that in august 1986 the applicant, having acted with full criminal responsibility, had raped an eighteen-year-old woman whom he had lured into a forest. it noted that between 6 october 1970 and 28 may 1991 the applicant had been convicted of five counts of rape of young women, committed only a couple of months after his release from prison. therefore, and having consulted a medical expert, the court found that the applicant had a propensity to commit serious sexual offences and was dangerous to the public. he had thus served ten years in preventive detention by 9 january 2012. it found that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder, for the purposes of section 1 (1) of the therapy detention act (see paragraph 23 below). he had a personality and conduct disorder as described by the relevant tool for the classification of diseases, the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems in its current version (icd-10). the expert had found that the applicant suffered from a profound and serious personality disorder with narcissistic elements and a lack of self-esteem. his disorder was characterised by denying and idealising conduct, total denial of his own aggression and minimisation of his criminal acts. furthermore, in the regional court’s view, there was still a high risk that the applicant, owing to the said specific circumstances relating to his person and his conduct, would commit the most serious sexual offences if released. however, the applicant, who had not completed therapy, had confirmed at the hearing that he refused transfer to the prison’s social therapeutic department. furthermore, the applicant had already raped six women and had repeatedly reoffended shortly after his release. on 24 october 2012 the applicant lodged an appeal against the regional court’s decision with the schleswig-holstein court of appeal. he argued that his continued preventive detention beyond the former ten‑year time-limit breached the basic law, as interpreted by the federal constitutional court, and the convention. the expert had been heard in person by the regional court in different proceedings (concerning the applicant’s transfer to a psychiatric hospital, see paragraph 19 below) on 6 june 2012 and had updated and confirmed his previous findings. his assessment had further been shared by the hamburg-eppendorf university hospital in its statement dated 27 march 2012 on the therapeutic progress made by the applicant. on 17 december 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the federal constitutional court. he complained that the extension of his preventive detention beyond the former statutory ten-year time-limit had violated his right to liberty and the protection of legitimate expectations in a state governed by the rule of law. in these circumstances, the courts had not had at their disposal a sufficient basis for concluding that he had a mental disorder for the purposes of the therapy detention act. in any event, he did not suffer from a mental illness as required by article 5 § 1 (e) of the convention. for as long as the applicant’s detention was executed at that prison during the time covered by the proceedings at issue, the applicant, having refused repeated offers of treatment, in particular transfer to the social‑therapeutic institution of lübeck prison, apparently did not undergo any therapy for sexual offenders. his occasional conversations with the prison psychologists had been discontinued in may 2012. that centre was built in order to comply with the constitutional requirement, as defined by the federal constitutional court in its judgment of 4 may 2011, to differentiate between preventive detention and imprisonment. he was granted leave without escort from march 2014 onwards. it was necessary for the applicant to undergo therapy for sex offenders in a social-therapeutic department in prison or possibly with an external social therapist. transferring the applicant, who was not willing to undergo therapy, to a psychiatric hospital against his will would not yield any success. it had regard to the report dated 28 august 2013, submitted by psychiatric expert l., on the applicant’s mental condition and the danger he represented. there was a medium risk that the applicant would again commit serious sexual offences if released. on 29 august 2014 the hamburg regional court, having regard to an additional report drawn up by expert l., declared the applicant’s preventive detention terminated and ordered his release on 1 october 2014.
as of october 2013, he was serving a life sentence in kherson prison no. the court sentenced him to life imprisonment with confiscation of property. according to him, he was held in an overcrowded, cold and damp cell located in a basement and lacking fresh air and sufficient daylight. according to the applicant, when he was transferred back to the itt on 4 november 2004 after his forensic psychiatric examination, the temperature in his cell was very low. nonetheless, the itt administration withheld his warm clothes. seven of those cells were identical: each of them measured 10 sq. each of them had a window and was equipped with a forced ventilation system. 105;
- from 23 to 25 november 2005 – in cell no. 101 was allegedly not glazed and the inmates had to cover it with blankets and plastic bags. there was no hot water supply and cold water was supplied irregularly. furthermore, he was allegedly denied the opportunity to use the common shower facilities. as the temperature inside was very low, he preferred not to wash himself. the applicant, being a life prisoner, was transferred from one cell to another every ten days. in some of them, the walls were covered with mold and fungus. it had sufficient daylight and artificial light. the cell had natural ventilation and the window could be opened from inside. in october 2012 some minor repairs were carried out in cell no. 8, showing a spacious and light room in a visually good state of repair. according to the applicant, those photographs had been taken after his detention in that cell and were of no relevance for his case. the applicant specified that it had not been so before october 2012. on 11 october 2004 the itt governor wrote to the simferopol prosecutor that, according to the conclusion of a tuberculosis specialist of the same date, the applicant was suffering from an active form of tuberculosis and required further examination and inpatient treatment in a hospital environment. on 26 october 2004, upon the applicant’s admission to the psychiatric hospital for his forensic psychiatric examination, a tuberculosis specialist examined him. he also had regular chest x-ray examinations. the applicant’s diagnosis remained the same and his x-raying showed no changes in the state of his lungs. on 18 october 2006 the applicant was transferred from the simferopol sizo to kherson prison no. in march 2009 his tuberculosis disease progressed again. on 5 may and 15 september 2009 he also refused from x-raying. as confirmed by a record in the applicant’s file of 16 november 2012, his x-ray examinations had not shown any positive changes in the state of his lungs since 2008. on 11 june 2006 the applicant sent his first letter to the court, in which he complained, in particular, about the physical conditions of his detention and the lack of adequate medical care. according to him (and confirmed by his three cell-mates), he had attempted to send his application form on 30 august 2006, but the administration of the simferopol sizo had refused to dispatch it unless he deleted any complaints about his conditions of detention there.
the applicant was born in 1943 and lives in london. the applicant is of cypriot origin and has lived all of his adult life in london. in 1997 he and another british national, c.g., bought a plot of land in the glyfada district of athens. asked the mortgage registry to register the deed of sale for the land in question. the mortgage registry refused to do so, since the state claimed ownership of the land. according to the forestry commission of the ministry of agriculture, the land had been classified as part of the forest estate since 1976. the investigating judge also accused him of having used the forged documents to persuade the administrative authorities that the land was privately owned and could be the subject of a transaction, in particular a deed of transfer. who had taken an oath on 17 april 2003 to discharge that function. when presenting his defence to the investigating judge on 29 march 2004, the applicant disputed the competence of the graphologist m.m.k. was not qualified and that her comments were incorrect. on 7, 28 and 29 december 2004 the applicant submitted three reports by a different expert, d.k., on an unspecified date the applicant and c.g. were committed for trial in the athens criminal court of appeal, sitting as a bench of three judges, on charges of forgery and the use of forged documents. the hearing, concerning not only the applicant but also other individuals whose cases had been joined to his, was initially set down for 8 may 2006 and was then adjourned until 30 october 2006 and subsequently 12 march 2007, as the defendants’ lawyers were unable to attend. it eventually took place on 12, 14 and 20 march 2007. the president adjourned the hearing and directed that the public prosecutor’s office was to ensure the attendance of the two experts. was present; he confirmed the findings set out in his three reports. the contents of which the court finds entirely convincing; in addition, the report’s credibility is backed up by the documents in the file and the witness testimony. on 20 march 2007 the applicant appealed against that judgment to the athens criminal court of appeal, sitting as a bench of five judges. the hearing eventually took place on 19, 26 and 29 march and 8 april 2010. at the end of the hearing, counsel for the defence asked the court of appeal to examine d.p. cannot be accepted as it is not deemed necessary in view of the evidence gathered so far. the court of appeal held that the applicant had had no factual or legal basis for challenging it, and that his objections were contradicted by the factual circumstances, which were established and undisputed. on 15 february 2010 the applicant appealed on points of law. he alleged that there had been a violation of article 6 § 3 (d) of the convention in that he had been convicted solely on the basis of the report by m.m.k., without having been allowed to cross-examine her at the hearings in the courts of first instance and appeal. she had not appeared in court despite having been called to give evidence. nevertheless, the applicant had been deprived of his right to cross-examine her. nevertheless, the court rejected the requests in the following terms, on sufficient and substantiated grounds: ‘the defendants’ request to call the graphologist [m.m.k.]
the applicant was born in 1938 and lives in mykolayiv. among other health conditions, he suffered from tuberculosis, aids and drug addiction. he also had an infected phlegmon (inflammation) on his right shin. was arrested on suspicion of drug-related crimes and placed in a temporary detention centre (“the itt”) belonging to the mykolayiv police. on 7 may 2007 the tsentralnyy district court of mykolayiv ordered a.g. during his detention in the itt, he was attended by the ambulance doctors who provided him with requisite medical treatment. on 19 may 2007 he was transferred to the surgical ward of the local hospital where he was treated for his phlegmon. following the treatment the doctors considered that he could be held in detention facilities. according to the results of the domestic investigations, at about 9.30 p.m. on 23 may 2007 an itt officer heard moaning coming from the cell where a.g. the officer checked the cell and saw him with his mouth open, breathing heavily and repeating that he felt bad and needed air. itt officers removed him from the cell and took him to the entrance area to get some fresh air, where they carried out first aid. an ambulance arrived at 9.43 p.m. and confirmed that a.g. according to the post-mortem examination report, a.g. died from ischaemic heart disease, which had been aggravated by acute heart failure. linear strangulation bruises were found on his neck, which indicated interrupted asphyxiation. according to the report, asphyxiation had been attempted ten minutes before death, and could have aggravated a.g. their decisions were quashed as unsubstantiated by supervising prosecutors and the courts, and further pre-investigation inquiries were ordered. on 14 december 2012 the authorities initiated criminal proceedings, in accordance with the 2012 code of criminal procedure. on 27 march 2013 an investigator at the prosecutor’s office of the zavodskyy district of mykolayiv terminated the criminal proceedings, finding no elements of a crime on the part of the itt officers in question. on 3 october 2013 the investigator terminated the criminal proceedings, concluding that there was no evidence to suggest that the itt staff had caused the death of the applicant’s son. he admitted that certain pieces of evidence could not be obtained. in particular, bed linen and a rope fashioned from bed linen, which had been found in the cell, could not be examined any further, as they had been destroyed after the post-mortem examination. for the same reasons, it was not possible to carry out a reconstruction of the events. he further noted that on 24 may 2007 a site inspection had been carried out, but no video-recordings or sketches of the scene had been made, and no photographs had been taken. relying on the available evidence, the investigator found that, shortly before his death, the applicant’s son had unsuccessfully attempted to commit suicide by asphyxiating himself with a rope which he had produced from the bed linen. according to the latest medical findings, his death had been caused by interrupted mechanical asphyxiation; the visible injuries on his neck suggested that heart failure had resulted from the attempted strangulation. as regards the applicant’s son’s condition during his detention, the available medical evidence suggested that a.g. had not had any acute condition necessitating his admission to hospital during his detention in the itt; on the other hand, he had been medically supervised within the itt. furthermore, his serious illnesses, such as the tuberculosis and hiv, suggested that his physical condition would have gradually deteriorated in any event. he added that the applicant’s son had been provided with appropriate nutrition and had not refused food.
the applicant was born in 1967 and lives in kharkiv. late in the evening of 15 august 2010 the applicant had a fight with his neighbour. the applicant claimed that he had acted in self-defence. the police officers then took the applicant to another part of the police station that he had just left, where they continued to ill-treat him. during that time the police officers put pressure on the applicant to admit that he had intended to murder his neighbour. the latter found that the applicant had sustained bruises on his head, nose, upper lip and chest. on 25 august 2010 the assistant prosecutor of the kyivskyy district prosecutor’s office of kharkiv (“the prosecutor’s office”) inspected the premises of the police station where the applicant had allegedly been ill-treated. he found traces of a brown substance on the floor, wall, and balcony, as well as on the pillowcase and two mattress covers. samples of the substance were taken and submitted to an expert for examination. and g. they all denied the allegations of ill-treatment and submitted that the applicant had sustained the injuries before being taken to the police station, namely during the scuffle with his neighbour. the applicant challenged that decision in the courts. on 11 april 2011 the court of appeal upheld the district court decision of 23 february 2011. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. on 10 may 2012 the district court reversed the decision of the prosecutor’s office of 29 october 2010, finding that the measures taken to examine the applicant’s allegations had been insufficient. according to the decision, which referred to the explanations by the police officers and other evidence, the applicant had left the police station at 9.45 a.m. on 16 august 2010 and there had been no involvement of the officers in any unlawful action in relation to the applicant. at 2.45 p.m. on 9 december 2010 an investigator with the district police arrested the applicant on suspicion of attempted murder. he further noted in his report that the applicant had been suspected of attempted murder, that he had a record of serious offences, and that his arrest would prevent the applicant from absconding and impeding the execution of a judgment. the investigator then charged the applicant and questioned him in relation to the case. it stated that the applicant had been charged with a serious crime, that he had two criminal offences on his record, and that he had no official income. furthermore, there had been no suggestion that the applicant could not be held in a detention facility for health reasons. on 4 february 2011 a bill of indictment was approved by the prosecutor and the case file was sent to the district court. the court stated that the applicant had been charged with a serious offence, was unemployed, had a criminal record, and had refused to admit his guilt. on 12 march 2012 the applicant was released from custody after giving a written undertaking not to abscond. the applicant also had a permanent place of residence where he lived with his family. it sentenced the applicant to two years of restriction of liberty. having regard to the period of the applicant’s pre-trial detention, the court found that the sentence had been served. he also asked the expert to state whether the injuries could have been inflicted by the applicant himself. on 11 december 2010, following the court decision of 10 december 2010 to hold the applicant in custody (see paragraph 27 above), he was taken under escort to the kharkiv pre-trial detention centre. on 14 december 2010 the applicant was examined by a forensic medical expert as requested (see paragraph 38 above). in his report of 15 december 2010 the expert stated that the applicant had sustained bruises on his face, neck, chest, left shoulder, right leg and right shin.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in stara zagora. the applicant worked as head teacher in a secondary school in stara zagora. on 19 july 2002 the head of the regional education inspectorate (“the rei”) of the ministry of education dismissed the applicant on disciplinary grounds. the applicant brought a claim against the rei, challenging the order for her dismissal and seeking reinstatement and compensation for lost earnings. by a judgment of 2 april 2003 the stara zagora district court (районен съд) allowed the applicant’s claims. that judgment was upheld by the stara zagora regional court (окръжен съд) and the supreme court of cassation on 18 july 2003 and 24 november 2005 respectively. in the course of the proceedings, neither the opposing party nor any of the courts raised any doubts as to whether the rei was the correct defendant in the case. following the entry into force of the judgment of 24 november 2005, the applicant applied to take up her duties on 6 december 2005. on the same day a new order for her dismissal was issued by the head of the rei. on an unspecified date, at the latest in january 2006, the applicant lodged an appeal against the dismissal order with the stara zagora district court, challenging its lawfulness, and seeking reinstatement to her previous post and compensation for loss of income. it appears from the case file that at the first court hearing, the date of which was not specified, the rei argued that it was not the proper defendant in the case and that the claims had to be addressed to the secondary school in which the applicant had been working prior to her dismissal. the rei submitted that article 61 § 2 of the labour code and section 37(4) of the education act provided that the applicant’s employer was the school. during a court hearing on 12 april 2006 the district court ruled in favour of the objection, and, reasoning that the proper defendant in the case was the school, discontinued the proceedings. the applicant appealed against that decision before the stara zagora regional court. on 26 may 2006 the regional court quashed the decision of the lower court, explicitly stating that the proper defendant in the applicant’s case was the rei. it remitted the case to the first-instance court for examination on the merits. by a judgment of 8 december 2006 the district court allowed the applicant’s claims. following an appeal lodged by the rei, on 27 april 2007 the regional court upheld the judgment. the rei lodged an appeal on points of law. on 16 april 2008 the plovdiv appeal court (апелативен съд), sitting as a court of cassation according to a legislative amendment entered into force in july 2007, quashed the judgment of the lower court and dismissed the applicant’s claims. it found that the rei was not the applicant’s employer under the law and was not, therefore, the proper defendant in the case. thus, the claims brought against it were unfounded. the court ruled that the applicant’s claims had to be brought against the school in which she had been working prior to her dismissal, as that school was her employer.
the applicant, mr claus moog, was born in 1972 and lives in cologne. the applicant’s son, d., was born on 18 july 1998. d. has been living with his mother ever since. since 1999, the parents have been in dispute over contact and custody. on 18 may 1999, upon the applicant’s request, the cologne family court (“the family court”) granted the applicant two visitation periods per week. this decision was modified on 24 march 2000 by a settlement according to which the applicant had a right of contact for eight hours every saturday. on 16 november 2001, after the appointed psychology expert had informed the family court that he considered that contact with the father was in the child’s best interest, the parties concluded an in-court settlement according to which contact between the applicant and his son should be re-established. by the end of 2001, the applicant had visited the child twice in kindergarten. on 7 january 2002 the applicant renewed his request to have a fine imposed, because ms k. was not cooperating. on 28 july 2002 the court-appointed expert, dr k., having examined the situation of both parents and their child, submitted her report regarding custody. she considered that the child enjoyed contact with his father. on 15 november 2005 the family court heard testimony from the child, who declared that he did not wish to see his father anymore. on 18 january 2006 the applicant once again applied for contact. on 13 september 2006 the experts informed the family court that they had been unable to supervise contact because ms k.’s counsel had informed them that both ms k. and the child had been advised not to talk to the applicant on medical grounds. the child reacted to this excessive control in a violent manner. it found that d. had been pleased when he had met his father. if he had appeared to react emotionally, this had presumably been provoked by his mother. according to this report dr d. highly recommended family therapy in order to prepare contact between the child and the applicant. the child declared that he wanted to be left in peace and did not want to see his father. he could imagine visits if his parents stopped quarrelling and if his father did not oblige him to go to the youth office. according to the child’s school teacher the child needed respite from the legal situation and the applicant lacked empathy. he added that he only saw his paediatrician rarely. according to a medical certificate issued by a psychologist dated 7 january 2008, ms k. suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder manifesting itself in uncontrollable agitation patterns, palpitations, feelings of panic, trembling, nausea and feelings of helplessness and despair. this would seriously jeopardise his welfare. this should be avoided considering his ongoing therapeutic treatment. on 5 january 2009 the applicant appealed against the family court’s suspension of contact. on 30 june 2009, the cologne court of appeal rendered its decision on the basis of the case-file and confirmed the family court’s decision to suspend contact (see paragraph 30 above), even though this decision meant that ms k., who – for whatever reason – had wanted to prevent contact with the applicant, had managed to attain her aim. these statements demonstrated that d. had established an association between his father and the court hearings, which he disliked. only a period of respite could give d. the feeling that he could decide on his own whether he wished to see his father. furthermore, this period of time would also allow ms k. to reflect on her behaviour.
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in vlora. on 30 may 2007 the vlora district court ordered the vlora construction police (policia e ndërtimit dega vlorë) to pay the applicant 2,795,956 albanian leks (“all”) for the unjustified destruction of his property. on 11 june 2008 the decision was upheld by the vlora court of appeal and became final. on 11 september 2008 an enforcement writ was issued. from 2009 to 2012 the bailiff unsuccessfully sought the enforcement of the decision from the vlora construction police and the national urban construction inspectorate (inspektorati ndërtimor urbanistik kombëtar). to date, the final decision has remained unenforced.
the applicant was born in 1982 and is detained in hm prison dovegate, uttoxeter. the minimum period (“tariff”) was set at two years, eight and a half months, less time spent on remand. the tariff expired on 18 april 2004 and he became eligible for parole. the parole board subsequently examined his case in order to review whether his detention remained necessary for the protection of the public. on 26 may 2005 it decided not to direct his release but recommended that he be transferred to open conditions. that recommendation was rejected by the secretary of state. at the conclusion of its statement of reasons for rejecting the board’s recommendation, the national offender management service (“noms”) wrote:
“the secretary of state has therefore decided that you should remain in closed conditions and your next review will conclude in january 2008.” the accompanying letter stated:
“it has been decided that your case will next be referred to the parole board for a provisional hearing to take place in january 2008. ...
you will be notified by the parole board nearer the time about the exact date of that hearing. this consideration will take place approximately 12 weeks prior to your provisional hearing [in january 2008]. the case was referred to the parole board on 21 december 2007. on 16 may 2008 the parole board gave case-management directions requiring additional reports. on 8 october 2008 the parole board received the further reports requested. the hearing took place on 8 january 2009. on 23 january 2009 the parole board directed the applicant’s release. he was released from prison four days later. meanwhile, in autumn 2008, the applicant commenced judicial review proceedings against the secretary of state and the parole board seeking damages for the delay in holding the hearing. he relied on article 5 § 4 of the convention. he was granted permission to bring proceedings on 13 october 2008. on 5 june 2009 the claim was dismissed by the high court. leave to appeal was granted by the court of appeal on 27 october 2009. on 14 december 2010 the court of appeal handed down its judgment. damages on the basis of a loss of liberty were therefore appropriate. it distinguished between cases where the delay had merely led to feelings of frustration and those where it had been established that, but for the delay in the holding of the hearing, the applicant would have been released earlier. the parole board sought leave to appeal on the ground that the award was excessive. in respect of his latter argument, he relied on this court’s findings in james, wells and lee v. the united kingdom, nos. 25119/09, 57715/09 and 57877/09, 18 september 2012. on the matter of damages for the violation of article 5 § 4 of the convention, lord reed reviewed relevant case-law of this court where a violation of article 5 §§ 1, 3 or 4 had been found, focusing in particular on cases concerning a delay in holding a hearing intended to address the question whether a convicted prisoner should be released. while, he said, an appellate court would not interfere with an award of damages simply because it would have awarded a different figure if it had tried the case at first instance, in the applicant’s appeal the court was being invited to give guidance as to the appropriate level of awards in cases of this character. ... in the light of that analysis, and applying the general approach which i have described ..., it appears to me that an award in the region of £6,500 would adequately compensate mr faulkner for his delayed release, bearing in mind the conditional and precarious nature of the liberty foregone.
the applicant was born in 1977 and prior to his arrest his permanent address had been in svitlovodsk, kirovograd region. on 26 june 2014 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of committing a drug-related offence and on 7 july 2014 placed in kirovograd remand prison no. on 27 june 2014 the svitlovodsk court remanded the applicant in custody. the applicant appealed, arguing in particular that he was suffering from hcv. on 6 august, 27 november and 3 december 2014 and on 9 january and 4 june 2015 the applicant consulted the prison doctor, complaining in particular of discomfort in the hypochondrium (below the lower ribs), on the right-hand side. the applicant asked for a medical certificate, to be provided to the courts examining his criminal case. according to three separate reports signed by three prison employees, during three of those consultations – those of 6 august and 27 november 2014 and 4 june 2015 – the applicant was offered an opportunity to undergo a “blood test” (it is unspecified of which type) to verify whether he had hcv but refused without giving any reasons. the applicant denied the latter allegation. on 13 august 2014 the prison’s medical unit issued a certificate stating that the applicant, according to his own statement, was suffering from hcv and that during his stay in the prison he had consulted the prison doctor on several occasions in this connection and received treatment for his symptoms. on 3 march 2015 a blood test, apparently an hcv antibody test, came up positive. on the same day an ultrasound examination showed that the applicant’s liver had undergone diffuse changes. on 19 june 2015 the acting president of the section, upon the applicant’s request under rule 39 of the rules of court, decided to indicate to the government that they should present the applicant urgently for medical examination by a specialised doctor of the city hospital; secure for the applicant immediately, by appropriate means, treatment to his state of health; and inform the court by 17 july 2015 about the applicant’s state of health and the measures undertaken. from 6 until 9 july 2015 the applicant underwent an in-patient examination at the city hospital in the course of which a number of blood tests and an ultrasound examination were conducted and the applicant was examined by a number of specialists. on 9 july 2015 the hospital issued an opinion according to which the applicant was suffering from сhronic hcv “in an inactive phase” and liver impairment. he was prescribed hepatoprotectors (carsil and ursohol). on 14 july 2015 the government informed the court about the applicant’s examination at the city hospital. on 26 august 2015 the court invited the government to comment on those allegations. on 1 september 2015 the applicant started to be treated with hepatoprotector medicine. on 3 september 2015 he underwent general and biochemical blood tests which, according to the government, revealed no abnormality. on 15 september 2015 he was consulted by a gastroenterologist and an infectious diseases specialist, who confirmed the diagnosis of inactive chronic hepatitis. on 15 september 2015 the government informed the court of the measures taken from 1 to 15 september 2015. the cpt is concerned by the lack of systematic screening and treatment for blood-borne viral hepatitis in the ukrainian prison system. in 2013 the ukrainian parliamentary commissioner for human rights published a special report dedicated to the monitoring of the observance of the right to medical care in the remand prisons within the purview of the state correctional service of ukraine. diagnosing and treating hepatitis in patients was not a priority for remand prisons’ medical units. testing was only voluntary and could only be conducted on the initiative of the prisoner in question. in practice it was difficult to get hepatitis diagnosed and treated. where this happened, treatment was mainly conducted at the expense of relatives and friends, who furnished medications to prisoners. only prisoners with hiv/aids could receive hepatitis treatment at public expense. on 29 april 2013 the cabinet of ministers approved a state programme for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of viral hepatitis for the period until the end of 2016. the programme stipulates a number of goals to be achieved over that period, including extending access to hepatitis treatment to 30% of all patients.

the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in moscow. an eu-russia summit was scheduled for 17 and 18 may 2007 to take place in samara. he was accompanied by several activists who were also travelling to the rally. the parties have submitted different versions of events as to what then happened. the applicant was required to leave the check-in area and to follow officer a. he was taken to a police office on the second floor of the airport. five other persons from his group were escorted from the check-in hall in the same manner. the applicant replied that his ticket had been purchased lawfully and refused to give any further explanation, relying on his constitutional right to remain silent. the applicant has submitted three documents in support of his version of events. the first is a copy of the record (протокол) of search and confiscation completed by captain n. it records that the applicant was searched and his aeroplane ticket confiscated, in accordance with articles 21.1, 27.7 and 27.10 of the code of administrative offences (see relevant domestic law at paragraphs 25 and 26 below). at the bottom of the record, the applicant has written that it had been explained to him that the search and seizure could be appealed to a higher authority and that, while the record had been handed to him at 1 p.m., the actual seizure of the ticket by officer a. had taken place at 8.30 a.m. at the check-in desk. at the same time, they indicated that we have to provide an explanation to the police officers because some tickets were allegedly forged. on 18 may 2007, officers from the branch, acting on that information, were present at check‑in and examined the tickets of all passengers on the flight. in the course of their checks, twenty tickets bearing signs of forgery were found: they had worn spots and the forms on which the tickets were printed appear dubious. those tickets were confiscated and the passengers who had presented them were prevented from boarding. if it had been, the applicant would have been able to make a written comment to that effect in the search record which had been drawn up by the police, but he had not done so. on 28 june 2007 the prosecutor’s office decided not to open criminal proceedings against the policemen. the decision stated, in so far as relevant, as follows:
“... on 18 may 2007 the [police] together with the sheremetyevo airport security service carried out a check of the passengers leaving on the flight no. ...thirteen plane tickets were found to have traces of forgery, such as scuff marks, and also the ticket blanks used for printing the tickets were suspicious. [the police] seized the tickets and removed the passengers from the flight. [ on 18 may 2007 [s.], together with [the operative officer a.b.] together with the [airport security screening service] they checked all passengers, which included screening their luggage with special equipment and checking their documents. because of that, thirteen suspected forged tickets were seized and the passengers were questioned about the circumstances of their purchase. moreover, several passengers decided not to fly, without explaining why. on the same day similar checks were conducted for other flights to samara. ...
an expert examination of the twenty seized tickets ... revealed that seven tickets had no corrections of the original content. for thirteen of the tickets, the examination revealed that secondary text had been added on top of the original text in the fields ‘flight number’ and ‘time’. the applicant challenged this decision before a court under the procedure set out in article 125 of the code of criminal procedure. on 20 july 2007 the golovinskiy district court of moscow examined and rejected the applicant’s appeal. it also observed that the applicant had challenged the prosecutor’s refusal to open criminal proceedings claiming, inter alia, that the police had unlawfully restricted his liberty and in violation of his right to freedom of expression and to freedom of assembly. it upheld the finding that no criminal offence could be imputed to the police officers in question.
the first applicant, ms jenőné barcza, was born in 1962 and lives in solymár; the second applicant, ms jánosné básits, was born in 1957 and lives in dunabogdány; the third applicant, mr lászló pávai, was born in 1930 and lived in leányfalu. the applicants were co-owners of a vacant plot of land situated in the urban area of the municipality of leányfalu. it was originally designated as non-agricultural land and registered under plot no. according to this decision, the applicants’ property, together with other plots of land, formed part of the protection zone. the administrative decision ordered the owner of the protected water reserve, the hungarian state, to make an offer compensating the owners of the plots of land within the protection zone within sixty days. the decision also required that if the owner of the protected water reserve was different from that of the land in the protection zone, the owner of the protected water reserve had the obligation to acquire ownership of the land in the protection zone, either through expropriation or through a sale and purchase agreement (see paragraphs 24 and 25 below). that decision also quashed the obligation to proceed with compensation for the landowners within sixty days. by a decision of 4 october 2005 the szentendre district land registry redesignated the applicants’ plot of land as an “inner protection zone”. under the law, owners of land within the water protection zone were under an obligation to refrain from any activity that could endanger water quality or lead to pollution and from constructing any facility that did not serve the purposes of the water reserve. moreover, they were obliged to allow the use of their property for any work necessary for the maintenance of the water reserve (see paragraph 25 below). the directorate transferred the request to the central danube valley inspectorate for environmental protection, nature conservation and water management (közép-dunavölgyi környezetvédelmi és vízügyi igazgatóság), which, due to lack of jurisdiction, returned the case to the directorate on 13 december 2005, informing the ministry of environment protection and water management about the measure. on 12 april 2006 the ministry instructed the danube regional waterworks inc. ( the managing body of the water reserve, that the expropriation fell within the waterworks’ competence. meanwhile, in proceedings initiated by some of the landowners, the pest county regional court established that the treasury asset management directorate was under an obligation to proceed with the expropriation. accordingly, the applicants made a new representation to the ministry on 31 october 2007, asking it to make an offer within thirty days of receipt of the letter. on 11 august 2008 the owners of the plots of land, including the applicants, asked the central hungarian regional administration office (közép-magyarországi regionális közigazgatási hivatal) to instruct the ministry to proceed with the expropriation by setting a time-limit. their request was dismissed on 11 august 2008. the owners sought judicial review of this decision. by a decision of 22 october 2009 the pest county regional court overturned the administrative decision and remitted the case to the administration office, stating that the three-year period had expired since the expropriation proceedings were initiated, on 16 november 2005, at which time the claimants had offered their plot of land for sale. on 2 december 2008 the danube regional waterworks informed the applicants that any measure concerning the ownership of the disputed plot of land fell within the competence of the state. on 19 january 2009 the central directorate for water and environment informed the applicants that it had appointed a limited liability company to prepare the sale and purchase agreements and the documents necessary for the expropriation by 29 may 2009. on 27 january 2009 the limited liability company forwarded a purchase offer for the acquisition of the applicants’ plot of land for 3,974,000 hungarian forints (huf – approximately 13,000 euros (eur)). the applicants disputed the amount of the compensation; nevertheless, the case file indicates that they never received an answer to their submissions. on 14 december 2010 the pest county governmental office (pest megyei kormányhivatal) (the legal successor of the central hungarian regional administration office) ordered national asset management inc. ( after the deadline had passed the applicants applied to national asset management inc. seeking the enforcement of the compulsory expropriation decision. the application was granted by the government office; despite this national asset management inc. did not respond to any of the measures taken by the government office. accordingly, the government office proceeded with the expropriation of its own motion, commissioning an expert opinion and holding hearings. the applicants received the compensation on 27 january 2012.

“[the applicant] is charged with serious offences, which fact suggests that, being a former law enforcement officer, if released, he may interfere with the establishment of the truth, influence or threaten witnesses and victims, continue criminal activities or abscond and it will not be possible to complete the investigation or conduct a trial. the court considers that [a less strict] restrictive measure cannot be applied.” the applicant remained in custody pending investigation and trial. relying on the seriousness of the charges against the applicant, the district court extended the applicant’s detention during investigation on 30 october and 18 december 2008. on 15 july and 20 october 2009, 20 january, 15 april, 16 june, 19 august and 15 november 2010 the supreme court of the bashkortostan republic extended the applicant’s detention pending trial. each time the supreme court issued a collective detention order in respect of five defendants, including the applicant, and noted that the circumstances underlying their remand in custody had not ceased to exist. relying further on the seriousness of the charges against the five defendants, the supreme court reasoned that, if released, they might abscond, continue criminal activities or interfere with the establishment of the truth. the applicant’s appeals were to no avail. on an unspecified date the applicant was charged with abuse of power and organisation of a criminal gang. on 27 december 2010 the supreme court of the bashkortostan republic found the applicant guilty of several counts of causing and inciting prostitution of minors, abuse of power and unlawful breaking and entering. he was acquitted of organisation of a criminal gang and one count of causing and inciting prostitution of minors. on 27 april 2011 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the applicant’s conviction on appeal. on 21 july 2011 the applicant was released on parole. following the remand in custody on 5 september 2008, the applicant was detained in remand prison no. on 20 april 2009 the applicant was transferred to remand prison no. iz 3/5 in dyurtyuli where he was detained until 12 october 2009. on 27 february 2009 the applicant sent a letter to the court alleging a violation of his right to liberty and asking the court to send him an application form. his letter was registered as application no. on 17 april 2009 the court sent a letter to the applicant which contained an application form to be filled out. in the letter the court advised the applicant that he was to submit a completed application form by 12 june 2009. the court’s letter was sent to remand prison no. the applicant was not detained at the remand prison at the moment and the court’s letter was forwarded, to correctional colony no. according to the stamp on the court’s letter of 17 april 2009, the correctional colony received it on 2 september 2009. then the administration of the correctional colony sent the letter back to remand prison no. the remand prison received it on 14 september 2009 and forwarded it to remand prison no. the letter arrived there on 2 october 2009 and on the same day the applicant received it (according to the applicant, he received the letter on 5 october 2009).
the applicant was born in 1961 and lives in kaunas. the purpose of the loan was to build or buy an apartment. the apartment was pledged to the bank as collateral. both loans were administered by a state bank, the state commercial bank of lithuania (hereinafter “the bank”). in 1998 that bank transferred the claims to some of its loans, including both of the applicant’s loans, to another state bank, the savings bank of lithuania. on 13 august 2001 the applicant concluded an agreement with a third party, a.e., the right to restoration of title in respect of 1.47 hectares of land in kaunas. had owned a total of 68.26 hectares of land in kaunas. on 10 november 2001 the kca forwarded to the ministry of finance a list of individuals, including the applicant, whose property rights it had decided to restore by cancelling their debts to the state. ’s land, as established by the kaunas district court (see paragraph 7 above), had been incorrect, and recommended that the kca suspend the restoration of property rights in respect of any land which had previously been considered as belonging to s.f. the kca and the applicant participated in the reopened proceedings as third parties. on 25 october 2004 the prosecutor asked the kaunas regional administrative court to revoke the order suspending the enforcement of the kca’s decisions concerning the restoration of property rights in respect of s.f. on 26 october 2004 the kaunas regional administrative court granted the prosecutor’s application. on 6 december 2004 the ministry of finance issued a certificate confirming the cancellation of the applicant’s outstanding debt to the state, amounting to ltl 112,896 (eur 32,697). on that same day the bank received the certificate from the ministry and cancelled the applicant’s debt. it appears that from 23 october 2001 to 6 december 2004 the applicant did not make any loan repayments to the bank and the bank did not request any such payments. it asked the kaunas district court to order interim measures – seizing the applicant’s apartment. on 7 february 2005 the kaunas district court seized the applicant’s apartment and informed her that, following her failure to repay the debt under the loan agreement of 2000 within one month, the apartment would be sold at auction. the applicant submitted that from 23 october 2001 until 6 december 2004 she had repeatedly contacted the bank and asked it to not count the interest and late payment fines. on 22 february 2006 the kaunas district court granted the bank’s civil claim in part. accordingly, it ordered the applicant to pay the bank ltl 2,705.52 (eur 783.57). accordingly, the court decided that the bank had no grounds to claim late payment fines, and ordered it to return to the applicant ltl 72.25 (eur 20.93) which she had already paid. the applicant’s counterclaim was dismissed. the applicant appealed against that judgment, but on 1 june 2006 the kaunas regional court dismissed her appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment in its entirety. as submitted by the applicant and not disputed by the government, on an unspecified date in 2006 the applicant paid ltl 10,231.23 (eur 2,963.17) in interest and late payment fines requested by the bank under that agreement. on 26 april 2007 the applicant submitted to the kaunas regional administrative court a civil claim for damages against the kca only. the kca had acted lawfully and diligently by suspending the restoration of the property rights and initiating the reopening of the proceedings. had owned less land than initially determined (48.40 hectares and 47.91 hectares, as opposed to the initial estimate of 68.26 hectares) showed that the suspension had had a proper basis. accordingly, the court concluded that the kca had acted lawfully and there were no grounds to award damages to the applicant. accordingly, the supreme administrative court concluded that the kca could not be held responsible for the suspension of the restoration of the applicant’s property rights and the cancellation of her debt, and thus there were no grounds to award her damages.

the applicant was born in 1967 and until his conviction lived in ivdel, a town in the sverdlovsk region. in april 2000 the applicant was arrested on charges of murder and arson. on 24 july 2000, as the investigation unfolded, the local official newspaper the north star printed an interview with a deputy town prosecutor about a spike in murder rates. the prosecutor said:
“in the first half of 2000 our town reported fourteen murders – a historic high, it seems. twelve of them have already been solved, thanks to the industry of the police department and the investigators from the prosecutor’s office....
the fingerprint identification of ex-convict [n.b.] ( whose body was found in [a river]) has allowed to discover his enemies and to prove that he was beaten by three inhabitants of ivdel seeking [...] to settle scores for his murder of [another man] for which [he] had served almost nine years. ’s] two murderers – [the applicant’s codefendant] and s. turyev, both ex-convicts – were complicit in the early‑march murder of [l.r.] who had dared to report them to the police for past wrongs. [ her] body was dumped in a wood near the airport and was found only in may. as those crimes were not solved in time, [the applicant’s codefendant] rampaged on and on 20 april killed [another woman] who had witnessed the night-time arson at vizhayskaya street that had killed five. and [the other woman] (whose body was found in a well next to the sports centre) had been garrotted with a wire. all three persons arrested in this multicount case will undergo forensic psychiatric observation because of the gravity of the crimes committed, which carry up to twenty years or life in prison. but even after these downright senseless murders, the crime wave in the town continued.” when the case came to trial before the sverdlovsk regional court, the applicant moved to disqualify the prosecutor for the prejudice apparent in that interview. on 4 october 2002 the court refused the motion because the prosecutor had only cited facts from the investigative file, had affirmed the applicant’s complicity but not his guilt, and was not personally interested in the outcome of the trial. on 22 january 2003 the court sentenced the applicant to twenty years’ imprisonment for arson and the murders of n.b. on 23 october 2003 the supreme court upheld the sentence, leaving unanswered the applicant’s complaint about the press interview. in reply to a post-conviction complaint brought by the applicant, in december 2004 the sverdovsk regional prosecutor’s office found that the interview had breached the agency’s ethics policy as it had preceded the trial without, however, tangibly redressing the applicant.
the applicants were prosecuted in russia for various crimes. they were arrested and detained pending investigation and trial. their detention was ordered and extended by the courts. the detention orders were essentially based on the gravity of the charges, the primary grounds being the risk of the applicants’ absconding and interfering with the course of justice. the detention and extension orders used stereotyped formulae, without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures. the first applicant was born in 1973 and lived, prior to his arrest, in yekaterinburg, sverdlovsk region. in 2007 the applicant was arrested in ukraine. on 24 may 2008 he was extradited to russia and was placed in pre-trial detention until 27 december 2010 when he was released on bail. on 22 april 2011 the kirovskiy district court of yekaterinburg convicted him of fraud. the second applicant was born in 1978 and lived, prior to his arrest, in angarsk, irkutsk region. on 23 september 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of fraud. on 25 september 2007 the court remanded him in custody. on 24 june 2010 the irkutsk regional court convicted the applicant of fraud. the third applicant was born in 1967 and lived, prior to his arrest, in yekaterinburg. the applicant was arrested on 16 august 2012. on 17 august 2012 the court held to place him in pre-trial detention. on 10 october 2013 the sverdlovsk regional court convicted the applicant of trespass, battery, robbery and sexual assault.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lived in cheboksary before his conviction. he is currently serving a sentence in novocheboksarsk. on 9 september 2006 a criminal case was opened into her murder. according to ms p. and two other female witnesses, the applicant had no injuries before his arrest. according to the applicant, police officers ch. they allegedly beat him up, delivering blows to his head, ears, body and legs, and threatened him with rape. this course of events was reported by police officers ch. and f. to their superior on 7 october 2006. and f. after surgery his right foot was in plaster and his left foot had a weight fixed to it. from 7 to 8.30 p.m. that evening an investigator from the moskovskiy district prosecutor’s office questioned him as a witness in the murder case. at 1.10 p.m. on 10 october 2006 an investigator from the district police drew up a record of the applicant’s arrest at 1 p.m. that day as a suspect in the theft case. on the same day the district court extended his arrest until 16 october 2006. the district court remanded him in custody. the judgment entered into force on 5 april 2007. he was diagnosed with a closed head injury, concussion, bruises and scratches on the head soft tissue and left hip and knee joints, and fractures to both feet. 217 had been inspected and no weights had been found. in the most recent refusal issued on 2 december 2008 investigator a. from the cheboksary investigative committee found that the applicant, who had been wanted in the theft case, had been arrested and taken to the police station and remained there on suspicion of committing it. and f. had handcuffed him lawfully in order to guard him and prevent him from escaping or harming himself or others. he had been handcuffed in hospital to prevent him from attempting to escape again. his allegations that he had been subjected to physical violence had not been confirmed. however, the lack of any detailed description of those injuries in the applicant’s medical records had made it impossible to establish when and how they had been received, in particular whether they had been received as a result of him falling from the first floor or being beaten up. the investigator’s decision of 2 december 2008 referred, inter alia, to statements by police officers ch. 217 about the theft and the murder of g. of which he had been suspected. the applicant had given a partial confession to the theft but had denied murder. in september 2006, after the murder of g., the applicant had been hospitalised for a drug overdose, but had not been arrested because after the hospital had alerted the police he had managed to escape. claimed that he had been putting documents into a safe at the time, while f. said that ch. access to the window had been blocked by the table. it had been possible to reach and open it while sitting at the table. the decision of 2 december 2008 also referred to the applicant’s statements that immediately before his arrest he had been drinking, and to statements by the investigator from the district police and a police officer who had guarded the applicant at the hospital on 9 october 2006 that the applicant had allegedly stated off the record that he had jumped out of the window himself trying to flee, without any influence by the police officers. the decision of 6 march was upheld on appeal on 12 april 2007 by the supreme court of chuvashiya, which noted that it was necessary to assess the lawfulness of the handcuffing and guarding of the applicant in hospital before his detention in the criminal proceedings.

“[the report begins with a detailed account of the applicant’s personal and medical history with a special accent on the events related to the assembly and use of explosive devices and his subsequent involuntary treatment in psychiatric facilities.] [mr makarov] refused medication stating that ‘he [had] a sufficient supply’. in recent months the attending psychiatrist has observed changes in his mental state – mood swings from depression to hypomania, statements about ‘social pressure’, and conflicts with local and regional public bodies. during the appointments he mentioned ‘bad ideas about killing mr b. [the governor of the region]’ ...
mental state: conscious. does not engage in discussion, leaves the doctor’s office, slams doors. refuses to consume food and to give samples for analysis. suspicious of all statements and actions directed at him. conclusion: considering the clinical history of severe mental disorder, avoidance of in- and outpatient treatment, criminal behaviour in acute mental state in the past, his own complaints about ‘worsening’ of the condition, coupled with refusal of voluntary treatment, the panel [considers involuntary hospitalisation in a psychiatric facility to be necessary] ...” 10. on monday, 17 september 2012 the hospital applied for judicial authorisation of the applicant’s involuntary hospitalisation under section 29 (a) and (c) of the psychiatric assistance act 1992, since the applicant was a danger to himself or others and there was a risk of significant damage to his health owing to the deterioration or aggravation of his psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric assistance. on the same day the gorno-altayskiy town court (горно-алтайский городской суд, hereinafter “the town court”) received the application and extended the applicant’s detention until 20 september 2012. on 19 september 2012 the town court granted the application for the applicant’s involuntary hospitalisation. the hearing was attended by the applicant, his counsel mr m., the representative of the hospital, and the prosecutor. upon an application by the prosecutor, the court ordered that the hearing be held in camera in order to protect the applicant’s privacy in respect of his medical condition; the applicant himself and his representative objected to that decision. complained of persecution by local media, officials, insisted on obtaining a certificate concerning aggravation of his mental condition. schizotypal personality disorder in acute state. [the order goes on to provide an account of the applicant’s most recent hospitalisation and reproduces the relevant parts of the medical counselling panel report.] the court considers that the report of the medical counselling panel was prepared by competent professionals in the relevant field of studies, and due consideration was given to the clinical history of mr makarov ... the report contains the symptoms [showing the severity of mr makarov’s condition], it states the diagnosis. there are no reasons to doubt the objectivity and impartiality of the experts. on 29 october 2012 his counsel lodged an additional statement of appeal. on 14 november 2012 the supreme court of the republic of altay (верховный суд республики алтай) dismissed the appeal and upheld the lower court’s order as well-reasoned and lawful. concerning the applicant’s detention beyond the time-limit without a court order, the supreme court stated that the delay had been caused by the hospital administration, while the courts had complied with the procedural time-limits.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in shuya, in the ivanovo region. the applicant sued her former employer (the ministry of internal affairs of the republic of kalmykiya, hereafter “the ministry”). on 27 october 1999 the elista town court of the republic of kalmykiya (“the town court”) awarded the applicant monthly payments as compensation for damage to her health, with subsequent index-linked adjustment in accordance with changes in the statutory minimum monthly salary. the judgment came into force on 9 november 1999. 152-fz was adopted, which, inter alia, amended the procedure for index-linking compensation awards for damage to health. according to the new law, such payments were to be adjusted in accordance with changes in the level of inflation. the minimum monthly salary no longer served as the basis for index-linking. in november 2006 the ministry applied the new method of index‑linking, and recalculated the monthly payments to be paid to the applicant. this resulted in a decrease in the actual monthly amount she received from 10,370.51 russian roubles (rub) to rub 7,396.59, as established in march 2007. the applicant initiated three sets of proceedings, claiming delay interest in respect of three distinct periods. on 22 february and 3 april 2007 (upheld on 20 july 2007) the justice of the peace of elistinskiy court circuit no. 5 of the republic of kalmykiya (“the justice of the peace”) ordered the ministry to pay the applicant the interest in respect of certain delays in the monthly payments, in accordance with the judgment of 27 october 1999. on 22 february 2007 the judge agreed with the applicant’s calculation of the delay interest (based on the index-linking of the monthly payments in accordance with the changes in the statutory minimum monthly salary). on 3 april 2007 the court calculated the delay interest based on the amount of the monthly payments, as index-linked in line with the rate of inflation. on 7 may 2007 the justice of the peace refused the applicant’s claim for the delay interest. on 8 august 2007 the town court quashed the above decision and ordered the ministry to pay the delay interest as calculated by the applicant. the court held that, in the absence of a relevant judicial decision, the ministry had unlawfully changed the mode of index-linking ordered by the judgment of 27 october 1999. in the meantime, on 7 may 2007 the ministry requested clarification of the judgment of 27 october 1999 as regards the method of index-linking. on 25 june 2007 the town court held that, as a result of changes in the relevant legislation, as of 1 january 2003 the index-linking of the amounts in question was to be based on changes in the level of inflation. on 11 october 2007 the supreme court of the republic of kalmykiya upheld the decision of the town court. in a letter received on 1 october 2009 the applicant informed the court that in august 2009 the ministry had stopped paying the monthly payments, owing to a lack of funds in the relevant budget. according to the government, the amount due to the applicant from august 2009 onwards was paid to her in full on 8 october 2009. on 11 november 2009 the town court awarded her delay interest for late payment in respect of the delays in payment between september and october 2009. the judgment came into force on 23 november 2009, and was executed on 9 december 2009.
he owned a house with a yard in plovdiv, which were expropriated in 1982 on the basis of section 98 (1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973 (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство) with a view to constructing a residential building. the expropriation decision stated that the applicant was to be compensated with a two-room flat and a garage in a building which the municipality intended to construct. on an unspecified date the flat due in compensation was constructed and delivered. however, the applicant never received the garage which had also been due to him. in april 2008 the applicant complained to the plovdiv municipality of the failure to provide him with a garage. by a letter of 11 june 2008 the deputy mayor of plovdiv informed him that the municipality had no garages available and that it was currently constructing a building with underground garages, one of which could be offered to him. in february 2010 the applicant wrote once again to the municipality, and was informed in reply that the construction of the building mentioned earlier had not been completed. in 2014 the municipality offered the applicants’ heirs a garage, which the latter refused as it was situated at more than ten kilometers from their place of residence.
the applicant was born in 1961 and lives in pernik. her mother owned a house with a yard in the city, which were expropriated in 1978 on the basis of section 98 (1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973 (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство – “the tupa”) with a view to constructing a highway. it was stated in the expropriation decision that the applicant’s mother was to be compensated with a three-room flat, and the applicant was to receive a two‑room flat. the flat that the applicant’s mother was due was constructed and provided to her in 1985. until then the family lived in a municipally-owned dwelling. the expropriated house was pulled down in 1986. in a decision of 14 july 2000, issued on the basis of section 100 of the tupa, the pernik mayor indicated the exact flat to be provided to the applicant. it measured 75 square metres and was situated in a building under construction. it was stated in the decision that the flat’s value was 22,424.84 bulgarian levs (bgn), although it was not specified whether this amount took into account the value of the expropriated properties. later on in 2000 the applicant paid to the municipality bgn 28,000 for the flat’s value; it is unclear how this amount was arrived at. the building where the flat was situated was completed in 2003, but the flat that the applicant was due was never handed over to her. the applicant was told that it had been transferred by the municipality to third parties. in the following years the applicant and her mother filed complaints with the regional governor, the prime minister and the parliament. the authorities have not yet fulfilled their obligation to provide the applicant with a flat. the applicant states that she does not have another dwelling and that together with her husband and children she has been living with her parents in their flat.
the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in prague. the applicant has attempted to regain his legal capacity several times, but his requests have always been refused. in addition, he was unable to make more complex legal decisions independently. the applicant lodged appeals on 1 and 13 november 2012. on 8 august 2013 the municipal court quashed the judgment of 16 october 2012 and sent the case back to the district court which in a judgment of 12 june 2014 decided to limit the legal capacity of the applicant, for a period of twelve months, so that he was not entitled to dispose of funds exceeding 1,500 czk (eur55) per week. at the same time, it ordered an expert opinion in psychiatry. it appears that the proceedings are still ongoing. in the record of a telephone conversation between the applicant’s public guardian and a neighbour on 11 november 2011 it was noted, inter alia, that complaints about the applicant had been escalating, as he had been causing disturbance at night as a result of his excessive drinking and had been urinating on the stairs. he was an alcoholic who did not cooperate and was unaware of his alcohol abuse. the social care home in letiny is a private institution. from the record of the visit it appears that the applicant was unable to express himself coherently. he had also been sending confusing allegations to various institutions, such as courts, ministries and animal rights organisations. the applicant disagreed with his placement and contacted a number of authorities, including his public guardian. on 25 july 2011 the lawyer sent a request for the applicant’s immediate release to the director of the social care home and to the public guardian. on 3 august 2011 the applicant received a similar answer from his public guardian, who considered the power of attorney signed by the applicant as invalid, given that he had been deprived of his legal capacity. from 2 to 16 august 2011 the applicant was hospitalised at the mulačova hospital in plzeň for planned orthopedic surgery. she stated that she would try to transfer [the applicant] to a rehabilitation institution but afterwards they do not want to take him back. he is therefore sending me a letter informing me that [the applicant] is unhappy and that they want to discharge him. on 23 august 2011 the applicant’s lawyer lodged a request with the municipal court through the prague 4 district court arguing that the guardianship court, namely the prague 4 district court, had been inactive in the matter of his client’s detention and had not initiated guardianship proceedings (opatrovnické řízení) seeking to solve the conflict of interests between the applicant and his public guardian. as he repeatedly demands a review of his situation and refuses to stay in letiny, a psychiatric consultation was carried out. for this reason the applicant did not refuse the medication. in respect of some acts that have already been carried out, a subsequent ‘disapproval’ by the court could not lead to an effective reparation, and it is evident that [those acts] require the approval of the court before [their accomplishment] ...
in my opinion, legal acts connected with the involuntary placement of an incapacitated person in a social care institution are of such character and thus require prior approval, provided that there is enough time. the psychiatrist treating the applicant, it is noted, inter alia, that since the applicant’s discharge from the social care home he had not been attending for regular check-ups and had refused to take any medication with the exception of hypnotics. he had been visited by a nurse who had occasionally found him drunk. it also provided educational, training and stimulation activities, mediation of contact with the social environment, social and therapeutic activities and other services. it was a closed institution, which he could not leave. some letters that the applicant received had been opened. regarding the latter, it held that the alleged shortcomings in the proceedings did not constitute irregular official conduct for which the state could be held responsible because the conduct had resulted in a decision. the former situation did not arise in the present case either, as there had been no final decision that was later quashed as illegal. in letters of 8 april 2013 the prague 2 district court informed the applicant’s representatives that given that the applicant had been deprived of his legal capacity, he could not have granted them power of attorney.

the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in sofia. the applicant’s husband owned a house with a yard and a garage in sofia. on 14 june 1985, by decision of the sofia mayor, the property was expropriated with a view to constructing a school. the decision, based on section 98 (1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973 (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство – “the tupa”), stated that the applicant’s husband was to be compensated with a four-room flat and a garage in a building which the municipality intended to construct. by a supplementary decision of 12 september 1986, based on section 100 of the tupa, the mayor determined the exact location, size and other details in respect of the future flat to be provided in compensation. no mention was made however of the garage. even though, after judicial review initiated by the applicant’s husband, in a final judgment of 18 march 1987 the sofia city court ordered the mayor to supplement the decision and specify the exact garage to be provided to the applicant’s husband, this was not done. in 2004 the municipal authorities transferred to the applicant’s husband property to a flat different from the one described in the decision of 12 september 1986, which however he did not contest. the applicant’s husband passed away in 2005. by virtue of his will, all his property was left to the applicant. in a letter signed by the chief architect of sofia and dated 8 july 2009 the applicant was informed that the decision of 12 september 1986 had not yet been supplemented to specify the garage to be provided to her because no buildings with garages earmarked for the purpose were being built. in august 2009 the applicant challenged before the courts the mayor’s failure to issue a decision specifying the garage to be provided to her. in a final judgment of 23 june 2010 the supreme administrative court dismissed her claim, noting that the case at hand did not concern what was defined by statute as “unlawful failure to act”, but instead the enforcement of the judgment of 18 march 1987 (see paragraph 7 above), which had to be pursued under a different procedure. in parallel proceedings brought on an unspecified date in 2009, the applicant sought damages from the sofia municipality for wrongful failure to provide her with a garage. in a final decision of 23 september 2010 the supreme administrative court declared the claim inadmissible, on the ground that the courts had already established in the judgment of 23 june 2010 that there had not been any unlawful failure to act on the part of the administrative authorities.
the applicant was born in 1940 and lives in donetsk. subsequently the applicant learned that on 18 december 2001 y. had signed a notarised gift deed in which he transferred his title to half of the flat (which was not as divided into allocated parts of the whole) to v.s. 9. according to the applicant, on numerous occasions they broke the locks, insulted and harassed her and caused damage to her property. as a gift, whose value amounted to 5,602 ukrainian hryvnias (uah) according to the gift certificates. however, irrespective of this transfer, a.n. hit the applicant in the chest inflicting a bruise and causing soft tissue swelling. v.s. and several strangers broke into the applicant’s flat again. also on an unspecified date in november 2002 v.s. arrived in the flat after 11 p.m. (when the applicant was already asleep) and opened the balcony door, holding it open for some four hours notwithstanding the freezing temperature outside. a conflict emerged, in the course of which v.s. hit the applicant on the head and stomach, inflicting concussion and blunt trauma of the abdominal wall. as a result of the conflict, the applicant and her daughter had to seek medical assistance for their injuries and the applicant received inpatient hospital treatment. these tenants, mostly young males, behaved in a discourteous way. her efforts resulted in conflicts, in the course of which she was harassed and intimidated. her attempts to replace the locks on the entrance doors to prevent unauthorised entry into the flat resulted in them being broken and in the tenants, who frequently changed, moving in again, in spite of her discontent. as she was unable to withstand such living conditions and was afraid for her life and limb, the applicant effectively moved out, contending herself with odd living arrangements. however, she paid short visits to the flat regularly, to supervise the situation. on 5 february 2004 the donetsk regional court of appeal (hereinafter “the regional court”) quashed this judgment following an appeal by the applicants’ opponent and dismissed the prosecutor’s claim, having found that, unlike in the case of selling part of a shared property, giving it as a gift to a third party did not require the co-owners’ consent. they sought damages from the applicant for this conduct and demanded that the flat be divided into allocated parts. on 21 june 2005 the district court allowed the applicant’s claim in part and dismissed her opponents’ counterclaim. and revocation of his right of occupancy had not been based on any legal provision. she further alleged that, having no other residence and being a victim of constant harassment, she had abandoned the flat and had been requesting refuge from various acquaintances. on 2 december 2005 the district prosecutor also lodged a cassation appeal on the applicant’s behalf, in which he corroborated her submissions that the defendants had been harassing her, had been using the flat in bad faith and had forced the applicant, a senior lady, to leave the dwelling she had occupied for many years. it was not possible to exclude that she had falsified the disappearance of her belongings in order to compromise the unwanted tenants. in 2006 the applicant was informed that the investigation had been suspended. he also acknowledged that numerous pre-emptive conversations and warnings given by the police had not brought about any improvements. on 18 july 2006 the applicant lodged a private criminal complaint against v.s., a.n. she found that the injured parties had failed to comply with the rules on territorial jurisdiction and with other unspecified procedural requirements. who had allegedly been forced to abandon her flat on account of the intolerable living conditions created by the co-owners of her flat. on various dates in 2008 the defendants were released from custody pending trial. on 27 february 2012 the regional court quashed this verdict on appeal by the prosecution and the injured parties and remitted the case for retrial. on 17 april 2012 the defendants were rearrested and placed in custody.
the applicants were born in 1952 and 1955 respectively and live in sofia. the first applicant’s parents owned part of a house in sofia. in 1986 the house was expropriated with a view to constructing a street and a residential building. the expropriation decision, based on section 98 (1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973 (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство – “the tupa”), provided in particular that in compensation the applicants were to receive a three-room flat. by another decision of 28 may 1993, based on section 100 of the tupa, the mayor indicated the exact future flat to be provided as compensation to the applicants. it measured 87 square metres and was situated in a building to be constructed by the sofia municipality. its value was set at 21,185 old bulgarian levs (bgl), later amended to bgl 21,231. the applicants paid to the municipality the part of this amount which was not covered by the value of the expropriated property. in 1990 the applicants, their children and the first applicant’s parents were accommodated in a three‑room municipal flat. they remained in it until 2004, when they chose to move to another dwelling better adapted for the first applicant’s mother’s frail state of health. on an unspecified date in 2005 the applicants brought a tort action against the sofia municipality, claiming pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage on account of its continued failure to build and provide them with a flat. the action was dismissed on 21 february 2006 by the sofia district court, which found that the applicants had not proven that they had sustained damage, in particular because they had been accommodated in a municipally-owned dwelling, and that in any event domestic law provided for a special remedy for persons in the applicants’ situation, namely the possibility to request a new valuation of the expropriated property. following that judgment, the applicants made a request for a new valuation. in a letter by the municipality dated 2 june 2006 and signed by a deputy mayor, they were informed that they were not entitled to seek such a valuation since they had not been the owners of the expropriated property. in the meantime the flat due to the applicants was built and they took possession of it on 19 june 2006. in the tort proceedings, in judgments of 14 december 2006 and 8 july 2008 the sofia city court and the supreme court of cassation upheld the sofia district court’s judgment of 21 february 2006, reiterating its findings. in these proceedings the applicants were ordered to pay 1,200 new bulgarian levs (bgn, the equivalent to 612 euros – eur) in court fees.

( seventeen-year old at the time) on account of aggravated robbery and remanded him in custody. on the same date, the trial court ordered f.t. ’s detention for fifteen days for the same reasons as before. on 1 december 2011 the investigating judge ordered his release finding that “his attendance at the trial can be secured with a more lenient measure (seizure of passport and obligation to report to the court) ... taking into account the individual circumstances and needs of [f.t.], on 13 january 2012 the public prosecutor lodged an indictment against f.t. they were indicted on charges of aggravated robbery with respect to the incident of 25 october 2011. on the basis of a prior agreement, arrived [at the applicants’ house] with an intention to steal movable objects. with the use of force and dangerous object – a metal hammer with a wooden grip, they intentionally inflicted serious injuries on the now deceased v.[k.] and [the first applicant] in order to achieve their aim ... wearing black masks, [s.g. arrived in front of [the applicants’ house] ... v.k. on the head and hands with the metal hammer. sustained serious injuries-head wounds, multi-fragmented fractures accompanied with brain haemorrhages under the hard tissues of the brain ... linear skull fracture, as a result of which he died on 1 november 2011. then physically assaulted her by hitting her on the head ... she fell down, pretending to be dead. after [the first applicant] had heard l.j. ’s screaming, she arrived in the kitchen in order to see what was going on, but when she arrived in the living room, she was assaulted by the minor f.t. were taken by ambulance to skopje hospital. her mother was so much beaten that she could not see; her eyes were closed and her face was so much coloured (модро) that she could not recognise her.” was required to report to ohrid detention centre on 30 january 2013 in order to serve the sentence. requested that the sentence be postponed for family and health reasons. this request was dismissed by decisions of 21 january and 12 february 2013 by the enforcement judge and a three-judge panel of the trial court, respectively. had not arrived at the facility on the specified date. by letters dated 28 february, 8 april and 20 may 2013, the enforcement judge notified the trial court in skopje responsible for minors about f.t. the latter sought, to no avail, for the custodial sentence to be adjourned. on 2 may 2014 the detention centre advised again that f.t. on 30 june 2014 the enforcement judge ordered f.t. was arrested on 10 july 2014 and started serving his custodial sentence on 11 july 2014. would remain in custody until 27 june 2019.
at the time she submitted her complaint she lived in madona region, latvia. on 17 november 2006 the madona district court, acting as a first‑instance court, found the applicant guilty of a traffic offence which had caused moderate bodily injury to a victim. the court ordered the applicant to perform 100 hours of community service and suspended her driving licence for a year. in establishing the applicant’s guilt, the first-instance court relied on incriminating statements by the victim and two witnesses. it also relied on other evidence, including a medical expert opinion on the bodily injuries sustained by the victim. the applicant appealed against the judgment to the vidzeme regional court. she alleged, inter alia, that the first instance court had failed to order an inspection and a technical examination of her vehicle, and had also not carried out a confrontation of witnesses. on 13 february 2007 the vidzeme regional court upheld the judgment of the first-instance court but changed in part the punishment by revoking the suspension of the applicant’s driving licence. on 8 march 2007 the applicant submitted an appeal on points of law to the senate of the supreme court. she alleged that the appellate court had failed to carry out and to order a number of investigating activities. specifically, according to the applicant, the appellate court has not carried out a confrontation between the witnesses and the victim. it has not ordered an investigative experiment, an inspection and a technical examination of her vehicle. the applicant maintained that the evidence in the case was not sufficient to establish her guilt, and thus the appeal court had acted contrary to numerous sections of the criminal procedure law. in a letter dated 11 april 2007 a judge of the senate of the supreme court informed the applicant that on 11 april 2007 her appeal on points of law was not admitted for examination in the cassation proceedings. it relied on section 573 of the criminal procedure law and stated that “[the appeal on points of law] was not substantiated by any fundamental infringement of the criminal law or the law on criminal procedure”. it was also stated that it was not within the competence of the cassation court to re-examine or obtain evidence, or to explain the factual circumstances of the case.
the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in athens. while studying in turkey (1994-1999) the applicant had become a pro-communist and pro‑kurdish political activist. in 1997 he opened a literary café, which was frequented by individuals favourable to such a political stance. in 2000 the turkish police arrested the applicant, and he was prosecuted for infringing state constitutional order (article 146 of the turkish criminal code). the applicant was also held in the “white (isolation) cells” in kandra prison. he went on hunger strike for 171 days, causing him to develop wernicke-korsakoff syndrome, a pathology which can cause irreversible damage to health and prove fatal. given the threat to the applicant’s life, the turkish authorities decided to release him. in 2002 the applicant fled to greece, where he submitted an asylum application on 15 january 2002. on 18 february 2002 the general secretary of the ministry of public order, adjudicating at first instance, rejected that application, giving summary reasons. on 21 march 2002 the applicant appealed to the ministry of public order against that decision. on the same day the advisory board on asylum issued a favourable opinion in respect of the applicant. further to that favourable opinion, under article 3 § 5 of presidential decree no. 61/1999 (on the procedure for the examination of asylum applications), the minister for public order should have taken a decision within twenty-four hours on whether or not to grant the applicant international protection. however, by the date on which the application was referred to the court, the minister had not taken any decision and therefore had neither ratified nor rejected the board’s opinion. between 2003 and 2015 the applicant lived in athens and attended the police station every six months in order to renew his asylum-seeker’s card. under domestic law that card did not constitute a residence permit and therefore did not secure all the attendant rights: it only allowed the asylum-seeker not to be expelled and to reside in the national territory with “tolerated status” while his application was being examined. more specifically, under domestic law the asylum-seeker was not entitled to engage in an occupation, undertake vocational training, marry, obtain a driving licence, hold a bank account or apply for family reunion. in 2003, while he was living in athens, the applicant was joined by his wife from turkey. however, her presence in greece only became lawful in 2008, when she obtained a short-term work permit. in 2011 the applicant’s wife returned to istanbul with the child owing to health problems. meanwhile, on 5 august 2005, the turkish interpol office had issued an extradition request in respect of the applicant. that request had been based on accusations similar to those used in 2000 which had been assessed by the greek authorities during the examination of his asylum application. on 12 march 2013 the applicant was arrested in patras. on 26 march 2013 the indictment division of patras court of appeal examined the extradition request and unanimously decided to reject it. the division based its decision on the risk run by the applicant of suffering ill-treatment on account of his political opinions, should he be extradited. it further noted that the nature of the offences for which extradition had been requested had only been described vaguely and abstractly in the request submitted by the turkish authorities. on 26 april 2013 the court of cassation upheld the impugned decision. the applicant had meanwhile been actively seeking to secure a final decision. he had written to the ombudsman of the republic on 21 march and 25 june 2012, and to the minister for public order on 19 november 2013, 16 june 2014 and 27 february 2015. furthermore, it emerged from correspondence among a number of different authorities (between police authorities and between the police and other authorities) on 23 february 2007, 16 october 2012, 14 november 2012 and 28 january 2015, that the applicant’s asylum application was still pending before the minister for public order.
the applicant was born in 1964 and lives in istanbul. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. at the time of the events giving rise to the application, the applicant was working at the directorate of national palaces as a secretary. on an unspecified date in 2002, following ongoing conflict with a colleague and at the request of a certain professor, m.ü., from the same directorate, the applicant was demoted. who was a mutual acquaintance, and seek a reconciliation between the parties and thus her possible reinstatement. made a number of harassing phone calls to the professor with violent threats to hurt his son, accompanied by a ransom request. the professor, in turn, filed a criminal complaint against both m.g. and the applicant in relation to these threatening calls, which resulted in charges being brought on 3 december 2002 against m.g. admitted to having threatened the professor, but claimed that he had had no intention of hurting anyone. he asserted that he had only meant to scare the professor, at the applicant’s request. the applicant, on the other hand, denied m.g. she claimed that, although she had taken up m.g. ’s offer to contact the professor to settle the dispute which had caused her demotion, she had never instructed him to threaten or otherwise harass the professor. on 27 october 2005 the istanbul assize court convicted m.g. as charged, but acquitted the applicant on the grounds of a lack of sufficient evidence to corroborate the allegations against her. that decision, which was not appealed against by the defendants, was finalised on 4 november 2005. in the meantime, on 31 december 2002, shortly after her indictment, the applicant had been dismissed from the position to which she had been demoted, without receiving payment in lieu of notice or severance pay. on 30 october 2003 the applicant brought an action against the directorate of national palaces before the bakırköy labour court, claiming severance pay and payment in lieu of notice on grounds of wrongful dismissal. to commit the offences of making threats and requesting a ransom, and had breached the relationship of trust with her employer. the relevant part of the judgment reads:
“...in their observations, the respondent party submitted that the applicant had incited her friend to threaten and extort ransom from m.ü, and that she had confessed to the charges against her in her statement to the police...
the court has requested the case file of the istanbul 6th criminal assize court and examined the entire criminal investigation file. in his statement to the police of 19 november 2002, stated that it was the applicant who had instructed him to threaten m.ü. had demoted her, and that when he had visited the applicant at the office, she had said that m.ü. should also suffer just as she suffered and that it would be best to threaten him with kidnapping his son unless he gave 50 billion turkish liras. the court has also given regard to the documents submitted by the plaintiff’s employer and finds it established that the plaintiff’s contract had been terminated on the basis of the fact that the plaintiff had incited m.g. to commit the crime of making threats and requesting a ransom. based on the documents submitted by the parties, the statements made during the proceedings, the statements of m.g. the applicant appealed against the decision of the bakırköy labour court. during the criminal proceedings, in total disregard of the fact that she had been acquitted of incitement by the istanbul assize court. on 20 december 2006 the court of cassation upheld the decision of the bakırköy labour court.
the applicant was born in 1971 and lives in arzamas. in the early hours of 5 june 2005, at about 3 a.m., the police arrested the applicant. in the morning he was interviewed and later taken to the hospital because he broke the window and injured himself. at 6 p.m. the arrest record was drawn up; it gave 6 p.m. as the time of the applicant’s arrest. on 7 june 2005 the lukoyanovskiy district court in the nizhny novgorod region remanded the applicant in custody for an initial two‑month period. on 8 august 2005 the district court held a hearing to decide, among other matters, on an extension of the applicant’s detention. the applicant asked for release; counsel for the applicant pointed out that, since the authorised detention period had ended on 5 august 2005, his detention in the following three days had been unlawful. the district court extended the applicant’s detention, finding that the “preventive measure [should] remain unchanged”. in the statement of appeal against the district court’s extension order, the applicant complained that the custodial measure which had already expired could not “remain unchanged”. the appeal was forwarded to the regional court only on 8 september 2005. on 23 september 2005 the regional court rejected the appeal in a summary fashion, without addressing the applicant’s arguments. on 25 january 2006 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 25 april 2006, without informing the applicant or his representative about the hearing or giving any reasons for its decision. the applicant filed an appeal on 30 january 2006 which was dismissed by the regional court on 31 may 2006. by judgment of 25 august 2006, as upheld on appeal on 17 october 2006, the applicant was found guilty and given a custodial sentence.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in opfikon. on 28 august 1995 she was hit by a motorcycle while crossing the road and fell on her back. she was hospitalised overnight owing to suspected concussion resulting from the impact of her head against the ground. on 29 january 1996 the applicant was examined at the zurich university hospital. nevertheless, on 12 june 1996 another doctor in the same hospital declared the applicant totally incapable of work. on the basis of the assessment carried out by that centre, the applicant was declared fully capable of work with effect from february 1997. on 4 february 1997 the applicant submitted an objection to that decision and enclosed a report of a neurologist, who confirmed an almost permanent headache, limited head movement, pain radiation towards the shoulders and arms with sensory disorders as well as sleep disorders. in addition, the specialist suspected that the applicant had suffered whiplash and that she was affected by a neuropsychological dysfunction. in september 1997 the insurance company rejected the applicant’s complaint finding no causal link between the accident and her health problems. the applicant appealed to the social insurance court of the canton of zurich (sozialversicherungsgericht des kantons zürich). moreover, a doubt remained as to whether the applicant had suffered trauma to her neck and spine. the insurance company therefore ordered another medical report, which was delivered on 11 november 2002. the medical expert confirmed the existence of a causal link between the accident and the applicant’s health problems, and concluded that the applicant’s illness had led to a total incapacity for work. the applicant lodged a complaint against that decision. he also strongly criticised the approach and findings of other medical experts. on the basis of this report, on 22 september 2005 the insurance company dismissed the applicant’s complaint on the grounds of lack of a causal link between the accident and her medical conditions. thereafter, the insurance company invited the applicant to undergo a medical evaluation of her functional abilities, which she refused. no mention of the possibility of covert monitoring was mentioned. thereafter, on 3, 10, 16 and 26 october 2006 the applicant was monitored by private investigators, commissioned by the insurance company. the surveillance was performed on four different dates over a period of twenty-three days and lasted several hours each time. the undercover investigators followed the applicant over long distances. following the surveillance, a detailed monitoring record was prepared. on 14 december 2006 the insurance company sent the private investigators’ report to the applicant. however, the applicant refused to undergo any further examination and asked for a decision on her benefits to be taken. she also asked for the surveillance case file to be destroyed. on 6 may 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal with the social insurance court claiming compensation for damage to her physical integrity as well as a disability pension based on 70% disability. on 29 may 2009 the social insurance court found in favour of the applicant. as a result, it denied any probative value of the expert opinion based on the evidence, which had taken into account the illegal surveillance. accordingly, the federal court denied the probative value not only of the medical reports attesting to the applicant’s complete incapacity to work but also of the reports attesting to her incapacity to work of a lesser degree. it quashed the decision of the social insurance court, except for the considerations relating to the interest on arrears.
the applicant was born in 1948 and lives in budapest. on 9 march 2006 the applicant submitted a request for an increase of her disability pension before the budapest governmental authority (directorate of pension insurance), which dismissed her claim on 21 august 2006. the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision on 10 october 2006. the central-hungarian regional insurance directorate acting as a second-instance authority upheld the first-instance decision on 4 january 2007. the applicant sought the judicial review of the second-instance decision within the statutory time-limit. she submitted her statement of claim on 9 february 2007 to the first-instance administrative authority, in line with the applicable procedural laws. in the absence of any developments in the case, the applicant notified the first-instance administrative authority about upholding her claim on 18 march 2010. the first-instance administrative authority subsequently forwarded the applicant’s statement of claim to the budapest labour court on 20 july 2010. the budapest labour court dismissed the applicant’s claim on 14 june 2011.
the case originated in an application (no. 52257/11) against hungary lodged with the court under article 34 of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms (“the convention”) by eleven hungarian nationals, mr tibor bak, mrs lászlóné csatári, mr istván csillag, mr andrás halász, ms boglárka lászló, mr zoltán lex, mr márk marsi, mr sándor orosz, mrs klára pápainé armuth, mr györgy  rosta and mr attila széles (“the applicants”), on 8 august 2011. a list of applicants is annexed to the present judgment. the applicants were represented by mr cs. the hungarian government (“the government”) were represented by mr z. tallódi, agent of the ministry of justice. on 31 august 2015 the applicants’ complaint under article 1 of protocol no. 1 to the convention concerning the imposition of 98% tax on part of their severance payment was communicated to the government. these sums will be converted into the currency of the respondent state at the rate applicable on the date of payment, and will be free of any taxes that may be applicable. they will be payable within three months from the date of notification of the strike-out decision taken by the court. in the event of failure to pay these sums within the said three-month period, the government undertook to pay simple interest on them, from the expiry of that period until settlement, at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage points. the payment will constitute the final resolution of the case in respect of these seven applicants. the first applicant, mr tibor bak was born in 1965 and lives in dunakeszi. from june 2002 he was employed at the state-owned national development bank ltd. his employment was terminated by mutual agreement in june 2010. the upper bracket of his severance payment was taxed at 98% rate. the government did not contest the levy of the special tax on his severance payment; but in their observations they rectified the tax amount. the first applicant did not contest this. the fourth applicant, mr andrás halász was born in 1961 and lives in budapest. from october 2002 he was employed at the state-owned national export-import bank ltd. his employment was terminated on 29 october 2010. the fifth applicant, ms boglárka lászló was born in 1967 and lives in budapest. from april 2007 she was employed at the state-owned mfb investment ltd. her employment was terminated by mutual agreement on 29 october 2010. the fifth applicant did not contest this. accordingly, special tax was levied on her severance payment in the amount of huf 6,508,053 (approximately eur 21,700). the ninth applicant, mrs klára pápainé armuth was born in 1957 and lives in budapest. her employment was terminated by mutual agreement in 2010. the upper bracket of her severance payment was taxed at 98% in the amount of huf 2,932,623 (approximately eur 9,700). in a letter dated of 17 march 2016 the ninth applicant submitted that due to some special accounting methods applied in her case, she had received further bonuses from her previous employer calculated pro rata temporis for the years of 2011 and 2012; in respect of these bonuses additional special tax had been levied in the amount of altogether huf 829,119 (approximately eur 2,700). the applicant received a certificate from her employer regarding the deduction of special tax from the subsequently received bonuses on unspecified dates in 2011 and 2012.
the applicant was born in 1987 and lives in nizhniy novgorod. the applicant and two minors (z. and s.) were suspected to be implicated in several car thefts. on 23 august 2007 the leninskiy district court of nizhniy novgorod (“the district court”) authorised the applicant’s detention on remand in connection with the car thefts, referring to the gravity of the charges and an unspecified risk that she would put pressure on minors s. and z. the judge concluded that the applicant could obstruct the proceedings. on 5 september 2007 the nizhniy novgorod regional court upheld the detention order on appeal. on 13 september 2007 the investigator ordered a psychiatric examination of the applicant to verify whether she was fit to stand trial. on 8 october 2007 the experts found that the applicant suffered from a mental deficiency. the experts concluded that her mental conditions did not exclude a criminal liability and that she did not require any compulsory psychiatric treatment. the district court, referring to the need to complete the investigation “in the absence of grounds for varying or cancelling the measure of restraint”, issued further detention orders extending the term of the applicant’s pre-trial detention on 18 october and 14 december 2007, and on 15 january 2008. in february 2008 the criminal case against the applicant and her co‑defendants was submitted for trial before the district court. on 18 february 2008 the district court, noting that the applicant had been charged with a serious crime and could exercise pressure on the minor co-defendants if at liberty, decided to maintain her in custody until 1 august 2008. on 11 july 2008 the judge ordered the applicant’s and z.’s release, concluding that there was no longer necessary to maintain them in custody, given that they had made admissions and that the applicant was unlikely to put any pressure on her co-defendants. by judgment of 1 september 2008, the applicant was convicted on several charges and acquitted of the remainder, in particular, of the charges pertaining to involvement of minors in criminal activities. she was sentenced to a suspended prison term. on 23 august 2007 the applicant was placed in remand prison iz‑52/1 in nizhniy novgorod. according to the applicant, the cell accommodated up to forty persons. in the government’s submission, twenty-seven to thirty-five inmates shared the cell during that period. on 20 december 2007 the applicant was transferred to cell no. 30/349 measuring 12.14 square metres, which she shared with another detainee. in december 2007 the committee against torture retained ms p., an advocate, who visited the applicant in the remand centre on 27 december 2007 and 21 february 2008. the applicant explained to the advocate that a certain “olga”, a prison staff member, asked her about her complaint to the court and told her to make written statements indicating that she “had no claims against the remand centre”. in the meantime, on 8 february 2008 mr ryzhov, the applicant’s representative before the court, sought a permission to see the applicant in the remand centre in order to obtain further details concerning the conditions of her detention. the applicant’s representative showed a simple authority form signed by the applicant and authorising him to represent her before the court. on 28 february 2008 the administration of the remand centre informed the representative that such permission could be granted by the district court dealing the criminal case against the applicant. instead of applying for a court order, the applicant’s representative sought judicial review of the above refusal. by decision of 25 march 2008 the sovetskiy district court of nizhniy novgorod confirmed the above refusal considering that the applicant’s representative had not been vested with any authority to represent the applicant in the judicial review proceedings because he had not had an “advocate” status, as required by the civil code or the code of civil procedure; a copy of the authority form concerning the proceedings before the court had not been duly attested. on 6 may 2008 the nizhniy novgorod regional court upheld the sovetskiy district court’s decision on appeal.
the applicant was born in 1989 and lives in vanadzor. on 2 august 2010 the applicant appeared voluntarily at the gugark town police department and confessed that earlier that day, during a street fight, he had injured another individual, y.p., with a knife after the latter threatened him with a gun. the applicant also surrendered his knife and y.p. on the same date the investigator decided to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant under article 113 criminal code (cc) on account of wilful infliction of medium gravity damage to y.p. ’s health, and to apply a written undertaking not to leave his place of residence as a preventive measure in respect of the applicant. the applicant objected to this motion, arguing, inter alia, that it was unreasoned and did not contain any arguments in support of the allegation that he could commit any of the acts prescribed by article 135 of the code of criminal procedure (ccp). it was incompatible with article 5 of the convention to provide stereotyped reasoning for detention or to rely solely on the severity of the sentence. the applicant requested that the written undertaking not to leave his place of residence be maintained. on 10 august 2010 the lori regional court, having heard the applicant, found the investigator’s motion to be well-founded and decided to grant it by ordering the applicant’s detention for a period of two months:
“... taking into account the nature and dangerousness of the act committed by [the accused], and the fact that, if at large, he may abscond from the authority dealing with the case or obstruct the investigation by exerting unlawful influence on the persons involved in the criminal proceedings, as well as avoid liability and sentence.” on 12 august 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal arguing, inter alia, that his detention on conditions provided by article 135 of the ccp was incompatible with the guarantees of article 5 of the convention. he had appeared voluntarily with a confession and had assisted the investigation by appearing every time upon the investigating authority’s summons, participating in various investigative measures and confrontations; his identity and place of residence were known to the authorities. there were therefore no circumstances precluding the application of a written undertaking not to leave his place of residence. the investigator had not produced any evidence that he had ever tried to abscond or obstruct the investigation or that he would abscond, obstruct the proceedings, commit a criminal offence or avoid criminal liability or serving the imposed sentence. on 23 september 2010 the investigator filed a motion seeking to have the applicant’s detention, which was to expire on 9 october 2010, extended by two months. the applicant objected to this motion and requested that the regional court release him on bail. it further decided to dismiss the applicant’s motion for release on bail on the same grounds. in particular, his identity was known, he had a permanent place of residence and had never tried to abscond. on 20 october 2010 the criminal court of appeal upheld the decision to extend the applicant’s detention and to refuse his release on bail, finding it to be lawful and well-founded. as regards specifically the question of bail, the court of appeal stated at the outset that the grounds for refusal of bail mentioned in article 143 of the ccp were not exhaustive. it then concluded that it was impossible to replace the applicant’s detention with bail on the same grounds which justified the necessity of keeping him in detention. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, which was declared inadmissible for lack of merit by the court of cassation’s decision of 16 december 2010. on 8 november 2010 the applicant filed a motion with the lori regional court seeking to be released on bail. he submitted, inter alia, that he had a permanent place of residence, had never absconded or obstructed the investigation and that on the contrary he had assisted in the disclosure of the crime. on 19 november 2010 the regional court decided to dismiss the motion, finding that the grounds for the applicant’s detention – as stated in its previous decisions – still persisted. this decision was subject to appeal before the criminal court of appeal within ten days. on 24 november 2010 the investigator filed a motion seeking to have the applicant’s detention, which was to expire on 9 december 2010, extended by one month, citing similar reasons as previously. on 15 december 2010 the regional court decided to grant partially the investigator’s motion, extending the applicant’s detention by fifteen days. on 16 december 2010 the applicant was released upon the payment of the amount of bail fixed by the regional court. on 25 january 2011 the investigator decided to drop the charges against the applicant, cancel the bail and terminate the criminal proceedings.

the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in lviv. a paramedic working at the centre, concluded, after merely examining the applicant’s appearance and without administering any laboratory tests, that he was suffering “from alcohol intoxication of an intermediate degree.” accordingly, the applicant was confined in the centre in order to sober up. at about 7 a.m. on 21 february 2002 the sobering-up centre’s staff informed the applicant’s mother on the telephone of her son’s whereabouts and invited her to pick him up from the centre. this report also contained illegible handwritten observations of the centre’s paramedic concerning the applicant’s pulse and other health-related indicators taken upon his placement in the centre. at about 1 p.m. on 22 february 2002 the applicant complained to a doctor at lviv municipal clinic no. on the same date the applicant was certified as having no alcohol in his urine. he was also found to be suffering from contusions on one of his elbows and in the eyebrow area. also on the same date, the police were notified by the medical staff that the applicant had complained about having been beaten. from 25 february 2002 until 18 march 2002 the applicant continued to be treated as an outpatient at his local polyclinic for the above injuries. it further noted that k., a police officer, had been assigned to conduct an inquiry into that complaint. he had been found liable to be disciplined for inaction on his part, notably for not having questioned the parties concerned. the applicant was also given assurances that the complaint would be investigated further. on 3 july 2002 the applicant received a letter from the lviv prosecutor’s office stating that an inquiry into his complaints concerning the actions of the municipal guard officers and the sobering-up centre paramedic had concluded that those complaints were ill-founded. at trial, the applicant submitted, inter alia, that he could not describe in detail when and how the injuries had been inflicted on him. he also maintained that on 21 february 2002, following his discharge from the sobering-up centre, he had had to attend a court hearing in an unrelated case. having been occupied in court for the whole day, he had not been able to visit a doctor until 22 february 2002. according to this instruction, it was not necessary to perform laboratory tests to establish the level of a person’s alcohol intoxication. such a conclusion was to be made by making a visual examination and by measuring such vital indicators as pulse rate and blood pressure. the paramedic further submitted that the applicant had had no injuries either upon his placement in the facility or upon his release. on 6 june 2003 the court rejected the applicant’s claims as unsubstantiated. in these circumstances, the court found that the applicant had most likely sustained his injuries after his release. he submitted, in particular, that the confinement report did not constitute reliable evidence, as it had been signed by him under duress. however, the applicant had agreed to sign it because he had been afraid that otherwise he might not be discharged. the applicant also complained that the first-instance court had unreasonably refused his request for the prosecutor’s office to be obliged to produce the results of its inquiry concerning the applicant’s complaints. on 13 october 2003 the lviv regional court of appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal, having found that he had failed to substantiate his allegations. he noted, in particular, that his arrest and confinement had been arbitrary, since neither the confinement report nor any other document stated the circumstances in which he had been arrested or the grounds for his confinement. he further noted that the method by which it had been determined that he had been suffering from alcohol intoxication of an “intermediate degree” had been based on a visual examination only, without any objective tests having been undertaken. this method was arbitrary and neither the defendant authority nor the courts had referred to any specific legal provision governing such a practice. he further complained that neither the prosecutor’s office nor the civil courts had made any effort in good faith to establish the circumstances in which he had sustained his injuries; thus, his version of events remained credible and unrebutted.

the applicant company is a limited liability company based in vienna. it is the owner and publisher of the weekly news magazine profil. until 2007 the land of carinthia (land kärnten) owned almost 50% of the shares of hypo alpe-adria bank. in that capacity he was responsible for authorising foreign currency transactions. between 1 and 6 april 2006 a number of daily newspapers published reports on the investigation and mentioned mr rauscher by name as responsible for the speculative transactions in question. on 5 april 2006 the fma filed criminal information (strafanzeige) about offences committed in relation to the business of hypo alpe-adria bank against the three members of the executive board and mr rauscher, accusing them of embezzlement by investing money entrusted to the bank contrary to the instructions of the executive board. carinthian hypo affair - how much did haider know?”). the article, headlined “schwere hypothek” (“heavy mortgage”), ran to nine pages. furthermore, the article featured an interview with mr kulterer, confronting him with those accusations. at that point we immediately called a halt’ said ceo wolfgang kulterer. this son of the former spö regional finance chief max rauscher was not available for comment). ...
the transactions in question were all performed between 20 september and 5 october 2004. a few weeks later, on 17 november 2004, the perfect storm hit. according to inside sources, rauscher may have set the stakes so high precisely because he wanted to make his mark as a candidate for the vacant post of department manager. after all, high stakes mean correspondingly high profits if all goes according to plan. he submitted that he was not a public figure and that his position at the bank had not been such as to justify the disclosure of his name. he asserted that when authorising the transactions at issue he had acted in accordance with his instructions and with the approval of his superiors. he had not been active in politics nor had he been in the public eye in connection with his professional activity. hypo alpe-adria’s treasury department had been directly answerable to the executive board. criminal proceedings against the claimant had been discontinued in 2008. after accusations against the claimant had been published in various media, his employment contract had been terminated. he had not been able to find a similar position in another bank. as a rule, adults who were suspected of having committed a crime were only protected against the disclosure of their identity if such disclosure disproportionately affected their professional advancement. moreover, the chief executive of the bank, mr kulterer, had levelled similar accusations against him. having regard to the function of the press as a “public watchdog” and the circumstances of the case, the regional court found that the public interest of obtaining information outweighed the claimant’s interest in not having his name disclosed. it shared the view of the regional court that there was a public interest in knowing who was responsible for hypo alpe-adria bank’s losses due to the fact that the land owned 50% of the bank. however, the article should have confined itself to mentioning the head of the bank’s treasury department without disclosing his name. the public interest in reporting on the criminal offences at issue had not in itself been sufficient to justify disclosing the claimant’s identity. it examined in detail the reasons given by the court of appeal. 62746/00, 14 december 2002), the supreme court found that the appeal court had correctly weighed the conflicting interests of the claimant under article 8 on the one hand and of the applicant company under article 10 on the other, especially because of the early stage of the criminal proceedings against the claimant.

the applicant was born in 1958 and lives in hamburg. on 26 august 2004 the zagreb municipal state attorney’s office (općinsko državno odvjetništvo u zagrebu; hereinafter: the “state attorney’s office”) indicted the applicant and another person in the zagreb municipal criminal court (općinski kazneni sud u zagrebu) on charges of aggravated fraud under article 224 §§ 1 and 4 of the criminal code (see paragraph 14 below). the applicant was tried in summary proceedings (skraćeni postupak). on 11 february 2009 the zagreb municipal criminal court found the applicant and the other accused guilty as charged and sentenced the applicant to one year’s imprisonment, suspended for four years. she was also ordered, jointly with the other accused, to pay damages to the victims in the total amount of 230,335.22 croatian kunas (hrk; approximately 31,100 euros (eur)). the applicant appealed against her conviction and sentence, challenging all legal and factual aspects of the case and asking that her conviction be quashed and a retrial ordered. she submitted, in particular, that she had not had fraudulent intentions, but had merely acted as an intermediary between the loan provider and the borrowers in order to earn commission for herself. moreover, she stressed that the trial judge had erred in the factual findings and had failed to obtain certain evidence requested by her, which meant that some crucial facts had been left undetermined. she also asked that she and her defence lawyer be allowed to appear at the session of the appeal panel. on 20 january 2011 the bjelovar county court (županijski sud u bjelovaru), without informing the applicant or her lawyer, examined the case without holding a hearing. after examining all of the factual and legal issues of the case it dismissed the appeal and upheld the applicant’s conviction and sentence. on 5 april 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske), complaining of a lack of fairness of the criminal proceedings against her. she contended in particular that she had not been allowed to appear at the session of the appeal panel. on 29 september 2011 the constitutional court declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded.
the applicants were born in 1966 and 1985 respectively. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. in 1995 the first applicant moved to russia from tajikistan. in 1998 he was sentenced by the dzerzhinsky district court in perm to eight years of imprisonment for drug trafficking. at some point after his arrival in russia, the first applicant entered into a relationship with the second applicant. in 2006 the couple had a son and in 2009 they officially registered their marriage. there were two other children in the applicants’ family from the second applicant’s previous marriage. the documents submitted indicate that the first applicant lived in russia on regularly extended temporary residence permits and was allowed to work. he was also involved with the union of tajiks in russia (союз таджиков россии), a public organisation promoting cultural ties between tajikistan and russia. on 13 may 2013 the first applicant left russia to go to tajikistan. in their replies the agencies either denied having provided the basis for the re-entry ban or refused to provide information. the applicants furnished the court with copies of their information requests to the above agencies and their replies. at the end of february 2014 the applicants lodged a complaint against the regional fss with the dzerzhinsky district court of perm and requested that the exclusion order be quashed and the re-entry ban lifted. on 16 may 2014 the regional court examined the complaint in camera. the regional fss provided the court with the case file concerning the first applicant. the file, which seemed to comprise about two hundred and forty pages, was reviewed by the judge within the space of a few minutes. the regional fss was represented at the hearing by its counsel. another fss officer, an operational search officer who had participated in operational measures against the first applicant, was called as a witness. according to the executive agency, the exclusion order and the re-entry ban had been imposed on the first applicant on the basis of a report drafted by the regional fss dated 7 september 2012 according to which the first applicant was a member of an extremist group and had incited ethnic tensions. the regional fss refused to specify which actions of the first applicant had served as the basis for the ban. according to the second applicant, neither she nor her counsel was allowed access to any of the documents that had served as the basis for the exclusion order. on 16 may 2014 the regional court upheld the first applicant’s exclusion and the re-entry ban, stating, inter alia, that according to the witness statement of the fss operational search officer “the [first] applicant had been involved in activities threatening state security. this has been confirmed by the secret operational documents presented, which have been reviewed by the court and returned to the representative of the fss”. the court further stated that the decision to exclude the first applicant had been issued in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law and its reasoning had referred to the information submitted by the regional fss; therefore, it had been lawful. (b)  appeal to the supreme court of the russian federation 16. on 23 july 2014 the supreme court upheld the decision of 16 may 2014, stating in general terms that the regional court had duly examined the legal basis for the exclusion, and that its decision had been lawful and had balanced public and private interests. according to the government, on 10 january 2015 the first applicant re-entered russia. on 20 march 2015 the perm region fms granted him a temporary residence permit, valid until 20 march 2018. the first applicant currently resides in russia. on 4 april 2015 the applicants paid the above amount.
the applicant was born in 1980 and lives in slavonski brod. in response to a request from the police, on 26 november 2007 the state attorney’s office for the suppression of corruption and organised crime (ured za suzbijanje korupcije i organiziranog kriminaliteta) asked an investigating judge of the zagreb county court (županijski sud u zagrebu) to authorise the use of special investigative measures, namely tapping the telephone conversations of the applicant and several other individuals on the grounds of their suspected participation in organised drug trafficking, customs evasion, and the abuse of power and authority. on 27 november 2007 the investigating judge granted the request and issued an order for the use of secret surveillance measures. having assessed the [state attorney’s] request, and in view of [the request from the police], it is established that there is probable cause for believing that the criminal offences have been committed and that the requisite investigation in the present case could not be carried out by any other means, or would be extremely difficult. in addition, given that the matter concerns the offences enumerated in article 181 § 1 (2) of the code of criminal procedure, the request has been granted and it was decided as indicated in the operative part of this order.” in the course of the investigation, the investigating judge issued several further secret surveillance orders to the same effect. in addition to the phone tapping, the investigating judge also authorised the covert monitoring of the suspects. the applicant decided to remain silent and not give any evidence. she also ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention. on 12 june 2009 the applicant asked the slavonski brod county court to exclude from the proceedings the evidence obtained by means of secret surveillance as being unlawfully obtained. at a hearing on 18 june 2009 the slavonski brod county court dismissed the applicant’s request as unfounded. at the same hearing the applicant pleaded not guilty to the charges held against him, whereas three other defendants pleaded guilty. the trial bench heard several witnesses and an expert witness and examined the reports in the case file. a further hearing was held on 29 september 2009 at which the applicant reiterated his request for the exclusion of the evidence obtained by secret surveillance as being unlawfully obtained. the applicant further contended that his exact location at the moment of the alleged commission of the offence at issue should be established by obtaining the location tracking data of the mobile phone which he had allegedly used. it heard two witnesses and an expert witness and adjourned the proceedings in order for the defence to obtain copies of the secret surveillance recordings. the trial bench dismissed his request as unfounded and proceeded with the examination of the secret surveillance audio recordings. at a hearing on 14 december 2009 the trial bench heard further secret surveillance audio recordings. further hearings were held on 2 and 19 february 2010 at which the trial bench examined the secret surveillance recordings. in this connection the trial bench heard evidence from the police officer in charge of the operation, z.h., who explained the method of identifying the mobile phones used by the defendants. ’s questioning, the trial bench dismissed all further requests for the examination of evidence and adjourned the hearing for the preparation of the defendants’ closing statements. on 26 february 2010 the trial bench heard the parties’ closing arguments. by a judgment of 1 march 2010 the slavonski brod county court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment. the slavonski brod county court further held that all doubts on the part of the defence as to the accuracy of the recordings had been clarified by questioning the police officers, who had explained the manner in which the recordings had been obtained and documented. he also complained about the use of the evidence thereby obtained in securing his conviction. it also held that all the relevant circumstances of the case had been properly established by the first-instance court and that the applicant’s conviction had been based on a proper and convincing assessment of evidence and the relevant facts. on 11 july 2012 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as unfounded, endorsing the reasoning of the supreme court. it considered in particular that the criminal proceedings against the applicant, taken as a whole, had not been unfair. the decision of the constitutional court was served on the applicant on 11 september 2012.
the applicants were born in 1982, 1967 and 1978 respectively and live in podgorica. the applicants were employees of the usa embassy (“the embassy”) in montenegro. the first applicant worked as a protocol specialist/translator, and the second and third applicants as security guards. the employment contract between the locally employed staff and the embassy provided, inter alia, as follows:
“3. the employee agrees to perform all the duties set forth in the position description in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. the first applicant’s main duties and responsibilities were related to assisting in organising official receptions, lunches and dinners; questions relevant to protocol and local practices and customs; maintaining a contact database; drafting correspondence in english and montenegrin; interpreting and translating documents, articles and incoming correspondence; arranging official calls; ensuring press coverage of ceremonial events; organising official visits and serving as a contact person between the front desk and the host country officials. the second and third applicants’ main duties and responsibilities were continuous surveillance of an area around their fixed posts for security hazards; checking id cards, screening visitors and vehicles, and controlling parking; recognising emergencies and unusual incidents, and acting accordingly. they could occasionally be required to work at other locations and for special functions such as vip visits, receptions and dinners at the principal officer’s residence. between 14 february 2009 and 28 june 2012 the applicants were informed by the embassy that they were dismissed. it would appear that on an unspecified date thereafter this decision became final. between 22 november 2010 and 26 july 2012 the applicants instituted separate civil proceedings against the embassy. all the applicants claimed compensation: the first applicant sought compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by the wrongful dismissal, and the second and third applicants claimed compensation for loss of earnings. the first and second applicants, in addition, sought reinstatement. on 26 may 2011 the court of first instance in podgorica declared that it lacked competence to deal with the first applicant’s claim and rejected it (tužba [se] odbacuje), which decision was upheld by the high court on 21 june 2011. on 4 october 2011 the supreme court quashed these decisions. while the court acknowledged that in international and comparative law there were restrictions on state immunity in respect of employment-related disputes, it also held that recruitment (pitanja u vezi sa zapošljavanjem) in a foreign diplomatic mission or an embassy was an issue which could be “very sensitive or of a confidential nature” and might relate to the diplomatic and organisational policy of a foreign state. the court also relied on article 22 of the vienna convention, which provided for the inviolability of the premises of embassies. on various dates thereafter the applicants appealed. the first applicant submitted, inter alia, that by examining the merits of her claim the courts would not interfere with the other party’s sovereignty. she also submitted that the court of first instance had to examine the claim on the merits pursuant to the decision of the supreme court of 4 october 2011 and relied on section 415 of the civil procedure act (see paragraph 32 below). between 20 november 2011 and 6 december 2012 the high court upheld the first-instance decisions, in substance endorsing their reasoning. the high court further held, upon the first applicant’s appeal, that a violation of sections 367 (1) and 415 of the civil procedure code (see paragraphs 31 and 32 below) by the first-instance court did not render the first-instance decision unlawful, in particular as it was undisputed that the respondent party had its seat in another state and only a diplomatic representation in montenegro. in ruling upon the second applicant’s claim it held that the jurisdiction of the domestic courts was not explicitly provided for either by the law or an international agreement. between 1 november 2012 and 10 may 2013, ruling upon the applicants’ appeals on points of law, the supreme court upheld the previous decisions on the grounds that the respondent party was a foreign state with its own legal personality and the domestic courts had no competence to rule upon the applicants’ claims. in ruling upon the third applicant’s appeal on points of law the supreme court also held, inter alia, that granting immunity to a foreign state in civil proceedings pursued a legitimate aim of complying with international law and encouraging good diplomatic relations between states, and that it could not be considered as a restriction on access to court in violation of article 6 of the convention. between 10 january 2013 and 12 july 2013 the applicants lodged separate constitutional appeals. on 18 november 2015 the constitutional court dismissed the first and third applicants’ constitutional appeals, while the second applicant’s constitutional appeal would appear to be still pending. the constitutional court held that there had been no violation of article 6 of the convention as the decisions had been issued by tribunals established by law, which had acted within their competence, and which had given clear reasons for their decisions. there was therefore no arbitrariness in the courts’ rulings. however, it did not go into any analysis about the third applicant’s right of access to court.

the applicants are a family who lived in yerevan in a house on a plot of land measuring 1,385.6 sq. m. in total and situated at 13 byuzand street. the second and third applicants are the first applicant’s wife and son. he thus sought recognition of his ownership rights for the above-mentioned house and the plot of land. no appeal was made against this judgment and it became final. on 18 july 2000 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan granted the first applicant’s claim. on 1 august 2002 the government adopted decree no. 1151-n, approving the expropriation zones of the real estate situated within the administrative boundaries of the kentron district of yerevan to be taken for state needs, having a total area of 345,000 sq. on 22 november 2005 vizkon ltd lodged a claim on behalf of the mayor of yerevan against the srer, seeking to invalidate the registration of the first applicant’s ownership of the plot of land, claiming that it had never been recognised by any judicial act. it also requested that the first applicant be involved in the proceedings, as a third person whose rights were affected by the claim. on 24 january 2006 the first applicant lodged an appeal against this judgment. on an unspecified date, vizkon ltd lodged an appeal on points of law against this judgment. m. in the centre of yerevan in exchange for his revocation of ownership of the house and the plot of land. on 19 april 2006 the applicant sent a reply to the judge informing her of his refusal to sign a friendly settlement. on 21 april 2006 the court of cassation held a hearing of the appeal with the participation of the parties. it appears that the first applicant persisted in his reluctance to sign a friendly settlement. the relevant parts of this decision read as follows:
“...it follows from the examination of [the relevant court decisions] that no ownership right of [the first applicant] had ever been recognised in respect of any plot of land, therefore there are no legal grounds for the registration of [the first applicant’s] ownership to the land. on 15 september 2006 the civil court of appeal examined the claim anew and granted it, finding that the first applicant’s ownership right to the plot of land had not been recognised. on 2 march 2007 the court of cassation declared the appeal inadmissible for lack of merit. on 25 december 2005 vizkon ltd informed the first applicant that the house he owned was situated within an alienation zone. an additional sum would be paid to him as a financial incentive in accordance with government decree no. 759-n of 19 may 2005, if he agreed to sign an agreement and to hand over the property within one month. it appears that the first applicant did not accept the offer. vizkon ltd also joined these proceedings as a third party. on 22 august 2006 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan examined the claim in the presence of the first applicant and a representative of the mayor’s office. it appears that a hospital certificate stating that he was in hospital was attached to the request. by the judgment adopted on the same date the court of appeal upheld the judgment of 22 august 2006 confirming the amount awarded by the district court. the judgment stated that the first applicant had failed to appear despite having been duly summoned to the hearing. the judgment of the court of appeal of 25 september 2006 entered into force at the time of its delivery and was immediately enforceable. on 11 june 2007 the department for execution of judicial acts enforced the judgment by demolishing the house.

the case originated in an application (no. 62614/13) against the russian federation lodged with the court under article 34 of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms (“the convention”) by a russian national, mr gayk levonovich sarkisyan (“the applicant”), on 23 september 2013. the applicant was represented by mr a. anokhin and ms m. gordeyeva, lawyers practising in astrakhan. the russian government (“the government”) were represented by mr g. matyushkin, representative of the russian federation at the european court of human rights. on 28 january 2016 the complaints concerning article 5 § 3 and article 5 § 4 were communicated to the government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to rule 54 § 3 of the rules of court. in particular, the government acknowledged that the applicant had remained in pre-trial detention for an excessively lengthy period in violation of article 5 § 3 of the convention. they offered to pay the applicant 1,200 euros and invited the court to strike the application out of the list of cases in accordance with article 37 § 1 (c) of the convention. the amount would be converted into the currency of the respondent state at the rate applicable on the date of payment, and would be payable within three months from the date of notification of the court’s judgement. in the event of failure to pay this amount within the abovementioned three-month period, the government undertook to pay simple interest on them, from the expiry of that period until settlement, at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage points. the declaration did not mention the applicant’s complaint under article 5 § 4 of the convention.
the applicant was born in 1959 and is currently detained in baia mare prison. on 10 january 2002 an investigation was opened against the applicant for embezzlement, forgery and abuse of his official position as minister for agriculture. the criminal investigation ended on 19 december 2003 with the applicant’s indictment together with three other co-accused. on 28 may 2012 the applicant’s appeal against the above-mentioned judgment was rejected with final effect by a five-judge panel of the high court of cassation and justice. the full text of the judgment became available to the applicant on 1 november 2012. the applicant started serving his sentence in gherla prison on 31 may 2012. on 2 april 2013 he was transferred to baia mare prison where he is currently serving his sentence. on admission to prison, the applicant was already suffering from type ii diabetes, which was being treated with insulin, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, biliary lithiasis and lumbar discopathy. according to the report drawn up on the applicant’s arrival in gherla prison on 31 may 2012 the applicant was allowed to take with him to his cell, among other items, one glucometer with forty-one test strips and needles as well as several drugs. during his ten-month stay in gherla prison the applicant was taken to the medical ward eighteen times. he was given a special diet for diabetics and was allowed to work. he was taken to diabetes specialists outside the prison system on several occasions where he was prescribed a special diet, medication and constant self-monitoring of his glycaemia level. according to the applicant’s medical chart in gherla prison his glycaemia levels were measured two, three or four times per day at the prison’s infirmary. on 9 october 2012 his signature confirmed the receipt of thirteen drugs including vitamin c and omega 3. in addition, he was taken for specialist diabetes and nutrition examinations at the baia mare county hospital nine times between 24 may 2013 and 2 october 2014. according to the information provided by the national administration of prisons the applicant made no complaints concerning his medical treatment. on 5 september 2013 the applicant’s lawyer was informed by the baia mare prison administration that the applicant could not be compensated for the work he had performed in detention with permission to leave the prison. the applicant alleged that he had been transported in conditions which had not allowed him to take his insulin. in addition, the food provided during transport had not been adapted to his diabetes. the vehicles in which he had been transported lacked air conditioning and other prisoners had been smoking during the trips. from the government’s submissions it appears that the applicant was transferred sixteen times between detention facilities, to the hospital or to the courts, in special vehicles (iveco, mercedes or raba vans) which were well-maintained and met the legal comfort requirements. they were fitted with windows, lights, heating and sunroofs. the number of detainees transported never exceeded the number of available seats. detainees were provided with food and water during transfers, and were allowed bathroom breaks. smoking was strictly prohibited in the vehicles. according to the information provided by the national administration of prisons, the applicant was allowed to take with him his personal glycaemia kit and medication and was therefore able to measure his glycaemia. moreover, during long drives a number of breaks were taken allowing the applicant to administer his treatment. as regards the food received during transport, the applicant was provided with a diabetic menu as follows: during transport to and from gherla prison the applicant received 100 grams of biscuits, 100 grams of cheese, one egg and 500 grams of bread; during transport to and from baia mare prison the applicant received 320 grams of unsalted cheese, two eggs, 300 grams of processed poultry meat, 260 grams of semi-white bread and 250 grams of apples. copies of the prison menus were submitted in support of these assertions. according to the prison visits record the applicant often received food packages which included sweets, fruits and vegetables as well as bottles of juice, all of which he was allowed to take with him during transport.
the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. the applicant was born in 1984 and moved to live in russia in the early 2000s. a russian national, and they started living together in the krasnodar region. in 2009 the applicant’s daughter from a previous marriage moved in with them to attend a primary school. married and on 23 august 2012 their son was born. on 30 march 2013 the applicant was returning home by train after a visit to ukraine, together with the two children. shortly after midnight on 31 march 2013 the russian border control service handed her a notice, informing her that she would not be allowed to re-enter russia, in accordance with the entry and exit procedures act. the notice did not specify the grounds for that decision. in april 2013 the applicant’s husband obtained a copy of a decision pronouncing her presence in russia to be undesirable (“the exclusion order”), which the consumer protection authority (cpa) had issued on 9 june 2012. the text of the order indicated that the applicant’s presence in russia had been declared undesirable by the krasnodar regional division of the cpa on 9 june 2012, in accordance with section 25.10 of the entry and exit procedures act. it did not state any facts or reasons for the applicant’s exclusion. it subsequently transpired that the basis for the exclusion order was that during her pregnancy in 2012 the applicant had tested positive for hiv and that the hospital had reported her hiv-positive status to the cpa. according to the government, the krasnodar division of the cpa sent the exclusion order to the applicant by registered mail on 19 june 2012. they produced a log of registered correspondence which was to be submitted to the post office for dispatch on that date. on 24 may 2013 the tsentralnyy district court in sochi rejected the claim in summary fashion, repeating verbatim the text of the exclusion order and holding that it was lawful. he pointed out that the applicant’s husband and newborn son were russian nationals, that her daughter was enrolled in a russian school and that the hiv infection was in a latent stage. on 30 september and 19 december 2013 the krasnodar regional court and the supreme court of russia respectively issued summary decisions, dismissing the application for an examination of the case by the cassation instance. her husband and their son have been living in st petersburg, russia. the husband was unable to visit her in the donetsk region. the constitutional court held that migration laws can lawfully restrict access to russia by non-russian nationals whose medical condition might jeopardise public health and pose a threat to national security. the constitutional court held as follows:
“1. pending such amendments, the constitutional court directed that the executive and judicial authorities be guided by the position it had formulated in the judgment. on 3 july 2015 the district court dismissed his application. it found that, lacking the information that the applicant had been receiving antiretroviral therapy, she must be presumed to be a threat to others, including those with whom she had social and casual contact. the applicant’s husband appealed and on 22 october 2015 the krasnodar regional court quashed the above judgment, finding that the district court had not heeded the position of the constitutional court and had incorrectly shifted the burden of proof onto the applicant:
“the krasnodar office of the consumer protection authority did not produce any evidence of ms ustinova’s conviction under article 122 of the criminal code (infection by hiv) and/or under article 6.1 of the code of administrative offences (concealing the source of hiv infection). nor did it show that she had breached any obligation which the law imposes on hiv-positive individuals, for instance, by refusing to take antiretroviral therapy. on 18 may 2016 the federal migration service issued her a three‑year temporary residence permit. on 31 may 2016 the consumer protection authority informed the border control service about the annulment of the exclusion order. the applicant replied that she had only been able to re-enter russia by crossing the border between ukraine and belarus and by continuing from belarus to russia, as there are no controls on the belarus-russia border. as of 16 august 2016, she has not been notified that the exclusion order of 9 june 2012 was formally rescinded and that the border control database was updated accordingly.
the applicant, magyar helsinki bizottság (hungarian helsinki committee), is a non-governmental organisation (ngo) that was founded in 1989. it monitors the implementation of international human-rights standards in hungary, provides legal representation to victims of alleged human-rights abuses and promotes legal education and training both in hungary and abroad. in particular, it focuses on access to justice, conditions of detention, and the effective enforcement of the right to defence. together with the ministry of justice and law enforcement and various bar associations, the applicant ngo developed a questionnaire aimed at evaluating the performance of defence counsel. the results of the two projects were presented at a conference in april 2009, the conclusions of which were summarised in the report “in the shadow of suspicion: a critical account of enforcing the right to an effective defence”. in the applicant ngo’s assessment, its research showed that the system of ex officio appointed defenders did not operate adequately, essentially because the investigative authorities, in particular the police, were free to choose defence counsel from a list compiled by the relevant bar associations. this gave rise to distrust on the part of defendants. the applicant ngo also concluded that the selection system lacked transparency. as a feature of the project, the applicant ngo requested the names of the public defenders selected in 2008 and the number of assignments given to each lawyer from a total of twenty-eight police departments, situated in the seven hungarian regions. these requests were made under section 20 (1) of act no. thus their names constitute private data, which are not to be disclosed under the law”. the police department also referred to the disproportionate burden the provision of the data would impose on it. a similar request by the applicant ngo was rejected by the debrecen police department on 27 august 2009. data concerning them thus qualified as information subject to disclosure in the public interest. the debrecen police department requested the discontinuation of the proceedings. the debrecen district court joined the two cases. on 21 october 2009 the district court found for the applicant ngo, ordering the respondents to release the relevant information within 60 days. the court found that although defence counsel did not qualify as persons performing public duties, they were also not employees or agents of the respondent police departments, and the question whether defence was an activity of a public-interest nature was a matter which should be assessed with reference to its aim and role. the names of defence counsel and the number of their respective appointments did not therefore constitute information of a private nature, in relation to which disclosure would only be possible with the approval of the person concerned. the court ordered the respondents to surrender the information requested. the court rejected the applicant ngo’s argument that ex officio defence counsel exercised public functions within the meaning of the data act. it upheld the regional court’s judgment in substance, partly modifying its reasoning. the supreme court held as follows:
“... [w]hat needs to be examined is whether defence counsel are to be considered ‘other persons performing public duties’. the supreme court considers, in compliance with recommendation no. 1234/h/2006 of the parliamentary commissioner for data protection, that the question of whether an individual was a person performing public duties has to be determined solely on the basis of the provisions of the data act. in answering this question [of interpretation of the notion of ‘persons performing public duties’], the applicant’s argument concerning article 137(2) of the criminal code is irrelevant, since that provision only prescribes that defence counsel were to be regarded as persons performing public duties for the purposes of the criminal code itself, but not for the purposes of the data act or for any other legal relationship. in so doing, these bodies accomplish their public duties, which are thus terminated with the appointment of defence counsel. following his or her appointment, a defence counsel’s activities constitute private activities although they are performed in pursuance of a public goal. accordingly, under section 19(4) of the data act, the respondent police departments cannot be obliged to surrender such personal data. it follows that the second-instance court was right to dismiss the applicant’s action.”
the applicants were born in 1963 and 1964 respectively and live in kaunas. on 27 february 2001 the kaunas regional court ordered the first applicant’s company to pay a total of 211,883 lithuanian litai (ltl – approximately 61,365 euros (eur)) to the claimant company. on 27 september 2001 the first applicant brought a counterclaim for ltl 167,018, alleging that the claimant company had failed to properly fulfil its contractual obligations. the first applicant submitted a cassation appeal and on 29 january 2003 the supreme court upheld the court of appeal’s decision. on 28 march 2003 the kaunas regional court instituted bankruptcy proceedings in respect of the first applicant’s company. he claimed that he had not been party to the proceedings even though he was the first applicant’s husband and the private unlimited liability company was a joint matrimonial asset. the second applicant was represented by a lawyer throughout those proceedings. during the proceedings, the second applicant asked for adjournment due to his lawyer’s absence, which was granted. on 19 january 2005 it joined them to the bankruptcy proceedings. the second applicant submitted several appeals against the joining of the two cases but they were subsequently dismissed. on 20 june 2005 the kaunas regional court examined the reopened rent arrears case, concluded that the second applicant should not have been involved in the proceedings and rejected the request of the second applicant to have the decision of the kaunas regional court of 8 april 2002 quashed (see paragraph 6 above). on 6 january 2006 her request was granted by the legal aid service. on 20 march 2006 the supreme court examined the applicants’ cassation appeals, observing that the reopened case concerned only procedural aspects and that the merits had not been examined at all. the case was returned to the kaunas regional court for fresh examination. on 12 august 2005 both applicants requested legal aid to prepare claims with regard to the bankruptcy and rent arrears proceedings. on 7 september 2005 both applicants’ requests were denied because their claims were directly related to their commercial or independent professional activities. the applicants started administrative proceedings, complaining about the decisions of the legal aid service not to provide them with legal assistance. on 28 september 2006 and 6 april 2007 respectively their complaints were dismissed by the kaunas regional administrative court and the supreme administrative court, which again held that under domestic law, legal aid was unavailable if the claims were directly related to a person’s commercial or independent professional activities. the applicants asked for the proceedings to be reopened but their request was dismissed on 8 may 2008 by the supreme administrative court. his request was granted by the kaunas regional court the same day. the applicants started administrative proceedings, complaining about the decision of the legal aid service not to provide them with legal assistance. all their requests were granted by the kaunas regional court. their request was granted on 6 may 2008 by the kaunas regional court. the applicants responded on 2 october 2009 (as indicated on the post mark) that they would not be able to attend the hearing because on 30 september 2009 they were sent a notice that another case involving the first applicant was being examined at the same time that day. this letter was received by the court of appeal on 7 october 2009. it examined the case in the parties’ absence, holding that all the parties had been duly notified of the date and time of the hearing. on 23 october 2009 the applicants’ appeal was dismissed. on 3 november 2009 both applicants submitted requests for legal aid for the preparation of a cassation appeal against the decision of 23 october 2009 of the court of appeal. the applicants brought proceedings against the state for damages, alleging that the decisions of the domestic courts had been unlawful. they submitted numerous complaints, including about being deprived of legal representation.
the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in budapest. at the material time, he was a member of parliament and a member of the largest opposition party, the hungarian socialist party. at the plenary parliamentary session on 18 march 2013 the applicant made an interpellation. according to the applicant and not contested by the government, during his speech numerous remarks were made. once the applicant finished talking, he sat down and showed his left middle finger in the direction of the jobbik mps. on 25 march 2013 the speaker initiated disciplinary proceedings against the applicant. xxxvi of 2012 on parliament – 131,410 hungarian forints (approximately 450 euros) for using a blatantly offensive expression. xxxvi of 2012 on parliament and in application of my prerogatives under subparagraph 6 of the same, that parliament

an affirmative decision was adopted by the plenary on 28 march 2013, without any remedy available. it was addressed to the minister of national development and concerned the publication of the list of successful bidders in the national tender for tobacco retail licences. it reads as follows[1]:
“the nation has acquired 1,500 tobacco retailers. tobacco retailers have not had a significant margin, exactly 4.5 per cent. every twenty tobacco retailers will go bankrupt and be replaced by one, that is, instead of every twenty retailers, one will have the concentrated profit. however, the newly introduced 10 per cent profit, now due to the cronies (csókosoknak járó), will result in a situation in which the [new] “national” retailers will have forty times higher profit than was usual. forty-fold profit for the pals and the cronies! this is big-time bloody swinishness (vérbő disznóság)! tobacco licences are, in europe, normally the privilege of those with impaired working abilities. because this work requires the least mobility, it is locally done and not too complicated. the government’s trust of lies is disseminating their false sermon. but there is no point in lying; the tens of thousands who have been sacked and their families will not be deceived. there is not one living soul in this country who would believe your deceitful talk. i am asking therefore the honourable minister: is your face not burning with shame? and if it is, are you then planning to surrender the power and duly hide your head? the applicant submitted a further interpellation on the same topic on 21 may 2013. but to get the golden prize of the juicy retail spots possibly generating millions per day, one needed to belong to, one way or another, the jamboree of buddies of the local fidesz-chieftains. to win, you did not even need to have business premises. in exchange and ex post facto, you have increased the statutory profit rate and, at the same time, prohibited tobacco selling anywhere else, destroying tens of thousands of shops and their employees, under the slogan “let the strong live and the weak perish”. amongst these, i am sure, you will consider sex toys, common horse-riding equipment, and, to please your [extreme right-wing] friends, maybe penis pumps as well or those dance bars around which naked strippers jerk. my previous, prohibited question also targeted this issue: is your face not burning with shame? the interpellation was refused by the speaker on 27 may 2013, with reasoning similar to the one above (see paragraph 10 above).
the applicant was born in 1976 and is detained in togliatti, samara region. on 19 october 2006 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of drug dealing. on 20 october 2006 the samarskiy district court of samara remanded the applicant in custody. the court held that the applicant was suspected of a serious crime, that he could abscond, commit crimes, destroy evidence, threaten witnesses or in any other way interfere with the investigation. on 18 december 2006 the district court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention. the court reproduced the reasoning of the previous detention order. the court also indicated that the applicant had played a leading part in the criminal activities. on 15 february 2007 the district court extended the applicant’s pre‑trial detention on the ground that the investigation was still pending and it was necessary to conduct some investigative activities. the court further referred to the same grounds as in the previous detention orders. the samara regional court rejected the applicant’s appeals against the detention orders. on 1 june 2007 the bolshechernigovskiy district court of the samara region convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to 11 years’ imprisonment and a fine. on 21 august 2007 the samara regional court upheld his conviction on appeal.
the applicant was born in 1985 and lives in vilnius. as a result of the accident, he lost the ability to walk and became disabled. he checked that there were no cars in the left-hand lane, coming either from in front or from behind, indicated left and overtook the car. he drove for another thirty metres and stopped the car. on the same day the police investigator examined the scene of the accident. all those elements were also indicated in a sketch drawn by the investigator. on the same day the investigator examined the applicant’s motorcycle and m.n. he stated that before the collision he had been driving at about 60 km/h and had decided to overtake a bus and two cars. he lay on the ground until the ambulance arrived and took him to hospital. the latter indicated the trajectory of his car before the collision and the exact location of the collision. the applicant’s lawyer submitted additional questions to be forwarded to the expert. the expert estimated the speed of the motorcycle immediately before the collision as at least 70.3 km/h and, assuming that the speed limit on that road was 50 km/h, noted that the applicant had exceeded that limit. on 26 february 2007 the applicant’s mother, r.k., however, the investigator was not given a disciplinary penalty because more than one year had passed since the breach and she was no longer working in the interior affairs system. on 13 august 2008 the district prosecutor discontinued the pre-trial investigation on the grounds that m.n. but by the applicant himself, and that the testimonies of several eyewitnesses had confirmed that conclusion. appealed before the vilnius city first district court. on 20 november 2008 the vilnius city first district court upheld r.k. ’s appeal and reopened the pre-trial investigation. on 23 february 2009 the police investigator ordered a fresh examination of the circumstances of the accident. the examination was carried out by a different expert from the forensic science centre. in his report, delivered on 15 may 2009 (hereinafter “the third expert report”), the expert examined the sketch of the accident and photographs of the two vehicles, and estimated that immediately before the collision the applicant had been travelling at a speed of at least 70 km/h, and that it was not possible to determine the speed at which m.n. the report also stated that the motorcycle had hit the right side of the car, so even if, as claimed by the applicant, the car had entered the left-hand lane suddenly and unexpectedly, that would not have caused the collision, which had occurred in the right-hand lane. ’s actions had not amounted to the crime stipulated in article 281 § 3 of the criminal code. on 23 november 2009 the vilnius city second district court ordered a fresh expert examination of the circumstances of the accident. the fourth expert report concluded that the accident had occurred in the right-hand lane and that it had been caused by the applicant who had exceeded the speed limit and had not slowed down in time to avoid the collision. and some of the eyewitnesses questioned previously. on 22 december 2010 a senior prosecutor upheld that decision, considering that the fourth expert report had assessed all the material collected during the pre-trial investigation, including the specialist’s opinion, and that r.k. had also had an obligation to make sure that none of the drivers behind him had started overtaking, so it was possible that he had committed the crime stipulated in article 281 § 3 of the criminal code. the court observed that the question of m.n.
the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in vilnius. she began as a receptionist and translator and was later promoted to be cultural, information and press officer. on 9 february 2001 the applicant wrote a letter to the swedish ambassador in vilnius. she stated that since 1998 a major change had been made to her work description – she had started managing cultural affairs, enjoying partial independence in decision-making and a high degree of responsibility for financial matters. she was considered as being responsible for certain categories of business because she had to draft budgets for cultural projects. the applicant submitted several letters of recommendation to the court which were written between 1994 and 2006 by her swedish colleagues at the embassy, including the ambassador to lithuania between 1991 and 1994. under section 18, an employee could be dismissed for committing a criminal act, seriously neglecting his duties, or committing further breaches of the requirements of his duties despite warnings having been given. between october 2004 and june 2005 the trade union made several written complaints to the embassy about working conditions. the union expressed the view that a collective agreement between the locally employed staff and the embassy could resolve such issues. the applicant was a source of conflict at the embassy. she expressed a wish to involve a neutral person in negotiations over her working duties. then she walked in, sat for a while and then left. the applicant was also on sick leave in december 2006 and for some months in 2007. the protest was covered by news outlets in sweden. however, before the new ambassador took office, ms naku had not received any complaints about her work during her fourteen years of service. by a judgment of 5 june 2006 the vilnius regional court granted the embassy’s request for the merits of the applicant’s complaints to be left without examination because the embassy had invoked the defence of diplomatic immunity. the embassy, as an institution of a foreign diplomatic service, represents a foreign state, maintains international relations, implements foreign policy goals and defends the rights and interests of its citizens and other individuals. in this case the embassy of the kingdom of sweden made such a request on 19 may 2006, relying on lithuanian case-law. as to the question of state immunity from foreign courts’ jurisdiction, the supreme court noted the lower courts’ conclusion that “from the title of the applicant’s job description (head of culture and information projects) it was already possible to conclude that the duties which were assigned to her contributed to a certain extent (tam tikru aspektu) to the kingdom of sweden’s implementation of its sovereign functions. the supreme court also held:
“... the chamber also observes that international practice is not consistent as concerns the question of which persons working at a diplomatic representation of another state participate in the public functions of the state they represent and who, as a result, work in the civil service of the represented state, on the one hand, and which persons are engaged in activities that are not related to the performance of state functions, and whose activity consequently falls under private law, on the other. the fact that the parties chose an employment contract to formalise the legal relationship between them and that they noted that lithuanian law is applicable [to that relationship], is not in itself a ground to conclude that the parties were bound by an employment legal relationship, and not by that of the civil service, because, as has been mentioned, all the members of the diplomatic representation’s staff who work at the representation are considered to be in the civil service of the [represented] state, irrespective of the nature of the contracts concluded with them. for the [applicant] it is not clear from the lower courts’ decisions on what basis the government of the kingdom of sweden demanded that state immunity be applied and why those courts found the embassy’s letter alone to be sufficient. however, the appellate court found that in her initial lawsuit of 9 december 1999 she had not asked the court to reinstate her to her former job at the polish embassy because of unfavourable working conditions there, but to award her compensation instead. it was only natural that working duties and the structure of jobs at the embassy had changed. moreover, the embassy had no free posts in which to employ her. severance pay depends on the employee’s length of service. labour law issues of such employees are normally regulated by contracts. indeed, local staff working, for example, in a foreign embassy would have no realistic way to present a claim other than in a court of the state of forum. the commission on second reading replaced the words ‘the proceeding relates to’ adopted on first reading by the words ‘the subject of the proceeding is’ to clarify this particular point. (...)” it was opened for signature on 17 january 2005, and has not yet entered into force.
the applicants complained of the excessive length of different civil and criminal proceedings under article 6 § 1 of the convention. all applicants obtained decisions of the constitutional court of serbia, which found a violation of their right to a hearing within reasonable time (see appended table for details of each civil proceedings and constitutional court’s decisions). the court, additionally, declared that the applicants were entitled to the non-pecuniary damages sought, in accordance with article 90 of the constitutional court act (see paragraph 14, article 90, below). all the applicants filed requests with the commission for compensation for payment of non-pecuniary damages. on 14 october 2010 the commission for compensation offered to pay ms prohaska prodanić rsd 60,000 (at the time approximately eur 600) for non-pecuniary damage incurred and rsd 25,000 for costs and expenses. she refused to accept that payment as the commission did not specify the deadline by which the sum would be paid. on 15 september 2015, the ministry of justice paid her rsd 85,000. the applicant v. tomić contacted the commission for compensation on several occasions and requested the payment of non-pecuniary damage. it would appear that he had received no response. on 16 march 2011 the commission for compensation offered to pay mr d. trpković rsd 35,000 (at the time approximately eur 350), but he refused to accept this amount, deeming it insufficient.
the first applicant was born in 1952 and lives in hausen (canton of aargau). the second applicant, who was born in 1990, is the son of the first applicant. the first applicant entered switzerland in 1997, where he applied for asylum in the same year. the first applicant’s asylum application was rejected by the competent authorities. in march 1999 the first applicant married a swiss national and obtained a residence permit. in 2000 a daughter was born to the couple. in 2002 the second applicant visited his father in switzerland for three months based on a tourist visa valid for that period. in july 2003 the second applicant re-entered switzerland for purposes of family reunification with his father. in august 2004 he obtained swiss nationality and has since held nationality of both switzerland and egypt. after encountering difficulties in school and with his step-mother, the second applicant returned to egypt in january 2005, where he was cared for by his mother and his paternal grandmother. in 2006 the first applicant separated from his spouse. the latter continued to live in switzerland with the couple’s daughter. on 1 march 2006 the first applicant lodged a request for family reunification with the second applicant, who was 15 and a half years old at the time and for whom he had custody according to egyptian law. on 15 february 2007 the migration office of the canton of aargau refused that request. on 6 june 2007 that authority dismissed the appeal. on 26 june 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision with the court of appeal in foreigners’ law (rekursgericht im ausländerrecht) of the canton of aargau. on 7 september 2007 that court granted the applicant’s appeal. subsequently, the migration office of the canton of aargau declared that it would grant a permanent residence permit to the second applicant for purposes of family reunification and, on 28 january 2008, transferred the file to the federal office of migration to seek the required consent. on 4 april 2008 the first applicant lodged an appeal against that decision with the federal administrative court, both in his own name and in that of his son. his mother had moved to kuwait with her new spouse and he was now cared for exclusively by his paternal grandmother. on 2 february 2010 the federal administrative court dismissed the appeal. it found, second, that the applicants could not rely on article 8 of the convention, as the second applicant had reached the age of adulthood and was not dependant on the first applicant (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 33 below). on 8 march 2010 the applicants lodged an appeal against that decision with the federal supreme court. it noted that the first applicant had not applied for family reunification immediately after his arrival in switzerland, that the second applicant was cared for by his mother and his grandmother in egypt until he turned 18 years, that the second applicant had lived almost all of his life in egypt and had more important social and personal ties to his country of origin, which would be negatively affected if he moved to switzerland, and that he had returned to egypt after having stayed with his father in switzerland for one and a half years. it observed that the first applicant had, thus, at that time, preferred that the second applicant lived with his mother and that the second applicant would face even more severe challenges to integration now than he had during his first stay in switzerland, given his age. while noting that the first applicant had a close relationship to his daughter in switzerland and that he could, thus, not be expected to relocate to egypt to live there with the second applicant, the court noted that the applicants had not submitted sufficient reasons to justify the second applicant’s reunion with his father in switzerland. moreover, the federal supreme court considered that the circumstances of the present case differed from those of tuquabo-tekle and others v. the netherlands, no. the mother had tried to bring her child to the netherlands as soon as possible after her arrival. moreover, the child’s grandmother who cared for her in ethiopia had taken the child out of school against the mother’s will and planned a forced marriage. on 7 october 2010 the court refused to apply rule 39 of the rules of the court.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in achkhoy-martan, chechen republic. on 13 january 2001 two soldiers of the russian federal forces m. and p. came to the applicant’s house to buy drugs. after the applicant sold heroin to them, unknown persons attacked the soldiers, put them in a car and took them to a hide-out where they were kept for five days. the kidnappers also took m.’s automatic gun. the soldiers were released by law-enforcement officers on 18 january 2001. on an unspecified date the authorities opened a criminal investigation into the soldiers’ abduction. other perpetrators had not been identified. according to the applicant, on 4 april 2007 at approximately 7 p.m. he was arrested on suspicion of having participated in abduction of m. and p. according to the arrest record, the applicant was arrested on 5 april 2007 at 10:40 a.m. 8. on 6 april 2007 the achkhoy-martan district court of the chechen republic authorised the applicant’s detention pending the criminal proceedings against him. on an unspecified date the investigator questioned m. and p. both of them submitted that they had been abducted from the inner yard adjacent to the applicant’s house. they had come to the applicant’s house to buy drugs. the applicant had asked them to enter to help him move the car that had been parked inside. after they had been done with the car, they had been attacked by four persons. m. had cried out to the applicant for help, but the applicant had done nothing. after that they had been blindfolded, put in a car and taken to another place. on 26 june 2007 the district court found the applicant guilty of abduction and theft of firearms and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment. the court relied on the statements of m. and p. given during the questioning by the investigator, the written statements made by their parents to whom m. and p. had told about their abduction, the written statements made by other soldiers who confirmed that m. and p. had been missing in 2001. testified in court as regards his questioning of m. and p. the court also heard a number of the applicant’s relatives and neighbours who testified as to the applicant’s character and the curfew introduced in the village in 2001 and studied the materials from the case-file prepared by the investigator. as regards the use of m. and p.’s written statements, the court noted as follows:
“... according to [the rules of criminal procedure], if the victim of the crime fails to appear in court, the court, if requested by a party to the proceedings or of its own motion, may decide to have the [victim’s] earlier statement read out in the event of a natural calamity or other extraordinary circumstances preventing the [victim’s] appearance in court. the court considers such circumstances to be extraordinary and preventing the victims from appearing in court.” on 15 august 2007 the supreme court of the chechen republic upheld the applicant’s conviction on appeal. on 26 december 2011 the applicant was released.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lived in the sverdlovsk region. on 6 april 2012 the leninskiy district court in nizhniy tagil issued a detention order in respect of the applicant who had been charged with murder and had absconded. the order was to be valid for an initial period of two months following the applicant’s arrest. on 19 february 2013 the applicant was apprehended in china and extradited to russia. on 30 april 2013 the leninskiy district prosecutor asked the district court to extend the applicant’s detention for a further two months. on the same day the district court granted the application in part. it extended the authorised period of detention “for one month, until 19 may”. he complained, in particular, that the initial two-month detention period had expired already on 19 april 2013 and that his subsequent detention had been unlawful. on 10 june 2013 the sverdlovsk regional court rejected the appeal. on 26 september 2013 a judge of the regional court refused the applicant leave to appeal to the regional cassation instance. on 4 march 2014 a judge of the supreme court of the russian federation refused the applicant leave to appeal to the supreme court. the judge noted, in particular, that the belated filing of an application for an extension of the authorised period of detention was not a ground for varying the custodial measure.
the applicant was born in 1987 and lives in helsinki, finland. in the criminal proceedings t. was heard as a witness. in its judgment the domestic court dismissed the applicant’s argument that he had shot the victim in self-defence. the applicant was subsequently transferred to finland to serve his prison sentence. on 11 december 2008 v., the owner of the apartment where the applicant had committed the crime brought a civil action against the applicant before the harju county court. he claimed compensation for damage caused as a consequence of the offence (damaged chair which had been hit by the bullet, damaged or lost belongings (mostly various items used to wrap parts of the victim’s cut up body), damaged flooring after the police had cut out a piece of parquet with a bullet mark to serve as evidence, a lock cylinder removed for evidence, cleaning bills, unpaid utility bills) in the amount of 28,259 kroons (eek) (corresponding to approximately 1,806 euros (eur)). on 14 january 2009 the county court ruled that the action was accepted for proceedings and that the case was to be dealt with in simplified proceedings (lihtsustatud menetlus) under article 405 § 1 of the code of civil procedure (ccp) (tsiviilkohtumenetluse seadustik). it also explained to the parties that if they wished to be heard, they would have to notify the court within fifteen days of the date of receiving the decision. the applicant was asked to provide the court with a written reply to the action. he further contended that he had not committed murder but had shot the victim in self-defence; in so far as the alleged damage related to the collection of evidence, it had been caused by the police; the claims were unsubstantiated in part. he requested examination of the case at a court hearing and asked that he and two witnesses (t. and k. – estonian and finnish forensic experts) be summoned and questioned in court. he stated that he wished to explain that he had not caused the damage and had acted in self-defence. as to the witnesses, he also wished them to give evidence about his acting in self-defence. he asked the court to dismiss the applicant’s request for the summoning of witnesses, as these individuals would be unable to give testimony about the items in the apartment or their value, and their statements could not refute the findings of a final court decision. he also submitted additional evidence to the court (a photo of one of the items in question; a bank statement about the payment of utility bills; price lists to prove the cost of another damaged item and the cost of cleaning services). the court noted the plaintiff’s agreement to the case being examined in written proceedings and that the applicant wished to be heard. no submissions were made to the court within the thirty-day time limit. relying on the judgment in the criminal case, the county court considered it established that the applicant had not acted in self-defence when he killed the victim. the court found on the basis of the applicant’s submissions that accepting the claim was not justified in so far as it concerned the lock cylinder, unpaid utility bills and certain allegedly damaged items. it was noted in the judgment that an appeal lay to the tallinn court of appeal and that the appeal could be examined in a written procedure unless examination at a court hearing had been requested in the appeal. on 22 december 2010 the applicant filed an appeal against the county court’s judgment. he complained that, although he had requested an oral hearing before the county court, no hearing had been held. it noted that the county court had examined the case in simplified proceedings (lihtmenetlus). in such circumstances, the court of appeal could only accept an appeal for examination if the county court in its judgment had granted leave to appeal or a provision of substantive or procedural law had clearly been incorrectly applied or it was clear that the evidence had been wrongly assessed and this could have significantly influenced the court’s ruling. the county court had not granted leave to appeal. however, for that it was not necessary for a court hearing (kohtuistung) to be conducted. on 8 july 2010 the county court had ruled that the case was to be examined in written proceedings and had given the parties an opportunity to make written submissions. pursuant to article 333 § 3 and article 652 § 6 of the ccp (see paragraphs 19 and 20 below) the court of appeal could not therefore consider these arguments in the appellate proceedings. the applicant lodged an appeal against the court of appeal’s decision, arguing that by refusing to allow him a hearing the county court had clearly violated procedural law and article 6 § 1 of the convention. on 30 may 2011 the supreme court decided not to examine the appeal.
the applicant was born in 1944 and lives in sofia. the applicant’s father owned a house with a yard in sofia, which were expropriated by a decision of the mayor of 16 april 1987 with a view to constructing embassy buildings. the decision, based on section 98 (1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973 (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство – “the tupa”), stated that the applicant’s father was to be compensated with a two-room flat and the applicant was to be compensated with another, three-room, flat. by a supplementary decision of 15 april 1988, based on section 100 of the tupa, the mayor determined the exact location, size and other details in respect of the future flats to be offered in compensation. the flats were to be situated in a building which had to be constructed by the bureau for servicing the diplomatic corps (“the bsdc”). the one to be provided to the applicant’s father measured 64.26 square metres. in 1987 the applicant’s parents and the applicant and his family were settled in a two-room municipally-owned flat. in 1991 the plans for the construction of the building where the future flats offered in compensation were to be located were cancelled. the expropriated house was pulled down and the construction works on the plot of land started on an unspecified date. in february 1996 the applicant’s father passed away. by a decision of the mayor of 10 july 1996 the applicant was allocated another flat, with a surface which was about 28 square metres bigger than the surface of the flat originally offered in compensation to him. he was not required to pay an additional amount for the bigger flat. on an unspecified date in 1996 the applicant and his family moved in that dwelling, and his mother continued occupying the municipally-owned flat. in the years that followed the applicant filed numerous requests with the authorities, asking them to find a suitable two-room flat to be provided to him and his mother in lieu of the one which had initially been due. on several occasions before 2001 the bsdc proposed flats but the applicant and his mother turned them down, either because they were not in the vicinity of the expropriated property or because they were not self-contained dwellings. on 10 june 2004 the applicant requested that the mayor of sofia offer as compensation one of the several flats in the vicinity of the expropriated property managed by the ministry of foreign affairs, successor to the bsdc. the request was made in accordance with section 103 (5) of the tupa providing for the so-called re-compensation (преобезщетяване). as no response followed, the applicant lodged an appeal against the mayor’s tacit refusal. the ministry of foreign affairs also participated in the proceedings. in a final judgment of 9 april 2008 the supreme administrative court quashed the tacit refusal and remitted the case back to the mayor for examination of the request. it held that it was the duty of the mayor, and not of the ministry of foreign affairs, to provide a flat to the heirs of the applicant’s father. it appears that even after that judgment the mayor never took a decision on the applicant’s request for re-compensation. in the meantime, the applicant’s mother was evicted from the municipally-owned flat she had been occupying. in 2007 she died, whereupon the applicant became the sole owner of the future flat allocated in compensation to his father for the 1987 expropriation. in 2014, after the present application’s communication to the government, the applicant was requested to file once again with the sofia mayor a formal re-compensation request. it is unclear whether any decision on the matter has been taken after that.

the first applicant was born in 1969 and is serving a life sentence in perekhrestivka in the sumy region (oblast). the attacks were initially investigated by the authorities as unrelated crimes committed by unidentified people. the description of the attacks is set out in the appendix as episodes 1-7. according to the government, on 29 october 2001 the first applicant was charged in absentia with participation in the kharkiv attacks, which had been classified as robberies. on 14 october 2001 the second applicant was arrested. he confessed to participation in the attacks on mr and mrs va. on 7 november 2001 the second applicant was questioned in the presence of his lawyer about the circumstances of the crimea attack (episode 7) and participated in a reconstruction. he described his and mr zakshevskiy’s role in the attack, stating that he had arrived at the scene of the crime on a motorcycle with mr zakshevskiy. he repeated those statements the next day (see zakshevskiy, cited above, §§ 10 and 11). on 28 march, 23 april and 10 july 2002 s.s. and the first applicant commit that crime. arrested in belarus in december 2001, i.k. and the first applicant commit the luhansk murder and witnessed the applicants participate in the attack on the shoe sellers near kharkiv. at a later stage of the pre-trial investigation the applicants’ co‑defendants retracted their statements, saying they had been given under physical and psychological duress. there was no possibility for the applicants to put questions to those victims and witnesses at that stage or later. stood trial at the donetsk regional court of appeal, acting as a trial court (“the trial court”). episodes 4, 6 and 7 respectively) to court. on 17 march 2005 the trial court ordered the police to bring mr g.s. witnesses to the luhansk murder, to court on 6 april 2005. the presiding judge asked whether the witness would appear at the next hearing. he replied that he wished to confirm the statements he had given in the course of the pre-trial investigation, and that the only point he might be confused about was the make of the foreign car he had seen on the night of the murder, since he was not a specialist. could not be brought to the court because they were not present at the addresses they had given and could not be found. it convicted the applicants of banditry, armed robbery and related offences of carjacking, aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder. it acquitted the applicants of several counts of robbery for lack of proof. ten pages of the judgment were dedicated to whether the defendants’ pre-trial statements could be used in evidence even though they had been retracted. afterwards, he examined the case file on at least five days up to 2 august 2006. they also alleged that their defence rights had been breached in various ways. as the person they had seen standing on the road at the scene of the luhansk murder dressed as a traffic police officer. the second applicant submitted, in particular, that in the course of his pre-trial interviews r.m. however, that picture, in the second applicant’s opinion, had not looked like him.
as of 19 february 2011, the date on which he lodged his application with the court, he was serving his sentence of imprisonment in a penitentiary institution in yerevan. on 27 april 2009 the applicant, together with his friend d.t. who was serving his sentence in a penitentiary institution there. and remained in the penitentiary facility in order to start the formalities. he signed a warning concerning the responsibility for sending prohibited items to a prisoner. brought a cake that they had bought from a local store. subsequent inspection of the parcel revealed that there was a disposable syringe filled with liquid inside the cake. on the same date the investigator decided to assign a forensic medical examination of the items discovered. on 29 april 2009 the expert delivered his opinion, which stated that the substances examined were narcotics. had bought a cake which they had then given to the applicant. stated that they had given the cake to the applicant before it was handed over to the administration of the penitentiary facility. the officer of the penitentiary facility who had inspected the parcel, stated during questioning that he had discovered a syringe filled with liquid inside the cake which was to be delivered to m.k. following the confrontation, the applicant complained about the way it had been conducted. he complained, inter alia, that the investigator had failed to record a number of important statements proving his innocence and that he had put several questions to m.s. which were neither recorded nor answered. in this connection the deputy prosecutor of the syunik region questioned the applicant on 6 november 2009 and recorded his complaints. the applicant also requested that another confrontation be held. residents of the town of kapan, and g.b., contained a note made by the courier on 3 december 2009 which stated that d.t. judge d. was thereafter provided with a certificate issued on 19 february 2010 by a hospital in yerevan according to which d.t. by letter of 22 february 2010 the police informed judge d. that m.s. the hearing of 22 february 2010 was postponed until 9 march 2010 because judge d. was ill. ’s mother, he had left for yerevan at the end of february to undergo medical treatment. is receiving medical treatment in yerevan. defence lawyer ... opined:

the applicant was born in 1955 and lives in yambol. the applicant and his brother co-owned a house with a yard and a garage in yambol. by a decision of the mayor of 31 january 1983 the property was expropriated with a view to constructing a residential building. the decision, based on section 98 (1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973 (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство – “the tupa”), stated that the applicant and his brother were to be compensated with flats in a building which the municipality intended to construct. on an unspecified date the flats were constructed and delivered to the applicant and his brother. on 13 july 1994 the mayor modified the decision of 31 january 1983, stating that the two brothers were also to be compensated with a common garage. the applicant’s brother informed the mayor that he renounced his right to compensation with a garage in the applicant’s favour. by a supplementary decision of 30 may 1995, based on section 100 of the tupa, the mayor held that the applicant was to be compensated with the right to build a garage on a municipal land and determined the exact location of the future garage. the applicant did not appeal against that decision and apparently prepared to start the construction works. by a decision of 9 october 2002 the mayor modified the previous decision of 30 may 1995, indicating another municipal plot of land where the future garage was to be built, as it had turned out that the previous one was not owned by the municipality. that decision was not appealed against by the applicant, but was eventually set aside by the yambol regional governor after it had been contested by third persons. on an unspecified date in 2010 the applicant brought a tort action against the yambol municipality, claiming a wrongful failure on its part to provide him with a garage. the action was dismissed, the final judgment being given by the supreme administrative court on 30 march 2011. the domestic courts held that no unlawful inactivity on the part of the authorities had been established, neither had it been shown that the applicant had sustained any damage. in june 2011 the applicant agreed to receive compensation in cash in lieu of the garage due to him. it appears that the municipality had been offering such a solution since 2007. the compensation in cash was paid to the applicant on 4 april 2012.
two conversations with a person using a mobile phone belonging to a certain i.k., which were recorded on 4 september 2009, appeared to incriminate the applicant: one between a woman identified as r.g. and a man known as kiril, later identified as the applicant, and the other between the same woman and another man, in which the same kiril was referred to in terms suggesting that he was involved in the prostitution ring. a judicial investigation was opened on 2 october 2009 into alleged offences of living on the earnings of prostitution with aggravating circumstances, committed as part of an organised gang; trafficking in human beings, committed as part of an organised gang; and criminal conspiracy. a warrant for the applicant’s arrest was issued on 28 july 2010 by judge n.c., the vice-president responsible for the investigation at the lyons tribunal de grande instance. after being arrested in germany pursuant to the warrant, which had in the meantime been converted into a european arrest warrant, the applicant was handed over to the french authorities at 11.45 a.m. on 16 december 2010; he was then brought before the strasbourg public prosecutor and immediately placed in administrative detention in strasbourg. at 10.56 a.m. on 20 december 2010 he was brought for the first time before b.g., the investigating judge dealing with the case, who placed him under formal investigation for the above-mentioned offences. at about 5 p.m. on the same day, the lyons liberties and detention judge, to whom the matter had been referred by the investigating judge, interviewed the applicant and remanded him in custody pending trial. although the alleged offences were classified as serious crimes, the interviews and confrontations carried out during the investigation were not recorded, by virtue of the exception provided for in the seventh paragraph of article 116-1 of the code of criminal procedure, as applicable at the material time. on 17 june 2011 the applicant applied to the investigation division of the lyons court of appeal to have various procedural steps declared void, including the order for his detention, the interviews and confrontations carried out during the investigation and the interception of various telephone conversations. he submitted two requests for preliminary rulings on constitutionality, concerning respectively the seventh paragraph of article 64-1 and the seventh paragraph of article 116-1 of the code of criminal procedure, pursuant to which no video recording had been made of the interviews and confrontations. on 6 september 2011 the investigation division dismissed most of the application to have the procedural steps declared void (except for one point concerning the interception of telephone conversations), in particular restating the reason given in its previous decision of 13 january 2011. in two further judgments delivered on the same day, it referred the requests for preliminary rulings on constitutionality to the court of cassation. on 14 september 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, relying in particular on article 5 § 3, article 6 § 1 and article 14 of the convention and the constitutional principle of equality. on 18 january 2012 the court of cassation referred the requests for preliminary rulings on constitutionality to the constitutional council and deferred judgment pending the council’s decision. 2012-228/229 qpc) the constitutional council declared the seventh paragraphs of articles 64-1 and 116-1 of the code of criminal procedure unconstitutional, holding that by providing for an exception to the rule of compulsory video recording of interviews in connection with serious offences where such interviews were carried out during preliminary or judicial investigations into serious offences relating to organised crime or undermining the fundamental interests of the nation, the impugned provisions infringed the principle of equality. it pointed out that the abrogation of those provisions would take effect from the publication of its decision and would apply in the case of persons in police custody or under formal investigation who were questioned or interviewed from that date onwards. in a judgment of 10 may 2012 the criminal division of the court of cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law. ... it rejected his argument that there had been violations of the convention (he had relied on articles 6 and 14 of the convention and, more broadly, the right to a fair trial and the prohibition of discrimination) and the constitution as a result of the application of the seventh paragraphs of articles 64-1 and 116-1 of the code of criminal procedure in his case. firstly, it held that the constitutional council had specified that the abrogation of the provisions in question would apply only in the case of persons in police custody or under formal investigation who were questioned or interviewed following the publication of its decision, so that his argument had in that respect become devoid of purpose. ... lastly, it held that “it is not possible for anyone other than the party concerned to complain of a breach of the substantive requirements governing police custody, or of the lack of a video recording of police questioning or interviews by the investigating judge, in support of an application to have a procedural step or document declared void”; accordingly, the applicant was not entitled to object that the judgment appealed against had stated that there was no cause to declare void any police questioning or interviews by the investigating judge concerning individuals other than himself. in a judgment of 28 october 2011 the lyons criminal court found the applicant guilty of the alleged offences, although it dismissed the charge of trafficking in human beings. it sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 euros (eur). in a judgment of 20 july 2012 the lyons court of appeal upheld the judgment as to the issue of guilt and sentenced the applicant to six years’ imprisonment with a minimum term of two-thirds of the sentence, as well as imposing a fine eur 10,000 and a five-year exclusion order from the départements of savoie and bas-rhin. an appeal on points of law by the applicant – whose sole argument was that french criminal law was not applicable – was rejected by the criminal division of the court of cassation in a judgment of 12 june 2013.

the applicant was born in 1948 and lives in sofia. the applicant was one of the co-owners of a house with a yard in the town of troyan. by a decision of the mayor of 15 march 1983 the property was expropriated with a view to constructing residential and administrative buildings. the decision, based on section 98 (1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973 (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство – “the tupa”), provided that the applicant was to be compensated with a three-room flat in a building which the municipality intended to construct. by a supplementary order of 27 march 1990, based on section 100 of the tupa, the mayor determined the exact location, size and other details in respect of the future flat to be offered to the applicant. the applicant and the other owners continued occupying the expropriated house. even though the applicant lived in sofia, she apparently continued to keep in it possessions of hers. the building where the applicant’s flat was initially to be located was finished in 2003, but it was smaller than originally planned and no flat in it could be offered to the applicant. the reason for the change of plans, which had been decided upon in 1995, was the restitution of part of the land earmarked for the construction to its previous owners, under restitution legislation adopted in 1992. in april 2001 the municipality issued a building permit for a new building with flats, to be situated on the plot of land where the applicant’s expropriated house was still standing. the permit was renewed in 2004, 2007 and 2010. in the meantime, construction plans were approved, and towards the end of 2003 the municipality allocated the flats to their future owners. on the basis of that distribution, on 13 january 2004 the mayor issued a new decision under section 100 of the tupa in respect of the applicant, revoking the previous decision of 27 march 1990 (see paragraph 7 above) and indicating the exact flat in the new building to be provided to her in compensation. the newly allocated flat measured 94 square metres, slightly bigger in size than the one offered in 1990. nevertheless, dissatisfied with the decision of 13 january 2004, the applicant challenged it before the courts, claiming that it impermissibly modified the 1990 decision dealing with the same matter. the proceedings continued until 20 november 2007 when, in a final judgment, the supreme administrative court dismissed the applicant’s application for judicial review. in the meantime, in 2005 the applicant made a request to the mayor, seeking the revocation of the 1983 expropriation order in respect of her share of the property. as no response followed, she applied for the judicial review of the mayor’s tacit refusal. the ensuing proceedings were initially stayed to await the outcome of those described in the previous paragraph. once they were resumed, in a final judgment of 24 july 2009 the supreme administrative court dismissed the application for judicial review, finding that the preconditions for restitution had not been met. on 13 and 28 august 2009 the mayor ordered the applicant’s eviction from the expropriated house and that the house be pulled down. the applicant applied for the judicial review of both orders. the first one was upheld by the courts in a final judgment of 14 february 2011, and the second one on 20 april 2010. meanwhile, in september 2009 the applicant was evicted. the house was pulled down on an unspecified date, after which the municipality selected a company to carry out the construction works on the site, which started in april 2011. in the meantime, the applicant contested before the courts the 2001 building permit (see paragraph 10 above) concerning the building to be constructed, but was unsuccessful. the building was finished in 2014 and in july 2014 the applicant was invited to receive the keys to her flat. she refused to do so and instead of that challenged before the courts the authorization for the building to be used, claiming in particular that the construction had not been of sufficient quality. the course of these proceedings is unclear.
the applicants live or lived (the second applicant) in split. the applicants’ other personal details are set out in the appendix. except for the third and the fourth applicants who are the co-owners of the same flat, each applicant is (and the second applicant was before her death) the owner of a flat in split occupied by “protected lessees” (zaštićeni najmoprimci). under the lease of flats act (zakon o najmu stanova), which entered into force on 5 november 1996, such lessees are subject to a number of protective measures, such as the duty of landlords to contract a lease of indefinite duration, payment of protected rent (zaštićena najamnina), the amount of which is set by the government and significantly lower than the market rent; and better protection against termination of the lease. in 2005 the applicants brought civil actions before the split municipal court (općinski sud u splitu), seeking to obtain judgements ordering the state to pay them the difference between the protected rent they were entitled to receive under the domestic legislation and the market rent they could have obtained if their flats were not subject to the protected lease scheme. the applicants argued that the inadequate level of the protected rent imposed on them under the lease of flats act unduly restricted their right of ownership. the applicants relied, inter alia, on article 48 § 1 and article 50 of the croatian constitution (see paragraph 18 below). the split municipal court dismissed the applicants’ actions as unfounded. these judgements were upheld by the split county court (županijski sud u splitu), and in case of the third and fourth applicants, also by the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske). in their complaints lodged with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske), the applicants alleged violations of their right to a fair hearing guaranteed by article 29 § 1 and of their right to compensation in case of ownership restrictions guaranteed by article 50 § 1 of the croatian constitution while referring also to its article 48 § 1 (see paragraph 18 below). by decisions of 25 january and 14 december 2011 and 29 march and 9 february 2012 the constitutional court dismissed the applicants’ constitutional complaints, respectively. according to the information submitted by the applicants, the level of the monthly protected rent for their flats changed in the period after the entry into force of the convention in respect of croatia (5 november 1997) in the manner indicated below. the government did not contest this information

the applicant was born in 1980 and lives in samara. at about 8.35 p.m. on 14 october 2009 the applicant was apprehended by officers of the federal service for drug control (фсkн, “the drugs police”) during a test purchase of drugs from him. according to the applicant, he was brought to their premises at around 11 p.m. his account was corroborated by two drug police officers and two attesting witnesses. furthermore, at around 2 a.m. on the following day he was put in a cell that had not bed or stool, light, lavatory or running water, and was smeared with dirt and faeces. during his detention he had not been provided with food or drink, or permitted to use the toilet, but had had to urinate in a plastic bottle. at 6.30 p.m. a criminal case was instituted against the applicant, and thirty minutes later an investigator drew the arrest record, thus formally remanding the applicant in custody. at 11.55 p.m. on the same day he was transferred to a temporary detention centre. on 16 october 2009 the oktyabrskiy district court of samara remanded the applicant in custody. in particular, the court mentioned the following arguments: seriousness and nature of charges; previous conviction not being expunged; absence of “regular source of income”; hence possibility of continuing criminal activities or absconding or obstructing justice in any other manner. on 11 december 2009 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 15 january 2010 finding that the grounds on which the preventive measure had previously been imposed still persisted and there was no reason to vary the preventive measure. additionally, the court mentioned that the applicant had permanent place of residence and employment but it further stated that the applicant “did not have a regular source of income”. on 22 december 2009 the samara regional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, endorsing the reasoning of the district court. the prosecutor was present at the appeal hearing unlike both the applicant and his counsel. on 12 february 2010 the kuybyshevskiy district court of samara found the applicant guilty of selling large quantities of narcotics and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment in a strict-security institution. on 4 may 2010 the samara regional court upheld the conviction. the prosecutor was present at the appeal hearing whereas both the applicant and his counsel were absent.
the applicant was born in 1977 and is currently serving a sentence in a correctional colony in the tambov region. on 17 july 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of robbery. on the following day the meshchanskiy district court of moscow authorised his detention. on 6 september 2007 the taganskiy district court extended the detention. that detention order was upheld on appeal on 22 october 2007 by the moscow city court. another extensions of detention followed on 16 october 2007 and 11 december 2007. the applicant appealed against both detention orders. on 17 january 2008 the applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment. the conviction became final on 19 march 2008. on 2 july 2008, in reply to the applicant’s complaint about the failure to examine his appeal, the city court informed him that his appeal against the detention order of 16 october 2007 was not received by the city court. however, by a letter of 22 august 2008 the city court forwarded the applicant’s appeal statement lodged on 17 october 2007 to the district court, requiring it to perform procedural steps necessary to initiate the appeal proceedings. the city court also informed the applicant that his appeal complaint of 17 october 2007 was mistakenly attached to another case-file. no further information on organisation of the appeal hearing against the detention order of 16 october 2007 was provided.
the applicant was born in 1982 in achinsk, krasnoyarsk region. he was allegedly beaten up by epkt guards on two occasions. upon their return the guards put him in a spread-eagled position and started beating him, until he fell to the floor. they continued beating him for another two to three hours. thereafter he was dragged back to his cell where he was locked up alone. in the end of march 2008 the applicant again visited the prison doctor to complain about a sprained ankle. he diagnosed a blood circulation disorder and prescribed medication. in the summer of 2008 the applicant started using crutches. in november 2008 the applicant was again placed in the old wing of the prison hospital. the treatment was effective and on 21 november 2008 he was discharged. in the beginning of 2009 the applicant’s leg swelled again. his treatment in the hospital continued until 27 april 2009 and resulted in the decrease of the oedema and associated inflammation. compression stockings, drugs and limiting of physical activity were prescribed. the illnesses were addressed with drug therapy. on 10 september 2008 his mother asked for a thorough inquiry into the alleged ill-treatment. the investigating authorities collected extracts from the applicant’s medical records and written explanations from a guard who had been allegedly involved in the beatings. tired of the difficulties of prison life, the applicant had allegedly told the inmates that he had intended to use his chronic ailments to obtain a transfer to a hospital, where he “could rest”. the applicant had insisted that he had been beaten by the guards. after having examined the applicant and his medical file, the expert found no evidence of ill-treatment and insisted that the applicant’s medical condition could not have been caused by or linked to the beatings. the cell was equipped with two double plank beds. according to the government, the number of cellmates in disciplinary cell no. the cell was ventilated by means of a window casement. the window itself, measuring 90 by 60 centimetres, allowed sufficient daylight. the applicant was given uniform, underwear and slippers. the deterioration of his health in november 2008 could have been caused either by the natural course of his illness or by his failure to adhere to doctors’ recommendations. on 23 november 2009 the zheleznodorozhniy district court dismissed the claim, having considered that the medical treatment received in the prison hospital had been adequate and successful, given the significant improvement of his health. the parties to the proceedings did not appear. in 2010 the applicant lodged a claim for non-pecuniary damages against the correctional colony, arguing that the conditions of his detention in the epkt had been appalling and that he had not had adequate medical care in the colony. the experts also stressed that there were no scientifically available means to properly diagnose the applicant’s deep-vein thrombosis before the illness had manifested itself through acute symptoms, such as pain. in the meantime the applicant asked the town court to ensure his presence at the hearing.
the applicant company is a limited liability company incorporated under croatian law, which has its seat in zagreb. on 21 june 2000 the applicant company instituted civil proceedings before the zagreb municipal court (općinski sud u zagrebu) against the croatian health insurance fund seeking payment of 11,500 croatian kunas (hrk)[1] which had been unjustifiably seized from the company’s bank account for the alleged failure to pay health insurance contributions. the municipal court scheduled sixteen hearings of which six were adjourned (in the period between 10 may 2005 and 3 november 2009) at the request of the applicant company. the applicant company’s director failed to attend the hearing scheduled for 6 november 2006 without giving any reasons for his absence. therefore, by a decision of the same day, the court decided to suspend the proceedings (mirovanje postupka) pursuant to the law. the proceedings continued upon the request of the applicant company of 21 february 2007. the statutory conditions for the suspension of proceedings were again fulfilled on 2 march 2010 when the applicant company’s director attended the hearing but failed to engage in litigation. accordingly, on the same date the municipal court issued a decision declaring that the applicant company’s action was to be considered withdrawn, pursuant to the law. by a decision of 17 september 2010 the zagreb county court (županijski sud u zagrebu) dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant company against the first-instance decision. the county court’s decision was served on the applicant company on 3 january 2011. meanwhile, on 1 april 2010 the applicant company lodged a request for protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time (zahtjev za zaštitu prava na suđenje u razumnom roku) with the zagreb county court, complaining about the excessive length of the above civil proceedings. on 3 september 2010 the applicant company’s request was forwarded to the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske). by a decision of 13 july 2011 the supreme court found a violation of the applicant company’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time and awarded it hrk 5,000[2] in compensation. it held that (a) even though there were no substantial periods of inactivity the mere fact that the municipal court had scheduled sixteen hearings suggested that the proceedings had not been conducted efficiently, and (b) the conduct of the applicant company significantly contributed to their length (see paragraphs 6-8 above). by a decision of 6 september 2012 a three-judge panel of the supreme court dismissed the appeal and served its decision on the applicant company on 13 november 2012. by a decision of 31 january 2013 the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) declared inadmissible the applicant company’s subsequent constitutional complaint, and served that decision on the company on 23 march 2013. the constitutional court held that the contested second-instance decision was not open to constitutional review.

the applicants were born in 1964 and 1975 respectively and lived in moscow. on 5 april 2005 the presnenskiy district court in moscow found the applicants and their co-defendants guilty of extortion and gave them a custodial sentence. on 31 october 2005 the moscow city court upheld the conviction on appeal. on 26 january 2006 the presidium of the city court quashed the appeal judgment of 31 october 2005 for formal defects and ordered a new appeal hearing. it did not mention the matter of the defendants’ detention. no ordinary appeal lay against that decision but the second applicant complained to the supreme court about the city court’s failure to render a decision on his measure. on 13 december 2006 a judge of the supreme court rejected his complaint, finding as follows:
“the fact that [the presidium of the city court] unjustifiably (необоснованно) omitted to rule on the preventive measure is not a ground for setting aside its decision because it appears from the ... city court’s decision of 26 july 2006 and the ... district court’s decision of 31 august 2006 that the matter of detention was addressed in subsequent judicial decision which maintained the custodial measure in respect of [the second applicant].” on 26 july 2006 the city court held a new appeal hearing and quashed the initial conviction for formal defects, ordering a re-trial. it also held that there were no grounds for varying the preventive measure and maintained it without setting a time-limit or relying on any provisions of the domestic law. on 21 august 2006 the district court held a preliminary hearing and fixed the trial date for 31 august. it maintained the custodial measure, without citing any reasons, references to the domestic law or time-limits. on 31 august 2006 the district court returned the case file to prosecutor and extended the applicants’ detention, referring to the gravity of the charges but without setting a time-limit. on 30 october 2006 the city court rejected the applicants’ appeals against the extension order. on 16 january 2007 the district court extended the applicants’ detention until 28 february 2007, relying on the gravity of the charges and unspecified circumstances that indicated a risk of perverting the course of justice. on 21 february 2007 the city court quashed the detention order of 16 january because of an incorrect date in its text. it maintained the custodial measure without giving reasons. on 27 february 2007 the district court issued an identically worded detention order which was upheld on appeal on 16 april. on the same date the district court granted a further extension of the applicants’ detention until 30 april 2007, relying on the gravity of the charges. the extension order was upheld on appeal on 25 june 2007. further extensions were approved by the district court on 27 and 28 april (upheld on appeal on 25 june), 8 and 16 may (upheld on appeal on 23 july), and 13 june 2007 (upheld on appeal on 1 august). on 11 october 2007 the district court found the defendants guilty and gave them custodial sentences.
the applicants were born in 1985 and 1980 and live in jilemnice and prague respectively. the applicant gave birth to her first child in hospital in 2007 without any complications. she was also forced to give birth in a position she did not find comfortable. she wanted to leave the hospital a few hours after the birth as both she and the baby were healthy, but a doctor ordered her to stay in the hospital. the pregnancy was free from complications and the medical examinations and tests did not indicate any problems. moreover, prevailing expert medical opinion did not approve of home births. not having found any health professional to assist her, the applicant gave birth to her son alone at home on 11 may 2011. nine out of the fourteen judges attached separate opinions to the decision, in which they disagreed with the reasoning behind it. the applicant is the mother of two children who were born at home in 2008 and 2010 with the assistance of a midwife. according to the applicant, before deciding to give birth at home, she had visited several hospitals, which had all refused her requests to deliver the baby without any medical intervention that was not strictly necessary. at the time of lodging the present application, the applicant was pregnant again, with an expected delivery in the middle of may 2012. the pregnancy was free from complications and she again wished to give birth at home with the assistance of a midwife. however, she was unable to find a midwife willing to assist because of the risk of a heavy fine if medical services were provided without authorisation. in a letter of 18 november 2011 the ministry of health replied that it did not provide medical services to individual patients and that the applicant should make enquiries to the city of prague (město praha), which, acting as a regional office, registered and issued licences to health professionals. on 7 may 2012 the applicant gave birth to a child in a maternity hospital in vrchlabí, 140 km away from prague. nevertheless, according to her, not all her wishes had been respected. it stated that the recommendation of specialists was that a newborn should be discharged from the maternity hospital no sooner than seventy-two hours after birth. in other european countries the figures ranged from 0.5% in sweden and italy to 4.7% in azerbaijan. in most european countries the figures were below 1%. according to their 2006 report, perinatal mortality is an important indicator of maternal care and maternal health and nutrition; it also reflects the quality of available obstetric and paediatric care, comparing different countries. the reported data regarding stillbirths were not adjusted to this effect in the study. according to the european perinatal health report on the health and care of pregnant women and babies in europe in 2010, issued in 2013 within the framework of the activities of the euro-peristat project, the czech republic was among the countries with the lowest mortality rate for newborns in the first twenty-seven days of their life. several have been prosecuted, however, for alleged malpractice in connection with a delivery at home. the applicants referred to the cases of ms š. she was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment, suspended for five years, and prohibited from practising the occupation of midwife for three years. was based on the fact that she had not strongly advised the mother to contact a medical facility when consulted by telephone during a labour that was already ongoing at home. was eventually acquitted by the district court on 23 may 2016. the criminal complaint was not lodged by the parents but by a hospital. it held that the conclusions of the ordinary courts as to ms k.’s guilt had been too subjective and were not supported by the evidence beyond all reasonable doubt, thereby violating the principle of the presumption of innocence. that freedom, which includes freedom in personal activities, is accompanied by a certain degree of acceptable risk.
the first and second applicants were born in 1940 and 1942 respectively and live in kaunas. the third applicant was born in 1977 and lives in france. the four buyers paid, in equal parts, a total of 15,000 lithuanian litai (ltl; approximately 4,344 euros (eur)) to g.o. were provided with four plots of land (one plot each) in the city of vilnius the following month. in august and september 2001 the applicants, represented by v.m., it was suspected that an organised criminal group was forging documents showing deportee status in order to obtain priority rights in the property restoration process. it was also suspected that some officials of regional authorities had unlawfully restored property rights to individuals who did not have such rights. stated that in 1994 he had befriended e.k. that he had found a person who was willing to sell his restoration rights. submitted that he had not known the buyers previously and had only met them when signing the agreements. in all their dealings related to the land v.m. had informed him about the pending pre-trial investigation and advised him to tell the authorities, if questioned, that he (v.m.) in january 2002 the prosecutor of the vilnius region (hereinafter “the prosecutor”) lodged a claim before the vilnius city first district court, asking for the administrative decisions which had acknowledged g.o. and all the administrative decisions which had allocated land to them, to be overturned. that claim was amended in june and september 2002 and june 2005. on 20 february 2006 the vilnius city first district court allowed the prosecutor’s claim in part. ’s property rights and that the latter had lawfully sold those rights to the applicants. accordingly, the court ordered the applicants to return to the state an amount corresponding to the market value of the land at the time they sold it, as that value was the lowest. the applicants appealed against that judgment; on 6 june 2006 the vilnius regional court dismissed their appeal. on 29 june 2007 the applicants submitted a claim against the state for pecuniary damages before the vilnius regional administrative court. on 13 march 2008 the vilnius regional administrative court dismissed the applicants’ claim for damages. the applicants appealed against that judgment. or other unlawfully acting officials, or that the applicants had pressured any officials to act unlawfully to their benefit. the court held that by selling their plots for a price that was significantly lower than their market value the applicants had acted at their own risk, and thus the difference between what they had received (ltl 25,000 each) and what they were obliged to pay to the state (ltl 216,000 each) could not be regarded as pecuniary damage. relying on the supreme court’s judgment of 5 june 2007 (see paragraph 19 above), the supreme administrative court considered that the applicants had abused their rights by attempting to get from the state more land than g.o. were informed by the national land service that they were number 185 in the above-mentioned list. they were invited to a meeting of candidates during which they would be able to choose one plot of land of up to 0.12 hectares in joint ownership. were present but the third applicant was not. since the four of them were entitled to receive one plot of land in joint ownership, the first and second applicants (and v.m.) were not allowed to choose a plot in the absence of the third applicant.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in donetsk. on 18 july 1997 the donetsk regional court of appeal (“the regional court”) granted amnesty to the applicant. on 26 september 1997 the same court, following an objection (протест) by its president, quashed the decision of 18 july 1997 and upheld the judgment of 29 may 1997 by a final decision. in october 1997 the kirovskyy court sent its judgment to the local police with a view to ensuring its enforcement. as submitted by the applicant and eventually established by the domestic courts (see paragraph 12 below), he continued living at his permanent address. although he was placed on a wanted list for a brief period in december 1997, neither during that period nor thereafter did the police try to contact him. on 12 february 2003 the kirovskyy police arrested the applicant at his home and brought him to dzerzhynsk prison no. following numerous unsuccessful complaints to the prosecution authorities, in march 2003 the applicant lodged a complaint with the kirovskyy court, stating that his arrest and detention had been unlawful and requesting to be released. the court found no evidence in the case file that the applicant had been informed of the court hearing and the final decision of 26 september 1997. he had been arrested more than five years later. by that time his sentence had become time-barred, a fact which the police had been obliged, but had failed, to check. as regards the applicant’s request for release, the kirovskyy court stated that the issue was no longer of relevance (see paragraph 14 below). in the meantime, on 27 april 2005, the dzerzhynskyy local court ordered the applicant’s release on parole. the applicant was released on 4 may 2005 once all the formalities had been completed. in 2006 the applicant lodged a claim for damages against the ministry of the interior on account of his unlawful arrest and detention. he relied on the compensation act, under which a person could claim such compensation if the unlawfulness of his or her arrest and detention had been established by a judicial decision (see paragraph 26 below). the applicant referred in that connection to the court’s decision of 23 march 2006, in which his deprivation of liberty had been found to be unlawful (see paragraph 12 above). on 3 april 2007 the kirovskyy court rejected his claim as unfounded. it noted the existence of the judicial decision referred to by the applicant without, however, commenting on it. it also observed that he had been released without any conclusion about his guilt. having relied on the above considerations, the kirovskyy court concluded that the applicant had failed to prove that he had been deprived of his liberty unlawfully. on 26 june 2007 the regional court upheld that decision. on 22 august 2007 the applicant’s representative, g., appealed on points of law. as confirmed by a postal acknowledgement of receipt, on 17 october 2007 the supreme court received a registered letter from the applicant’s representative, which had been dispatched on 12 october 2007 and which concerned the case under the number indicated in the ruling of 6 september 2007. according to the applicant, his representative had sent the requested authority form by the above-mentioned registered letter. according to the government, the content of that letter and the documents enclosed, if any, could not be established in the absence of their detailed description on the acknowledgment of receipt. on 30 october 2007 the supreme court returned the applicant’s appeal on points of law without examination. on 9 november 2007 the supreme court sent its ruling to the applicant’s representative. according to the applicant, his representative received it on 24 november 2007. on 3 december 2007 g. requested that the supreme court give reasons for the dismissal of the applicant’s appeal on points of law, since the ruling of 6 september 2007 had been complied with.

decree on 3 march 2008. on an unspecified date in march 2008, the applicants instituted administrative proceedings challenging their dismissal and seeking to be reinstated in their work. in

on the ground of convictions and opinions was prohibited by law. on 10 april 2008 the ministry of foreign affairs, as a respondent, lodged a response with the administrative court (հհ վարչական

activities. furthermore, the applicants had made use of their official capacity since they indicated their official titles in the statement. on 29 may 2008 the administrative court dismissed the

as protected by article 27 of the constitution (հհ սահմանադրություն), was not breached since the applicants, in exercising that right, had made use of their official status and work facilities.

administrative court, claiming, inter alia, a violation of their right to freedom of expression, as protected by article 10 of the convention. they also claimed that their dismissal had been based on an erroneous interpretation of sections 40, subsection 1, point (j) and 44, subsection 1, point (c), of the diplomatic service act since they had not made use of their official capacity or work facilities when making the impugned statement. furthermore, the statement had not been made for the benefit of any political party and it could not be qualified as political activity as such.

( агентство интимных услуг контакт или имидж!). the article was headlined “candidates must be known from the inside!” ( vasilinka proved to be a dame with a touch of greed and was pulled by a free advert for her agency in our newspaper, although she warned us that she would not answer a single question about that ‘bitch’ masyanya. ‘this ragtag bunch from st petersburg has no reason to be here because my agency contact or image can handle the elections – all my girls are professionals, and i myself am a lawyer and have extensive working experience as a prosecutor. sporadically, during elections, i run the contact or image escort agency in coordination with superior organisations. besides, this is a good opportunity for the contact or image escort agency to study its clients from the inside, which is particularly important when working with candidates to the state duma. this is, so to say, a governmental order, which, i think, is also supported by the president. especially as it’s for extra income, and there’s no such thing as too much money, even when one is at liberty,’ vasilinka told our newspaper. the article was followed by a list of candidates and vasilinka’s comments on them, using slang words and expressions commonly used in the criminal underworld. some candidates were described in more positive terms than others. to the left of the article was a picture of a female dressed in a one-dollar banknote. the figure’s left hand pointed in the direction of three handwritten letters which were reproduced in small type. he also complained that the picture accompanying the article had been put together in an indecent manner, in breach of the established rules of behaviour and public morals. the court noted in particular:
“in issue no. 47 for 20-26 november 2003 in the column headlined “nadezhda alisimchik’s hummock of view” the newspaper arsenyevskiye vesti published an article ‘candidates must be known from the inside’ which was accompanied by a photographic collage showing a female body covered with a one-dollar banknote. the claimant’s representative has highlighted the insulting nature of the information published in the newspaper ... pointing out that the claimant is a public figure and often takes part in tv programmes; his photograph has been published on numerous occasions in the media, and [mr v.’s] face is therefore well known to people in the primorskiy region. at the hearing the applicants had contested the guilty verdict. the first applicant stated that the article had been misinterpreted and that it had in fact concerned violations committed by law-enforcement agencies during the election campaign. it had therefore been clear that information “of an insulting nature” had related to mr v. the district court observed that, “by virtue of his office, mr v. [was] a public figure and readers [could] therefore easily understand that the photographic collage [showed] mr v.; so that readers [were] not mistaken, the name of the character in the article, ‘vasilinka’, [had] the same root as mr v.’s surname, and the character [was] a lawyer by profession and has extensive working experience as a prosecutor”. in the court’s opinion, representing the prosecutor of the primorskiy region as an immoral and corrupt ‘prostitute-werewolf’ is intended to ascribe distinctly negative characteristics to [mr v.’s] personality in an indecent form.” on 5 april 2005 the first applicant informed the bailiff that she was unable to pay the fine in one amount owing to a lack of funds. she requested that she be authorised to pay by instalments over six months. it appears that her request was refused and the first applicant had to borrow a part of the fine from the bank. according to the first applicant, she was able to pay back the money she borrowed six months later. the second applicant was also unable to pay the total amount of the fine and execution fee in one amount. she paid in instalments by deductions from her wages until 28 february 2006.
the applicant was born in 1977, and lived until his arrest in the town of krasnyy sulin, rostov region. he died in a prison tuberculosis hospital in rostov-on-don. on 27 march 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having been involved in drug trafficking. the two defendants were to stand trial together before the town court. on several occasions the town court extended the detention of the two defendants, each time using similar wording, citing the gravity of the charges and the lack of any change in the circumstances and risks which had initially warranted their detention. on 6 september 2007 the medical authorities informed the town court that the applicant’s state of health did not allow him to attend court hearings. on the same day the proceedings were stayed until his recovery. on 29 october 2007, after receiving notice of the applicant’s expected discharge from a prison hospital, the town court resumed the proceedings and scheduled a hearing for 26 november 2007. on 25 september 2008 the town court found the applicant guilty of two counts of the production and attempted sale of opium and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment. in the course of the new round of proceedings the town court, on a number of occasions, authorised the applicant’s continued detention. each time the gravity of the charges and the risks of his re-offending and absconding served as the reason for the extension. the extension orders were formulated in the same standard manner. the applicant did not attend the hearings as his tuberculosis remained contagious. on 14 may 2009 the town court decided to stay the proceedings until the applicant’s recovery. the hearings were to be held on the hospital premises. [the town court] came to the correct conclusion that the circumstances that had [indicated the necessity for] the applicant’s detention had not changed. on 25 august 2009 the rostov regional court upheld the applicant’s conviction. in 2006, prior to his arrest, the applicant was diagnosed with advanced tuberculosis, pleurisy, and inflammation of the tissue layers lining the lungs and inner chest wall. he was treated in the rostov regional state tuberculosis hospital. the condition was further complicated by pleurisy. a course of drugs, dietary nutrition and the drainage of fluid from the pleural cavity were prescribed. while a report by the detention authorities in april 2010 stated that he had been given the treatment in full, the applicant’s medical file did not contain any information confirming that he had complied with the course of drug treatment. the applicant was regularly examined by doctors, underwent various medical tests and received treatment for tuberculosis. on 9 january 2008 a drug susceptibility test was performed. several days later his drug treatment was amended and the illness was brought under control. the applicant was recommended a non-surgical course of treatment. on 30 january 2009 he consulted a psychologist and a psychiatrist on this matter. on 3 december 2009 and 12 february 2010 the doctors confirmed that the applicant could not undergo the prescribed pulmonary surgery due to the continuing deterioration in his health. on 29 october 2010 a medical panel concluded that the applicant’s condition warranted his early release from detention. on 10 november 2010 the town court ordered the applicant’s release on health grounds.
the applicant was born in 1967 and lived in rostov-on-don prior to his arrest. on 30 march 2006 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder. by judgment of 16 may 2006, the orlovskiy district court of the rostov region found him guilty and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment. on 18 july 2006 the rostov regional court upheld the conviction. the applicant and his counsel lodged an application for supervisory review of the conviction. on 12 april 2007 the presidium of the regional court, upon hearing the prosecutor, counsel for the applicant and for the injured party, quashed the conviction for formal defects and ordered a re-trial. the presidium directed that the applicant should be held in custody, without citing grounds for the custodial measure or setting a time-limit for its application. on 26 june 2007 the district court held a preliminary hearing and fixed the trial date for 3 july. by the same decision, the court determined that the applicant should remain in custody because he was charged with a particularly serious offence and could pervert the course of justice if released. the applicant and his counsel filed an appeal against the extension order. on 31 july 2007 the regional court examined the appeal in the absence of the applicant and his counsel. it annulled the detention order on the ground that the district court had failed to set a time-limit for the applicant’s detention, in breach of the requirements of the code of criminal procedure. it did not take any decision regarding the applicant’s further detention and referred the issue to the district court for a new examination. on 7 september 2007 the district court extended the applicant’s pre‑trial detention for a period of six months starting from 28 april 2007 and lasting until 28 october 2007, referring to the gravity of the charges and the applicant’s new line of defence which, in the district court’s view, was an indication that he might abscond. on 8 october 2007 the regional court rejected in a summary fashion the appeal against the extension order. on 15 october 2007 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 28 december 2007, referring to the gravity of the charges and the flight risk. on 11 december 2007 the regional court upheld the detention order on appeal. on 13 december 2007 the district court examined the applicant’s request for release. noting that the trial was approaching the final stage, that the witnesses had been heard, and that the applicant had family and dependent children, the court held that the applicant could be released on bail. the applicant was released the following day. on 5 february 2008 the regional court quashed the bail decision, holding that the district court had not taken proper account of the gravity of the charges. on 20 february 2008 the district court reconsidered the matter and held that the applicant should be re-detained for a further three months on account of the gravity of the charges against him. on 26 march 2008 the regional court upheld the detention order on appeal. on 3 march 2008 the district court found the applicant guilty of murder and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment. on 23 april 2008 the regional court upheld the conviction.
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in the leningrad region. on 25 february 2009 an investigator charged the applicant with kidnapping in absentia and put his name of the international list of fugitives from justice. on the same day the investigator asked the vasileostrovskiy district court in st petersburg to detain the applicant on remand. on 2 march 2009 the district court granted the investigator’s application for a detention order, referring to the gravity of the charges against the applicant. on 22 july 2009 the applicant was apprehended in the vologda region and transferred to a remand prison in st petersburg. on 30 july 2009 the applicant was interviewed and received a copy of the charge sheet. he also submitted an appeal against the detention order of 2 march. on 1 september 2009 the st petersburg city court heard the appeal and set aside the detention order, finding that the failure to follow the legal procedure for putting the applicant’s name on the list of fugitives from justice amounted to a “fundamental breach” of the rules of criminal procedure. it ordered a new examination of the detention matter but did not specify whether or not the applicant should remain in custody. as it happened, the applicant was not released. on 18 september 2009 the district court refused the investigator’s request for a detention order. it held, firstly, that the gravity of the charges was not a sufficient reason for detaining the applicant and, secondly, that the procedure for putting his name on the list of fugitives from justice had not been followed. the applicant was released in the courtroom. on 21 october 2009 the district court found the applicant guilty and gave him a custodial sentence conditional on four years’ probation.
the applicant was born in 1955 and lives in moscow. on 11 january 1999 the parish of the russian orthodox church of the dormition of the theotokos (the “parish”) brought a civil claim against the applicant and her family claiming title to the land plot de facto used by the latter. in may 1999 the applicant brought a counterclaim seeking annulment of the parish’s title to the land plot. on 23 november 1999 the butyrskiy district court of moscow granted the parish’s claim and dismissed the counterclaim lodged by the applicant. on 18 february 2000 the moscow city court upheld the judgment of 23 november 1999 on appeal. in july 2000 the city prosecutor’s office, upon the applicant’s request, asked for the supervisory review of the above judgments. on 24 august 2000 the presidium of the moscow city court quashed the judgments of 23 november 1999 and 18 february 2000 by way of supervisory review and remitted the matter for fresh consideration. it appears that both parties amended their claims in part for several times. the applicant eventually sought recognition of her property title to the land plot in question. on 4 may 2005 the district court granted the applicant’s claims in full. on 11 august 2005 the city court upheld the judgment of 4 may 2005 on appeal. it appears the judgment of 4 may 2005 was not enforced. on 25 december 2005 the parish asked for the supervisory review of the judgments in the applicant’s favour. on 13 july 2006 the presidium of the city court quashed the judgments of 4 may and 11 august 2005 by way of supervisory review and remitted the matter for fresh consideration. on 31 january 2007 the proceedings discontinued due to the absence of the parties.
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in rudinská. on 17 december 2008 the applicant lodged a civil action with the žilina district court (file no. 8 c 240/2008) seeking an order for the defendant (a municipality) to enter into a contract with her concerning the transfer of a flat, in which she resided. the district court scheduled two hearings for 8 june and 8 july 2009; it ruled on the merits of the action and granted the action on the latter date. the applicant lodged an appeal; the judgment was quashed by a court of appeal on 8 april 2010 and the matter was remitted on 4 june 2010 to the district court. the applicant lodged a complaint under article 127 of the constitution with the constitutional court contesting the length of the proceedings in so far as those had been held before the district court. on 11 october 2012 the constitutional court (file no. ús 423/2012) rejected her complaint on the ground that, prior to lodging her constitutional complaint, the applicant had failed to exhaust ordinary remedies, in particular lodging a complaint with the president of the district court under the courts act (law no. the constitutional court noted that the court of appeal had transferred the case file to the district court on 4 june 2010 and that the applicant had lodged her constitutional complaint on 27 september 2012. it found that, within that period, the district court had failed actively to proceed with the matter for one year and a half. the constitutional court observed that the court’s previous case-law – such as ištván and ištvánová v. slovakia (no. 30189/07, 12 june 2012), which concerned a delay of more than six years – dealt with unjustified delays imputable to the courts that were substantially longer than those in the present case (one year and a half). the constitutional court considered that, because the unjustified delays in the present case had been shorter (compared to those in respect of ištván and ištvánová and other similar cases), it was justified in requiring – before turning for protection to the constitutional court – that the applicant lodge a complaint with the president of the district court with a view to accelerating her proceedings. following the constitutional court’s decision, the district court scheduled a hearing for 9 september 2015. at the time of communication of the application the proceedings were still pending.
the applicant was born in 1953 and lives in vienna. the otto wagner hospital is a public institution of the city of vienna specialising in neurology, orthopaedics, psychiatry and pulmonology. he had escaped from the premises and died after jumping in front of a subway train. subsequently, in august 2010 the applicant brought a civil action in the vienna regional civil court (landesgericht für zivilrechtssachen) under the official liability act (amtshaftungsgesetz) against the city of vienna (stadt wien) as the authority responsible for the hospital, seeking compensation of 20,000 euros (eur) plus interest in respect of non‑pecuniary damage. had posed a danger both to himself and others. ’s mental state, diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. ’s mental state required him to be placed in a closed psychiatric institution. had lived with her in the same household and they had had a very close relationship. nonetheless, her mental state had not improved since. the fact that her son had been able to escape from the hospital premises led the applicant to conclude that the hospital staff had acted negligently in the performance of their duties. furthermore, such restriction should have included a degree of supervision by the hospital staff. there had been signs of suicidal thoughts on the patient’s part, and the hospital staff should therefore have prevented him from leaving the ward. however, the necessary diligence had not been exercised. because of the threat he posed to himself and others, he had repeatedly had his freedom of movement restricted whilst in hospital and had had to be medicated parenterally. on 25 march 2010 he had left the acute station without permission and went to his parents’ place. in view of the progress in his treatment, and as he appeared more reasonable and able to abide by agreements, he had been transferred from the acute station to the subacute ward on 20 april 2010. however, he had then succumbed to so‑called “dynamic exhaustion” (dynamische entleerung), which manifested itself in a noticeable loss of drive and the desire for a quiet environment. moreover, he had been made aware that he was not allowed to leave the hospital premises and had to notify the staff before going out for a walk and again upon his return. he had also been permitted to leave the building to smoke a cigarette. there had been no indication of suicidal thoughts. however, on 12 may 2010 at 5.15pm the doctor on duty was informed by the hospital staff that the applicant’s son had not returned from an authorised walk in the hospital grounds and had apparently taken his personal clothing with him. in the present case, by 12 may 2010 restriction of the physical movement of the applicant’s son (known as “fixation”), and/or the spatial restriction of his movement to the confines of a psychiatric bed, or his permanent supervision, were no longer medically indicated, nor would such measures have been reasonable or adequate. on 30 november 2012 the vienna regional civil court granted the claim. there was no effective supervision of his walks or their duration. therefore, even if he did not pose a threat to himself anymore, the requirement for hospitalisation was still valid because of the threat he posed to others. according to the expert opinion by dr p of 25 may 2012, the continuation of m.k. this was the reason why his freedom of movement at that point had been restricted to the hospital premises rather than just the closed ward. would not have been able to commit suicide if he had been prevented from leaving the hospital grounds. on 18 july 2013 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, upholding the legal and factual findings of the court of appeal. ’s hospitalisation had therefore not been unlawful, even though he had been placed in the open ward from 20 april 2010.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lived in budapest. having been a judge since 1 january 1978 and a member of the supreme court since 1 march 1994, on 15 november 2009 he was appointed vice-president for a six-year term by the president of the republic, after being proposed for the post by the president of the supreme court. the mandate of the president of the supreme court was prematurely terminated, upon the entry into force of the fundamental law on 1 january 2012, in reaction to his criticisms and publicly expressed views regarding proposed judicial reforms (see baka v. hungary [gc], no. in connection with these events, a proposal for the termination of the applicant’s mandate as vice-president was submitted to parliament on 23 november 2011, and was adopted on 28 november 2011 in the form of section 185 of act no. clxi of 2011 on the organisation and administration of the courts (“the aoac”) (see baka, cited above, § 30). accordingly, as of 1 january 2012, the applicant was removed from his position as vice-president, three years and ten months before the scheduled expiry of his mandate. he remained in office as president of one of the civil law division benches of the kúria (the historical appellation by which the supreme court was renamed in 2012). on 7 february 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court challenging the termination of his position. ab, adopted by eight votes to seven, the constitutional court rejected the constitutional complaint. it held that the premature termination of the applicant’s term of office as vice-president had not violated the fundamental law, since it had been sufficiently justified by the full-scale reorganisation of the judicial system and important changes made in respect of the tasks and competences of the president of the kúria. it noted that the kúria’s tasks and competences had been broadened, in particular with regard to the supervision of the legality of municipal council regulations (for the relevant parts of the constitutional court’s judgment see baka, cited above, § 55). seven judges dissented and considered that the changes concerning the judicial system, the new kúria and the person of its president had not fundamentally affected the status of the vice-president. the position of the vice-president within the organisation of the supreme judicial instance had not changed. under the act lxvi of 1997 on the organisation and administration of the courts, the vice-president was already entitled to act in the stead of the president of the supreme court only with regard to managerial tasks at the supreme court, but not with regard to his or her functions as president of the national council of justice (see baka, cited above, § 56). the dissenting judges concluded that the premature termination of the applicant’s term of office had not been sufficiently justified by the reorganisation of the judicial system; and that it had weakened the guarantees in respect of the separation of powers, had been contrary to the prohibition on retroactive legislation, and had breached the principle of the rule of law and the right to a remedy. on 6 july 2012, as a consequence of the lowering of the judges’ mandatory retirement age pursuant to section 90 (ha) of act no. clxii of 2011 on the legal status and remuneration of judges (“the alsrj”) (see baka, cited above, § 52), the president of the republic released the applicant from his duties as a judge with effect from 31 december 2012. 17) ab of 16 july 2012, the constitutional court declared unconstitutional and consequently annulled the provisions on the compulsory retirement age of judges (see baka, cited above, § 53). on the basis of that judgment, the budapest labour court found, in a first-instance judgment of 21 march 2013, that the termination of the applicant’s judicial service had been unlawful and reinstated him – without, however, ordering his reinstatement in his previous position as president of one of the civil law division benches of the kúria. following the constitutional court’s judgment of 16 july 2012, parliament adopted a modified scheme governing the reduction of judges’ compulsory retirement age and provided different options for those who had already been affected by the unconstitutional legislation (see act no. xx of 2013 referred to in baka, cited above, § 54). the applicant opted not to be reinstated and received lump-sum compensation for the termination of post as a judge.
he is currently serving a sentence in correctional colony no. several hours later the victim died in hospital from massive blood loss. it was further extended at the investigative authorities’ requests on a number of occasions given the seriousness of the charges, negative references about the applicant’s character and the fact that the applicant did not have permanent residence or a job. on 12 september 2007 a doctor discovered several bruises on the applicant’s body. the date the injuries were sustained could not be determined. he had died because of a knife wound to his femoral artery. neither the applicant nor his lawyer asked the expert to explain any possible contradictions between the two autopsy reports. they did, however, challenge the admissibility of the second report in view of the fact that they had only been notified of it afterwards. the trial court, convinced by the prosecution witnesses that the three individuals had not been present during the attack, dismissed the applicant’s request. it also noted that it had no legal power to find witnesses. on 8 august 2008 he was convicted of unintentional killing and sentenced to eight and a half years’ imprisonment. the regional court also ordered that the applicant should remain in custody pending a retrial. it neither verified whether the defence had been duly summoned nor looked at the reasons for their absence or reflected upon the need to obtain their attendance. on 18 march 2009 the town court again extended the detention until 20 june 2009. in the meantime, the trial court proceeded with the examination of the case. it was dismissed by the trial court as irrelevant and ill-founded. the trial court again noted the difficulties in finding one of the witnesses in the absence of any relevant information about her identity. the applicant’s counsel stayed, but did not call into question the two reports or other expert evidence. the court found that the weight of the evidence proved that the applicant had not acted in self-defence. on 7 october 2009 the regional court upheld the sentence. the applicant was prescribed vitamin b, cardiovascular and hypotensive drugs and painkillers. doctors recommended further treatment with beta blockers, potassium and magnesium based drugs, nootropics and vasoprotective medication. on 20 november 2009 a panel of psychiatrists examined the applicant and found that he suffered from organic personality disorder and vegetative nervous system disorder in the form of somatophrenia. over the year that followed the applicant mostly complained to the prison doctor of heartburn and palpitations. an abdominal ultrasound did not reveal any pathological conditions. shortly after his return to the correctional colony he was prescribed various medicines to treat his conditions. he was regularly seen by a prison doctor and psychiatrist. his general medical condition remained satisfactory. on 6 september 2012 the deputy head of the prison hospital examined the applicant and noted that the applicant was absolutely convinced that he was in a serious state of ill health. the applicant’s heart problems had not worsened.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lived, prior to his arrest, in olekminsk, sakha (yakutia) republic. on 23 december 2008 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder. on 25 december 2008 the olekminskiy district court of the sakha (yakutia) republic remanded the applicant in custody. on 21 february, 19 march, 18 may, 18 june, 15 august, and 12 september 2009 the court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention and held that despite the fact that he had permanent residence, job and family, he should remain in detention as the investigation was still pending, he could threaten witnesses or re-offend. on 18 june 2009 the judge stated in his detention order as follows:
“... the circumstances of the case have not changed. [ the applicant] ... committed the crime under the influence of alcohol ..., he concealed that he had committed the crime ...” 9. on 27 november 2009 the court replaced the pre-trial detention with a house arrest. on 10 june 2010 the olekminskiy district court convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to 8 years’ imprisonment. on 10 august 2010 the supreme court of russia upheld his conviction on appeal.
the applicants were prosecuted in russia for crimes. they were arrested and detained while the crimes were investigated and pending trial. their detention was ordered and extended by the courts. the detention orders were essentially based on the gravity of the charges, the primary grounds being the risk of the applicants’ absconding and interfering with the course of justice. the detention and extension orders used stereotypical formulae, without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures. the first applicant was born on 20 august 1983 and lived, prior to his arrest, in yekaterinburg, sverdlovsk region. the applicant was arrested on 30 march 2005 on suspicion of fraud and placed in detention. he remained in custody pending investigation and trial. on 19 april and 14 july 2006 his pre-trial detention was extended. his appeals against these detention orders were considered on 23 july and 3 november 2006 respectively. the applicant and his lawyer did not attend the hearing on 19 april 2006. on 23 october 2006 the leninskiy district court of yekaterinburg convicted the applicant of fraud and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment. the second applicant was born on 2 november 1972 and lived, prior to his arrest, in vorkuta, komi republic. the applicant was arrested on 14 january 2008. he remained in custody pending investigation and trial. on 5 june and 2 september 2009 the applicant’s pre-trial detention was extended. his appeals against these detention orders were examined on 24 july and 30 october 2009. the applicant and his lawyer were not present at the hearings on 24 july, 2 september and 30 october 2009. on 6 november 2009 the vorkuta town court of the komi republic convicted him of drug dealing and sentenced him to fourteen years and nine months’ imprisonment and a fine. having regard to the similarity of the main issues under the convention in the above cases, the court decides to join the applications and examine them in a single judgment.

 “the purpose of an amendment is to rectify a procedural act. having regard to the judgment of the constitutional court published in the official journal of 4 november 2000, we must conclude that, in civil law, injured persons are entitled to seek additional compensation once an expert report has been issued. however, in the proceedings before the supreme military administrative court, the time-limits of one year [from the date when a claimant becomes aware of the impugned act] and sixty days from the date of referral of the administrative authorities apply. under section 46(4) of the supreme military administrative court act, the amount claimed cannot be rectified once those deadlines have passed. consequently, the applicant’s amendment claim must be rejected for being out of time ...” 11. by a judgment of 16 april 2008 the supreme administrative court dismissed the applicant’s application for rectification of its previous decision.
the three applicants belong to the romanian church united to rome, also known as the greek catholic or uniate church. in 1948 the greek catholic church was dissolved by decree no. however, the committee never completed this task and the parish property was transferred to the orthodox church under decree no. 358/1948 was repealed by legislative decree no. the uniate church was officially recognised by legislative decree no. 126/1990 on certain measures concerning the romanian church united to rome. 126/1990 was amended by government ordinance no. the domestic law, in particular legislative decree no. 358/1948, be set aside, and that the church be returned to the first applicant. 126/1990, that is, before the joint committee. the first and second applicants lodged an appeal against that judgment. on 22 february 2002 they requested a stay of proceedings so that the case could be resolved by friendly settlement. in a final judgment of 24 november 2004, ruling on an appeal on points of law (recurs) by the first and second applicants, the high court of cassation and justice (“the high court”), quashed the court of appeal’s judgment and sent the case back to that court to be examined on the merits. on 12 may 2006, in application of the legislative amendments to legislative decree no. on 27 july 2006, when the case was restored to the county court’s list, the action was amended in order to add the first and the third applicants formally as claimants in the proceedings. the county court asked the parties to organise a meeting in order to decide the fate of the church building in question, and to inform it of the outcome of the negotiations by 25 april 2007. the parties met on 20 april 2007 without reaching an agreement. 358/1948 and that it had behaved as an owner, inter alia by ensuring that the church was maintained properly. by a judgment of 13 february 2009, the county court found in favour of the applicants and ordered that the church be returned to the first applicant. it noted that these statements supported the statistical data indicating that there were more orthodox than greek catholic worshippers in lupeni. 126/1990, to the effect that the legal situation of places of worship and parsonages ... must be determined taking account of the wishes of the worshippers in the community that is in possession of the properties”. on 15 june 2011 the high court, by a majority, delivered a final judgment in which it set out, in detail, the decisions taken by the lower courts. 126/1990 ... a distinction is made between two situations: (a) that in which the property is in the ownership of the state ... (b) that in which the places of worship and the parishes have been taken over by the romanian orthodox church and in respect of which [the question of] restitution will be decided by a joint committee made up of representatives of the clergy of the two denominations, a committee which will take account of the wishes of the worshippers in the communities in possession of these properties. the priority to be given to the criterion of the worshippers’ wishes was decided by the legislature, which wished in this way to regulate an area which concerns the buildings assigned to a particular use (places of worship), [and so] the court is not entitled to criticise the law. returning the properties which belonged to the greek catholic church without respecting the criteria imposed by article 3 § 1 of legislative decree no. 126/1990 would undermine the stability and certainty of legal relations. however, the greek catholic denomination was dissolved by decree no. the fact that, through legislative decree no. 358/1948 does not mean that all of its titles to property were restored, in so far as the right of ownership is subject to a procedure (namely the provisions of legislative decree no. as an action for recovery of possession involved a comparison of the relevant property titles, the judge concluded that the orthodox church had no such title to the church building in question.
she is currently detained in forest-berkendael prison. according to her explanations, since 1983 b.m. the applicant and her husband had five children. recommending that he prescribe her a new antidepressant, as well as sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication. that she felt isolated from her own family. saw the applicant again on 30 january and 9 and 13 february 2007. when i walk down the street, i am afraid. i don’t want to believe in a better future. i don’t know how i am going to tell my husband all this, that i don’t feel well and that i have always kept it hidden that i felt so bad about myself and in my head and that i was taking medication. early in the morning of 27 february 2007, the day before the incident, the applicant went to dr d.v. they are suicidal thoughts which are going to carry me away and i will take my children with me. i don’t think my husband will save me because whichever way you look at it, he is in a favourable position. i imagine scenarios which are both true and realistic and i know i am capable. the applicant’s letters addressed to dr d.v. dated 13 and 27 february 2007 were not included in the file on the criminal investigation. who will be at érasme [hospital] on friday morning at 9. you have always opened your door to me and my children and have been a ray of sunshine in our life, and i will thank you forever. i beg my sisters to forgive me if i have hurt them. is a bastard who has ruined my life and robbed me of my privacy with my husband and children. ’s mobile phone – in a voice which the investigating officers later described as “trembling” and “hesitant” – telling v.g. the investigating judge ordered several psychological reports. she had developed a maternal omnipotence and a lack of psychological distance between the children and herself. mentioned the existence of the two letters dated 13 and 27 february 2007 which the applicant had addressed to him. in view of this new evidence, the president of the assize court duly instructed the panel of three psychiatrists, g., b. and m., who had already been involved at the investigation stage and had already confirmed their findings orally before the assize court, to produce a further report. these answers reflect the experts’ personal conviction after carrying out the various written procedures. ms lhermitte developed a severe state of anxiety and depression ... [and] a transient dissociative state of depersonalisation, causing her to perform acts of extreme violence. only operational thought remains; reflective consciousness is momentarily lost. ... on 18 december 2008, after the submissions of the prosecution and the parties had been heard, the jury was called to answer the following five questions put to it by the court’s president:
“1st question (principal question as to guilt)
is the accused geneviève lhermitte, present before this court, guilty of having knowingly and intentionally killed [y.m.], [ subsequently, the assize court, composed of both the three judges and the jury, deliberated on the sentence to be imposed. in a judgment of 19 december 2008 it took note of the guilty verdict reached by the jury alone and sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment.
the applicant was born in 1949 and lives in san gwann. various items were stolen and the victims were injured while they were being held face down in the bedroom. the applicant and his brother, like their father previously, had done work for the z. family as plumbers and electricians. he considered that there was no hope of this situation changing in the near future. mr z. testified that a few days after the robbery he had gone to buy a bulb from the applicant, who had expressed no sympathy. yet in 1995 the applicant had sent the couple a christmas card and in 1996 invited them to his daughter’s wedding. he reiterated the changed attitude of the applicant towards him following the robbery and had even instituted civil claims in judicial proceedings. the saliba brothers had also not told him that their father had died, even though he had been the testamentary executor nominated by their late father. he considered the applicant’s wife’s affidavit as totally untruthful; likewise the applicant’s brothers’, in particular in connection with the reasons why work on project d. had stopped – he noted that the real reason had been the robbery and the fact that the applicant had realised he had been caught – and in connection with their exchanges with w.b. an employee of the z. family (who testified that the saliba brothers had been the trusted electricians and plumbers of the z. family and they had stopped working on any of the z. family’s properties after the robbery (unlike other workers); he stated that the brothers had once asked him why mr z. had not been paying them as mr z. had told them that compared to the gold he had not even a breadcrumb had been taken. that they had not wanted to work for mr z. anymore as he had had no money. stated that the investigators had spoken about the applicant in june 1995 and that subsequently he had been questioned (amongst others – five people altogether) as a person with the knowhow to commit such a robbery, as well as a result of mr z.’s claim to the effect that he had mentioned the buckets of gold only to the applicant. by a five-page judgment of 10 october 2006 the civil court (first hall), in its civil jurisdiction, considered that the applicant had taken part in the robbery and therefore ordered him to pay damages yet to be quantified, and requested that the plaintiffs submit a claim. indeed these repeated arguments had been far-fetched and banal, usually an indication that an individual was not convinced of his statement. the court noted that the only established facts were that the robber had known both the house (allowing him to move comfortably within it and find what he wanted) and mr z. (giving the robber a reason to remain silent during the robbery). the court noted that this unfortunately indicated that mr z. had used this factor for the identification of the applicant, and it would have been better to have solely relied on visual identification. they further claimed medical expenses of eur 85,000 in relation to the injuries suffered. on 17 march 2008, the applicant appealed against all the above decisions. the court of appeal, by a judgment of 6 october 2009, reiterated that it was well known that it was not for it to alter the assessment of evidence in the absence of compelling reasons. it noted that for civil proceedings to reach a finding it sufficed for a judge to have a “moral certainty”, as opposed to proof beyond reasonable doubt as required in criminal proceedings. it noted that the first court had assessed the evidence available and considered that the identification of the applicant had been convincingly established; the court of appeal found no reason to alter that conclusion. as to the applicant’s inability to cross-examine ms z., it noted that there had been a valid reason, namely her poor health as confirmed by her doctor, and the applicant had had the opportunity to comment on her written testimony. by a judgment of 15 october 2012 the constitutional court also rejected the applicant’s claims. furthermore, the court of appeal had not found there were compelling reasons to alter that decision. thus, no prejudice had been caused to the applicant. according to the documents submitted, following the above judgments the applicant became extremely depressed and unfit for work. he was thus excused from work and began to receive a disability pension. according to the government the applicant was certified as unfit for work on 1 july 2005 and retired when he was sixty-one and has since then been in receipt of a pension. another such request was made on 11 february 2013. the government located the file following communication of the application and submitted it to the court.
they owned rooms in a dormitory building in the municipality of samara. according to the government, the judgment has not been enforced and the applicants continue to reside in the rooms they had bought. ms vasyukhina and mr vasyukhin (application no. 45173/08) submitted that they had never moved into the rooms as they were occupied by other individuals. in 1993 a state-owned enterprise called samaraavtotrans was privatised and reorganised into a joint-stock limited liability company called stroitel. the privatisation plan was approved by the municipality and the regional property fund signed the plan on its behalf. in accordance with the privatisation plan, all residential buildings previously listed on samaraavtotrans’s balance sheet were to be transferred to the municipality, while the administrative buildings were to be taken over by stroitel. the privatisation plan referred to a building located at no. 61 yunykh pionerov avenue, samara, as an administrative building (used for non-residential purposes), and it was transferred to stroitel. as a result of a number of reorganisations of stroitel, the title to the building in question was transferred to the closed joint-stock company, stroitel-m. subsequently, separate rooms in the building were resold to third parties, including the applicants. the information concerning the applicants’ titles to the property can be found in the appendix below. according to the title deeds, the applicants were owners of non-residential premises. the applicants moved into the rooms and resided there. referring to the invalidation of the privatisation of samaraavtotrans, the prosecutor submitted that the subsequent transactions relating to the building were also null and void, and asked the court to return the title to the building to the municipality. on 20 january 2004 the samara regional court (“the regional court”) quashed that judgment and remitted the matter to the district court for fresh consideration. on 14 june 2005 the district court dismissed the prosecutor’s claim. on 2 august 2005 the regional court upheld the judgment of 14 june 2005 on appeal. on 18 may 2006 the presidium of the regional court quashed the judgments of 14 june and 2 august 2005 by way of supervisory review, and remitted the matter to the district court for fresh consideration. the presidium noted that the lower courts had erroneously applied substantive and procedural laws when deciding the matter. on 14-19 november 2007 the district court allowed the prosecutor’s claim in full. the court recognised that the owners of the rooms were bona fide purchasers, but ordered that the title to the building be transferred to the municipality. the municipality, the true owner of the building, had not authorised the purchase of the rooms in the building by their current owners. accordingly, the sale of the building in the absence of authorisation by the municipality meant that the municipality had lost possession against its will, and could recover its property from bona fide purchasers. on 12 february 2008 the regional court upheld the district court’s judgment of 14‑19 november 2007 on appeal. the applicants in the present application, mr vitaliy vasyukhin and ms darya vasyukhina, were minors at the relevant time. on 10 february and 4 july 1011 the regional court upheld the above-mentioned judgments on appeal. on an unspecified date a bailiff initiated enforcement proceedings. on 4 march 2014 he discontinued the enforcement proceedings, noting that it was impossible to establish mr b.’s whereabouts or identify his assets, if any such assets existed. it appears that the enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgment of 16 june 2011 are still pending.
the applicant was born in 1969 in lebanon. on 12 january 1993, at the age of 23, he entered denmark and requested asylum, which was refused by a final decision of 31 october 1994. she had entered denmark as a child in 1985. his request was granted temporarily, until august 1996. the applicant never went to school in lebanon and he has never had a job, either in lebanon or in denmark. his wife was granted an early retirement pension due to back problems. the applicant speaks and understands danish but he cannot read or write the language. he also speaks and understands arabic, but cannot read or write it. the applicant’s wife has eighteen siblings living in denmark. it was also noted that the applicant had previous convictions. on appeal, by a judgment of 30 march 2011 the conviction was upheld in part by the high court of eastern denmark (østre landsret) and the sentence was increased to six years’ imprisonment due notably to the nature and quantity of the drugs, the extent of the drug offences committed and the applicant’s leading role. he had no contacts there but his mother and sister. his other sister lived with her husband and their five children in a refugee camp in syria. twice he transferred money via western union to his sister to buy the apartment, but it was given up when he was arrested. the applicant’s wife stated that she could not follow her husband if he were expelled to lebanon or syria. she and the children would not be able to stand living in either of those countries, and the children could not live outside denmark. four of the children received special education and several of the children needed extra support and supervision in their schools and institutions. these concerned eighty different foreign telephone numbers, including thirty-eight in lebanon and nine in syria. the applicant explained in this connection that the calls to lebanon had mainly been to people from denmark who had been on vacation in lebanon and that the calls to syria had been to his sister. nevertheless she did have difficulties understanding why there had been calls to thirty-eight different numbers in lebanon. moreover, the drug trafficking had taken place over more than two and a half years and the applicant had had a leading and central role. he had been receiving state early retirement pension since 2004. they were born in denmark and went to school and institutions in the country. the applicant and his family spoke arabic. the applicant’s spouse had family in lebanon. moreover, she had regular contact with the applicant’s sister and family in syria, and she had spent several vacations there, for instance in 2008 and 2009 as well as one and a half months in 2010 and two months in 2011. on 11 january 2012 the applicant was convicted for having possessed a mobile phone while in prison. he was sentenced to imprisonment for seven days. it transpires from the danish civil registration system that the applicant and his wife divorced with effect from 21 november 2012. it appears that the applicant was deported to lebanon shortly thereafter.
the applicants were born in 1990, 1989 and 1990 respectively and live in moscow. he was wearing police uniform and was armed with a handgun. after a while he saw mr l. and shot at him, also without saying a word. as it was open twenty-four hours a day, there were always people inside. took ms p. by the arm, pointed the gun at her head and, holding her hostage, continued moving through the shopping centre. killed two people and wounded several others. she submitted, in particular, that as a child he had had head injuries. after the ninth grade he had been exempted from his school examinations on medical advice. according to the conclusions set out in report no. did not suffer from any mental disorder, but had “accentuated” personality traits. this explained the difficulties in his adapting to school life and his behavioural deviations, which required psychiatric help. this had included an increased volume of work and management of a new team. at the same time he had not been as enthusiastic about his new job as he had been about his previous job. he had therefore been in a state of emotional tension. had not been in an emotionally disturbed state. on an unspecified date the third applicant was also granted victim status in the criminal proceedings. there had been no instances of cartridge theft reported. however, since childhood he had been under the supervision of a neuropathologist on account of his psycho-emotional instability, but this had not been taken into account by the military medical panel which had found him fit to serve in the police. there had thus been a breach of section 19 of the police act, sections 130 and 131 of the order of the ministry of the interior of 14 july 2004 and section 9.7 of the order of the ministry of the interior of 14 december 1999. the first and second applicants sued d.e. however, according to the forensic expert examination conducted, such surgery was not recommended since the bullet was separated from the tissue and did not pose a danger to the first applicant’s health, whereas any attempt to extract it might lead to unexpected complications. on 29 july 2009 the nagatinskiy district court of moscow dismissed the first applicant’s claim. however, if a state official caused damage as a result of activities unrelated to exercising the duties of the state service, he was liable under article 1064 § 1 of the civil code. ’s working hours and the territorial jurisdiction of the tsaritsino branch of the moscow department of the interior. the fact that at the relevant time he had held the position of chief of the tsaritsino branch of the moscow department of the interior and had had the rank of major did not constitute grounds for the state’s liability under article 1069 of the civil code, as it had been established that d.e. the court also dismissed the first applicant’s arguments that the state should be held liable for the damage because (i) at the time of the events d.e. had been dismissed from service for discrediting the police. in the course of his duties as a civil servant. relying on articles 150, 151, 1064 § 1 and 1069 of the civil code and referring to d.e. on 16 april 2012 the moscow city court upheld the judgment on appeal.

the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in šibenik. on an unspecified date an investigation was opened in respect of the applicant and four other persons, a.b., in connection with the killing in split of s.i.t.j, a british national. on 28 may 1997 the applicant was indicted before the split county court on charges of murder, while a.b., were charged under the same indictment with participating in a fight which resulted in the death of one person. during the proceedings before the trial court a.b. did not testify and the oral evidence he had given during the investigation was read out. the applicant denied the veracity of his evidence. on 19 july 2000 the split county court, composed of a panel of two professional judges and three lay judges, acquitted the applicant and found the other accused guilty as charged. the supreme court also ordered that fresh proceedings against the applicant be conducted by a trial panel composed of different judges. in the presence of the applicant and his defence lawyer on 18 february 2004. however, since one of the lay judges changed during the proceedings, the trial had to start afresh. at a hearing held on 10 july 2007 the applicant agreed that a.b. ’s statement could be read out and on the same day the split county court again acquitted the applicant. that judgment was also quashed by the supreme court, on 22 january 2008, which again ordered a fresh trial with different judges. a third round of proceedings was held before a panel of two different professional judges (i.r. at a hearing held on 23 february 2010 a.b. gave oral evidence in the presence of the applicant and his defence counsel. at a hearing held on 8 july 2010 that panel heard evidence from a.b., in the presence of the applicant and his defence counsel. whose prior statement was read out at a hearing held on 7 june 2011 because he was in a psychiatric institution. was the only witness who said that he had seen the applicant attacking the victim. a request by the applicant for the trial panel to hear the witness in person was denied on the grounds that the witness was undergoing treatment for alcoholism in a psychiatric institution and that any absence from the institution would have a negative effect on his treatment. on 16 june 2011 the split county court found the applicant guilty of murder and sentenced him to eleven months’ imprisonment, suspended for five years. in an appeal of 5 august 2011, the applicant, inter alia, challenged the veracity of the evidence given by a.b. on 27 march 2012 the supreme court upheld the judgment of 16 june 2011. the relevant part of the supreme court’s judgment reads:

“having heard the parties’ arguments, the court concludes that, in view of the fact that [the applicant] is charged with a ... grievous offence ... which he committed whilst on parole, the court considers that, if released, he might abscond or continue criminal activities. furthermore, the [applicant’s] release might interfere with the comprehensive and objective examination of the case. on 16 july 2009 the regional court upheld the decision of 22 may 2009 on appeal. the applicant talked back to the judge in chechen. according to the record of the court hearing, the applicant refused to return to the courtroom to participate in the closing arguments. the court accepted the prosecution’s version of events, namely that the applicant had been arrested by special police forces in the course of an operation targeting him as a racketeer as alleged by p. and that heroin had been found on him during the search conducted immediately after his arrest. on 21 and 22 may 2009 the applicant was examined by a paramedic. it appears that the applicant did not appeal against the decision of 9 september 2009. the applicant resisted and kicked m. guard n. came to m.’s rescue and pulled the applicant’s arm behind his back. on 22 october 2009 the expert issued an additional forensic report, noting that it was impossible to determine the exact date on which the applicant had sustained the injuries. on 17 march 2011 the regional court upheld the applicant’s conviction on appeal. according to the applicant, the prison guards beat him and nine other inmates. he also threatened the guards and insulted them. on 3 november 2010 the applicant took part in a hearing at the supreme court of the russian federation by means of video link. on 7 october 2012 the applicant was transferred to correctional colony no. the management of correctional colony no.

the applicant was born in 1970 in armenia. until his arrest in 2008 he lived in kurgan, russia. on 20 september 2012 the sverdlovsk region office of the federal migration service ordered his deportation to armenia. it seems that the deportation order was executed on 11 october 2012. as a result of this accident he sustained multiple injuries, including a thighbone fracture, a dislocated hip and facial wounds. the applicant was taken by ambulance to kurgan town hospital where he was admitted to an intensive care unit. he was connected to a medical ventilator and subjected to emergency anti-shock treatment. several days later his condition improved and he was transferred to a trauma department, where he remained bedridden in a skeletal traction frame. osteosynthesis surgery was to be performed in due course. on 6 august 2008 the police opened a criminal case into car theft. a police investigator asked the attending doctor whether the applicant could be discharged from hospital and transferred to a detention facility. on an unspecified date the doctor informed the investigator that the applicant was in need of inpatient treatment on account of multiple injuries, including facial injuries, a dislocated hip and a thighbone fracture. it does not seem that any special arrangements for the applicant’s transport were made. the regional court remitted the issue for fresh consideration. on 4 september 2008 the regional court upheld the applicant’s detention on appeal. on 25 august 2009 the russian prosecutor general’s office ordered the applicant’s extradition to stand trial in belarus. according to the applicant, in march 2010 he was extradited to the republic of belarus. in the meantime, on 29 august 2008, in the context of the criminal investigation into car theft, the kurgan town court ordered the applicant not to leave kurgan. on 23 september 2008 the town court changed the measure of restraint to detention pending investigation. on 22 november 2008 the town court extended the applicant’s detention until 5 december 2008, citing the seriousness of the charges and the lack of a permanent residence in russia. in the discharge summary drafted on account of the applicant’s arrest, “continued medical treatment” and crutches were prescribed. it was not disputed by the parties that the next day the applicant had been placed in a cell designed to accommodate a maximum of four inmates. m. on 13 august and between 15 and 19 august 2008 the applicant had to share that cell with seven other inmates, with each inmate thus having no more than 1.9 sq. in the prison hospital several medical tests were performed. as to the conditions of the applicant’s detention during that period, the government submitted that the applicant had been transferred between several cells of the remand prison, some of which were overcrowded. m of floor space, and occasionally less than 2 sq. m. according to the applicant, the cells were poorly ventilated, had non-partitioned toilets and were infested with bugs, mice and lice. on 2 june 2009, the applicant was sent to serve his sentence in a settlement colony. he was released on 22 september 2012, after having served his sentence in full. according to him, he continued to walk with a limp after the release, because the broken leg had knitted in a wrong position.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in tomsk. the newspaper is published and distributed in the tomsk region. the article described everyday life in a state-owned care home for the elderly, lesnaya dacha, giving examples of various residents who were or had been living there. it exposed practical difficulties encountered by the personnel in taking care of the residents in the absence of necessary equipment, and also mentioned that quite a few residents had been abandoned in the care home by their relatives. that sentence was followed by text in bold letters:
“there is, for example, a room in which the mother of deputy [s.] died. it is a single room, however small and narrow. the ill and massively corpulent woman lay here for four months. nurses remember that it was very hard to lift and turn her ...” 9. sometimes ordinary nurses happen to be more merciful than people in authority ...” 10. the above-mentioned two paragraphs were the only ones printed in bold in the whole article. who were respectively mr s.’s father, brother and sister, brought defamation proceedings against the applicant. they claimed that the above-mentioned extracts contained statements aiming to create negative feeling on the part of readers towards the s. family and influence them as voters during the elections. they argued in particular that those statements made readers think that the s. family had had no mercy for their closest relative – their wife and mother – that they had taken her to lesnaya dacha to get rid of her, and that they had not paid her any visits and had not taken care of her. they also referred to article 24 of the russian constitution, which prohibited the dissemination of information about an individual without his or her consent. on 17 april 2000 the leninskiy district court of tomsk delivered its judgment. the court, having examined certain witnesses, also considered that mrs s. had indeed caused the claimants inconvenience and complicated their life, and that they had therefore decided to place her in a medical institution. it also rejected as unfounded the claimants’ argument that the disputed publication had been propagandistic and had aimed to influence voters’ opinions; in this respect, it noted that the text of the article was socially oriented and contained general argument concerning the problems affecting ill and elderly people, with the specific example of the lesnaya dacha care home. on 30 may 2001 the presidium of the tomsk regional court, in supervisory review proceedings, dismissed an extraordinary appeal against the judgment of 17 april 2000 and the appeal decision of 30 june 2000, thus upholding those decisions. on 28 june 2002, in supervisory review proceedings, the supreme court of russia quashed the judgment of 17 april 2000 and the decisions of 30 june 2000 and 30 may 2001, and sent the case back to the first-instance court for fresh examination. in a judgment of 20 may 2003 the leninskiy district court of tomsk again dismissed the claims against the applicant, employing reasoning similar to that of the judgment of 17 april 2000. on 17 october 2003 the tomsk regional court examined the case, on appeal by the claimants. it noted that, according to resolution no. the appellate court found that the claimants in the present case had discharged that obligation. in relation to the sentence stating “...quite a few respectable people bring their ill relatives to the care home in an attempt to escape unnecessary troubles...”, the tomsk regional court disagreed with the first-instance court’s view that the sentence was true and was not damaging to the claimants’ honour and dignity. in particular, the regional court noted that the headline of the article and the sequence of its sentences made it clear that the statement, along with the reference to the lack of mercy for next of kin, although generalised, related to the claimants. in support of this conclusion, the appellate court referred to the statements of two witnesses who had confirmed that they had perceived the extracts to relate to the claimants. the court thus concluded that the disputed information was untrue. it further found that the disputed information, namely that the claimants had placed their seriously ill close relative in the care home for the elderly because of a lack of mercy, and in order to avoid unnecessary troubles, was a statement that the claimants had breached their moral principles, and was therefore damaging to their honour and dignity, according to the resolution of the supreme court. by a decision of 4 march 2004 a judge of the tomsk regional court declined the applicant’s application to institute supervisory review proceedings in respect of the appellate court’s decision. the applicant was ordered to pay rub 4,000 (approximately eur 110) to each of the three claimants.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in skørping. by an indictment of 25 october 2007 the applicant, jointly with three co‑accused, was charged with violation of intellectual property rights under section 299 b of the penal code of a particularly aggravated nature, comprising professionally organised production, importation and sales, in which the defendants had cooperated on marketing substantial quantities of counterfeit goods in the form of designer knives, lamps and similar products. from the beginning of 2006 the applicant was represented by lawyer a, and as from 21 august 2009, the applicant was represented by lawyer b. 8. by letters of 1 and 9 september 2009 a submitted his claim for legal costs to the city court for work performed from 2006 until 2009. it appears that the transcript of the court records was sent to counsel a and the prosecutor in accordance with usual practice. neither the applicant nor b was informed of this decision. the case was heard before the city court (retten i viborg) over 15 days between 24 september and 4 december 2009. by a judgment of 4 december 2009, the city court convicted the applicant and the three co-accused. the applicant was convicted on two out of fifteen counts and given a six months’ suspended sentence, and 120 hours of community service due to his good personal circumstances and the fact that his role had been a minor one. in addition the proceeds, estimated at 40,000 danish kroner (dkk), were confiscated, as were various copies of designer goods, such as lamps and cutlery. the applicant and b were present when the judgment was passed. the operative part of the judgment, including the matter of payment of legal costs, was read aloud when the judgment was passed. a few days later lawyer b received a transcript of the judgment, which in the operative part relating to legal fees stated:
“each of the accused is to pay the legal costs relating to them, including the fee to counsel appointed to them.” the applicant did not appeal against the judgment to the high court, nor did the public prosecution. according to a court record of 5 january 2010, the city court approved the costs to be paid to b in the amount of dkk 247,200 (approximately eur 33,200) plus vat and reimbursement of other costs amounting to dkk 32,423. it was stated that the amount was to be paid by the applicant. on 17 january 2010, on behalf of the applicant, b appealed against the decision. he did not contest the amount granted, but claimed that it should be paid entirely or partly by the treasury. in support thereof, and with reference to section 1008, section 2, of the administration of justice act, he submitted that the applicant had only played a minor role in the criminal case; that an extensive part of the production of evidence did not relate to him; that he had been acquitted of one count; and that the total fee was of a significant amount. this was the moment when the applicant became aware for the first time of the fees that had been granted to a. 16. he also requested that the city court send him the court records of the decision to grant fees to a. 17. the court records of 24 september 2009 and a’s letters of 1 and 9 september 2009 were also enclosed with the letter. in a supplementary pleading of 4 march 2010, b maintained that a’s fees should be paid by the treasury. he pointed out that the fees payable to a and b totalled dkk 573,311 and that therefore the payment duty would be manifestly disproportionate to the applicant’s responsibility and circumstances. referring to section 1008, subsection 4, of the administration of justice act, he thus requested that the payment duty be reduced. in his view, the time-limit for appealing against the decisions on the fees to be paid to a should, at the earliest, run from 25 january 2010, the date on which the applicant received the invoice from the police and thus became aware for the first time of the fees that had been granted to a. 21. by decision of 10 march 2010 the high court dismissed the appeal as being lodged out of time. this decision was integrated in the judgment of 4 december 2009 and the applicant, who was present when the judgment was passed, was informed of the decision during that hearing. thus, the time-limit had expired when the interlocutory appeal was lodged on 17 january 2010.” leave to appeal to the supreme court was refused by the appeals permission board on 18 june 2010.
the applicant was born in 1967 and until his arrest lived in menzelinsk, the tatarstan republic. in 1999 he was convicted and sent to serve his sentence in a correctional colony. in april 2008 a further set of charges was brought against the applicant. to ensure his participation in the ensuing investigation he was transferred to remand prison no. iz-16/3 in the tatarstan republic (“the remand prison”). on several occasions he was transported to a temporary detention unit at the naberezhnyye chelny police station (“the temporary detention unit”). the applicant was detained in the remand prison during several periods between 7 april 2008 and 7 october 2009. according to the applicant, for most of the period of his detention, 184 days between 7 april 2008 and 11 february 2009, he was detained alone in cell no. the cell was in a poor sanitary condition and was infested with vermin. the toilet pan was not separated from the living area. the cell was poorly lit and the ventilation system did not function. metal shutters on the windows blocked access to natural light and fresh air. the cell was not equipped with either a television set or a radio, and newspapers were not available. the bedding in those cells was torn and dirty. the cells had no television set or refrigerator. the quality of food in the remand prison was poor. throughout the entire period of his detention the applicant was allowed access to the exercise yard, which was dirty and dusty, for only fifty minutes a day. this facility was overpopulated and inmates had no access to outdoor exercise. in october 2008 the applicant complained of toothache to a prison doctor and received painkillers. a similar request was submitted by the head of the medical unit on 10 february 2009. on 19 may 2009 the custodial authorities transported the applicant to a civilian dentist, who diagnosed chronic pulpitis and periodontitis, and provided some treatment. according to the dentist, delay in the treatment could lead to grave complications, such as the loss of the chewing function, osteomyelitis and sepsis. the naberezhnyye chelny town court dismissed the claim on 19 august 2009, having found that the applicant had been provided with adequate medical assistance. on 17 september 2009 the supreme court of the tatarstan republic upheld the judgment on appeal. failure to do so would entail the necessity to start the treatment anew. the dentist also pointed out that the excessively long time the treatment had taken had already caused substantial suffering to the applicant and increased the risk of digestive problems. having not been taken to the dentist as recommended, the applicant submitted several requests for the dental treatment, stating that he had lost the ability to chew and in addition to severe teeth pain he started experiencing stomach pain. on 17 june 2010 the authorities gave their approval for the applicant to be transported to the dentist. owing to the constant pain and the lack of teeth the applicant had to refuse prison food for several days. in august 2010 the applicant was taken to a dentist who completed the dental restoration.
until his death in 2016 he was detained in correctional colony no. 14 in the village of olovyannaya, zabaykalsk region. on 29 january 2014 the fokino town court of the primorskiy region convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to six and a half years’ imprisonment. on the same day he was taken into custody. prior to his detention the applicant sustained several spinal injuries and lost the ability to walk unaided. since 2013 he has been confined to a wheelchair. the doctor provisionally diagnosed him with spinal tuberculosis. according to the applicant’s submissions, which were not disputed by the government, he was put in an ordinary cell not equipped for wheelchair‑using detainees. as a result he suffered various inconveniences, including restricted access the toilet. he was advised to undergo various medical examinations and tests, including magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of the spine and a hip x-ray. in april 2014 a prison surgeon established that the osteoporosis affected not only the applicant’s spine, but also his legs. he was prescribed pain relief medication and advised to undergo several medical tests. there is no information in the applicant’s file to suggest that the remand prison authorities gave him medication, an mri scan or radiography. according to the applicant, even painkillers were unavailable in the remand prison. on 9 april 2014 the applicant was sent to serve his sentence in correctional colony no. he was prescribed and provided with comprehensive drug treatment. the government did not provide any evidence to show that the correctional colony had any special facilities to accommodate wheelchair‑using prisoners. on 30 july 2014 the applicant was sent to prison hospital no. 1 in chita, zabaiykalsk region, for an in-depth medical examination to establish whether he was entitled to early release on medical grounds. a hip x-ray revealed that he suffered from an old displaced fracture of the cervical hip with full avulsion of the greater trochanter. on the same day the applicant was discharged from the prison hospital. on 2 october 2014 the olovyannaya district court dismissed the applicant’s application for early release, referring to the medical report of 27 august 2014. that decision was upheld on appeal by the zabaiykalsk regional court on 16 december 2014. the latter authority found a shortcoming in the applicant’s treatment, namely a failure to ensure he was examined by an orthopaedic traumatologist. on 25 march 2015 the applicant was seen by a traumatologist, who diagnosed him with an inguinal hernia and recommended surgery to be performed at a later date. the doctor also stated that he should be provided with a walking stick and a walking frame. over the months that followed the applicant was regularly seen by prison doctors and provided with hypotensive drugs and pain relief drugs. in the meantime he brought a civil claim against the medical authorities seeking compensation for damage to his health caused by inadequate medical treatment. on 15 june 2015 the central district court of chita dismissed the claim. on 27 june 2016 the applicant died of a heart attack.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in moscow. on 13 october 2006 the zamoskvoretskiy district court in moscow remanded the applicant in custody on the charge of fraud. subsequently the district court extended the applicant’s detention on 8 december 2006 and on 2 february, 10 april, 29 may and 18 september 2007. each time the district court attached preponderant weight to the gravity of the charges against the applicant. on 21 may and 4 july 2007 the moscow city court rejected the appeals against the detention orders of 10 april and 29 may 2007, respectively. the city court authorised further extensions of the applicant’s detention on 28 september and 26 december 2007. the supreme court rejected his appeals on 31 october 2007 and 15 february 2008, respectively. on 14 february 2008 the case was submitted for trial. on 20 february, 30 june and 17 december 2008 and 18 march and 18 june 2009 the district courts in moscow prolonged the applicant’s detention pending trial, referring mainly to the gravity of the charges. the most recent extension order was issued for the period until 19 september 2009. between 27 january 2007 and 16 may 2008 the applicant was detained in the iz-77/1 remand prison in moscow. the prison was filled beyond the design capacity and cells were severely overcrowded. he was later transferred to another remand prison in moscow.
he lived in brussels and died there on 7 june 2016. the couple subsequently had a child together in august 1999 and another in july 2006. on 29 december 1998 the applicant was arrested and taken into custody on charges of theft. in 1999 and 2000 the applicant and his wife were arrested on several occasions in connection with theft offences. a request to take charge of them was therefore sent to the italian authorities and was accepted on 4 june 1999. it was immediately rejected after his fingerprints had been checked. on 20 march 2000 the applicant lodged a first request for regularisation for a period of more than three months, on the basis of section 9(3) (since 1 june 2007, section 9bis) of the aliens (entry, residence, settlement and expulsion) act of 15 december 1980 (“the aliens act”). in support of his request the applicant stated that he and his wife had a daughter born in georgia before their arrival in belgium and another daughter born in belgium in 1999. he cited as exceptional circumstances the duration of his residence in belgium and his integration into belgian society, the risks that a return to georgia would entail for his children’s schooling, the fact that he had been the victim of persecution and his state of health. the aliens office noted that the applicant had been allowed to remain in the country for the sole purpose of the asylum proceedings, which had been concluded by a final decision. that decision was served on the applicant on 11 july 2010. on 22 july 2010 a doctor from antwerp university hospital visited the applicant in the merksplas closed facility for illegal aliens (see paragraph 79 below), to which he had been transferred in the meantime, in order to carry out a full medical check-up. it was decided to switch to a different course of chemotherapy. after a relapse diagnosed in 2013, the doctors in st pierre university hospital observed in march 2014 that the applicant’s leukaemia had developed into lymphocytic lymphoma, and his chemotherapy was adjusted accordingly. it is clear from the medical literature that if ibrutinib is discontinued in such a situation, the average life expectancy is three months. ... the literature also shows that only 7% of patients being treated with ibrutinib achieve complete remission. this is a new targeted therapy to which he would have no access in his country of origin. a hla [human leukocyte antigen] matched donor has been identified for the patient. according to a medical report dated 24 april 2015 his hepatitis, which had been treated effectively in 2012 and 2013, had become stable. on 10 september 2007, relying on articles 3 and 8 of the convention and alleging, in particular, that he would be unable to obtain treatment for his leukaemia (see paragraph 34 above) if he were sent back to georgia, the applicant lodged a first request for regularisation on medical grounds on the basis of section 9ter of the aliens act. the request was refused by the aliens office on 4 june 2008 for the same reason it had cited previously (see paragraph 55 above). on 16 july 2008 the applicant lodged an application with the aliens appeals board to have that decision set aside. in a judgment of 21 may 2015 the aliens appeals board rejected the application to set aside. as to the complaints alleging a violation of articles 2 and 3 of the convention, the aliens appeals board stated that the assessment of the medical situation of an alien facing removal whose request for regularisation had been rejected should be carried out, as applicable, at the time of enforcement of the removal measure. the report prepared by the medical adviser on that occasion listed the consultations held and the treatment that had been administered to the applicant. chemotherapy has been discontinued for the time being. however, on 15 november 2007 the lawyer lodged an application on his own initiative. in parallel with its decision of 7 july 2010 refusing the applicant’s request for regularisation on exceptional grounds (see paragraph 29 above), the aliens office on 7 july 2010 issued an order for him to leave the country, together with an order for his detention. on 16 july 2010 the georgian embassy in brussels issued a travel document valid until 16 august 2010. in addition, in july 2013 the aliens office was contacted by the luxembourg police and customs cooperation centre, which reported that the applicant was in detention in the grand duchy of luxembourg.
was a romanian limited liability company, with a registered office in cluj-napoca. on 7 march 2002 the cluj prefecture issued the applicant company with an operating permit, which was valid until 7 march 2005. its main activity consisted in collecting and recycling scrap iron. as the applicant company’s permit was due to expire on 7 march 2005, on 4 january 2005 it applied for an extension of the existing permit. the relevant guidelines were published on 11 january 2005. 876/2004, its activity was considered to have a significant impact on the environment and that it should therefore follow the authorisation procedure set out in that order. the applicant company was invited to submit new supporting documents within thirty days. the applicant company submitted the requested documents on 27 january 2005. a new environmental permit was issued on 24 march 2005. on 14 april 2005 the prefecture issued a new operating permit. between 7 march and 14 april 2005 the applicant company continued to carry out its activity. following an inspection carried out at the applicant company’s headquarters, on 6 may 2005 the cluj finance inspectorate (garda financiară cluj) fined the company rol 25,000,000 (approximately 694 euros) and ordered the confiscation of rol 768,471,700 (approximately eur 21,347), representing the market value of the scrap iron collected for recycling between 8 march and 14 april 2005. the applicant company lodged a complaint against the decision of the cluj finance inspectorate, claiming that the competent authorities were responsible for the delay in issuing the operation permit. in this connection, it argued that the application for an extension of the operating permit had been lodged in good time, namely on 4 january 2005. on 2 august 2005 the cluj-napoca district court dismissed the complaint as unfounded. it also noted that the applicant company had continued to carry out its activity despite the fact that its operating permit had expired on 7 march 2005; it had therefore infringed article 7 § 1 in conjunction with article 13 (a) of emergency government ordinance no. the court dismissed the applicant company’s claim that liability for its situation lay with the authorities for failing to issue its environmental and operating permits in time, holding that such a claim would be relevant only within the framework of a tort action and could not be raised as a reason for exonerating a company that had committed an administrative offence. that had further delayed the authorisation procedure. on 10 march 2006 the cluj county court dismissed the action as premature, holding that the applicant company had not followed the prior procedure required by law before lodging an action with the court. it quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the first-instance court for examination on the merits. on 15 september 2006 the cluj county court dismissed the applicant company’s action. 265/2001, had provided only for the obligation to obtain an environmental permit, without establishing the procedure to be followed in that respect. it also claimed that it had been unable to apply for a new permit forty-five days prior to the expiry of its existing environmental permit on 31 january 2005, as the new order had entered into force on 20 december 2004 and the relevant guidelines had not been published until 11 january 2005. in this connection, the applicant company pointed out that, like the previous order, the new order provided for the ope legis extension of an existing permit for up to five years if the company’s operating conditions had not changed. it also pointed out that at the time of lodging its application for a new permit on 4 january 2005, the applicable law was order no. 265/2001, which provided for a time-limit of thirty days for the issuance or renewal of an operating permit. on 8 february 2007 the cluj court of appeal dismissed the applicant company’s appeal on points of law, upholding the first‑instance judgment. it held that the law applicable to the applicant company was order no. it concluded that even assuming that the administrative authorities were liable for non-compliance with the applicable legislation, the applicant company had had no right to continue an illicit activity in the absence of the authorisation required by law. in january 2013, before the court had communicated the applicant company’s complaints to the respondent government, the administrator and sole shareholder, mr teodor morar, informed the court of the company’s dissolution on 24 february 2010 and his intention to continue the procedure initiated before the court by the applicant company.
the applicant was born in 1951 and until his arrest lived in vladivostok, primorskiy region. on 21 november 2003 a criminal case was opened against the applicant and seven other suspects (the “first case”). on 5 january 2004 the police charged the applicant with abuse of his position and issued an order prohibiting him from leaving vladivostok. in august 2005 the charges were amended to multiple counts of aggravated embezzlement and money laundering committed by an organised criminal group. the court noted that the applicant was a person of mature years, permanently residing at a known address, that he had no criminal record, had never attempted to abscond, and, at the time in question had been undergoing inpatient medical treatment in a hospital. that decision was upheld on appeal by the primosrskiy regional court on 21 november 2005. on 23 january 2006 the district court remanded the applicant in detention. it referred chiefly to the gravity of the charges, the fact that the accused had continued informally running a legal entity, was allegedly involved in criminal activity and that he had twice failed to comply with police summonses. the court also stated that his state of health did not preclude him from detention. over the following months the applicant’s detention was extended on several occasions, including on 2 march, 1 june and 3 september 2007. the regional court upheld them on 26 march, 3 july and 24 september 2007 respectively. although the applicant was present, two of his retained lawyers failed to appear. when the hearing resumed, the applicant’s lawyer opposed to the extension of the detention, referring, among other things, to the applicant’s health problems and the fact that the address of his residence was known. two days later the applicant appealed, arguing that his lawyers had not been notified about the court hearing and had therefore been unable to attend it. they were eventually held on 7 february 2008. that detention order was upheld on appeal on 10 april 2008. on 27 may 2008 the district court considered that there was no necessity for the further detention of the applicant as the investigating authorities had completed the collection of evidence, and the applicant could therefore no longer hamper the investigation. the court ordered him to be released on bail. prior to his detention the applicant had been suffering from hypertension, had had a heart attack and had undergone coronary artery bypass surgery in a civilian hospital. the applicant was prescribed drug therapy which, according to medical entries dated 2 february and 20 march 2006, led to an improvement in his health. on 5 april 2006 the applicant was discharged from the prison hospital. having suffered a serious hypertensive crisis in late june 2006, the applicant was admitted to the prison hospital on 7 july 2006. he remained there until his release from detention on 28 may 2008. on the day of the applicant’s admission to the prison hospital the head of the therapeutic department established that the hypertensive disease had progressed to the most advanced stage. dietary nutrition and multidrug therapy were prescribed. throughout his stay in the hospital the applicant was seen by the attending doctors around four times per week. a follow-up electrocardiogram examination revealed a certain worsening of the heart condition. some days later the applicant’s drug regimen was adjusted. the adjustment had a positive effect on his health. the applicant was discharged from the hospital for outpatient treatment in a satisfactory health condition.

the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in oradea. on 11 december 2008 the national anticorruption department instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant and a police officer for traffic of influence (trafic de influenţă). the applicant was accused, as a lawyer, of having requested and received money from a client in return for persuading certain judges, other than in the context of the judicial proceedings, to adopt a favourable judgment in his client’s case. on the same day the case prosecutor authorised several police officers to enforce a warrant to appear (mandat de aducere) issued in the applicant’s name on the basis of articles 183 and 184 of the criminal procedure code. according to the warrant, the applicant’s presence was required in order to be heard as a suspect (învinuit) in the criminal investigation instituted in file no. no other reasons or conditions were stated on the authorisation or the warrant itself. on 12 december 2008 at 8 a.m. a police officer went to the applicant’s office in the city of oradea to enforce the warrant to appear. according to the police officer’s report, the applicant was shown the warrant to appear and was escorted to the police station in the nearby town of salonta. at 9.40 a.m. the applicant was handed over to two other police officers who escorted him to the timişoara office of the national anticorruption department (t.n.a.d.). according to the escorting police officers’ report, which was signed also by the applicant, he was handed over to the prosecutor at 11.40 a.m. 9. according to the record of the statements the applicant made before the prosecutor, he was heard as a suspect by the prosecutor at the t.n.a.d. from 12 noon to 4.50 p.m. after the questioning the applicant was charged with the crime of traffic of influence. according to the applicant, his phone, wallet and watch had been confiscated by the police officers and were held during this entire time. moreover, he had been constantly guarded by the police. by an order issued on 12 december 2008 the applicant was placed in police custody for twenty-four hours commencing at 5.10 p.m. 12. on 13 december 2008 the prosecutor’s request for the placement of the applicant in pre-trial detention for thirty days was allowed by the timişoara court of appeal. the applicant complained before the court that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty from 8 a.m. to 5.10 p.m. on the previous day. he requested that the above-mentioned period be deducted from his time in custody. the court considered that it was not competent to decide on this complaint and suggested that the applicant should have used the procedure provided by article 1401 of the criminal procedure code. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (recurs) against that judgment, reiterating that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty. on 17 december 2008 the high court of cassation and justice rejected the applicant’s appeal on points of law as ill-founded without addressing his complaint regarding the lawfulness of his detention prior to his placement in police custody. on 12 march 2010 the applicant was found guilty with final effect and given a suspended sentence of four years’ imprisonment for traffic of influence.
the applicant was born in 1967 and lives in chișinău. on 2 october 2008 the chișinău court of appeal delivered a judgment acknowledging the applicant’s entitlement to a disability pension. owing to the lack of an appeal, the judgment became final on 22 october 2008. on 1 december 2008 the ministry of defence lodged an appeal on points of law. on 4 february 2009 the supreme court of justice allowed the appeal on points of law, quashed the judgment of 2 october 2008 and remitted the case for a fresh examination on the merits. after several rounds of proceedings, on 2 march 2011 the supreme court of justice finally acknowledged the applicant’s entitlement to a disability pension. meanwhile, after communication, the prosecutor general, following a request from the government agent, lodged an application for revision with the supreme court of justice, seeking the reopening of the proceedings and redress for the violation of the applicant’s rights. in those proceedings, the applicant claimed 29,069.17 moldovan lei (mdl) in respect of pecuniary damage, mdl 25,000 in respect of non‑pecuniary damage, mdl 29,784.60 for legal costs and mdl 4,000 for miscellaneous expenses. on 23 june 2011 the supreme court of justice found a violation of the applicant’s rights as a result of the quashing of the final judgment in his favour. it set aside the judgment of 4 february 2009 and the subsequent judgments adopted in the reopened proceedings and decided to restore the final judgment of 2 october 2008 in the applicant’s favour. the court then awarded the applicant mdl 15,000 (equivalent to 890 euros (eur)) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, mdl 15,000 for legal costs and mdl 1,000 for miscellaneous expenses. the court dismissed the applicant’s claims in respect of pecuniary damage, arguing that they could not be examined by direct application of article 41 of the convention.
the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in baktalórántháza. subsequently, she was in receipt of unemployment benefit from 15 september 1997 until 9 september 1998. in response to a request lodged on 16 october 2001, the applicant was granted a disability pension (rokkantsági nyugdíj) later that same year on the basis of a retrospective finding that she had lost, as of 1 april 2001, 67% of her capacity to work on account of various ailments. this assessment was maintained in 2003, 2006 and 2007. as of 2008 the legislation on the methodology used to assess health impairment in occupational contexts changed. without envisaging any procedure for rehabilitation, the assessment panel scheduled the next check-up of her medical status for 2012. since, however, she was found to have only 40% health impairment, her condition had to be deemed to have improved in the intervening period. as a consequence of the applicant’s newly assessed 40% level of disability, on 1 february 2010 the relevant pension insurance directorate withdrew her entitlement to the disability pension. the applicant appealed against that decision. on an unspecified date, the decision was upheld by the second-instance pension insurance authority. in an opinion of 16 february 2011, the expert submitted that the old score of 67%, as well as the new one of 40%, were correct under the respective methodologies; at any rate, the applicant’s condition had not significantly improved since 2007. the applicant was ordered to reimburse the amounts received after 1 february 2010. it drew her attention to the possibility of making a renewed application for disability pension should her health deteriorate. in 2011 the applicant requested another assessment of her disability. on 5 september 2011 the first-instance authority assessed it at 45%, scheduling the next assessment for september 2014. such a level would have entitled her to disability pension had rehabilitation not been possible. nevertheless, no such rehabilitation took place, and the applicant did not receive rehabilitation allowance. as of 1 january 2012, a new law on disability and related benefits (act no. it introduced additional eligibility criteria. in particular, instead of fulfilling a service period as required by the former legislation, the persons concerned had to have at least 1,095 days covered by social security in the five years preceding the submission of their requests. individuals who did not meet this requirement could nevertheless qualify if they had no interruption of social cover exceeding 30 days throughout their careers, or if they were in receipt of a disability pension or rehabilitation allowance on 31 december 2011. her condition was assessed in april 2012, leading to the finding of 50% disability. the next assessment was scheduled for april 2014. on 15 august 2012 the applicant submitted a fresh request for disability pension under the new law. she underwent another assessment, during which her degree of disability was again established at 50%. instead of the requisite 1,095 days covered by social security in the five preceding years, the applicant had been covered for 947 days. according to the government, had the law not been so amended, the applicant would again have become eligible for a disability pension, since her health impairment was again assessed as exceeding the relevant threshold in 2012. on 27 march 2013 the applicant filed an action with the nyíregyháza administrative and labour court, challenging these administrative decisions. on 20 june 2013 the court dismissed her case. however, the applicant does not meet these criteria either.

the applicant had a restitution claim concerning movable property located in opočno castle. the castle itself belonged to another person, of whom the applicant is not an heir. after the end of the second world war, the property was once again confiscated, in 1945, by the czechoslovak state under the beneš decrees as he was considered to be of german nationality. that expropriation was quashed on appeal by the national council in prague (zemský národní výbor) on 21 january 1947 after it had been established that the applicant’s predecessor was of czechoslovak nationality and had been loyal to the czechoslovak state. what happened to the property afterwards is disputed and was discussed in the domestic decisions. on 31 march 1992, the applicant’s father, together with his cousin, ms. kristina colloredo-mansfeld, claimed the restitution of movable property which had been in opočno castle. the applicant entered the proceedings as the heir and legal successor to his father, who died in 1998. due to a large number of items in question, the first-instance court decided the case by way of three separate judgments. that judgment was upheld on appeal by the hradec králové regional court (krajský soud) on 1 june 2000 and the defendant’s appeal on points of law was dismissed. those proceedings are not part of the present applications. on 27 october 2006 the district court ordered the national heritage institute to return to the applicant and his co-plaintiff certain movable property located in opočno castle. it found that the applicant’s predecessor had been the owner of the property on the critical date, that is 25 february 1948 (see gratzinger and gratzingerova v. the czech republic (dec.), on 18 october 2007 the regional court quashed the judgment and dismissed the action. it held that the property in question had been taken away from the applicant’s predecessor before 25 february 1948 and that therefore the legislation on restitution did not apply. the regional court based its decision on two pieces of evidence. firstly, there was a letter of 24 june 1947 from the national administrator of opočno castle to his superiors, informing them about a visit by the applicant’s predecessor to the castle. the 1947 decision had not been raised with the parties in the course of the hearing and the parties had not received an opportunity to comment on it. in its reasoning the regional court noted that it was aware of the existence of the document through the exercise of its functions. on 11 february 2009 the supreme court (nejvyšší soud) dismissed an appeal on points of law (dovolání) lodged by the applicant. it noted that the appellate court had reached its conclusion, inter alia, on the basis of the 1947 decision. it did not address the applicant’s argument that he had not seen that decision and had not been able to comment on it. it noted the importance of the 1947 decision, but stated that the requirements of article 121 of the code of civil procedure had been met and that it was not necessary to prove facts which were generally known, or known to a court through the exercise of its functions. on 22 april 2009 the district court dismissed the rest of the applicant’s restitution claim. in its reasoning it referred to the judgment of the regional court of 18 october 2007 and that of the supreme court of 11 february 2009. on 27 january 2011 the regional court upheld the first-instance judgment. the court relied as evidence on a letter by the ministry of agriculture of 27 may 1957 referring to the 1947 decision. despite the applicant’s repeated requests, the 1947 decision was not produced for the parties. on 28 november 2011 the supreme court dismissed an appeal by the applicant on points of law. on 19 april 2012 the constitutional court dismissed a constitutional appeal by the applicant, claiming a violation of his right to a fair trial and to his property, as manifestly ill-founded.

–  an appeal may be lodged against the present order within a period of sixty days from the date of its service, with the justice of the peace of agrigento. –  the lodging of an appeal will not, in any event, suspend the enforcement (efficacia) of the present order. 286 of 1998; and with its registration under article 10 § 6 of the said legislative decree. these orders were each accompanied by a record of notification bearing the same date, also drafted in italian with an arabic translation. in the space reserved for the applicants’ signatures, both records contain the handwritten indication “[the person] refused to sign or to receive a copy” (si rifiuta di firmare e ricevere copia). on their arrival at tunis airport, the applicants were released. in a decision of 1 june 2012 the palermo preliminary investigations judge (giudice per le indagini preliminari) granted the public prosecutor’s request. the fact that a refusal-of-entry measure (respingimento) had been ordered in respect of the migrants, without judicial scrutiny, a few days after their arrival, was not unlawful in the judge’s view. moreover, the judge was of the view that no malicious intent could be attributed to the authorities, whose conduct had been prompted first and foremost by the public interest. the migrants had not sustained any unfair harm (danno ingiusto). in so far as the complainants had alleged that the way in which the migrants had been treated had been detrimental to their health, the judge noted that the investigations had found that nobody on the ships had applied for asylum. unaccompanied minors had been placed in temporary accommodation and no pregnant women had been transferred to the ships. the migrants on board had been able to receive medical assistance, hot water, electricity, meals and hot drinks. moreover, as recorded in a press agency note of 25 september 2011, t.r., a member of parliament (mp) had boarded the ships in the port of palermo, and had observed that the migrants were in good health, that they were receiving assistance and were sleeping in cabins containing bed linen or reclining seats (poltrone reclinabili). accompanied by the deputy chief of police (vice questore) and by police officers, the mp in question had talked with some of the migrants. in the light of the foregoing, the preliminary investigations judge concluded that the case file contained no evidence of the physical and mental elements of the offences provided for in articles 323 and 606 of the criminal code. in his reasoning the judge observed that the complainants had been found on italian territory on 6 may and 18 september 2011 respectively and that the orders at issue had been adopted only on 16 may and 24 september 2011.
the applicant was born in 1971 and lives in helsinki. the applicant and her partner began to cohabit in 2003. their daughter was born in november 2004. this arrangement continued for about a year but was disrupted for some time in 2007. according to the applicant, the child was often restless and talked strangely after the meetings with her father. on 15 june 2007 the kouvola district court gave another interim decision according to which the father had a right to meet with his daughter for 2 to 4 hours at a time without supervision. the meetings were, however, temporarily discontinued for the duration of the pre-trial investigation (see below). the child was using vulgar language and was restless and anxious. the child had told her mother about things that her father did to her. she kept repeating these issues and suffered from increasingly bad nightmares. the applicant contacted a child psychiatrist. on 16 august 2007 she contacted the child welfare authorities in helsinki reporting her suspicions of sexual abuse. they recommended that the meetings with the father be discontinued for the duration of the investigation. at the time the child was two years and ten months old. the pre-trial investigation was concluded on 15 october 2007 as there was no appearance of any crime. on 18 january 2008 the applicant submitted another child welfare report and the second report to the police, insisting on another investigation and stating that she suspected that someone was abusing her child during visits to the child’s father. no somatic signs or symptoms of sexual abuse were found. on 16 april 2008 the parliamentary ombudsman decided not to take any measures as the police investigation was still pending before the kouvola police (see paragraph 20 above). he did not have competence to give orders to the police concerning the investigation of the matter as he could not examine the actions of private individuals. the child had only been two years and ten months old at the time of the first police investigation. he claimed that these allegations were not true and that the applicant’s motive for such accusations was that she wanted to have sole custody of the child and hamper the meetings between the father and the child. could not have had strong grounds to consider that her insinuation of the crime was true, even if the child had said what she was alleged to have said. nor could the child’s other, more general symptoms have given sufficient confirmation of her insinuation. taking into account what has been said above about the circumstances of the case and the nature of the criminal insinuation, there is no basis for considering that m.p. it had been the child welfare authorities who had qualified these concerns as relating to sexual abuse. sexual abuse did not always leave physical marks which could be revealed by medical examination but it was a grave procedural mistake not to interview the child during the pre-trial investigation. by letter dated 7 march 2011 the applicant appealed to the supreme court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen), reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the appeal court. on 14 december 2011 the supreme court refused the applicant leave to appeal. on 18 march 2010 the father of the child requested the helsinki district court to order that the child live with him. this decision was upheld by the helsinki appeal court on 2 december 2011.
he is currently serving a prison sentence in valmiera. on several occasions between 2009 and 2011 the applicant was escorted to court hearings from various detention facilities where he was being held. during these transfers the applicant was subjected to strip-searches. according to the applicant, he was ordered to strip naked in the presence of other inmates and escorting officers, to assume embarrassing positions (squatting), and to submit to a visual inspection of his body. the strip-searches of the applicant were carried out on 9 december 2009, 8 and 11 june 2010, 22 february and 8 june 2011. the applicant lodged several applications with the administrative courts concerning the strip-searches. they were all joined in one set of administrative proceedings (no. on 20 june 2012 the administrative district court (administratīvā rajona tiesa) dismissed the applicant’s complaints and terminated the proceedings. it held that the strip-searches had been objectively justified on security grounds and the manner in which they had been conducted had not gone beyond what had been required to ensure the efficacy of those searches. therefore these searches had not “significantly interfere[d]” with the applicant’s rights and had not constituted an “action of a public authority” (see paragraphs 17 and 18 below). on 13 september 2012 the administrative regional court (administratīvā apgabaltiesa) dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the ruling of the lower court. on 5 november 2012 the senate of the supreme court (augstākās tiesas senāts) quashed the ruling of the appeal court and remitted the case to the first-instance court. the senate of the supreme court found that the strip-searches had had a legitimate goal, namely ensuring public safety, and had not been carried out in an abusive manner. however, the lower courts had not sufficiently addressed the applicant’s argument that he had been subjected to strip-searches in the presence of other persons. on 27 february and 11 april 2013 hearings took place before the first-instance court. in order to clarify the facts eleven witnesses – seven escorting officers and four prisoners – were called. on 13 may 2013 the administrative district court dismissed the applicant’s complaints and terminated the proceedings. as concerns the strip-searches carried out on 9 december 2009, 8 and 11 june 2010, the court, on the basis of witness testimony, found that the applicant had been searched in the presence of one inmate and at least one additional escorting officer. however, taking into account that the applicant had not voiced any concerns in this regard during the first round of proceedings, the court concluded that “the strip-searches ... had not humiliated the applicant in the eyes of others or in his [own] eyes”. accordingly, the court could not establish a “significant violation” of the human rights guaranteed under article 95 of the constitution and article 3 of the convention. as concerns the strip-searches carried out on 22 february and 8 june 2011, the court found that the evidence did not support the applicant’s allegation that he had been searched in the presence of other persons. the court dismissed the applicant’s further allegations (the presence of female officers, being exposed to the court’s staff and passers-by, unsanitary touching of his food) as unsubstantiated. on 9 july 2013 the senate of the supreme court, by a final decision, dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the ruling of the lower court.
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in novomoskovsk. at about 5.30 p.m. on 1 august 2004 a fight took place involving the applicant, z. and sh. on 15 november 2005 the novomoskovsk court convicted the applicant of gang hooliganism committed against z. and sh., and gave him a suspended prison sentence of three years. on 10 february and 19 december 2006 respectively the court of appeal and the supreme court upheld the applicant’s conviction and sentence. according to the applicant, his conviction had been based on an incorrect assessment of the evidence. at about 7 p.m. on 1 august 2004 a group of people, including z. and sh. and two volunteer citizen guards (добровільна народна дружина), who were identified in the course of the ensuing proceedings (see paragraphs 9-11 below), entered the yard of the applicant’s house and, according to the applicant, assaulted him. in particular, he was punched, hit with a gas pistol and kicked in the head and torso and as a result briefly lost consciousness. according to the material available in the case (see paragraph 9 below), the volunteer citizen guards used force against the applicant while exercising their powers under the relevant regulations (see paragraph 13 below) in an attempt to take him to a police station in relation to the incident of 1 august 2004 (see paragraph 5 above). subsequently, the applicant was admitted to novomoskovsk central hospital, where a physician found two bruises near the applicant’s right eye, a wound on the back of his head and numerous abrasions on the right side of his back. the applicant was also diagnosed with concussion. during subsequent examinations by a forensic expert in december 2004 and april 2006, the applicant was found to have developed post-traumatic otitis media. the applicant’s injuries were classified as being partly minor and partly moderate. on 1 august 2004 the applicant filed a complaint with the novomoskovsk police, seeking to have criminal proceedings instituted against those who had beaten him. the applicant’s complaint was examined initially by the police and later by prosecutors. between december 2004 and march 2009 they issued a number of decisions rejecting the applicant’s complaint, finding, inter alia, that the applicant had been injured after disobeying the lawful orders of the volunteer citizen guards, who had lawfully resorted to force in order to take him to a police station in relation to the incident of 1 august 2004 (see paragraph 5 above). those decisions were overturned by different courts, which considered, principally, that the applicant’s complaint had not been examined thoroughly. on 12 march 2009 the novomoskovsk prosecutor opened criminal proceedings related to the applicant’s complaint and ordered the police to investigate the incident of 1 august 2004 at the applicant’s house. in the course of the investigation the two volunteer citizen guards who had taken part in the incident on 1 august 2004 at the applicant’s house died. for that reason, the proceedings concerning those two people were terminated on 17 july 2009. on the same date the police terminated the proceedings concerning z. and sh., finding that there had been no elements of a crime in their actions. the police noted that two witnesses had stated that the volunteer citizen guards who had died had beaten the applicant on 1 august 2004. on 16 december 2009 the police suspended the investigation, finding that it was impossible to identify any other people involved in the incident of 1 august 2004 at the applicant’s home. no further investigation was carried out.
ms n. zīmele, the applicant’s grandmother, informed the court of her wish to pursue the proceedings on his behalf. the relevant facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. in july and august 2011 the police opened four criminal investigations into three incidents of theft and an incident of robbery. on 29 august 2011 these investigations were joined. on 12 august 2011 the police arrested the applicant on suspicion of robbery. he was held in custody on this basis until 14 august 2011, when he was placed under arrest on suspicion of theft. on 15 august 2011 the police lodged an application with the ludza district court (ludzas rajona tiesa) for the applicant’s pre-trial detention in relation to the theft investigation. on 16 august 2011 an investigating judge granted the application. with regard to the suspicion of theft, he reasoned as follows:
“there are reasons to suspect that [the applicant] has committed the crime under section 175(3) of the criminal law (krimināllikums) [theft] ... these suspicions are confirmed by the evidence gathered in the criminal case.” on 18 august 2011 the applicant appealed against that decision. on 2 september 2011 the latgale regional court (latgales apgabaltiesa) dismissed the appeal. with regard to the suspicion of theft, the judge stated:
“the ... suspicion that [the applicant] has committed the crime ... is confirmed by the information contained in the file.” no appeal lay against the aforementioned decision. on 19 september 2011 the public prosecutor charged the applicant with robbery, theft, involving a minor in theft and petty theft on the basis of the facts as alleged. on 26 september 2011 the applicant familiarised himself with the case material. on 28 september 2011 the prosecutor transferred the case to the ludza district court for adjudication. she set out the case against the applicant and detailed the evidence upon which the prosecution intended to rely. on 17 october 2011 the investigating judge decided to keep the applicant in detention. he gave the following reasoning:
“the accusation against [the applicant] of the crimes under sections 175(3) [theft], 176(2) [robbery], 180(2) [petty theft] and 172 [involving a minor in theft] of the criminal law ... is confirmed by the evidence gathered in the criminal case.” no appeal lay against the aforementioned decision. on 28 december 2011 and 23 april 2012 the applicant’s detention was extended. the judge stated as follows:
“[the applicant’s] detention is based on the suspicion that he has committed the crime under section 175(3) of the criminal law [theft]... in other criminal proceedings [he] has been declared a suspect in relation to crimes under sections 180(1) [petty theft] and 176(2) [robbery] ...
...
there has been no change in the reasons noted in the detention order of 16 august 2011 ... which had been re-examined in [the subsequent decisions]...” 20. on 3 february, 19 june and 6 august 2012, the applicant complained to the ludza district court that it had failed to assess his detention in relation to the alleged robbery. on 6 august and 2 november 2012, and on 25 january 2013 the judge decided to continue the applicant’s detention, using largely the same wording as in the previous decisions. in addition, she noted that the twenty-four-month period allowed by section 277(7) of the criminal procedure law (kriminālprocesa likums) for detention had been observed because the applicant had also been accused of an especially serious offence, robbery, under section 176(2) of the criminal law. the aforementioned decisions were not subject to appeal.
on 9 june 2004, the applicant, 69 at the time, was walking in the centre of kharkiv and was hit in the face by a pellet fired from an air gun. the applicant was admitted to hospital the same day and the pellet was removed from her face. it was subsequently seized as evidence by the police. the doctors noted in the applicant’s medical file that she had a gunshot wound on the infraorbital region of her face. later that day she lodged a criminal complaint with the police. the applicant alleged that the shot had been fired from a particular flat in a building in the centre of kharkiv. from 10 to 26 june 2004 the applicant underwent outpatient medical treatment for her injury. on 2 july 2004, at the request of the police, she was examined by an expert, who concluded that the applicant’s injury was of a minor degree and might have been caused by a gunshot. on 31 october 2005 the applicant underwent an additional medical examination, which confirmed the previous conclusion. by decisions of 22 march and 8 december 2005 and 9 august 2006, the police refused to open criminal proceedings, stating that it was not possible to identify the offenders and that the applicant’s allegations that the shot had been fired from a particular location were unfounded. they further found that there had been no serious breach of public order in the applicant’s case and noted that the applicant could have lodged a criminal complaint directly with a court in the framework of private prosecution proceedings. despite her repeated requests, the applicant was not given access to the police investigation file related to the incident of 9 june 2004. on appeal by the applicant, those decisions were annulled by different prosecutors and the courts generally on the grounds that the police enquiry had fallen short of the requirements of a full and objective examination of the circumstances of the case. it was noted that the police had failed to examine the relevant evidence, including the pellet, and that the case contained elements of the crime defined by article 296 of the criminal code (hooliganism). in particular, on 21 august 2007 the dzerzhynskyy district court of kharkiv ruled that the case should be returned to the prosecutors for further investigation. no further investigation was carried out after that date. by a letter of 21 august 2009, the deputy prosecutor of the dzerzhynskyy district of kharkiv informed the applicant that the investigation case file had gone missing. there is no information as to any further developments in that regard. her death was unrelated to the incident of 9 june 2004.
from 20 january 2006 onwards the tax agency (skatteverket) conducted audits of value-added tax, employers’ social security contributions (arbetsgivaravgifter) and income tax at the three swedish companies ergonia sweden ab, sns-lan trading ab (“sns”) and mouse trapper nordic ab. after mr jurik had been shown an extract of the swiss company register, where he was listed as an executive, he had admitted that he and another person involved in the swedish companies had been present at the establishment of the swiss company but that he was listed as an executive only for formal reasons. in the agency’s view, there were no alternative means of review. agreeing with the tax agency, the court considered that there was a substantial risk that documents could be withheld, corrupted or destroyed and that, having regard to mr jurik’s connection with sns and the two addresses in question, there was good reason to assume that the documents relevant to the audit of sns were to be found at those addresses. during the search of the flat, material of interest that belonged to draupner was found. this was specified in a report drawn up and submitted to the parties concerned the same day by the enforcement authority. attending was also a legal representative whom the applicant had appointed. however, no material of relevance was found on the premises. the tax agency’s interim decision of 14 march 2008 to use coercive measures against draupner was referred to the county administrative court, which received it on 17 march 2008, the following monday. draupner requested that the decision be quashed, referring, inter alia, to attorney-client privilege pertaining to its representatives. draupner and mr jurik appealed to the administrative court of appeal. on 18 june 2008 the tax agency dismissed the appeal because, in accordance with chapter 6, section 2 of the tax assessment act (taxeringslagen; 1990:324), no appeal lay against such a decision. in addition, it noted that, while the audit decision itself did not involve any harm to draupner, possible detriment caused by the audit procedure could be removed or mitigated through a request for the exemption of documents from the audit. such a request was at the time already under examination by the court (see paragraphs 35-43 below). it mentioned, in particular, the external hard disk drive and the usb memory stick. it also requested that an oral hearing be held on the question of its legal standing in the matter. by a judgment of 22 august 2008 the administrative court of appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal and agreed with the lower court that the applicant did not have legal standing concerning the requested exemption of documents, as the coercive measures had not been directed against the law firm. the applicant made a further appeal, stating, among other things, that the tax agency’s original interim decision of 14 march 2008 concerning draupner and the county administrative court’s judgment of 26 march 2008 confirming that decision had been directed against the law firm because they allowed a search in the firm’s offices. moreover, the coercive measures employed had led to the seizure of material which allegedly belonged to the applicant and could contain information covered by attorney-client privilege. she was also a civil servant at the tax agency, albeit formally on leave of absence while temporarily serving with the court. on 14 may 2008 the administrative court of appeal, sitting in a different formation, rejected the objection, noting that the co-opted member was on leave from her post at the tax agency. while the coercive measures used could not therefore be considered to have contravened the coercive measures act or the convention, the question remained whether there were reasons to exempt some or all of the material. by a judgment of 14 september 2009 the court rejected the company’s requests for an oral hearing and an inspection of the flat but granted that a few seized documents be exempted from examination by the tax agency, as they were considered to be mr jurik’s private documents. draupner agreed that 17 of the 19 files seized on 14 march 2008 could be handed over to the tax agency for examination, following which the request for exemption concerned the remaining material seized and copied on that day. the tax agency requested that it be allowed to examine deleted and reconstructed data files. it also considered that the particular circumstances of the case did not show that certain documents were protected by such privilege. on 15 november 2010 the supreme administrative court refused draupner leave to appeal. however, none of the documents for which exemption had been requested were found to have such content that attorney-client privilege applied. on 8 may 2012 the supreme administrative court (now högsta förvaltningsdomstolen) refused draupner leave to appeal. like sns, draupner has since been liquidated.
the first applicant, ms lia shioshvili, was born in 1977 and lives in gurjaani (georgia). she is the mother of the second, third, fourth and fifth applicant, all georgian nationals and born respectively in 1995, 1997, 2000 and 2004. after a period of custody in police stations, they were grouped together and taken by bus to a court, which summarily imposed administrative penalties on them and gave decisions ordering their administrative expulsion from russian territory. at that time there was no visa requirement for georgian citizens in place. in september 2004 the first applicant gave birth to her fourth child, the fifth applicant. the first applicant did not apply for a birth certificate for the fifth applicant at that time, since she was unlawfully residing in russia. on 18 october 2006 a police officer visited the applicants’ family home in ruza and requested the first applicant to produce her identity papers. the applicants left the police station after approximately 30 minutes. the police officer informed the first applicant that a court hearing concerning her case would take place soon. he further advised her to apply for a birth certificate for the fifth applicant. on 7 november 2006 a hearing before the ruzskiy district court of the moscow region took place, following which an expulsion decision was issued. on 20 november 2006, after having received the expulsion decision of 7 november 2006 all five applicants left moscow. the first applicant was eight months pregnant at the material time and her four minor children were eleven, nine, six and two years old. a)  the applicants’ version of the subsequent events 19. the officers collected the applicants’ identity and travel documents and confiscated 400 usd from the first applicant, which allegedly had not been declared. in particular, since she had to carry a suitcase and her youngest child. once the group arrived in derbent, the migration officers asked the group to accompany them to the migration service office. at daybreak, the police officers asked the group to go to the migration service office again, where they spent the whole day waiting outside at a temperature of 5o c. 24. on 29 november 2006 the first applicant tried to cross the russian/azerbaijani border with her three eldest children, the second, third and fourth applicant. they were subsequently sent back to derbent. the first applicant’s health worsened, she suffered from a cold and had a fever, became depressed and had repeated asthma attacks. on 3 and 4 december 2006, after having gone back and forth to the migration service office, and with the help of an employee from the consulate service of the georgian embassy in moscow, the first applicant finally obtained transit visa for her children and all other necessary documents, so that all five applicants could leave for georgia. the other four applicants were not registered in the aforementioned register. on 5 december 2006 a group of 30 georgians, including the applicants, travelled to the russian/azerbaijani border in two buses that they had hired. with another bus the group travelled through the city of baku to the azerbaijani/georgian border. after having arrived in georgia, the first applicant’s health was particularly bad. she suffered from a severe cough and fever, her right leg had grown numb and her general condition was extremely weak. on 12 december 2006, the first applicant’s health worsened, she had an asthma attack and severe abdominal pain. during the following months, the first applicant suffered from severe depression and panic attacks. however, he received no further information from the russian authorities.
the applicant was born in 1942 and lives in kutina. on 12 february 1989 he concluded a sale contract with ms m.a., whereby they sold him a house in kutina for 47,000 german marks (dem). because the applicant actually paid only dem 30,000 they brought a civil action against him in the kutina municipal court (općinski sud u kutini) seeking payment of the remaining dem 17,000. on 12 march 2003 the creditors applied to the same court (hereinafter “the enforcement court”) for enforcement of that judgment. specifically, they sought (a) the equivalent of 8,691.96 euros (eur) in croatian kunas (hrk), together with accrued statutory default interest running from 15 december 1989, (b) the costs of the above civil proceedings in the amount of hrk 1,860, together with accrued statutory default interest (running from 20 may 1994), and (c) the costs of the enforcement proceedings. during the enforcement proceedings a court-appointed expert assessed the value of the applicant’s house at hrk 384,197[1]. after two unsuccessful attempts on 16 february and 23 march 2005 to sell it through public auction, the enforcement court on 13 april 2005 at a third public auction sold the house and awarded it to the enforcement creditors for hrk 100,000. since the creditors did not pay the purchase price within the set time-limit, on 28 november 2006 the court set aside its decision of 13 april 2005 and re-ran the third public auction. at a third public auction, held on 10 december 2008, the enforcement court sold the applicant’s house and awarded it to a certain mr d.d. the court again based its decision on section 97(4) of the 1996 enforcement act, as amended by the 1999 amendments (see paragraph 11 above and paragraphs 25-26 below). following an appeal by the applicant, on 1 april 2009 the sisak county court (županijski sud u sisku) quashed the decision of 10 december 2008 to award the applicant’s house to mr d.d. the relevant part of that decision reads:
“the enforcement debtor ... justly complains about the sale of the property [in question] ... for an amount significantly lower than its established value. ...
by having sold for hrk 50,000 a property [worth] hrk 384,197, the first-instance court evidently misinterpreted ... [section 97(4) of the enforcement act]. that is so because the rule contained in section 97(4) is not of a mandatory nature [ius cogens], as it merely allows that property ... to be sold at a third public auction without restrictions regarding the lowest price ... (the text of that provision literally reads ‘ ... may be sold ...’ ). ... the enforcement court has to interpret the said provision in the light of the basic principles of [enforcement] procedure, as well as in accordance with the purpose sought to be achieved by the proceedings. by selling for hrk 50,000 property [worth] hrk 384,197 and awarding it to the buyer, the first-instance court breached section 6 of the enforcement act, which imposes the duty on an enforcement court, in carrying out an enforcement, to respect the debtor’s dignity and make [the enforcement] the least onerous for him or her. furthermore, the purpose of enforcement proceedings is to settle the claim of an enforcement creditor. accordingly, by a decision of 3 june 2009 the court awarded the applicant’s house to d.d. the applicant appealed against that decision, arguing that his house had been sold for less than one-fifth of its value, which had not been sufficient to settle the creditors’ claim in full. in so doing he referred to the reasons given by the sisak county court in its decision of 1 april 2009 (see paragraph 14 above). on 2 october 2009 the enforcement creditors informed the enforcement court that they considered that their claim had been settled in full. by a decision of 20 december 2010 the sisak county court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of 3 june 2009 to award the applicant’s house to d.d. ( the relevant part of the county court’s decision, which was served on the applicant’s representative on 12 january 2011, reads:
“it is not disputed that on 3 june 2009 a third public auction was held, at which the debtor’s property was sold for hrk 70,000. the third public auction was carried out in accordance with section 97(4) of the enforcement act, which provides that if a property is not sold at a second auction, the court shall, within 15 to 30 days [of the second auction], schedule a third auction at which the property may be sold without restrictions regarding the lowest price [calculated in proportion to its] established value.” on 11 february 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint alleging violations of his right to equality before the law and his right of ownership, as guaranteed by article 14 paragraph 2 and article 48 of the croatian constitution (see paragraph 22 below). in so doing he repeated, in substance, the arguments raised in his appeal. that decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 6 june 2011. meanwhile, by a decision of 14 february 2011 the enforcement court distributed the proceeds of the sale to the enforcement creditors, and by a decision of 18 may 2011 ordered the applicant’s eviction from the house. the applicant’s appeals against those decisions were dismissed by the sisak county court.
the applicant is a community of owners of a building located in madrid. on 13 june 1991 l., the co-owner of a house located next to the applicant’s building, filed a complaint before the madrid municipality, complaining that a dividing wall belonging to the applicant’s building and two other buildings located next to it was in poor condition. on 25 april 1994, in view of the “serious risk of harm” posed by the poor condition of the wall, the municipality repaired it motu proprio. on 30 august 1994 the applicant received a decree issued by the municipality on 29 july 1994, informing it that the repairs had been carried out in view of the “serious risk of harm” posed by the condition of wall in question, and ordering it to pay a provisional amount of 18,030.36 euros (eur). on 21 october 1994 the applicant initiated proceedings opposing the municipality’s demand, contesting the necessity of the urgent repairs. on 29 october 1994, before the madrid high court of justice, the applicant brought a first set of judicial administrative proceedings (recurso contencioso-administrativo) against the decree of 29 july 1994, complaining of the shortcomings of the procedure which had led to the municipality repairing the wall. on 18 march 1996 the municipality asked the applicant to pay the remainder of the amount owed: the final cost of the repairs minus the amount already paid as a provisional amount. on 16 july 1996, before the madrid high court of justice, the applicant initiated a second set of judicial administrative proceedings (recurso contencioso-administrativo), contesting the amount of the requested payment and asking for a suspension of its obligation to pay that amount. on 20 november 1996 the application to suspend its obligation to pay was rejected. that decision was confirmed by the madrid high court of justice and the supreme court on 11 july 1997 and 23 february 2001 respectively. on 6 march 1998 both sets of judicial administrative proceedings were joined. on 9 december 2004 the madrid high court of justice ruled against the applicant, on the grounds that the repairs had been carried out by the municipality in view of the poor condition of the wall and the “serious risk of harm” present at that time, which had given the municipality no other choice but to repair it and then ask the applicant for payment in respect of the costs incurred. the madrid high court of justice also confirmed the amount set for the costs of the repairs. on 3 march 2005 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the supreme court, which was declared inadmissible more than four years later on 29 may 2009. this decision was served on the applicant on 9 june 2009. on 10 december 2009 the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the constitutional court. on 31 january 2010 the community of owners agreed to authorise mr. garcía caballero to act on its behalf in the framework of the judicial proceedings concerning the costs of the repairs to the wall. by a decision of 28 april 2010 the constitutional court declared the amparo appeal inadmissible on the grounds that “the constitutional significance of the appeal had not been justified”. this decision was served on the applicant on 6 may 2010.
during the period from the end of september 2006 to the end of january 2007 identity checks of georgian nationals residing in russia were carried out in the streets, markets and other workplaces and at their homes. many were subsequently arrested and taken to police stations. on 5 october 2006 the kuzminskiy district court of moscow fined the applicant (rub 1,000) for failure to observe the applicable registration procedure and ordered his administrative expulsion from the russian federation. he was subsequently, around midday, released. the applicant entered the territory of the russian federation on 12 august 2006 on a multiple entry business visa. subsequently the applicant was transferred to a detention centre for aliens. the court fined the applicant (rub 1,000), ordered her detention and her expulsion. on 11 october 2006 the applicant was apprehended by police officers for an inspection of her identity documents and was brought to the vykhino police station in moscow, where she was subsequently detained. on 13 october 2006 the applicant was transferred to the centre for temporary detention of aliens no. 2, where she was detained until her expulsion. on 18 october 2006 the applicant left the russian federation by her own means. he worked as an engineer, had a visa valid until 28 october 2006 and a registration certificate, issued by a private agency, valid until the same day. the applicants had lived in the russian federation since 1993, most recently in moscow. the second applicant had a visa valid from 30 june 2006 until 19 june 2007. he had a visa valid until 30 august 2007 and a registration certificate that had expired on 18 september 2006. 1, where he was detained until his expulsion. on 28 october 2006 the applicant was brought by bus to demododova airport and was flown to georgia. the applicant had lived in moscow since 1997. on 27 september 2006 she was apprehended by police officers in a grocery store, and, after her identity papers had been checked and an administrative report had been drawn up, the applicant was released. in addition the court ordered her detention and subsequent expulsion. (h)  kakha tsihistavi (born on 24 february 1983) 24. (i)  koba norakidze (born on 17 april 1969) 25. on 6 october 2006 the litkarinskiy town court of moscow region discontinued proceedings against the applicant for not observing the applicable registration procedure. on 23 october 2006 the kuzminskiy district court of moscow fined the applicant (rub 1,000) for not observing the applicable registration procedure. the court also ordered his expulsion from the russian federation. the applicant arrived in the russian federation in 1993 for the first time. for the relevant time the applicant had a visa and registration, valid until respectively 8 october 2006 and 28 february 2007. the exact circumstances and dates of the applicant’s arrest, detention, court decision and expulsion are matters of contention (see paragraphs 67-70 below). on 17 october 2006 the applicant was taken to a military airport and was flown to georgia with a cargo plane. the conditions of detention in the different places of detention are a matter of contention (see paragraphs 111-112 below).
on 26 march 2004 the applicant acquired an apartment in housing cooperative (“borettslag”) x. at her request, on 29 march 2004 its governing board (hereinafter “the board”) approved the applicant’s acquisition. on 2 september 2008, the board held a meeting. on 14 april 2009, attorney k. sent to the applicant on behalf of the housing cooperative a letter ordering her to sell her part (salgspålegg) in accordance with section 5-22 of the housing cooperative act 2003 (burettslagslova, see paragraph 75 below). and told him that ‘he ought to watch out’ and ‘that he would keep an eye on him’. this statement was in the circumstances frightening to mrs [t.l.b.]. mr a did not lodge an appeal against his above conviction and sentence which thus became final. in an additional indictment of 14 april 2008, mr a was charged under the same provision as follows:
“at around 18h15 on saturday, 12 january 2008, in the staircase of the garage building of z street 14c, oslo, he hit and/or pushed mr d.h. the city court sentenced mr a to eighteen days’ imprisonment. she had previously moved from the previous cooperative y to cooperative x and had left old disputes behind her. the situation had evolved over time and she ought to be entitled to admit mr a in her household. the most recent offence dated from january 2008. this did not exclude that a request for an eviction order be made subsequently. nor was there anything to indicate that attorney k. had exceeded the powers conferred on him by the board. the condition for requiring sale was that the owner of the part in question had “substantially defaulted” his or her obligations (“misheld pliktene sine vesentleg”). both the board’s approval and her confirmation had dated approximately six years back in time and it was only at present that she for the first time had alleged that the housing cooperative had forced her to make the said declaration by threatening to take unlawful action. whether and to what extent any outsiders had acted unlawfully was not for the city court to consider in the present case. the episodes in the 2006 judgment had occurred on 29 and 30 july, 12 september and 13 november 2005. this he did in a manner which was so aggressive as to make people anxious of the possibility of further and more serious violence being perpetrated. and her children, for the period from 3 may 2007 to 3 may 2008;
- mr h.f., from 22 february to 22 august 2008; and
- mr j.-e.s., considering the circumstances of the case as a whole, the city court found that by reason of her admission of mr a as a member of her household and of his conduct over a longer period, the applicant had substantially defaulted on her obligations as a part owner. for this reason, the issuing of a warning before compulsory sale had not been a requirement. it found it established that her obligations as a part owner had been seriously defaulted, in any event since 2005. despite her own confirmation that she moved in alone, the applicant had let her son live in the apartment with all the problems this had caused to other occupants. this was his second conviction for offences committed against neighbours while the first had concerned offences committed in 2005. by a decision of 5 august 2010 the high court rejected her appeal. more than this could not be required, bearing in mind especially the long historical background to the case. he had repeatedly levelled new accusations and more or less veiled threats against these persons and had in part made very serious and degrading remarks and descriptions. having reached this conclusion, the high court found it unnecessary to examine whether mr a’s moving into the applicant’s flat contrary to the declaration made on her behalf by attorney b on 26 may 2004 amounted to serious default in the sense of the housing cooperative act. on 10 march 2015, the government forwarded a copy of a handwritten note, dated 10 february 2015, by which the applicant instructed her then lawyer mr mørk to withdraw her application immediately.
the first applicant, mr j. maxian, was born in 1949. the second applicant, ms i. maxianová, was born in 1965. they are spouses and live in vienna, austria. the applicants have lodged thirteen applications with this court already, most of which concerned their involvement in a convoluted cluster of litigation relating to a suite of real properties. a number of those sets of proceedings were interrelated and were often stayed pending the outcome of another set of proceedings concerning related matters. the applicants believed that they had had ownership rights in respect of a property which they had rented out to individuals for payment. during the main proceedings, the applicants were involved in two other separate sets of auxiliary proceedings held before the same court (see paragraphs 18 to 21). owing to a dispute over the aforesaid real property in the context of these two sets of auxiliary proceedings, the main proceedings were stayed on two occasions. on 16 may 2005 the district court issued a payment order which was challenged by the defendants. subsequently, the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law to no avail. between 9 september and 1 december 2008 the district court monitored the first set of auxiliary proceedings and once those were finalised it resumed the main proceedings on 20 march 2009. the district court then dealt with the applicants’ applications to modify the claim, it ordered the taking of expert evidence, scheduled a number of hearings, and traced the defendants’ whereabouts in order to serve the court documents on them since they were continually changing address. on 17 september 2012 the district court stayed the proceedings for the second time pending the outcome of the second set of auxiliary proceedings (see paragraph 21). the applicants appealed this decision unsuccessfully and the decision on staying the main proceedings became final on 16 january 2014. the main proceedings have not been resumed since their interruption. however, the district court has regularly monitored their state. the applicants complained before the constitutional court about the length of the main proceedings on two occasions. i. ús 291/2010) rejected their first complaint as manifestly ill-founded on the grounds that the proceedings had been stayed between 2006 and 2009 pending the outcome of the first set of auxiliary proceedings. it also found that the applicants had contributed to the delays by making five applications to modify the particulars of their claim. on 4 june 2014 the constitutional court (file no. i. ús 267/2014) rejected the applicants’ second complaint as manifestly ill-founded. it noted that the district court had been obliged to find the defendants’ address. it found only a short period of inactivity in the district court’s procedure amounting to four months, which in itself did not breach the applicants’ right to a hearing within a reasonable time. it also noted that they had failed to raise some of their arguments about the alleged unfairness and the lack of reasoning before the lower courts, in particular before the appellate court. the judgment dismissing that claim became final on 10 november 2008. they also introduced an application in respect of the length of proceedings with this court (no. the second set of auxiliary proceedings commenced on 14 march 2011 and once again related to a dispute over the validity of the purchase agreement concerning the aforesaid real property (file no. 10c 62/2011) by way of a constitutional complaint, relying on article 6 § 1 of the convention and article 48 § 1 of the constitution. the constitutional court declared their complaint admissible on 11 february 2016. the court has received no further information about the outcome of these constitutional proceedings.
during the period from the end of september 2006 to the end of january 2007 identity checks of georgian nationals residing in russia were carried out in the streets, markets and other workplaces and at their homes. many were subsequently arrested and taken to police stations. after a period of custody in police stations, they were grouped together and taken by bus to a court, which summarily imposed administrative penalties on them and gave decisions ordering their administrative expulsion from russian territory. subsequently, after sometimes undergoing a medical visit and a blood test, they were taken to detention centres for foreigners where they were detained for varying periods of time, taken by bus to airports in moscow, and expelled to georgia by aeroplane. ( together they had lived in st petersburg since 2004. in may 2006 the applicant returned to georgia because her visa had expired. at about 8.50 p.m. on 3 october 2006 mr togonidze was arrested by police officers in st petersburg and placed in detention. the court also fined the applicant in the amount of rub 1,500. upon his arrival he was examined by a medical officer, who found that mr togonidze did not show any health problems preventing him from being placed in the reception centre. mr togonidze informed the medical staff that he suffered from asthma attacks and was subsequently placed together with another georgian detainee who suffered from asthma in a cell measuring between 35 and 40 m2 with 25 to 30 other georgian nationals. on 13 october 2006 mr togonidze was suffering from nausea and a headache and asked for medical assistance. subsequently a medical officer checked his blood pressure and temperature, which was slightly raised. prior to entering the bus the detainees and their belongings were searched. on the way to the airport the bus stopped five times to let people, allegedly for a bribe, use the toilet and purchase food. exiting the bus was closely monitored by the accompanying police officers. on the way to the terminal mr togonidze collapsed after walking a few steps and died. in addition blood and urine samples were taken and sent for forensic chemical examination. based on these findings the bureau of forensic medical examination of the moscow health department finally concluded that mr togonidze had died of methadone poisoning. on 8 november 2006 the decision not to initiate criminal proceedings of 19 october 2006 was quashed and the case file was forwarded for additional examination. it held that thus far the deterioration of mr togonidze’s health during the bus ride had not sufficiently been examined and that relevant officials had not been interviewed. on 20 december 2006 a criminal investigation was initiated against an unknown person for selling methadone to mr togonidze at an unknown date and unknown location. on 8 august 2007 the criminal proceedings were dismissed and on 9 august 2007 the dismissal was quashed again, as the instructions of 30 july 2007 had not been fulfilled. on 14 august 2007 the criminal proceedings were dismissed again and the dismissal was quashed on 11 december 2007. a subsequent request to quash the dismissal was denied on 14 february 2008 and confirmed on 1 september 2010. based on the documents provided by the government, and in particular on the autopsy report and the report of the forensic chemical examination, the applicant submitted her own medical report regarding her husband’s death. the experts pointed out that the russian authorities gave the cause of death as methadone intoxication based on the fact that methadone was detected in the blood and urine of mr togonidze and that he had three injection marks on his body. they further indicated that methadone is usually taken in liquid form and only very uncommonly by injection. being a sedative, people dying from methadone intoxication typically do so after a period of unconsciousness. the deterioration of his health, however, would have been noticeable, as he would have been unwell and showed signs such as wheezing and coughing. a timely hospitalisation and antibiotic treatment would have been the correct course of action.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in sumgayit. on 6 march 2010 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of possession of narcotic substances. during the search, narcotic substances were found on his person. the applicant did not appeal against that decision. on 10 march 2010 the applicant met his lawyer for the first time when he was brought before the sumgayit city court. he also asked the investigator to question the applicant and organise a formal face-to-face confrontation between the applicant and the other co-accused in his presence. following a conversation between the applicant and agents from the ombudsman’s office in a temporary detention centre, on 22 april 2010 the ombudsman requested that the prosecutor general’s office carry out a forensic examination of the applicant and conduct an effective investigation into his allegation of ill-treatment. by a letter of 7 may 2010, the prosecutor general’s office informed the lawyer that the complaint submitted by the ombudsman concerning the applicant’s alleged ill-treatment by the police would be examined, and he would be informed of its outcome. he concluded that the injury had been caused by a hard blunt object, and could have been inflicted on 6 march 2010. the expert stated that the severity of the injury had not been determined, because it was not an injury causing harm to health. he also claimed that, although numerous injuries were still visible on the applicant’s body, the expert had noted only one injury in his report. on 26 may 2010 the investigator granted the request and ordered a new forensic examination of the applicant. he held that it had not been established that the applicant had been beaten by the police officers, or that the injury found on his left wrist joint had been caused by them while he was in police custody. on 5 july 2010 the sumgayit city prosecutor lodged an objection against the sumgayit city court’s decision of 25 june 2010. during the examination the applicant stated that he had been tortured in police custody, and gave a detailed description of his ill-treatment. in particular, he stated that on 6 and 7 march 2010 police officers x., s. and m. had tortured him with truncheons, a device which gave electric shocks and cigarette burns. as to the fact of the applicant’s ill-treatment, the appellate court held that this was supported by the expert reports of 11 may and 21 july 2010, which confirmed the existence of various injuries on his body. he complained, in particular, that the prosecuting authorities had unlawfully refused to investigate the applicant’s ill-treatment, despite the explicit acknowledgment of the fact of the ill-treatment by the relevant court decisions. the appellate court’s reasoning was essentially the same as that in the first-instance court’s decision. on 3 june 2010 the sumgayit city court again extended the applicant’s detention for a period of one month. the court granted the prosecutor’s application. under domestic law, a decision taken at a preliminary hearing was not open to appeal. on 16 august 2010 the sumgayit city court dismissed the application, finding that there was no basis for such an extension. on 23 august 2010 the sumgayit court of appeal dismissed the prosecutor’s objection and upheld the first-instance court’s decision. the applicant was released from detention. on the same day the applicant lodged a request with the investigator, asking for unlawfully obtained evidence to be removed from the case file and the criminal proceedings against him to be discontinued. in the meantime, following the applicant’s release from detention, on 25 august 2010 the investigator in charge had issued a decision placing the applicant under police supervision (polisin nəzarəti altına vermə). the decision did not detail the duration of that preventive measure. according to the applicant, his placement under police supervision lasted approximately five or six months, during which time he was obliged to report to the police twice a week and not leave the city where he resided. at the end of this period, although he was no longer required to report to the police, he was not provided with any official decision confirming the end of his placement under police supervision.
the applicant was born in 1968 and is serving a prison sentence in samara. according to the government, on 6 december 2004 the samara regional court authorised the tapping of the applicant’s mobile telephone. they recorded five audio tapes and on 13 january 2005 forwarded them to the investigator. on 26 december 2004 the applicant was arrested during an attempted car-jacking. the applicant was then taken to a police station where the beatings continued. on an unspecified date the applicant retained legal counsel. the investigator ordered the applicant to have a medical examination. on 27 february 2006 the samara regional court fixed the trial for 13 march 2006. the court order in question of 6 december 2004 was not in the case file, which contained only a certificate confirming the taking of that decision by the regional court. as regards the interception of the defendants’ mobile telephone calls, the court noted as follows:
“it is clear from the material in the case file that the regional court authorised the interception of the [defendants’] telephone communications ...

the facts of the applications, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. the first applicant was born in 1967 and lives in perm. on 6 may 2003 the first applicant was stopped by a customs officer at a moscow international airport and found to be in possession of 10,200 euros (eur) and 8,755 us dollars[1] (usd) which he failed to report on his customs declaration. on 4 december 2003 the golovinskiy district court in moscow convicted the first applicant of smuggling and issued a confiscation order in respect of the foreign currency he had carried on him. on 5 february 2004 the moscow city court upheld the judgment on appeal. further to an application from a deputy moscow prosecutor, on 5 december 2008 the presidium of the moscow city court amended the judgment. noting that there was no evidence that the confiscated currency had been the instrument of a crime or had been criminally acquired, it cancelled the confiscation order and ordered the confiscated money to be refunded to the first applicant. on 3 june 2009 the amount of 628,750 russian roubles (rub)[2] was credited into the first applicant’s bank account. the first applicant sued the ministry of finance, seeking to recover the interest accrued on the retained amount during the period from 6 may 2003 to 3 june 2009, which he assessed at rub 458,777. on 25 august 2009 the tverskoy district court in moscow granted his claim in part. it awarded the first applicant rub 11,719.20[3] in respect of the period from 2 april 2009 when his representative had submitted the bank details to the ministry of finance until 3 june 2009 when the transfer had been made. the district court did not say anything about the part of the claim concerning the previous six-year period. the second and third applicants were born in 1967 and 1971 respectively and live in graz, austria. on 11 october 2004 the customs officer at a moscow international airport stopped the second and third applicants as they were carrying eur 14,600 and 14,980 euros in cash, respectively, which they had not reported on their customs declarations. on 14 and 16 february 2006 the golovinskiy district court in moscow found the second and third applicants guilty as charged and issued confiscation orders. on 10 april 2006 the moscow city court upheld the conviction on appeal. on an application from a deputy moscow prosecutor, on 26 august 2011 the presidium of the moscow city court amended the judgments in respect of the second and third applicants. noting that there was no evidence that the confiscated currency had been the instrument of a crime or had been criminally acquired, it cancelled the confiscation orders and ordered to refund rub 526,471.62 to ms sumann and rub 540,174.30 to mr sumann.[4]
the applicant was born in 1971 and lives in dębowa kłoda. in 1997 the applicant married r. in 2004 r. underwent infertility treatment so she could conceive a child with him. in january 2005 he moved out of the flat he had lived in with r. 8. on 25 september 2006 the applicant filed a petition for divorce. at first he requested a no-fault divorce. he admitted that he had moved out of the matrimonial home, but did not mention his involvement with a new partner. at a hearing held on 15 november 2006 the applicant refused to undergo the mediation process provided for by divorce law. r. did not agree to a divorce, declared that she loved the applicant and asked the court to dismiss the divorce petition. subsequently, the applicant requested a divorce on fault‑based grounds. during the proceedings thirteen witnesses were heard. most of them were of the opinion that the marriage seemed happy until autumn 2004. only the applicant’s mother, his two colleagues and his cousin recalled minor arguments between the spouses. on 17 february 2009 the lublin regional court refused to grant the divorce to the applicant. the court held that he was the only person responsible for the breakdown of his marriage because he had failed to respect the obligation of fidelity. the court did not find it credible that problems had already begun within the first year of the marriage. it observed that until 2004 the applicant had not wanted children. for that reason r. had undergone surgery, the operation having taken place in august 2004. he had no longer wished to have a child with his wife. the respondent had been shocked by the applicant’s unfaithfulness and had been treated for depression since autumn 2004. the court acknowledged that there had indeed been “a complete and irretrievable marriage breakdown” within the meaning of article 56 § 1 of the family and guardianship code. reconciliation was unlikely as the applicant had consistently rejected all attempts made by r. to reconcile their differences. moreover, he had been in a relationship with a.h. for almost four years and had a child with her. there was no indication that when refusing to give her consent r. had acted out of hatred, was motivated by vengeance, or simply wanted to vex the applicant. the court emphasised that she had repeatedly stated during the proceedings that she was ready to reconcile with him despite the fact that he had a child with another woman. the applicant appealed against the judgment. he argued, inter alia, that the court had erred in holding that a spouse’s refusal to consent to a divorce could be disregarded only when it was of an abusive nature or was dictated by hostility towards the spouse seeking the divorce. the court should have examined the negative social consequences caused by continuing the formal existence of failed marriages. the applicant did not request to be served with the written grounds for the appellate judgment. the judgment was final, a cassation appeal against a divorce judgment not being available in law.
the applicants are owners or co-owners of residential buildings which comprise flats that were or still are subject to rent control. they obtained ownership of the flats by various means, such as restitution, donation, inheritance or purchase. under the relevant legislation they had to accept that the flats were occupied by tenants with a regulated rent and that they could charge them no more than the maximum amount of rent fixed by the state. the relevant legislation precluded them from unilaterally terminating the leases, or selling the flats other than to the tenants (“the rent‑control scheme”). the particulars of the flats affected by the rent‑control scheme are set out in appendixes 2‑5 (columns a‑f). the situation of the applicants is structurally and contextually the same as in bittó and others v. slovakia (no. 30255/09, 28 january 2014 (merits) and 7 july 2015 (just satisfaction) and three subsequently decided cases concerning the rent control‑scheme in slovakia (krahulec v. slovakia, no. 19294/07; bukovčanová and others v. slovakia, no. it is in dispute between the parties in the present case what amount of rent the applicants would be able to receive by letting their flats under free‑market conditions. by extension, that disagreement translates into an argument over the proportion of the market rent that the regulated rent represents. in that connection, the government submitted an expert’s opinion drawn up in 2010 in relation to all four applications (“the government’s expert opinion”), according to which the monthly free-market rent for flats comparable to the applicants’ was between 6.13 and 6.48 euro (eur) per sq. m in the municipality of bratislava-staré mesto and eur 5.05 and 5.35 per sq. m in the municipality of bratislava-nivy. the regulated rent in the flats owned by the applicants ranged between eur 0.80 and 1.7 per sq. m. according to those calculations therefore, the regulated rent of the flats possessed by the applicants corresponded to some 14-26% of the market rent in 2010. the relevant data are set out in appendixes 2‑5 (columns g‑i). the applicants for their part relied on different sources of information to support their contention that the regulated rent was disproportionately low compared with similar flats to which the rent-control scheme did not apply. the data submitted by them are set out below separately in relation to each application. the applicants maintained that in 2007 the regulated rent ranged between eur 76 and 84 a month whereas the average free-market rent for comparable flats in a similar location was eur 956 a month. they submitted an expert’s opinion which showed that the difference between the general rental value of the property and the regulated rent they actually received was eur 88,431.53 for the period between 2000 and 2011. the applicants submitted that in 2010 the regulated rent for their flats amounted to eur 95 and 105 a month, whereas the monthly free-market rent for comparable flats was eur 616. they relied on data from the national association of real estate agencies (“the narea”). depending on the period and the relevant law in force, the regulated rent represented some 5-13% of the market rent for comparable flats in the area. they further submitted that the sum which they and the other co‑owners had invested in repairing the building was ten times the income they obtained from letting the flats under the rent‑control scheme. in 2008 the applicant was allowed to charge a monthly rent of eur 40 to 60 for each of his flats. he submitted that the market rent in the same area in 2005 was between eur 305 and eur 366 a month for the single-room flat and between eur 396 and eur 488 a month for the two-room flats. he relied on information about average rental prices published in the press. the applicants submitted that the regulated rent for their flats ranged between eur 38.5 and 104 a month in 2010. relying on data from the narea, they maintained that the market rent for comparable flats in the area amounted to approximately eur 616 a month.
the applicant was born in 1980 in tetovo and lives in golema rečica in the municipality of tetovo in “the former yugoslav republic of macedonia”. he arrived in switzerland in 1989 via family reunification and was granted a permanent residence permit. after leaving school, the applicant did not undergo professional training, but worked in a variety of jobs, namely as a postman, mailman, plasterer and construction worker, with brief periods of unemployment. on 13 march 2003 the zurich district court convicted the applicant of embezzlement for having sold a rental car to a third person in september 2000 and gave him a suspended sentence of three months’ imprisonment. on 4 october 2000, while he was engaged in a car race on a public road with an acquaintance, the applicant, driving at a speed of at least 170 kilometres per hour, lost control of his car and crashed into a lamppost, which caused the death of his passenger. that court took the view that the applicant, by agreeing to engage in the race, had deliberately taken the risk of killing him. it found that the applicant had acted with a high degree of recklessness and sentenced him to five years and three months’ imprisonment. on 25 april 2006 the applicant started serving his sentence. on 30 september 2007 the hinwil district office (statthalteramt) sentenced the applicant to a fine of 120 swiss francs (chf) for the purchase and consumption of marihuana. on 28 october 2009 the applicant was released on parole after having served two thirds of his sentence. it found that the conditions for revocation pursuant to, inter alia, article 63 § 1 lit. b of the federal act on foreign nationals (ausländergesetz, aug, see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 27 below) were met. after considering the circumstances of the case, it concluded that the public interest in the applicant’s removal outweighed his interest in enjoying his family life with his wife and children in switzerland. it ordered his expulsion pursuant to article 66 § 1 of the federal act on foreign nationals. on 10 february 2010 the administrative court of the canton of zurich dismissed the applicant’s appeal lodged on 20 october 2009. it concluded that the decision to revoke his permanent residence permit was proportionate. moreover, the court noted that the applicant’s wife was a national of “the former yugoslav republic of macedonia” as well, knew albanian and the country’s culture, and was not well integrated in switzerland either. on 27 july 2010 the federal supreme court dismissed the appeal. it considered that the main criminal offence, of which the applicant was convicted, intentional homicide, was a particularly serious one. while it acknowledged that he had lived in switzerland for over twenty years, which had thus become the centre of his life, it found that he was neither professionally nor socially integrated. it considered that he had no stable employment, but considerable debts. both he and his wife and children had benefitted significantly from social welfare. she knew albanian and visited the country annually on holiday. at the same time, she was not well integrated in switzerland as she did not undergo any professional training after leaving school, had received social welfare as from 2005 and only started to work in 2010. as far as their children were concerned, the court considered that they attended primary school and kindergarten, respectively, and were still of an adaptable age. on 16 october 2010 the applicant left switzerland in compliance with the expulsion order. on 14 may 2013 the federal administrative court, on the applicant’s appeal, reduced the duration of the re-entry ban to seven years due to proportionality considerations. it found that the conditions in article 67 §§ 2 lit. it considered that the offence committed by the applicant was particularly serious and that he continued to be a serious threat to public order, notwithstanding his mostly good behaviour since the commission of the offence and positive personality development. in august 2015, i.e. after almost four years, the applicant’s wife and children returned to switzerland to avoid the expiry of their permanent residence permit pursuant to article 61 § 2 of the federal act on foreign nationals (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 27) and because their socioeconomic living conditions in “the former yugoslav republic of macedonia” were difficult.
the applicant was born in 1980 and lives in the kyiv region. on 15 august 2006 the applicant got involved in a drunken brawl with a stranger and beat him to death. the date of his arrest cannot be established with certainty. according to the applicant, he was arrested on 20 august 2006. an internal police inquiry established the date as 22 august. the official arrest record gives the time and date of his arrest as 6.45 p.m. on 24 august. on 25 august 2006 the sovetskiy district court in omsk remanded the applicant in custody. on the same day he was seen by a medical expert who noted two abrasions on his forehead that could have been caused by a solid blunt object four to six days prior to the examination. on 28 december 2006 the applicant was convicted of murder and sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment in a high-security facility. on 21 january 2007 the applicant asked the prosecutor to investigate his allegation that police officers had beaten him up after his arrest. on 11 march 2008 the prosecutor refused institution of criminal proceedings. on the following day the decision was quashed and an additional inquiry was ordered. since then the investigative authorities and courts issued and subsequently quashed at least eight decisions to open criminal proceedings into the alleged ill-treatment. referring to the statements from three police officers and from the investigator all of whom denied any ill-treatment or intimidation, the decision of 31 december 2009 concluded that the applicant’s allegations were unsubstantiated because the expert had determined his injuries to have been caused no later than 21 august, that is to say, three days prior to his arrest. on 28 july 2015 the prosecutor of the sovetskiy district in omsk annulled the decision of 31 december 2009 and ordered an additional inquiry which should establish whether or not the applicant had been brought to the police station already on 20 august 2006 and whether or not the specific police officer described by the applicant had been on duty on that day. between 26 february 2007 and 30 october 2009 the applicant served the sentence in ik-9, a correctional institution in omsk. the dormitory was crammed and in a poor state of repair. on the latter date the applicant was transferred to ik-3 where he stayed until 26 march 2010. the dormitories in which the applicant slept were overcrowded, affording at times no more than 1.5-1.7 sq. the access of natural light was restricted by plastic film covering the windows. the toilets, located in a separate building, were equipped with 7 pans for 600 detainees. on 26 march 2010 the applicant was transferred to liu-2, a medical facility, where he appears to have stayed until the end of his sentence on 23 august 2015. the premises of the facility were overcrowded and afforded no more than 1.8 sq.
the applicant was born in 1953 and lives in krosno. from 29 april 1997 to 29 april 1999 he was employed by a polish company which was carrying out construction work in germany. the polish workers were employed on the basis of the international agreement signed on 31 january 1990 between poland and germany on the secondment of workers of polish companies to carry out construction work (umowa między rządem rzeczypospolitej polskiej a rządem republiki federalnej niemiec o oddelegowaniu pracowników polskich przedsiębiorstw do realizacji umów o dzieło z 31 stycznia 1990 r., dz.u. on 16 july 1999 the applicant lodged a civil claim against his former employer for payment. instead polish labour law was applicable. in so far as the applicant relied on the provisions of the international agreement of 1990 (see paragraph 6 above) and argued that it should serve as the basis for setting his rate of pay, the court observed that this agreement was of a public-law character. in the applicant’s opinion, the court’s finding that the applicant’s rates of pay were fixed in his employment contract was erroneous, because that contract did not contain any rates (only symbols which were not understood by the applicant). besides, in his view, the court had violated the provisions of the above‑mentioned international agreement, according to which the rates of the applicant’s pay should be comparable to those received by the german workers occupying the same positions. the court of appeal comprised three judges. he was not a judge rapporteur and he did not preside. it noted that a partial judgment could be delivered only when a part or some of the claims in a lawsuit had been sufficiently clarified for the decision. this part of the court’s reasoning read as follows:
“as to the substantive grounds for the court’s legal view expressed in the judgment under appeal, it should be stated that it finds support in the content of the agreement between the governments of the republic of poland and the federal republic of germany on the secondment of workers of polish companies to carry out construction work (journal of laws 1998/84, items 474 and 475) as well as in the hitherto interpretation of this agreement in judicial decisions (see, e.g., iii a pa 29/00 wrocław court of appeal, decision of 31 may 2000).” on 10 december 2002 the applicant challenged one of the judges, alleging his partiality. on 20 march 2003 the wrocław court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s request. on 16 january 2004 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, finding no grounds for the judges of the opole regional court to step down. on 25 november 2004 the wrocław court of appeal dismissed the appeal. the court accepted the reasoning of the first-instance court. on 29 november 2005 the supreme court examined the cassation appeal, quashed the challenged judgment and remitted the case to the court of appeal. the supreme court considered that the polish-german agreement of 1990 was not a source of universally binding law and did not contain provisions applicable to labour relations. moreover, poland’s accession to the european union did not have an impact on the applicability of that agreement. furthermore, the european union law did not apply retroactively to situations predating poland’s accession. the court reiterated that the applicant was entitled to the rates of pay fixed in his employment contract. on 28 march 2007 the applicant lodged a further cassation appeal with the supreme court. he averred that the opole regional court had disregarded the provisions of the labour code. it was further argued that the court had failed to take into consideration the evidence gathered in the case. the court had also erred when refusing to allow certain requests for evidence to be taken. he sat on the bench of the supreme court. the supreme court stressed that in his cassation appeal the applicant raised the same complaint which had already been made in his earlier cassation appeal. additionally, the supreme court noted that the interpretation made by the lower courts of the applicant’s contract of employment, seen as a whole, had taken into account the applicant’s employer’s declarations submitted to the german authorities and also a wealth of other evidence in so far as it had been relevant for the determination of the applicant’s working conditions and remuneration. in so far as the applicant complained in his cassation appeal of the alleged failure of the courts to take further evidence and of the assessment of the evidence they had carried out, those complaints could not be examined in the context of those proceedings.
the applicant was born in 1988 in margilan, uzbekistan. on 5 september 2014 the applicant was charged in absentia with participation in the extremist religious movement hizb ut-tahrir al islami and activities threatening the constitutional order. on the same day the authorities ordered his pre-trial detention and issued an international search and arrest warrant bearing his name. on 24 december 2014 the applicant was arrested in moscow. on 26 december 2014 the cheremushkinskiy district court of moscow ordered and subsequently prolonged his detention. on 22 january 2015 the applicant was further charged with organising a local branch of hizb ut-tahri al islami in one of the regions of uzbekistan. on 23 january 2015 the uzbek prosecution authorities requested the applicant’s extradition on the above charges. the request included assurances regarding the proper treatment of the applicant, which were formulated in standard terms. on 21 may 2015 the applicant’s extradition in respect of certain charges was authorised by the deputy prosecutor general of the russian federation. the applicant challenged this decision in the courts, arguing that he belonged to a vulnerable group and therefore faced a real risk of treatment contrary to article 3 at the hands of the uzbek authorities. on 13 october 2015 his appeals were dismissed by a final decision of the supreme court of the russian federation. without reference to any relevant evidentiary material, the supreme court considered that the applicant’s claims were hypothetical and lacked specific indications regarding the level of risk, and observed that the situation in a requesting state might change over time. it also found that the assurances of the uzbek authorities were satisfactory. on 5 june 2015 the applicant lodged a request for refugee status, referring to persecution in uzbekistan on religious grounds. on 9 november 2015 his request was refused by a final administrative decision of the migration authorities. the applicant challenged this decision in the courts, referring inter alia to the risk of ill‑treatment. on 18 may 2016 his appeals were dismissed by a decision of moscow city court. on 25 december 2015 the meshchanskiy district court of moscow ordered the applicant’s expulsion for violating the migration rules. the applicant’s appeal, which referred to the risk of ill-treatment, amongst other factors, was dismissed by the moscow city court on 24 february 2016. on 16 february 2016 the applicant applied for temporary asylum. no information concerning the outcome of these proceedings was supplied by the parties.
the applicants were born in 1961, 1963 and 1966 respectively and live in the town of taganrog. on 2 july 2001 the neklinovskiy district court of the rostov region found the applicants guilty of various offences but declared that they need not serve their respective sentences because the case was time-barred. on 2 october 2001 the rostov regional court upheld the judgment on appeal. on 31 january 2002 the presidium of the rostov regional court quashed by way of supervisory review the decisions of 2 july and 2 october 2001 and discontinued criminal proceedings against the applicants. it found that the courts had not been in a position to decide on the applicants’ guilt because the whole case had been time-barred. the applicants sued the ministry of finance of the russian federation for, among other things, compensation in respect of non‑pecuniary damage in connection with their prosecution. in its judgment of 1 march 2005 the taganrog town court of the rostov region rejected their claims. it reasoned as follows:
“... the court finds that, since the applicants’ guilt of the commission of the above‑mentioned crimes was established, the use of the measure of restraint was justified. this being so, the court has no reason to grant the applicants’ claims for compensation in respect of the non-pecuniary damage resulting from their unlawful detention and the obligation not to leave their usual place of residence. ...” on 11 may 2005 the rostov regional court upheld the judgment of 1 march 2005 on appeal. it stated that:
“ ... the first instance court, in reaching its decision refusing to grant the applicants’ claims for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage, correctly assumed that the decision of the presidium of the rostov regional court dated 31 january 2002 cleared them of liability on non-exonerating grounds. in the court’s view, since the applicants’ guilt of the commission of the above-mentioned crimes was established, the application of the measure of restraint during the investigation was justified. the court’s conclusion is a correct one, made following the examination and proper assessment of the legally relevant circumstances of the case. ...”
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in białystok. he uses sign language to communicate with other people. the last contact had occurred on 25 august 2007. in their opinion, dated 15 october 2007, the experts underlined that the emotional ties between the mother and the child were strong and natural. in its judgment the court also ruled that parental authority should be exercised by both parents and that the child should reside with the mother. for example, she refused to pass on oral messages from their son to the applicant. and that she had not obstructed those meetings. did not have any emotional ties with his father and did not need contact with him. on 4 november 2011 a court guardian submitted a report to the court. according to that report, the applicant had not been visiting his son regularly on account of his being treated for depression and other illnesses. on 30 april 2012 the rodk issued an opinion commissioned by the district court. it had been prepared by a psychologist, an education specialist and a psychiatrist who had met the parents and the child and had been assisted by an interpreter of sign language. the experts further noted that the conflict between the parents impeded their cooperation with regard to the child. the district court heard evidence from the rodk experts. on 9 august 2012 the białystok district court dismissed the applicant’s application for a change to the contact arrangements. he suffered from a hearing impairment and used a hearing aid. the child required specialised medical care and followed a rehabilitation programme. however, in consequence, his limited and irregular involvement in the child’s life had adversely influenced the emotional ties between the father and the son. the court disagreed with the applicant that the paternal grandmother could ensure proper communication between him and his son. the court noted that the neighbour was a familiar person to the child, since he had been regularly visiting the child’s family. it noted that the experts had opined that both parents required contact with a specialist who would assist them in mutually accepting each other as a parent. the mother stated that she already attended a parent support group there and the applicant declared that he could do the same. the applicant contested the lower court’s finding that the child’s paternal grandmother was a stranger to him; he argued that the child would not be exposed to stress in the event of contact without the mother’s presence and outside her home in view of the fact that the child attended nursery school and was cared by a neighbour a few times a week. lastly, the applicant contested the refusal to order a supplementary expert opinion. on 23 november 2012 the białystok regional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. it dismissed the applicant’s counteraction. having regard to the evidence, the court found that it was justifiable to restrict the applicant’s parental authority and limit it only to matters concerning the child’s education. the applicant was not to be solely blamed for this situation. it took into account the fact that the mother had already been attending a support group and found no reasons to formally oblige her to undergo therapy. it ruled that the communication barrier constituted an objective obstacle to relations between the applicant and his son and that taking it into account could not be considered to constitute a form of discrimination against the applicant.
the applicant was born in 1988 and is detained in saransk. on 3 august 2009 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of the rape of a girl, who was also a minor. on 5 august 2009 the staroshaygovskiy district court of the mordovia republic remanded him in custody. he remained in pre-trial detention pending investigation and trial on the grounds that he was accused of a serious crime, might reoffend, abscond, destroy evidence, threaten witnesses, or interfere with the investigation. on 24 december 2010 the supreme court of the mordovia republic found him guilty as charged. on 4 october 2010 the applicant, acting for himself, submitted his first letter to the court. on 4 august and 4 october 2010 he provided two powers of attorney authorising mr frimu, one of his cellmates, to represent him before the court.
the applicants were born in 1976 and 1978 respectively and live in basle. the first applicant, who was born in turkey, moved to switzerland at the age of 10. on completing a business-studies course in basle, he returned temporarily to turkey to attend classes in islamic studies; while there, he met the second applicant, who became his wife. she moved to switzerland in 1999 under the provisions for family reunion. when the present application was lodged she was on a training course to become a playgroup leader (spielgruppenleiterin). the first applicant speaks fluent swiss german. three daughters were born to the applicants, on 8 july 1999, 22 june 2001 and 7 july 2006 respectively. the present application concerns only the first two daughters. they were initially enrolled in the vogelsang primary school in basle. the eldest daughter subsequently attended an “orientation school” (orientierungsschule, between the primary and secondary levels). swimming lessons are part of the compulsory school curriculum; under the applicable legislation in the canton of basle urban, pupils cannot be exempted until they reach puberty (see paragraph 27 below). the applicants, who are devout muslims, refused to send their daughters to the swimming lessons on the grounds that their beliefs prohibited them from allowing their children to take part in mixed swimming lessons. they stated that although the koran did not instruct women to cover their bodies until puberty, their beliefs required them to prepare their daughters for the precepts that would be applied to them from that point onwards. as the holders of parental responsibility for their daughters, the applicants alleged that there been a violation of their own rights. by a letter of 13 august 2008, the public education department of the canton of basle urban (erziehungsdepartement des kantons basel-stadt) advised the applicants that under section 91 (9) of the education act of the canton of basle urban (see paragraph 24 below), they were liable to a maximum fine of 1,000 swiss francs (chf) (around 923 euros (eur)) each if their daughters did not comply with the obligation to attend school. on 30 march 2010 the head teacher of the school held a meeting with the applicants in order to resolve the situation. the applicants continued to refuse to send their daughters to the swimming lessons. by letters of 30 march and 4 may 2010, the applicants were again invited to send their daughters to the swimming lessons. on 4 may and 14 june 2010 the school authorities asked the head of the public education department to open fixed-penalty proceedings against the applicants. on 17 june 2010 the applicants were invited to comment again as part of those proceedings. by a letter of 28 july 2010, the education authorities ordered the applicants to pay a fine of chf 350 (about eur 323) per parent and per child (a total of chf 1,400 chf – about eur 1,292) for acting in breach of their parental duties (see section 91 (8) and (9) of the education act of the canton of basle urban, paragraph 24 below). drawing on its leading decision of 24 october 2008 (see federal supreme court judgment 135 i 79; paragraph 29 below), the federal supreme court, by a judgment of 7 march 2012, dismissed an appeal by the applicants, holding that the authorities’ refusal to exempt their daughters from mixed swimming lessons in primary school had not breached the applicants’ right to freedom of conscience and belief. it accepted that this refusal represented a breach of freedom of religion. it cited, firstly, section 22 of the education act of the canton of basle urban, which stated that gymnastics was one of the compulsory lessons in primary school, and section 139 of the same act, stating that at least three hours of the pupils’ weekly timetable was to be spent in physical education. it also held that, under section 17 of the act, boys and girls at primary-school level were, in principle, to attend classes together. the federal supreme court then pointed out that pupils could be exempted from lessons or from certain subjects, and any such decision was to be taken by the school authorities at the request of teachers or of persons responsible for the children’s education (section 66 (5) and (6) of the education act; see paragraph 24 below). the federal supreme court accordingly concluded that the measure had a valid legal basis. the federal supreme court also found irrelevant the applicants’ argument that their children were receiving private swimming lessons, holding that what was at stake for the children was not simply learning to swim, but also submitting to the conditions surrounding the teaching itself (äussere bedingungen des unterrichts). it held that the school’s function of social integration, valid in respect of all pupils, required that exemptions for swimming classes be granted only sparingly. for that reason, the comparison with exemptions granted for medical reasons was also irrelevant.
the applicants, dorina and viorel-aurel[2] ioniță, were born in 1976 and 1972 respectively and live in brăila. in the state-run brăila emergency hospital. after surgery the child was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit. the child suffered a haemorrhage, causing blood to flood his lungs. a team of doctors tried to resuscitate him and clear his respiratory channels, but without any success. the child was declared dead two hours after the operation. were questioned and gave written statements. on 12 october 2006 the superior commission of the mina minovici forensic institute examined all the documents and approved the conclusions of the commission for confirmation and supervision of the iaşi forensic institute. an expert medical opinion was submitted to the committee and was used by it in reaching its final conclusions. the expert noted, among other things, that the child’s preparation for surgery had not been appropriate as his examination before anaesthesia had been “very superficial”; in this respect the committee noted the lack of a radioscopy of the lungs, of an ekg and an exploration of the necessary time for blood coagulation. the committee further stated that the presence of blood in the child’s airways could not be explained on the basis of the documents and statements in the file. 46/2003, the committee also noted that the parents had not given their informed consent. they joined the criminal proceedings as civil parties. following a request of the brăila police inspectorate, on 19 july 2006 brăila emergency hospital stated that the medical staff members in charge of monitoring the child were dr p.a. on 5 january 2007 the prosecutor’s office of the brăila district court decided to institute criminal proceedings against dr p.a. during the criminal proceedings against dr p.a., in spite of the fact that she had been repeatedly summoned, the investigating authorities were not able to question her as she had not been found. she had left her job at the brăila emergency hospital in january 2006. the iaşi forensic institute replied that a new forensic report could not be produced as the evidence examined had been sent by brăila forensic service to the mina minovici national forensic institute. submitted an extrajudicial expert report. the report noted a generalised inflammatory reaction associated with diffused haemorrhages in his digestive tract, lungs, heart and spleen. the applicants gave evidence to the investigating authorities on 23 january 2008. and the investigating authorities submitted several questions for the forensic experts. copies of the documents from the disciplinary file were added to the criminal file. a complaint by the applicants against the prosecutors’ decisions was allowed by the brăila district court on 25 february 2009. did not give evidence before the court as, although summoned, she did not attend the hearings. he again contended that the doctors had not informed his family about the risks of surgery and in particular of the general anaesthetic and accordingly they had not given their informed consent. and dismissed the applicants’ civil claim as unfounded. the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against that decision. who had had the child under her supervision in the intensive care unit.
on 27 june 2005 a criminal investigation was initiated into a theft allegedly committed by the applicant in the republic of uzbekistan. on 12 september 2005 an investigator ordered the applicant’s arrest and placed him on the list of fugitives. it appears that in the meantime the applicant moved to the russian town of perm. on 21 january 2007 he was arrested there. on 23 january 2007 a prosecutor issued a decision to detain the applicant pending resolution of the extradition request in his regard. the decision referred to article 61 of the convention on legal assistance and legal relations in civil, family and criminal matters (signed in minsk on 22 january 1993 and amended on 28 march 1997, “the minsk convention”). it did not indicate that it was amenable to appeal. on 25 january 2007 the prosecutor wrote to the prison authorities asking them to hold the applicant in detention until further notice. on 19 february 2007 the uzbek authorities requested the applicant’s extradition. on 6 march 2007 the prosecutor applied to the court for authorisation of the applicant’s detention pending extradition. he again relied on article 61 of the minsk convention and articles 97‑101, 108 and 466 § 1 of the code of criminal procedure of russia (“the ccrp”). on 9 march 2007 the leninskiy district court of perm authorised the applicant’s detention pending extradition. the district court did not set a limit on the length of the applicant’s detention. on 27 march 2007 the perm regional court upheld the decision on appeal. no court subsequently reviewed or extended the applicant’s detention. it appears that on 10 july 2007 the applicant was handed over to the authorities of the republic of uzbekistan.
the applicants are the wife and daughter of mr ivan mirchev pashaliysky, who was killed on 2 june 2000 in an office situated in a hotel in sofia. he died as a result of suffering severe trauma to his brain, chest, torso and limbs, which led to irreversible damage to several of his vital organs. the trauma was caused by a number of kicks and punches and blows inflicted with different objects. on the day of the incident a private security guard was called to the office premises where mr pashaliysky was later found dead in order to investigate a brawl reportedly happening there. the security guard caught a brief glimpse of mr pashaliysky lying helpless on the floor with blood on his face. that there was no problem, the security guard left. a friend and business partner of mr pashaliysky, threatening to kill them both if ch.m. failed to deliver an undisclosed sum of money to s.v. the incident was reported to the police by an investigator, who had been tipped off earlier the same day. traces of the crime having been discovered on s.v. on 5 june 2000 a prosecutor indicted s.v. for the murder of ivan mirchev pashaliysky, which had been committed three days earlier. a prosecutor from the sofia city public prosecutor’s office found on 20 april 2001 that there were reasons for amending the indictment by applying a law providing for a heavier penalty. she also found that not all available evidence had been collected. the case file was sent to the sofia city court on an unspecified date in november 2003. both applicants were named as private prosecutors and the second applicant, at her request, also as a civil party seeking non‑pecuniary damages. a number of hearings took place during the trial. and the applicants lodged appeals with the sofia court of appeal. on 16 august 2008 the prosecution indicted s.v. pashaliysky and the first-instance court, the sofia city court, opened fresh proceedings against him. the first two scheduled hearings were postponed because the defendant’s lawyer failed to appear. on 11 february 2009 the court recognised the second applicant as a civil party seeking non-pecuniary damages but refused to name both applicants as private prosecutors. subsequently, the presiding judge was elected president of the supreme administrative court as a result of which the trial stage was started anew. a new presiding judge was appointed, yet no further hearing was scheduled for about a year. the applicants complained about the delay to the inspectorate of the supreme judicial council, asking that disciplinary sanctions be imposed on the new presiding judge. the inspectorate replied on 21 february 2012. it nonetheless held that the judge in question could not be sanctioned, given that the duration of the other cases that she had heard had not exceeded an acceptable length. on an unspecified later date the new presiding judge was sent back to the court from which she had been transferred and the case had to begin anew once again. on 9 december 2013 the proceedings before the first-instance court ended. guilty of murder and sentenced him to twelve years’ imprisonment.
the applicant was born in 1953 and lives in molodetske, in the donetsk region. from the inhabitants of the village of zolotarevka ...
we, the inhabitants of zolotarevka ... appeal to you with indignation concerning the election and performance of the deputy president of the shaktarsk district executive committee, mr g. sh. [ how can he serve the district after having destroyed all the work in zolotarevka during his four years in office? he had no formal audiences, took decisions unilaterally, and was rude and impolite. he came to work in the morning, but then hid in his illegal firms in makeyevka or in the computer centre in kharsyzk, while continuing to receive his salary and bonuses. funds were allocated for renovation of the water supply system, but he did not manage them ... all the village ... was drowning in weeds and rubbish ... no discussion about petty things, we want to know specifically why [g.sh.] [he] collected 30 hryvnias per household [for renovation of the water supply system] on sh. and p. streets, and what did he spent it on? [he] removed all the metal parts from the boiler room in the kindergarten ... ;
(3). [he] uncovered and removed 400 metres of water pipes;
(4). with his knowledge, the century-old oak trees in the forest have been felled. ’s resignation from the district council. he should be expelled from the party of regions.” this text was followed by eleven signatures, with no indication of full names. ’s performance as a party activist and an elected public official, and was joined in this by several other participants. mrs a. stated that she was one of the authors of the letter, and that she agreed with all the allegations contained in it. was given the floor and argued that the allegations against him were defamatory and lacked any evidential basis. as the purported authors of the letter had signed it without indicating their full names or address details, it should have been disposed of without any follow-up as an anonymous application within the meaning of the citizens’ applications act. also submitted that the applicant had given him a photocopy of the disputed letter before the zolotarevka meeting, and had warned him about his intention to read it out. had protested on the grounds that the text was defamatory, yet the applicant had disregarded his opinion. on 17 september 2007 the shaktarsk court declared that the applicant had been at fault in defaming g.sh., the applicant, represented by mr v. filipenko, appealed. moreover, the letter was not “anonymous”, given that mrs a. at least had claimed authorship. as regards the nature of the letter, it contained no false allegations of fact. there was also evidence in support of other factual allegations. critical assessment of those facts by some village inhabitants was not susceptible of proof and constituted reasonable value judgments on their part, for which the applicant could not be held responsible. should have been tolerant of the criticism, as it related to his performance as an elected public official. on 3 december 2007 the donetsk regional court of appeal upheld the judgment of the shaktarsk court. furthermore, the trial court had rightly concluded that the applicant had not verified the accuracy of the accusations contained in the letter as required by article 302 of the civil code of ukraine, and had therefore been liable for disseminating defamatory statements against g.sh. on 30 january 2008 the supreme court of ukraine rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal in cassation.
the applicants were born in 1984, 1988 and 1987 respectively. the third applicant left ukraine for ethiopia on 23 november 2014. according to the applicants’ representative, the second applicant died of a “natural cause”. no further details were given in this regard. the first applicant is an orthodox christian. when he was fifteen years old he was forcibly recruited to the army in eritrea. as he could have been expelled by the ethiopian authorities to eritrea, the second applicant left for djibouti in 2007. the government did not comment on those submissions. the next day the applicants were discovered by the vessel crew. the applicants were not allowed to disembark. the organisation requested leave for their lawyer, z., to meet with the applicants. she discussed their situation with them and informed them of the asylum procedures in ukraine. the discussion was in english in the presence of three border guards and two port security officers. according to the applicants, during the discussion they expressed the wish to seek asylum in ukraine and started filling in asylum applications with the help of one of the border guards who had knowledge of english. the border guards asked z. to leave the vessel. no copy of that decision was provided to the court. z. left the vessel without raising any complaints. on 28 february 2012 the applicants, allegedly having been misled by the vessel’s captain who was acting on the instructions of the ukrainian border guards, signed type-written statements in english, according to which they had boarded the vessel with the aim of reaching sweden “in search of better living conditions” and that they did not “need the status of refugee, addition[al] [or] temporary protection in ukraine”. the government submitted that the applicants themselves had asked the captain to help them to prepare the above-mentioned type-written statements. she stated that the applicants risked removal to saudi arabia, for which the vessel was scheduled to depart on 3 march 2012. on the same day the court granted the request. according to the government, it was during that meeting that the applicants requested asylum in ukraine. they were allowed to disembark and to cross the state border. on 16 march 2012 the applicants were questioned by the migration authorities concerning their asylum applications. according to the applicants, during the questioning they were not provided with adequate translation or any explanation of the relevant regulations. the third applicant did not challenge that decision on appeal. the unhcr helped him to organise the travel arrangements. the applicants’ representative did not provide any further information as regards the third applicant, as since the third applicant’s departure from ukraine the representative has lost contact with him. he appealed to the odesa administrative court. the proceedings were eventually terminated as the second applicant died on 6 march 2015.
the applicant was born in 1942 and lives in lamlash. in 1966 the applicant founded a business which was later incorporated as arakin limited (“arakin”). however, tods murray’s fees were not settled in full by arakin. the dispute gave rise to four sets of overlapping proceedings. on 4 august 1997 the taxation hearing began before the auditor. the court however refused arakin’s request to stay the case. in february 2000 arakin’s new solicitors withdrew from acting. this was dismissed as incompetent on 22 june 2001. he also renewed motions which had previously been refused. on 27 april 2007 the case was remitted to the outer house. the taxation proceeding were therefore at an end. hearings took place before the outer house between august and december 2001. on 18 january 2002 it directed that the case be heard on 13 february 2002. on that date, having regard to further allegations made by the applicant, it ordered that he lodge details of these allegations within fourteen days. this hearing lasted 15 days but was ultimately insufficient. on 21 april 2004 the inner house dismissed the application to appeal as incompetent since leave had not been obtained from the outer house. between 2004 and 2009 the amounts remained unpaid and the matter proceeded on the basis that the only issues to try were contained in the principal claim. by the time of the hearing the applicant sought over gbp sixty-two million in his counterclaim. the applicant’s position, it said, was “a great deal more complicated”. the applicant appealed against the decision. on 11 may 2011 the outer house heard both parties and fixed a hearing on the facts. it found in favour of tods murray in the principal claim and held that the applicant was liable in the sum of gbp 86,376.40. this brought to an end the substantive issues in the litigation. tods murray applied for its costs and the applicant lodged various applications. the applicant did not appear at the hearing on 22 july 2013. it was therefore a simple action for recovery of a debt. he has thereby caused the pursuer unnecessary expense...” 41. it also awarded an additional fee to tods murray to reflect the “huge amount” of correspondence and documents sent to the tods murray’s solicitors by the applicant, much of which was irrelevant, the complexity of the proceedings, having regard to the “number, difficulty and novelty of the questions raised”, the skill time, labour and specialist knowledge required of the solicitors and the accusations of deception, incompetence and bad faith levelled against individual solicitors at tods murray. he relied on four sets of proceedings, including the tods murray litigation. moreover, he had wasted time because of his disorganisation and persistent pursuit of irrelevant matters in that litigation.
the applicants were placed in menemeni police station in thessaloniki, either in pre-trial detention or serving prison sentences. at the time they submitted their application they had been detained for periods ranging from one to six months. the first six applicants were transferred to thessaloniki general detention facility on the following dates: applicant no. 4 was transferred on 11 february 2014, applicant no. the parties disputed the date on which applicant no. 1 was transferred: according to the government’s submissions, he was transferred on 18 september 2013, whereas the applicant argued that he was transferred on 3 december 2013. according to the material in the court’s possession, applicant no. 7 was still being detained in menemeni police station on 24 may 2014. 1 and 2 had measured 10 square metres and had accommodated four detainees each, while cell no. 3 had measured 6 square metres and had accommodated five detainees. the cells had been equipped with beds but had no blankets. detainees had been confined to their cells and had not been allowed to spend time outside, which had affected their psychological health. they had had to ask permission from the guards to use the restroom. recreational activities had not been offered and cells had not been equipped with televisions. the police station had not had the necessary means to transfer detainees to a hospital in case of emergency. instead of food, detainees had been offered 5.87 euros per day, which had not sufficed to cover their daily dietary needs, either in terms of quantity or quality. on 19 november 2013 the applicants had lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor, complaining of the conditions of their detention but had not received a reply. it had consisted of three cells: cell no. 1 had measured 23 square metres and had three built-in beds, cell no. 2 had measured 23.3 square metres with four built-in beds and cell no. 3 had measured 26 square metres with five beds. the capacity of the police station had never been exceeded. the government affirmed that there had been two sanitary facilities with hot water outside the cells. when the number of detainees had allowed it, drug addicts had been detained separately from the rest of the detainees. an on-call doctor had been available on a 24-hour basis in thessaloniki police headquarters (αστυνομικό μέγαρο θεσσαλονίκης). in urgent cases, inmates had been transferred to local hospitals. additionally, police staff had been responsible for administering prescribed medications to detainees, as ordered by a doctor. the government pointed out that the applicants had not referred to or adduced any evidence that they had needed medical treatment which they had not received. on the contrary, according to the police station’s records, applicants nos. 4, 5 and 7 had been taken to local hospitals on various occasions.
the applicant was born in 1970 in rafah, gaza. between 1977 and 1993 the applicant lived mainly in rafah. in 1993 the applicant went to ukraine to study. in 1998 the applicant married a ukrainian national. in january 2014 they married and currently live together as a family. the applicant visited gaza twice in 2000. since december 2000 the applicant has remained in ukraine without leaving its territory. in 2003 the applicant started preparing documents to apply for a permanent residence permit on the basis of his marriage to a ukrainian national. according to the applicant, about a week later his residence permit was extended until 15 september 2011. the government contested that submission, stating that no extension had been granted. on 16 september 2011 the applicant went to the migration unit of the chief police department in kyiv to apply for an extension of his residence permit. subsequently the applicant contacted a lawyer, who helped him to obtain copies of the decisions concerning his expulsion and to lodge an appeal against them (see paragraph 28 below). the applicant also argued that he had not been aware that subsequently, in may 2010, the police had initiated court proceedings for him to be forcibly removed from ukraine. in their written submissions made in the course of those proceedings, the police reiterated the findings in the decision of 17 march 2010 and requested the kyiv administrative court to order the applicant’s immediate forcible removal and his placement in a facility for temporary detention of foreigners and stateless persons for the period necessary to prepare the removal. in the latter regard, the police argued that there were reasons to believe that the applicant would try to remain illegally in ukraine. on 18 may 2010 the kyiv administrative court heard the case in the absence of the parties, having noted that the applicant had submitted a written statement that he did not wish to be present and that he agreed with the expulsion decision, and also that the police were not able to attend the hearing because of their high workload. on 29 november 2011 a lawyer submitted an appeal on the applicant’s behalf, together with a request for renewal of the ten-day time-limit, to the kyiv administrative court for further transfer to the kyiv administrative court of appeal. in the appeal, the applicant argued that he had been studying in ukraine between 1993 and 1999. the applicant complained that the first-instance court had failed to examine all the facts pertinent to the case and to hear him. it is unknown whether the applicant or his lawyer intended to take part in the hearing and, if so, whether they informed the court of appeal accordingly. the appeal was rejected as unsubstantiated. the decision entered into force immediately. that decision was not appealed against and became final. on 25 january 2012 the applicant lodged an asylum application with the state migration service. no copy of the decision was given to the applicant. the court also noted that the applicant had left his country of origin voluntarily for economic and personal reasons; he had had his residence permit in ukraine repeatedly extended for personal reasons; and he had requested asylum only after he had not been able to legalise his further stay in ukraine. on the whole, the court found that it had been for the applicant to provide documents or persuasive arguments demonstrating that he had run a real and personal risk of persecution, which he had failed to do. the applicant appealed in cassation, stating that the lower courts had not fully examined the material pertinent to his case, which had resulted in a wrong dismissal of his asylum request, in violation of articles 3, 8 and 13 of the convention. at the time, the applicant’s marriage had lasted for less than two years. thus, no leave to immigrate could be granted to him on that ground.
the applicants were born in 1969, 1968 and 1972 respectively and live in lanžhot (messrs. bátěk and elsner) and břeclav (mr blažej). as a result of her observations over the following two months, the customs officers were suspected of corruption, namely taking bribes from truck drivers in exchange for granting priority or trouble-free customs clearance. the undercover agent left the customs office on 6 february 2004. according to the applicants, interviews with four of the drivers were of decisive significance. the applicants, being not yet charged, were not present at these interviews. if not, the drivers had to wait for hours to be cleared. he described one customs officer as a corpulent person with thinning brown hair. testified that he had paid 5 eur on each of the ten trips he had made to pass the customs control. he was not able to describe any of the customs officers. on 22 april 2004 the applicants were charged, together with fifteen other individuals, with abuse of the authority of public official and accepting bribes. in february 2005 they were officially indicted. on 14 december 2005 the břeclav district court (okresní soud) heard the police agent as an anonymous witness (utajený svědek) under the provisions of article 55 § 2 and article 209 of the ccp. she gave her testimony outside the courtroom using an audio streaming device. the third applicant was present at the hearing. the other two applicants were absent and were represented by a substitute defence counsel. on 25 may 2006 the district court found the applicants and other accused persons guilty as charged. they were sentenced to one year’s imprisonment suspended for two years’ probation and were fined. the court further relied on customs documents stamped using the personal rubber stamps of specific customs officers, comparing these with the testimony of the truck drivers, the records of service rotations and the database linking the applicants to the times at which the interviewed truck drivers obtained their customs clearance. when it comes to counts 2 and 3 of the indictment, he is also incriminated by the witness statements of the bulgarian driver [d.] and the romanian driver [c.d.] and by a report from his former employer stating the defendant’s whereabouts at the time concerned. who submitted details of his border crossing to the authorities and notes of bribes given at a specific time and place. the district court explained that the truck drivers’ statements were read out at the hearing pursuant to article 211 § 2 b) of the ccp. the applicants appealed against the judgment. in such circumstances, and when such an agent is heard as a witness, article 55 § 2, article 183a § 4, and article 209 of the ccp would be applicable. in the instant case, the provisions of the ccp regulating the agent’s testimony were not violated and the allegations of some of the defendants that the agent had been heard as an anonymous witness in order to allow her to consult her notes or another person are unsubstantiated. questioning a witness who is a foreign national or stateless person without a permanent residence permit in the czech republic can be considered to be this kind of measure. the witnesses merely pass through the territory in the course of their work as truck drivers. the interviews with these witnesses were conducted in accordance with the provisions of the code of criminal procedure. it is apparent from the file that the truck drivers were questioned in the presence of an interpreter and in the presence of judges of the břeclav district court (...).
the applicant was born in 1971 and lives in daugavpils. of the daugavpils city police arrested the applicant and took him to the police station. the applicant, who had category 2 disability status in relation to his eyesight, did not offer any resistance. beat up the applicant by delivering several blows to his head, near to his eyes. after this injury, the deterioration of the applicant’s sight accelerated, leading to retinal detachment. in 1995 and 1996 he had several eye operations, including three in a hospital in moscow, but the retinal detachment continued to progress. in april 1996 he was granted category 1 disability status for complete loss of vision. in february 1995 a forensic medical report was drawn up. it stated that on 16 january the applicant had sustained numerous injuries, which by their nature were considered moderate, resulting in long-term health problems of more than twenty-one days and permanently reducing his capacity to work by at least a third. did not appear at the first hearing on 1 november 1995. in december 1995 the warrant was sent to the daugavpils police station. was wanted and that the trial court would be informed when he was caught. in july 1998 and january 1999 the daugavpils court asked the russian authorities for assistance in obtaining originals of medical records relating to the applicant’s operations (see paragraph 7 above). the daugavpils court upheld the prosecutor’s request and ordered the third forensic medical examination. from june 2000 to february 2003 a total of five hearings were postponed because experts, doctors, including an ophthalmologist, did not attend and several medical experts needed to be called. on 10 april 2002, at the request of daugavpils court, a panel of experts drew up the fourth medical report which stated that the applicant had suffered at least one blow to his right eye and to his thorax. the injuries sustained by him were considered minor. the report continued by stating that on 16 january 1995 the applicant had suffered injuries to his head that had resulted in a serious worsening of his eye disorder (myopia) with the recurrence of retinal detachments in both eyes followed by further deterioration of his sight. in absentia for abusing his official power in a violent and disrespectful manner. he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. the judgment became final on 11 march 2003. he was awarded lvl 90,000 (eur 128,500) in non-pecuniary damages for the damage caused to his health and lvl 4,502.81 (eur 6,432.58) in pecuniary damages from both defendants on a pro rata basis for his medical expenses. it ruled that the first-instance court had been incorrect in concluding that the applicant’s injuries had amounted to mutilation and disfigurement under section 2349 of the civil law. only proved that he had committed a crime using violence against the applicant. in the judgment of 27 february 2003 the first and fourth criteria had been established. the supreme court analysed all the medical data before it concerning the applicant’s health and concluded that the state police were liable to pay pecuniary damages to the applicant for his medical expenses under section 2347 of the civil law. the applicant had claimed pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages for injuries sustained as a result of police ill-treatment. in this regard he had relied on sections 2347 to 2349 of the civil law, which provided that compensation could be claimed for mutilation and disfigurement. nevertheless, it did not have retroactive effect and therefore the national courts could not apply it in the applicant’s case. according to the supreme court, no such obligation could be inferred from any other legal acts on the account that the subject matter of the present civil dispute did not concern the public law obligation which the latvian state had undertaken in the area of human rights.
the applicant was born in 1967 and lives in prague. do i have to become evil before you can hear me out and are willing to talk to me? it’s a pity that one has to abduct you or tie you up, in other words simply use means of physical restraint in order to make you listen and carefully think about and evaluate what they have told you. i would be happier if you could do so without such actions ...
... promise made in the car ...
because i have not humiliated you either, although i had a good opportunity to do so. i could have taken pictures of you, forced you to make a porn movie and sent it to all those people in england. do not wonder about the things i am able to think about; wonder about why i have not done so ...
i will tell her everything about what i have done to you as well as why i have done it; i will give her your contact details, and maybe she can help us become closer ...
i told the psychologist everything about what i have done to you, ... how i was bad to you, including the threats i have recently made in order to make you hear me out. on the next day, upon police advice, she changed her telephone number and email address. the female informer indicated that a certain c. had confessed that she had participated in sexual abuse whilst working as an au pair in the united kingdom. in addition, my daughter informed me that she had also reported the entire matter in england, where she had been questioned about the matter after suffering a mental breakdown there. my daughter said that she had these emails at her disposal ...
in addition, i learned from my daughter that [the applicant], during the period when he was communicating and was able to communicate with her, had told her that she could come back to him, that she was in no danger from him because he had started seeing a psychologist ... in order to reduce or eradicate his violent behaviour, which he was aware of and had been using against her – against [c.] ...” 11. on 7 august 2006 the police asked the prague 6 district prosecutor’s office to apply for an “urgent or non-repeatable measure” (neodkladný nebo neopakovatelný úkon) pursuant to article 158a of the code of criminal procedure (hereinafter “the ccp”), and the following day an interview with c. was conducted. at the time of making that request, c. had been living and working in the united kingdom but arrived back in the czech republic for the purpose of her interview on 8 august 2006. she described in detail the acts of intimidation conducted by him in the form of phone calls, sms messages, emails, letters and verbal threats. furthermore, on 1 january 2006 they had been in a car together and the applicant had threatened to throw c. into a snowdrift and drive off, or to kill both her and himself in a deliberate car accident. she had also phoned her mother and had confided in her about the intimidation by the applicant. c. also stated that the applicant was seeing a psychotherapist. as the intimidation continued, c. filed a criminal complaint at a police station in the united kingdom on 7 june 2006. on 25 october 2006 a judge at the prague 6 district court ordered the compilation of a list of incoming and outgoing telephone calls from the applicant’s mobile phone between 20 december 2005 and 31 july 2006. on 27 april 2007 c.’s mother was interviewed. she had agreed to meet him somewhere in prague they met normally and agreed to go out for a drink in the evening. the district court tried to summons c. again. in a letter of 24 april 2009, c. informed the presiding judge that, although she had been summonsed, she was unable to attend the main hearing because she had been working abroad for more than four years and intended to stay abroad on a permanent basis. it appears that the district court did not try to summon c. again. the testimony is consistent with further evidence taken. on 13 february 2010 the applicant appealed, raising a number of procedural, factual and interpretational complaints. the court found that the applicant’s guilt had been securely established in particular by the statement given by c., which was not the only evidence against the applicant, her statements having been corroborated by further indirect evidence, such as the testimony of her mother, in whom c. had confided at the material time. this is understandable given that she was allegedly abused by the mother’s partner (as the victim confided in the defendant). furthermore, the victim was already back in the united kingdom at the relevant time (as of 3 january 2006) and her contact with the defendant was conducted solely via mobile phone calls and email correspondence. finally, one should not disregard the statement of an impartial witness ... namely the victim’s psychotherapist, who confirmed that the victim came to her because of relational problems with the defendant, confided in her about having been held by the defendant against her will and driven off somewhere in his car, and about his emails threatening to harm her if she left him. in respect of the applicant’s complaint concerning c.’s interview, which was conducted as an urgent and non-repeatable measure under article 158a of the ccp, the municipal court noted that:
“the victim was duly interviewed in the presence of a judge ..., with the unrepeatability of the measure being determined by the long-term residence of the witness in the united kingdom.
the first applicant was born in 1933 and lives in brussels. two of the three occupants of the van were killed. who subsequently became a co-defendant (see paragraph 13 below). subsequently confirmed that witness statement. on 24 june 2002 the arrest warrant issued against r.c. had again been questioned by the police on 25 june 2002, he had mentioned, in connection with the attack on the b.z. on 30 september 2002 a warrant was issued for the purposes of a police hearing of r.c., following which he was first questioned officially on 2 october 2002. was heard by the investigating judge as a witness under oath. he explained that in 1997 he had left the group of instigators following his conviction for other offences. a member of the aforementioned group, which had in the end refrained from taking part in the attack on the van. on 31 october 2002 the first applicant had a face-to-face meeting with r.c. who were themselves involved in organised crime, had provided false information. ’s murder in exchange for police protection. the police questioned him on 2 december 2004. was also questioned, in the framework of police protection measures, in particular concerning the b.z. in the meantime, on the basis of the statements by d.s. on 3 december 2007 the indictments division committed the twelve defendants for trial before the liège assize court. van, as well as other offences linked to organised crime. he was sentenced to thirty years’ imprisonment. the applicants’ conviction was also based on the charges of possession of firearms and leadership of a criminal conspiracy and a criminal organisation. 926/05, 13 january 2009), the court of cassation quashed the judgment inasmuch as it adjudicated on the proceedings brought against four appellants, including the applicants, and referred the case to the brussels-capital assize court. on 2 april 2010 the retrial commenced before the brussels-capital assize court. on 28 september 2010 the jury found the applicants guilty, in particular, of the attack on the b.z. the main reasons for the jury’s decision were subsequently summarised as follows in a statement of reasons issued by the assize court that same day:
“the [first applicant’s guilt] regarding his involvement in the attempted robbery in waremme on 12 january 1998 transpires from the concurring statements of [r.c. both of whom admitted that they had had talks with [r.c.], and from the information provided by c.s. the reasons impelling a witness to testify may give rise to doubts concerning his or her credibility, but that is not necessarily inconsistent with the holding of a fair trial. the judgment notes that, according to the police officers having received the statements contained in the case-file, the latter do not diverge from the information previously supplied confidentially. the court of cassation gave the following reply to the applicants’ criticism of the fact that the procedure for granting a threatened witness assistance and protection is not subject to court supervision and, owing to its confidentiality, prevents the defendant from establishing that the financial assistance provided is tantamount to the covert purchase of witness statements:
“article 6 of the convention requires the prosecuting authorities to communicate to the defence all the relevant evidence in their possession for or against the defendant.
they were both born in 1957 and live in colares. the first applicant is a well-known journalist in portugal. and on what his election meant for the portuguese judicial system. if it was advisable for a president of the supreme court to pay greater attention to montesquieu and the principle of the separation of powers than to the playbook of the cgtp [general confederation of portuguese workers], n.n. it is so pathetic as to make one laugh, were we not in portugal and if we did not understand how the strategies of the spiders work. there was coverage of the election in the days preceding and following it in various articles in the national press. one of those articles, published in público on 6 august 2006, was an interview with a member (juiz conselheiro) of the supreme court of justice, p.m., who had severely criticised the electoral system for the post of president of the supreme court of justice. the relevant parts of the interview read as follows:
“... q.: why don’t you agree with the current system of electing the president of the supreme court of justice (scj)? through a competition, and an assessment of their work by the members of the hcj. it does not cross anyone’s mind that they aren’t people whom he trusts ... and i myself am not questioning those people. p.m.: it is a distorted system ... it is not the people – they are all serious and honest; the problem is the system itself. p.m.: yes; the way these [elections] work raises doubts and questions. it is an election which has the appearance of being distorted. brought an action in the lisbon civil court against the applicants for defamation. in fact, the second applicant had not participated at all in the writing or publication of the first applicant’s article; the civil proceedings for defamation had been instituted against her on the basis of articles 1691 and 1695 of the portuguese civil code. and in the high council of the judiciary, thus damaging his honour and reputation. ...
[the editorial examines] the plaintiff on two levels: how he, allegedly, managed to achieve the electoral results; and his electoral programme as a candidate for election to the presidency of the supreme court. ...
the defendant did not prove the veracity of this allegation. ...
in the light of the above, there is nothing which allows us to reach the conclusion that the defendant had determined the veracity of his comments [by means of accessing] credible, diverse and verifiable sources of information. argued that the level of compensation should have been set at a higher amount and that the second applicant should have been considered a party to the proceedings. on 9 november 2010 the lisbon court of appeal upheld the first-instance judgment. the court of appeal emphasised that the first applicant had exceeded his right to criticise and inform. it further considered that the first applicant had not been able to prove in the proceedings the veracity of some of the allegations made in the article, even though they had been based on previous articles published in the portuguese media about judge n.n. with regard to the facts, the lisbon court of appeal considered that the facts had been correctly established. on an unknown date in november 2010 the applicants and judge n.n., on 15 december 2011 the supreme court of justice declined to examine the applicants’ appeal. as to the facts, the lisbon court of appeal considered, inter alia, the following to have been established:
(i)  the plaintiff had been the only candidate for the post of president of supreme court of justice and had previously been a member and the vice-president of the high council of the judiciary;
(ii)  several articles had been published in the press and in blogs (in the periods preceding and following the election) about judge n.n. ...
besides that, and this is the decisive point for the determination of the amount to be awarded, the piece written by the defendant, despite the degree of offence and suffering [caused to] the plaintiff, was not an obstacle to his re-election by a large majority (larger than that previously, as everybody knew) to the same post. on 25 january 2013 the applicants submitted their grounds of appeal. had not submitted any grounds of appeal (julgado deserto o recurso e caducado o recurso subordinado).
the applicant was born in 1966 and is currently detained in giurgiu prison. on 24 june 1999 the călăraşi county court convicted the applicant of burglary, rape and murder and sentenced him to twenty five years’ imprisonment. in application of article 71 of the criminal code, his right to vote and to be elected was withdrawn during detention. the decision became final on 25 february 2000 when the supreme court of justice dismissed the appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant. the applicant is currently serving his prison sentence in giurgiu prison where he has been held since 21 january 2009. the applicant described the conditions of his detention as follows:
-  there was no water during summer days;
-  he was placed with smokers (in the court-room and for few days during detention) although he did not smoke;
-  the windows were covered with bars and thick galvanised wire which rendered the ventilation of the cell impossible;
-  he was transported to court hearings in small dirty vans, with no ventilation or natural light;
-  from 2009 until the date of the last information received (22 july 2014) he had been held with five other inmates in a 17.65 sq. based on the documents presented by the prison administration, the government explained that during his stay in giurgiu prison the applicant had occupied the following cells, all non-smoking:

the applicant company is a limited liability company with its seat in ansfelden. on 3 may 2000 the applicant company applied to the linz-land district administrative authority (bezirkshauptmannschaft – daa) for the permission to modify its facility site by constructing a loading zone and a noise protection wall. an oral hearing was held on 1 march 2001. on 12 july 2001 the applicant company lodged an application for transfer of jurisdiction, because the daa had not rendered a decision within the statutory six-month time-limit. by decision of 23 july 2001 the daa granted the applicant company permission to modify its facility site and dismissed the objections lodged by persons living in the vicinity of the site (hereinafter, “the neighbours”). on 18 december 2001 the upper austria regional governor (landeshauptmann von oberösterreich – hereinafter, “the regional governor”) lifted the daa’s decision because of lack of jurisdiction, and on 19 december 2001 he dismissed the applicant company’s application for transfer of jurisdiction. the applicant company appealed against the latter decision, but its appeal was dismissed by the federal minister of economy and labour (bundesminister für wirtschaft und arbeit – hereinafter, the “minister”) on 20 august 2002. the administrative court (verwaltungsgerichtshof) lifted the minister’s decision on 17 december 2002 and held that the regional governor was the competent authority to decide on the matter. on 16 october 2003 the minister lifted the regional governor’s decision of 19 december 2001 and held that the latter was competent to decide on the merits of the applicant company’s case. meanwhile, on 14 january 2002 the daa had granted the applicant company permission to modify its facility site and dismissed the neighbours’ objections. on 22 december 2003 the regional governor lifted the daa’s decision because of lack of jurisdiction, and granted the applicant company the permission. on 26 january 2004 the neighbours appealed against this decision to the minister. on 1 september 2004 the applicant company filed an application for transfer of jurisdiction, because a decision had not been reached within the statutory six-month time-limit. on 7 september 2004 the administrative court ordered the minister to take a decision within three months. on 11 november 2004, upon request by the minister, it extended the time-limit by another six months. on 11 may 2005 the administrative court refused another request by the minister for an extension of the time-limit and assumed jurisdiction. after having requested an additional statement from an official expert (amtssachverständiger) on 14 october 2008, the administrative court dismissed the neighbours’ appeal as being unfounded by judgment of 1 july 2010 (served on the applicant company’s counsel on 28 july 2010).
the first applicant was born in 1971 and lives in devecser. the second applicant was born in 1979 and lives in ajka. they had also been informed that the demonstrators would seek conflict with the police and the minority community. according to the far-right organisations’ websites, the demonstration was aimed “against roma criminality”, “against the roma of devecser beating up hungarians” and “against the roma criminals unable to respect the rules of living together”. on the day of the demonstration checks were increased throughout the county, including traffic check points. announced that the demonstration was about the justified self-protection of hungarians. he also announced that the roma were not “normal”. in his view there was a destruction of civilians going on in hungary. sporadically, quasi‑military demonstrations of force occurred, involving military-style uniforms, formations, commands and salutes. furthermore, one of his acquaintances had been injured by a stone thrown into his garden, but the police officer to whom the applicant had reported the incident had not taken any steps. had not been able to keep the events under control and had been unwilling to confront the participants. according to the government, the commander of the security forces immediately took action when the participants started to act violently, managed the crowd appropriately and separated hostile demonstrators from others. on 21 september 2012 the minister of the interior, reacting to a letter from civil society organisations, informed the public that the conduct of the police had been adequate and that forty people, including five demonstrators, had been questioned by the police. it went on to state that by not enforcing the limits of freedom of assembly, the police had caused anomalies in respect of the right to peaceful assembly and the roma population’s right to dignity and private life. both applicants complained to the veszprém county police department about the failure of the police to take measures against the demonstrators, thereby endangering their life and limb and their human dignity. on 22 november 2012 the police department dismissed the applicants’ complaint, finding that the conditions for dispersal of the demonstration had not been met, since any illegal or disorderly conduct on the part of the demonstrators had ceased within ten minutes. as regards the failure of the police to carry out identity checks on demonstrators and to hold suspects for questioning (előállítás), the police department found that such measures would only have aggravated the situation and strengthened the demonstrators’ hostility towards the police. on appeal, the national police service upheld the first-instance administrative decision. by its decisions of 29 october 2013 and 25 june 2014 the veszprém county police department dismissed both applicants’ complaints again on identical grounds. the national police service upheld those decisions on appeal on 19 december 2013 and 5 august 2014, respectively, stating that although under section 14 of act no. in its judgments delivered on 3 december 2014 and 19 march 2015 the veszprém administrative and labour court dismissed the applicants’ claims. sporadic acts of violence, as in the present case, could not serve as legitimate grounds for dispersal. the kúria also rejected the applicants’ argument that the police had done nothing to protect them and other members of the roma minority. the applicants, together with the hungarian helsinki committee, lodged a criminal complaint concerning the speeches delivered at the demonstration and the attacks to which the roma community had been subjected. on 22 november 2012 the veszprém county police department opened an investigation into charges of violence against members of a group under article 174/b of the criminal code. the investigation into incitement against a group was discontinued by the police department on 24 september 2013. following a complaint lodged by the applicants, the veszprém county prosecution office upheld the decision to discontinue the investigation. thus the applicants were not victims of the alleged criminal act and had no standing to lodge a complaint against the decision to discontinue the investigation. it held that the speeches delivered in devecser contained abusive, demeaning statements concerning the roma minority and might have contained statements that evoked hatred, but that they had not provoked active hatred and had not called on the audience to take violent action against the local roma. ’s conviction but amended his sentence to one year and three months’ imprisonment, suspended for three years.
the first applicant, ms floare cacuci, was born on 2 march 1939 and lives in oradea. both applicants were members of the romanian institute of accounting experts and certified accountants (corpul experților contabili și contabililor autorizați din românia). on 30 july 2001 the criminal department of the bihor county police ordered a forensic accounting report in a criminal case it was dealing with. the annexes justifying the conclusions were thus not appended on that occasion, but at a later date (see paragraph 22 below). a fourth expert, who was assisting m.g.s. was also appointed to participate in producing the report. the search shall be performed in compliance with articles 101, 103-108 and 111 of the rccp. according to the first applicant, on 21 october 2005, while she was in the street, having just left her house, she was stopped by a police officer, who told her that he had a search warrant for her home. the first applicant asked to be assisted by her lawyer. according to the government’s version of events – supported by the documents in the file, as issued by the criminal investigating authorities (see paragraph 42 below) – the search of the bag was carried out inside the first applicant’s home. several items and documents were found, the first applicant claiming that everything belonged to the second applicant. see paragraph 7 above – and an empty printer cartridge box. the applicants argued that, while the copy of the search report handed to them at that moment had made no mention of the manner in which the seized items had been sealed, the copy in the criminal file contained supplementary information on page 4, mentioning that the objects had been put in a sealed cardboard box labelled mai (the ministry of internal affairs) 15980. the witnesses had no objections concerning the manner in which the search had been carried out. the warrant was to last three days, starting on 21 november 2005. consequently, together with her lawyer, she decided to leave the police headquarters without attending the unsealing and search procedure. on 5 december 2005 the first applicant submitted the missing 497 pages from the first expert report (see paragraph 6 above) to the oradea district court, following payment of 60% of her fee. the first applicant submitted that the warrant had been issued only in respect of her home, and not in respect of the registered office of the second applicant. furthermore, no reasons had been given to justify the search measure. on 24 november 2005 the head prosecutor of the prosecutor’s office attached to the district court of oradea dismissed the first applicant’s claims, finding that the complaint against the search measure itself was inadmissible, given the lack of specific legal provisions allowing for such an appeal, while the complaint concerning the carrying out of the search was ill-founded. the warrant had been issued in respect of her residence as stated on her identification documents. the prosecutor also stated that the investigating authorities had been obliged to seize all pieces of physical evidence found at the search location, irrespective of who owned them, and that the pieces not belonging to the suspect had been returned to their owner at the end of the criminal trial. in any event, the manner in which the seized objects had been sealed could not affect the legality of the search, but possibly their use as evidence in the criminal proceedings. that request was dismissed by the president of the oradea district court on the same day. the application was dealt with by the romanian constitutional court (“the constitutional court”), which gave its judgment on 30 november 2006, dismissing the objection as ill-founded. and spoliation (the material alteration, thereby invalidation) of evidence. the accounting expert report had been produced with the other experts appointed in the case. by a judgment of 21 april 2011 the oradea court of appeal dismissed an appeal lodged by the prosecutor and upheld the first-instance court’s judgment, stating essentially that the presumption of innocence in respect of the first applicant had not been rebutted. those complaints were joined and assessed in a unique case file, being dismissed as ill-founded by the oradea court of appeal on 20 september 2006. the court concluded that all the complaints were ill-founded.
according to the latest information in the court’s possession, he was serving a sentence in the pravieniškės correctional home. on 30 may 2006 the applicant wrote to the ministry of education and science (švietimo ir mokslo ministerija, hereinafter “the ministry”), requesting information about the possibility of enrolling at university. the applicant mentioned that he was a prisoner and thus could not physically attend the place of study. in a letter of 12 june 2006 sent to the applicant at the pravieniškės correctional home, the ministry of education and science wrote that information about the study programmes could be found on the website <www.aikos.smm.lt>. this website states that it belongs to the ministry of education and science, and is administered by a public entity, the centre for information technologies in education (švietimo informacinių technologijų centras), which is a public institution founded by the ministry of education and science. the site also contains historical data regarding education ...
aikos provides information to three groups of users: adults, children (up to fourteen years of age) and english speakers. the users may use more functions after they have registered on this site. the latter information on the aikos website is renewed monthly...” 8. on 1 july 2006 the pravieniškės correctional home governor replied that the prison authorities did not consider the ministry’s reply to be comprehensive. the prison considered that the ministry should have provided a comprehensive reply in writing. the applicant then lodged a complaint with the department of prisons (kalėjimų departamentas), arguing that none of the laws prohibited him from obtaining information from a state institution electronically. the applicant referred to the ministry’s reply and asked to be granted internet access. it was suggested that the applicant again ask the ministry to provide the information he sought. furthermore, the use of mobile phones in prisons was prohibited so that prisoners could not continue their criminal activity whilst serving a sentence. lastly, given that postal correspondence between prisoners was not permitted, providing prisoners with access to the internet would make that prohibition pointless. the prisons department also asked the court to dismiss the applicant’s complaint, arguing that although article 96 of the code of the execution of sentences permitted prisoners to use computers (see paragraph 29 below), this did not encompass the right to internet use. there was no right under lithuanian law for a prisoner to be provided with internet access. on 2 february 2007 the kaunas regional administrative court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. giving internet access to prisoners would not be compatible with those legal norms. such prohibition was aimed at preventing crimes being committed in prison. he also argued that the lower court had ignored the fact that the core of his complaint was the restriction of his right to education and the right to obtain information. the secondary school graduation exams showed good results”. the prison thus considered that internet access, or the lack thereof, had no impact on the quality of studies. the court noted that, for its users, the internet provided very wide opportunities to use email, to obtain information, to download files, and to sell or buy things. the internet could be used for more than merely educational purposes. this stemmed from article 10 of the code of the execution of sentences (see paragraph 29 below). there was no legal provision in lithuania permitting prisoners to use the internet. on 15 january 2007 the vilnius regional administrative court dismissed the claim by the applicant as unfounded. however, the court found that the conditions of the applicant’s detention had been satisfactory overall, except for a few minor details, and that the gravity of those violations was not such as would amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. however, the applicant later committed a disciplinary offence, and for that reason the extended visit was denied.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in valea călugărească. in 1993 the applicant was sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for homicide. between 24 november 2004 and 12 november 2008 he was serving his sentence in arad prison. the applicant alleged that, between 24 november 2004 and 2 october 2008, while he had been under a closed prison regime in arad prison, he had been taking his daily three hours of exercise in outside yards which lacked access to toilets or running water. at certain times there were as many as fifty prisoners in one recreation yard. especially during the hot days of summer the situation could have been described as inhuman and humiliating, because he had been forced to satisfy his physiological needs together with other prisoners along the fences of the yard, in the same place where they were supposed to walk and breathe fresh air. the applicant alleged that he had on numerous occasions asked the arad prison administration to provide sanitary facilities and running water in the recreation yards. his requests had been consistently ignored or had received the reply that renovation works were planned for the future. on 4 june 2008, the applicant lodged a new complaint asking the prison authorities to equip the recreation yards with running water and toilets. the prison authorities noted on the applicant’s request that in fact he had been allowed to take water with him during his daily exercise and he had also been able to go to his cell in order to satisfy his physiological needs during this time. they further noted “at the moment renovation works are under way in the yards.” on 16 july 2008 the post-sentencing judge in arad prison rejected a complaint on the same matter lodged by the applicant. 276/2006 on the execution of sentences did not provide for the right to have access to sanitary facilities and water during the prisoners’ daily outside exercise. relying on the provisions concerning the prisoners’ right to daily exercise set forth by law no. 276/2006 as well as the provisions of article 3 of the convention, the applicant made a complaint against the above-mentioned decision before the arad district court. he also sought compensation for non-pecuniary damage in respect of the inhuman treatment he had been suffering during his daily exercise since 24 november 2004 in arad prison. the arad prison administration maintained before the court that the law did not provide for an obligation to equip the recreation yards with sanitary facilities. in a final judgment of 28 october 2008 the arad district court found that the applicant had indeed been deprived of access to a toilet and drinking water during daily exercise, and that this was in breach of article 48 of law 275/2006, which regulates prisoners’ right to daily exercise. the court based its decision on witness statements as well as on information submitted by the prison authorities. in view of the evidence before it, the court allowed the applicant’s complaint and ordered the arad prison authorities to ensure the applicant’s right to daily exercise in a yard provided with sanitary facilities and drinking water. the applicant’s request for damages was rejected as out of time, since it had not first been raised before the post-sentencing judge. in the meantime, on 23 october 2008 the post-sentencing judge in arad prison had studied another complaint lodged by the applicant in respect of another alleged breach of his rights. in this context the post-sentencing judge held that he was not competent in law to deal with the applicant’s request for compensation for non-pecuniary damage. on 2 october 2008 the applicant was placed under a semi-open detention regime, because his prison term was approaching its end. he was moved to a different prison wing, where the recreation yard was provided with both toilets and drinking water. on 12 november 2008 the applicant was conditionally released from prison. in a letter dated 2 june 2014, submitted by the government, the national administration of prisons mentioned that the recreation yards of arad prison could not technically be equipped with sanitary facilities because the prison lacked a sewage collection and disposal system. at the time the letter was sent, running water had been made available in all yards.
lojistik tasimacilik ticaret limited sirketi has its registered office in istanbul. on 13 november 2008 customs officers stopped and checked the applicant company’s lorry, in which they found packages of unknown content. a preliminary test of the content revealed that the packages contained heroin. the customs officers informed the police accordingly. the driver, a turkish citizen, was arrested and detained. the lorry was seized and the trailer and its goods became the object of a customs procedure. on an unspecified date the applicant company received documents enabling the goods contained in the trailer to be delivered to their destination. the trailer was returned to the applicant company. on 25 november 2008 the applicant company asked the ptuj district court to provide it with the case-file concerning the charges against the driver. it also enquired when it would be able to retake possession of the seized lorry. on 8 december 2008 the court informed the applicant company of the charges against the driver. on 23 december 2008 the applicant company informed the court that it opposed the district state prosecutor’s request for confiscation of the lorry. on 29 december 2008 the ptuj district court found the driver guilty of drug trafficking and sentenced him to nine years’ imprisonment. it held that confiscation was possible only if one of the conditions set out in the second paragraph of section 73 of the criminal code were met, namely the existence of reasons of general security or morality. both the driver and the higher state prosecutor appealed. the higher court explained that in accordance with section 73(2) of the criminal code, objects used in the commission of a criminal offence could be confiscated even when they did not belong to the perpetrator, in so far as the third party’s right to claim damages from the perpetrator was not thereby affected. moreover, section 73(3) provided for the possibility of mandatory confiscation in cases provided for by the statute. claiming that it had not had an effective possibility to prevent the abuse of its property for criminal purposes, the applicant company stressed that the lorry had been subject to regular controls concerning possible vehicle modifications and hidden compartments. thus, according to the applicant company, the measure complained of constituted a punishment and an unjustified and disproportionate interference with its property and that it had not had the opportunity to participate in the criminal proceedings. on 29 september 2011 the constitutional court dismissed both the constitutional complaint and the initiative. in reviewing the contested legislation, the constitutional court confirmed the higher court’s view that section 186 of the criminal code provided for mandatory confiscation of vehicles used for the transportation and storage of drugs or illegal substances in sport, regardless of their ownership. the constitutional court stressed that the nature of the criminal offences in question, the manner in which they were committed and their consequences justified the interference with the ownership rights of all owners of the means of transport used for drug-trafficking, regardless of their potential involvement in the criminal activities at issue, adding that a different regulation governing the confiscation of goods would diminish considerably the possibilities for effectively preventing the criminal offences in question. in this connection, the constitutional court pointed out that legal certainty required that every instance of legally recognised damage be adequately protected. under the general rules of tort law, the injured owner had the possibility and the right to exact compensation from the person responsible for the damage. meanwhile, on 29 june 2009 the ptuj district court informed the applicant company that the lorry was to be sold at a public auction and that it could submit written comments in this respect. on 20 october 2011 the court ordered the sale of the lorry and informed the applicant company thereof. on 30 november 2011 the lorry was sold at public auction for 12,000 euros (“eur”). according to the government the lorry was sold to the applicant company. lojistik, tas.ve tic.ltd.sti”, a company from istanbul. the government did not reply to this submission.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in tbilisi. she was raised mainly by her maternal grandmother in georgia while both parents, whose relationship soon ended, left to work abroad. applied to the tbilisi city court for her daughter to be officially registered as resident at her address. on 19 may 2008 a summons was sent to the applicant at his registered address, informing him of k.g. according to the courier, the summons could not be served as the house was closed up and no one was living there. on 3 june 2008 the court of first instance, acting on the basis of article 78 of the code of civil procedure (hereinafter, “the ccp” – see paragraph 15 below), ordered information concerning the proceedings to be published in a daily newspaper called 24 hours. on 24 june 2008 the tbilisi city court granted k.g. the decision was taken in the absence of the applicant, whose whereabouts, according to the ruling, could not be established. on 12 december 2008 the tbilisi city court, acting upon another application by k.g., could be issued with an international passport and leave the territory of georgia without her father’s consent. no specific time-limit for that restriction of the applicant’s parental rights was given in the ruling. the court again stated that the applicant’s whereabouts were unknown and ordered the information about the proceedings to be published in 24 hours. unlike the first set of default proceedings, the summons was sent twice to the applicant at the address he had registered at. the courier noted that the house was closed up. it appears from the case file that the custody and guardianship authority, which represented the interests of the child in the above proceedings, made its own attempts to contact the applicant. in conclusions submitted to the tbilisi city court, the authority noted that during its visit to the applicant’s registered address it had learnt from neighbours that he had sold the house in 2003 and left for moscow. both default decisions were sent to the applicant’s registered address and, as they could not be served, were consequently published in 24 hours according to the procedure provided for in article 78 of the ccp (see paragraph 15 below). on 6 june 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint with the tbilisi city court, seeking to have both default decisions set aside. he stated that he had learnt about the decisions only in may 2012. he also explained that he had not been living in georgia at the material time, which his former partner had well known. the default proceedings had been unfair as he had not been properly summoned to the hearings. by a decision of 16 august 2012 the tbilisi city court rejected the applicant’s application. the court ruled, with reference to articles 71 § 3 and 422 of the ccp (see paragraphs 15 and 17 below), that the applicant had been duly informed about the proceedings via public notifications in a newspaper and that there was therefore no legal basis to set the impugned decisions aside. it noted that the applicant had been registered at the address where the summonses had been sent and that for the purposes of the proceedings the courts had been justified in using that very address. that decision was upheld by the tbilisi court of appeal on 31 october 2012. it reasoned that the domestic courts had been right to send the summonses to the applicant’s only available registered address. furthermore, as it had not been possible to serve the summonses on the applicant, the procedure of delivering a summons via a public notification, as provided for in article 78 of the ccp, had been duly employed. in his last communication with the court on 15 december 2014, the applicant stated that he could still not have any contact with his daughter.

the us nationals (“the us applicants”) started proceedings for the adoption of children from russia between 2010 and 2012. on 13 july 2011 the united states and the russian federation signed the bilateral agreement on adoption setting out the procedure for intercountry adoption between the two states. they were assisted by the authorised adoption agency “hand in hand”. on 15 november 2012 the adoption application was submitted to the moscow regional court. on 15 january 2013 the us applicants appeared before the court. on 14 may 2013 the moscow regional court upheld the decision of 30 january 2013. according to the government, e.g. has been placed with a foster family. the us applicants initiated the adoption procedure in march 2012. is still available for adoption, and the competent authorities provide prospective adoptive parents looking for a child with information about her. from the committee on social policy of the st petersburg administration. she visited her twice a day between 24 and 28 december 2012. has been adopted by a different adoptive family. they were assisted by the authorised adoption agency “international assistance group, inc.”. petersburg city court rejected the application on the grounds that, as of 1 january 2013, the agency’s activity had been banned in russia pursuant to law no. suffers from down syndrome, psychomotor development delay, anomaly in heart development, partial atrophy of optic discs, astigmatism and cytomegalovirus infection. on 19 december 2012 the us applicants obtained a referral to visit d.k. born on 9 may 1960 and who lives in chicago, illinois, united states (the us applicant), and k.r., suffers from a mixed developmental disorder, planovalgus deformity, adenoids, hypertrophy of palatine tonsils, hepatosplenomegaly and physiological phimosis. on 21 november 2012 the us applicant obtained a referral to visit k.r. she visited her every day between 21 and 23 november 2012. 23890/13 was lodged on 5 april 2013 by m.w., however, their attempts were unsuccessful as no adoption agency worked with the chelyabinsk region. on 19 september 2012 the adoption file was returned and the us applicants were requested to amend certain documents and to enclose some additional documents. the us applicants have previously adopted a girl from kazakhstan. who was born on 19 february 2012 and lives in vladivostok. having completed the necessary steps for intercountry adoption within the united states, they were registered in the russian state databank as prospective adoptive parents on 20 november 2012. each visit lasted between an hour and a half and two hours. born on 5 august 1971, who live in long beach, ny, united states (the us applicants), and k.k., as the us applicants failed to submit the documents, on the latter date the adoption application was returned to them without examination. on 25 april 2013 the us applicants were informed that they had been removed from the state databank as prospective adoptive parents.
the first and second applicants were born in 1984 and 1982 respectively and live in vienna. the third applicant was born in 1972 and lives in switzerland. in late 2006 the first applicant contacted an agency in manila in order to find a job abroad. she is a single mother with one daughter who was eight months old at the time. upon her arrival in dubai the first applicant was taken to her employers, who were two sisters or sisters-in-law sharing one large residence with their families. one of them took possession of her passport. she was not allowed to have her own telephone and was only allowed to call her family in the philippines once a month, the costs of these calls being deducted from her wages. only when she accompanied the family to the supermarket approximately once a month was she allowed to buy some basic food for herself. when she became ill after sleeping on the cold floor, her employers prevented her from buying medicine or contacting a doctor; instead, she had to continue working the same hours. the first applicant therefore returned to dubai in april 2009. the employer also started to slap or hit her regularly for no or little reason. she also repeatedly threatened to let her husband hit the first applicant if she did not follow her orders or made any mistakes. the second applicant was married with three young children in the philippines. after the first applicant returned to the philippines for three months in january 2009 (see paragraph 11 above), the employers significantly changed their conduct towards the second applicant. they threatened not to pay her family if she made any mistakes. she was also forced to work from around 5 or 6 a.m. until midnight or 1 a.m. the following day. between april 2009 and june 2010 the violent and threatening behaviour of the employers increased. the third applicant’s family were desperate for money to pay for crucial medical treatment for her brother. the third applicant was working for a family member of the first and second applicants’ employers. on 2 july 2010 the applicants’ employers took them along on a short holiday trip to austria. one of the employers started screaming at the first and third applicants in a manner which the applicants had not experienced before. by this stage, the third applicant had formed the impression that this employer, of whom she lived in a constant state of fear, was a dangerous person who might try to hurt her very badly. therefore, she believed that something bad was going to happen to her if she remained with the family. similarly, the first applicant believed that they could not live with their conditions of work any longer, and did not want to risk waiting to see what happened if they travelled with their employers from vienna to london, as they were scheduled to do. the applicants subsequently found support within the local filipino community in vienna. in april or may 2011, approximately nine months after they had left their employers, the applicants contacted a local ngo called “lefö” for assistance in reporting their ill-treatment, abuse and exploitation to the police. in july 2011 the applicants decided to turn to the austrian police and filed a criminal complaint (strafanzeige) against their employers. they explained that they had been the victims of human trafficking. in the public prosecutor’s view, the offence had been committed abroad by non-nationals, and did not engage austrian interests within the meaning of article 64 § 1 (4) of the cc. all three applicants were granted a residence permit for special protection purposes in january 2012, valid for one year initially.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in toruń. he is a publicist and a professor of sociology. a journalist from rzeczpospolita, a national daily newspaper, on the subject of lustration of journalists which at that time was widely commented on in the media. the transcript of that interview was sent to the applicant by email. the applicant sent the text back with some minor corrections. on 14 march 2007 the newspaper published the applicant’s opinion. in a conversation with me stated: professor zybertowicz speaks now, although during the communist times he was quiet. a.m. repeatedly said: i spent so many years in prison, so now i am right. niektórzy z łatwością sięgają w niej po argumenty personalne. zybertowicz teraz zabiera glos, choć za komuny siedział cicho. a.m. wielokrotnie powtarzał: ja tyle lat siedziałem w więzieniu, to teraz mam racje. on 26 and 27 march 2007 a legal representative of a.m., an editor-in chief of gazeta wyborcza, one of the biggest daily newspapers, sent a legal letter to the applicant, offering to settle the issue amicably provided that the applicant published a relevant apology. a.m. repeatedly said: i spent so many years in prison, so now i am right” 10. he requested that the applicant be ordered to publish an apology and to pay damages of 15,000 polish zlotys (pln) (approximately 3,570 euros (eur)) to a charity. on 17 december 2007 the warsaw regional court allowed the plaintiff’s claim. the court did not find any basis to appoint an expert of its own motion. the applicant claimed before the court that the phrase used in the interview was an acceptable journalistic summary of a.m.’s opinions and his set of views demonstrated during numerous public appearances. however, the phrase was not a direct quote, since it was not in quotation marks. it was a reconstruction, interpretation and paraphrase, demonstrating a.m.’s mindset. he submitted examples of numerous public statements made by a.m. between 1982 and 2007, in which a.m. had referred to his stay in prison during the communist-era. it considered that the use of the colon, as in “a.m. repeatedly said: ...” would indicate the factual nature of the phrase. this view was made with reference to general knowledge and did not need any special information. however, as no expert opinion on linguistics was obtained, further reflections on this issue were pointless. the court referred to the reasons given by the lower courts. in the present case it had not been necessary to order an opinion from an expert on linguistics. furthermore, it could not have been perceived differently, because it had been made in the context of a public debate on lustration of journalists. at the same time he also arranged for the publication of an apology in rzeczpospolita, for which he paid pln 3,502.62 (approximately eur 900). during the proceedings against the applicant, several thousand people signed a letter titled ‘defending freedom of expression’, which was handed to the ombudsman on 21 november 2008. they argued that a publicist had a right to express this type of opinion about other participants in a public debate. therefore, in their opinion, spreading untrue information was not protected by any law.
the applicant was born in 1973 and lives in ceske budejovice (czech republic). on 26 august 1998 the wels regional court (landesgericht) issued an arrest warrant against the applicant, as he was suspected, inter alia, of having committed aggravated fraud on a commercial basis in several countries together with numerous other suspects, and of being a member of a criminal organization. on 12 september 1998 the applicant was arrested in germany and extradited to austria on an unspecified date. he remained in detention on remand until 23 july 1999. on 14 january 1999 the wels public prosecutor’s office (staatsanwaltschaft) filed a bill of indictment against the applicant. the applicant’s objection against it was dismissed by the linz court of appeal (oberlandesgericht) on 26 march 1999. on 13 january 2003 the applicant filed a request under section 91 of the courts act (gerichtsorganisationsgesetz) for the setting of a time-limit (fristsetzungsantrag) in order to accelerate the proceedings. thereupon, the wels regional court held a first hearing on 25 march 2003. on 29 october 2003 the court decided to separate the proceedings against the applicant from those against the other accused. on 9 december 2003 the applicant requested that the trial against him be resumed. in march and july 2004 the applicant filed further requests under section 91 of the courts act. on 6 december 2004 the applicant lodged an application with the court (no. 127/05), complaining under article 6 of the convention about the length of the criminal proceedings against him. on 9 june 2008 the applicant and the government agreed on a friendly settlement of that case against a payment of 12,300 euros (eur) by the government. consequently, the court decided to strike application no. 127/05 out of its list of cases (see benes v. austria (dec.) on 4 september 2008, following the issuance of the above‑mentioned strike-out decision, the applicant requested the wels regional court to discontinue the proceedings against him, or in the alternative to set a new date for a hearing as soon as possible. on 15 april 2009 the wels regional court held another oral hearing. the applicant failed to attend because he had fallen ill. during that hearing, the public prosecutor lodged the request that another expert opinion be obtained, to which the wels regional court acceded. the following oral hearing was set for 21 october 2009, but was cancelled because the court-appointed expert had informed the court that he would need three to five more weeks to finalise his opinion. following an urgent reminder which the wels regional court had sent to the expert, it learned on 18 october 2010 that the expert had passed away. on 1 september 2011 a new expert was appointed. on 1 september 2011, 17 november 2011 and 13 december 2012, the applicant filed further requests under section 91 of the courts act, which were dismissed by the linz court of appeal on 7 november 2011, 1 february 2012 and 2 january 2013 respectively. in its last decision, the court of appeal observed that the expert opinion had been finalised and submitted to the trial court on 19 december 2012. on 28 may 2013 the wels regional court acquitted the applicant from all charges, partly because his guilt could not be proven, partly because the public prosecutor had withdrawn the indictment.
the applicants, mr ramaz tsartsidze, mr samvel bozoyani, mr mamuka gelashvili (applicants nos. 1); mr alexander mikirtumov, mr binali aliev (applicants nos. their application to the court relates to five cases of religiously motivated aggression to which they were allegedly subjected in georgia at various times. at the same time, the police authorised a coach containing extremist members of the orthodox church, led by mr v. mkalavishvili, also known as father basil (see members of the gldani congregation of jehovah’s witnesses and others v. georgia, no. the attackers destroyed objects for religious use and seized items belonging to others. 1-3, other jehovah’s witnesses, the representation of the pennsylvania watchtower in georgia and the union of jehovah’s witnesses, lodged an administrative complaint with the mtatsminda-krtsanisi district court in tbilisi against the ministry of the interior, the governor of marneuli, the marneuli chief of police and his deputy and twelve other police officers involved in the case. they could not therefore have contributed by being passive or taking part in the acts of religious aggression against the applicants. using insulting language towards the participants, they ordered them to leave the premises. who ordered mr mikirtumov to leave marneuli and never to return, otherwise he would face serious problems. ordered mr aliev not to hold any more religious gatherings at his home if he wished to avoid problems with the police. as well as identifying the three police officers, the applicants also gave the number plates of the two vehicles in which the police officers had arrived. the police officers had therefore been obliged to go to the premises. mr aliev and mr mikirtumov had been taken together “somewhere”. on 17 june 2003 the proceedings brought by the applicants were dismissed as ill-founded. on 23 february 2005 the supreme court, ruling in written proceedings, dismissed an appeal by the applicants on points of law. before leaving the police station, the applicant asked that his belongings be returned to him. who was accompanied by another police officer. reprimanded him, stating that his conduct was not worthy of a christian. the police officers emptied the bag and tore up the religious literature inside. threatened to put him in his car and dump him in the rioni river. the applicants lodged an appeal, stating that submitting the destroyed religious literature to the court would have had no valid evidential value, since it would not have sufficed to prove that the police officers concerned had torn up the literature on the date in question. furthermore, in their opinion, the insults directed against them on account of their faith had been sufficient to establish that the police officers had been negligent in carrying out their professional duties. on 18 december 2002 the kutaisi district court dismissed the applicants’ appeal on the same grounds as the first-instance court. who had claimed that he did not recognise a white car with the registration number daq 492, which mr dzamukov had nonetheless identified as being that in which the two police officers had been patrolling at the time of the incident in question. this part of the application concerns mr boris gogoladze, mrs anastasia tvaradze and mrs madona kapanadze (applicants nos. the governor of dviri, and about fifteen local residents. the decision was upheld on appeal by the tbilisi regional court on 25 july 2003. the applicants also claimed compensation in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, in application of article 1005 § 1 of the civil code, and asked that a directive be sent to all police stations in the country, stating that the rights of jehovah’s witnesses were to be respected. he had seen that books and furniture were being thrown out of the window. on 25 june 2004 the tbilisi regional court upheld the first-instance judgment, repeating the grounds used in it.
the first applicant was born in 1964 and lives in korsakov, sakhalin region. the second applicant was born in 1948 and lives in moscow. the applicants sued the trest zhilishchnogo hozyajstva municipal company (мп «трест жилищного хозяйства» – hereinafter “the municipal company”) in two unrelated sets of civil proceedings. on 22 january 2003 the korsakovskiy town court of the sakhalin region (hereinafter “town court”) granted the claim by the first applicant for salary arrears and ordered the municipal company to pay him 1,270 euros (eur). the judgment became final on the same date, but remained unenforced. on 1 march 2004 the town court granted the claim by the second applicant for compensation for the damage to her health sustained as a result of the acts of one of the municipal company’s employees. the court awarded the applicant eur 16,256. the judgment became final on 25 may 2004. it was partly enforced in 2004 and in 2006-07; the applicant received eur 11,888. on 7 may 2007, in the course of insolvency proceedings in respect of the municipal company, the commercial court of the sakhalin region (hereinafter “the commercial court”) granted the second applicant’s claim for compensation of lost income and dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s claims. on 18 july 2007 the commercial court discontinued the appeal proceedings on the grounds that the municipal company had been liquidated. the commercial court relied on articles 49 § 3 and 63 § 8 of the civil code of russia as interpreted by the plenary supreme commercial court in ruling no. 29 of 15 december 2004 (see paragraphs 13-14 below). the municipal company was incorporated as a municipal unitary company set up by a decision of the local authority and provided heating supply and maintenance services in respect of municipal housing. the municipal company had “the right of economic control” (право хозяйственного ведения) over the assets allocated to it by the local authority in order to carry out its statutory activities. according to the second applicant, on 27 april 2002 the local authority withdrew most of the assets from the municipal company’s economic control. the assets were subsequently transferred to a newly created company; the debts remained with the municipal company. on 27 september 2005 the municipal company was declared insolvent and it was put into liquidation. on 7 may 2007 the commercial court ended the liquidation proceedings.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in toruń. the applicant is a publicist and a professor of sociology. on 11 january 2008 rzeczpospolita, a national daily newspaper, published an article titled “zybertowicz – so far 2:0 to the third polish republic” (zybertowicz: na razie 2:0 dla iii rp). he asked that the applicant be ordered to publish an apology and to pay damages of 20,000 polish zlotys (pln) (approximately 4,761 euros (eur)) to a charity. on 1 april 2008 the warsaw regional court transferred the case to the toruń regional court. on 20 august 2008 the warsaw court of appeal (sąd apelacyjny) quashed this decision. on 9 june 2009 the warsaw regional court gave judgment and partly allowed the plaintiff’s claim. it further determined the exact size and wording of the apology. the court also ordered the applicant to pay pln 1,000 (approximately eur 238) to a charity and pln 1,025 (approximately eur 244) in court fees. during the proceedings the court questioned the applicant and the plaintiff. the court also obtained an opinion from an expert on linguistics. the warsaw regional court noted that the applicant, when formulating the statement in question, referred in particular to a number of published statements made by a.m. in which he had criticised the lustration law. the applicant also relied on an earlier warsaw court of appeal judgment confirming that z.s. had indeed collaborated under communism with the security service. had been accused of collaborating with the security service. in particular, readers of rzeczpospolita should have been aware of that fact as the newspaper had published numerous articles on the issue. while the applicant in his statement had not specified who in his opinion had been “an agent” and who “their fierce defender”, from the nature of the publication and taking into account the readers’ general knowledge it was clear that it was the plaintiff who was considered to be “the fierce defender of two agents”. at the same time, the court accepted that had the applicant used a more general formulation and referred only to a.m.’s attitude towards the lustration law such words could have fallen within the limits of acceptable criticism and it would not have been necessary to protect a.m.’s personal rights. lastly, the court considered that from the published statements and quotes from a.m.’s public statements which the applicant had submitted during the proceedings it did not appear that a.m. had ever actually defended those two particular persons. the applicant was also ordered to publish an apology in rzeczpospolita. the court in principle agreed with the reasoning presented by the regional court. however, he had failed to prove that his statement had been true. it noted that in the context of that debate the phrase that someone was “a fierce defender of ... agents” suggested that that person had defended them, justified their actions and searched for a way to absolve them from any responsibility in the eyes of the public. the court also held that the phrase in question had been a statement of fact. on the contrary, he had firmly condemned such activities. he had objected to lustration being understood as a tool to destroy people and being used as an argument in political games. in particular, he referred to article 10 of the convention. on 15 june 2010 the warsaw district court ordered the applicant to publish the apology ordered by the warsaw court of appeal in rzeczpospolita. after the applicant failed to comply with that order, on 10 june 2011 the warsaw district court allowed a.m. to publish the apology in rzeczpospolita in the applicant’s name and ordered him to cover the fee for its publication in the amount of pln 23,124 (approximately eur 5,505). the applicant received a significant discount on that fee.
the first applicant was born in 1980 and the second applicant was born in 1981. one of the victims had died and the other had suffered serious injuries. she further stated that on the day her husband went to the forest she and her family were informed by a third party that her husband had met with an accident. they went looking for him and found him dead in the forest. on 16 november 2012 the gavojdia police department was informed about the incident by a third party. for involuntary manslaughter (ucidere din culpă). asked the timişoara forensic institute to produce a forensic necropsy report. with regard to the circumstances of the accident. on 6 february, 26 february and 13 may 2013 police officer c.s. by a report (referat) of 19 march 2013 police officer c.s. one of those familiar with the events which had resulted in the first applicant’s husband’s death. he had not kept a safe distance from the tree which was being towed with a flexible steel cable, so that the directions of its movement could not have been controlled. also he did not have the appropriate equipment for working in the forest. on 27 january 2014 a superior prosecutor attached to the timiş prosecutor’s office allowed the victim’s mother’s challenge, quashed the decision of 26 november 2013 (see paragraph 27 above), and referred the case back to the lugoj prosecutor’s office. in particular, a technical expert report had to be produced which could have established the cause and dynamics of the accident. on 11 march 2014 the lugoj police department decided to open a criminal investigation against l.d. on 10 june 2014 the aforementioned expert produced his report. had been sent to collect some of their belongings which had been left in a different location. the report also held that according to i.m.r. once he had realised what had happened he had stopped the tractor immediately and rushed to help the victim. in order to determine whether the moving tree had stopped or had become stuck. for assault, insult, slander and attempted murder. after the ceremony had ended he had been followed by l.d. on 27 june 2014 a prosecutor attached to the lugoj prosecutor’s office decided to close the criminal investigation in the case on the grounds that there was no evidence that the suspects had committed the alleged offence. the second applicant challenged the decision before a superior prosecutor. on 17 october 2013 the internal affairs department of the romanian police notified ldiacr that its allegations did not refer to acts or circumstances which had clearly attested that certain police officers had willfully (cu vinovăție) breached the relevant ethical and deontological standards and/or those concerning the fulfilment of their professional duties. together with two other police officers who were his brother-in-law and son-in-law, had manipulated the investigation, had tried to protect their own interests, and had attempted to distort the truth about what had happened on the day the first applicant’s husband died. it held, inter alia, that the three police officers who were the object of the denunciation were identified as i.d.d., had committed any act of abuse of office, as they had not been involved in the investigation into the first applicant’s husband’s death. had knowingly failed to fulfil or had insufficiently fulfilled his lawful duties during the investigation into the first applicant’s husband’s death, or that he had affected the legal interest of the victim’s family.
the first applicant divorced the second applicant’s father on 22 december 2008 by means of a court-approved divorce agreement. the child was to live with her mother, and her father could see her on the first and third weekend of every month, for thirty days during the summer, and for a week during the winter or spring. the agreement did not make reference to a specific address, or even a town or a city where the first applicant was supposed to live with the child. on 25 november 2009, upon a request by the child’s father for a change in the contact regime between him and his daughter, the first instance civil court approved another agreement between the parents, which extended the duration of the father’s weekend contact by a few hours. the parents also agreed that the father would collect the child from her mother’s home in kazanlak, bulgaria, and would take her back to the same location; the father could spend his time with the child at one of two specific addresses in bulgaria, located in koprivshtitsa and srednogorovo respectively. if the mother changed her address, she had to inform the father by registered mail within ten days of such a change. on 18 march 2009 the first applicant brought a claim under article 72 of the 1985 family code before the varna district court, seeking the court’s authorisation for the child to leave the country in the absence of her father’s agreement. she submitted that she was in a committed relationship with a bulgarian man who lived in the united kingdom, where he worked as a ship engineer. they intended to marry and she wished to settle in the united kingdom, and live with him and her daughter. on 30 october 2009 the varna district court rejected the first applicant’s claim for the child’s unrestricted travel abroad with only her mother, finding that it could not be in the child’s interests. more specifically, the reasons given were that the mother could not show that she had a fixed place of residence abroad, or a secure income with which to ensure her daughter’s well-being, and that the child’s absence from bulgaria would pose an obstacle to the father’s exercise of his contact rights. the first applicant appealed against the refusal to the varna regional court. she claimed that the father showed no interest in the child and did not pay any child support. his refusal to allow the child to leave the country for any period of time prevented her from taking her on holiday abroad and residing in montrose in the united kingdom, where she had a fiancé and could provide her daughter with better material conditions. the varna regional court allowed her appeal on 22 february 2010. it held that she had the necessary parenting qualities, including the ability to create an emotionally comforting environment for the child and provide her with financial support. that had been decided at the time she had been granted custody of her daughter, and had not been either challenged or refuted subsequently. the court first observed that there was conflicting domestic jurisprudence on the question of granting unlimited permission for a minor’s travel abroad in the absence of both parents’ agreement. some courts (including the second instance one in the present case) found that when a parent who had been granted custody (упражняване на родителските права) had the necessary parental skills, such permission could not be refused. examining the present case, the court relied in particular on its well‑established and binding case-law, according to which permission for a child’s unrestricted travel abroad with one parent only could not be granted because, as a matter of principle, that could never be in the best interests of the child. also, if the parent took the child to a country which was not a member of the european union, or with which bulgaria had no reciprocal agreement regarding legal assistance, the authorities would not be able to ensure that the contact rights of the other parent were enforced. turning to the specific case, the court held that the first applicant had not presented any guarantees as to where the child would be taken or how the father’s contact rights would be exercised. in any event, the first applicant had presented in the proceedings before the court only her personal assertions in respect of her future in the united kingdom, but no evidence to demonstrate the facts she claimed. she purported that she would get married; however, this was an uncertain future occurrence which did not depend solely on her will. the situation would have been entirely different, if she had been married and had settled in good material conditions in another country. however, as this was not the case, in view of the young age of the child, the court found that it was not in her interest for her mother to be granted permission to take her abroad at any time, for an unlimited duration and to unknown destinations throughout the period before the child reached majority. on 18 december 2011, a little over a year after the final judgment of the supreme court of cassation on the issue of the child’s travel, the first applicant and her partner, who was still living in the uk, married in bulgaria. he signed an initial declaration for the period between 5 january 2012 and 15 june 2012, and has apparently been signing such declarations authorising year-long periods ever since. as a result, the applicants have been able to travel to, live and study in the united kingdom, where they were at the time of their last correspondence with the court. since leaving bulgaria in january 2012, the child has been in regular contact with her father over the phone and skype, and has spent time with him every summer.
the applicant, a former police officer, was born in 1962 and lives in zaporizhzhya. on 16 september 2003 the applicant’s pre-trial detention was ordered by a court. on 23 september 2003, in the presence of his lawyer, the applicant was charged with drug-related crimes and questioned. they might have been producing drugs for their own use. on 22 december 2008 the court of appeal reviewed the case in the presence of the applicant’s wife. on 3 january 2004 the applicant’s wife lodged a criminal complaint with the zaporizhzhya regional prosecutor’s office (“the prosecutor’s office”) in which she alleged, inter alia, that her son had been unlawfully detained at the sbu’s premises between 13 and 14 september 2003. it was also observed in that letter that no violations of domestic law by the sbu officers had been established by a number of investigations into the events complained of and that the applicant’s son had stayed with the applicant at the sbu’s premises from 13 to 14 september 2003 at the applicant’s own request. on 25 january 2006 the applicant appealed to the ordzhonikidzevsky district court of zaporizhzhya against the prosecutor’s refusal of 31 july 2004 to institute criminal proceedings against the sbu officers. in particular, a cell measuring 3.8 square metres with one bed could be occupied by eight to ten persons. a bucket, which served as a toilet, was located in plain sight one metre away from the eating area. it had no cover and was emptied only once a day. detainees sick with contagious diseases, such as tuberculosis, venereal diseases, pediculosis and scabies, were held in the same cells as healthy detainees and not provided with medical assistance. m (intended for four detainees);
cell no. m, as provided for by the relevant domestic legislation. all the cells had been equipped with a toilet and a ventilation system. the sizo governor was instructed to remedy the situation. it was also recommended that the applicant consult an ophthalmologist and a neuropathologist. 20 and by an ophthalmologist from a civil hospital. the medication prescribed following the examination was administered to the applicant by the sizo. he was diagnosed with second-degree hypertension and nephropathy and was prescribed vascular and antihypertensive medication. on 29 october 2004 the applicant underwent a medical check-up. on 7 november 2005 the applicant was examined by a dermatologist. he was diagnosed with neurogenic dermatitis and prescribed the relevant medication. on 2 january 2006 the applicant was examined by a dermatologist and was diagnosed with dermatitis. he was diagnosed with symptomatic arterial hypertension and an uncomplicated cerebral crisis. 45, the applicant was examined by a group of disability experts and recognised as falling into the third (mildest) category of disability for a one-year period. from 15 december 2003 the applicant’s wife lodged a number of complaints with the sbu, prosecutors, courts and other state authorities alleging, inter alia, that the applicant had been unlawfully arrested and detained; that his health was in a critical condition; and that no relevant medical treatment could have been provided to him within the sizo. on 22 december 2003 and 9 january 2004, after a number of enquiries, the sbu informed the applicant’s wife that the applicant’s state of health was compatible with detention and that the sizo had all the necessary facilities to provide the applicant with qualified medical assistance. on 15 august 2004 the applicant’s wife asked the prosecutor’s office to provide truthful information about the applicant’s state of health and stated that adequate medical assistance could not be provided to the applicant in the sizo in view of the absence of the relevant medical specialists at the detention facility. on 2 and 23 february 2006, on the basis of the above conclusions, the prosecutor’s office informed the applicant that no violations on the part of sizo medical staff had been established.
the applicant company is a german company based in auengrund. in july 1994 the applicant company purchased land underneath which lay a limestone deposit (kalksteinvorkommen). it acquired a mining licence (bewilligung) to quarry the deposit for twenty-five years. subsequently the open-cast quarrying of limestone began. it was necessary that the applicant company operated a plant directly next to the quarry in order to process the limestone into construction material. in 1997 it received permission to use the quarry as a landfill (deponiezulassung) using waste soil from earthworks at other sites. meanwhile, the federal authorities began the planning of a new motorway with the preferred option being a route across the quarry. from 29 october until 6 december 1993 maps and documents were disclosed for public inspection in the municipality where the quarry was located. additionally, on 28 october 1993 information about the planning process was published in the municipality’s gazette. it was apparent from the disclosed documents that the quarrying operation would be affected by the motorway. the applicant company claimed that it had not been aware of the planning process when it had bought the land in 1994. only quarrying limestone in a specific area was approved and only to the extent that the route for the new motorway was not affected. consequently, the applicant company had to stop quarrying limestone in 2001 and transferred its activity to another nearby mining site. at the old site, 4,700,000 cubic metres of limestone (67% of the original volume) remained in the ground. it requested the annulment of the planning decision; in the alternative that it be stipulated in the planning decision that the applicant company be compensated for the interference in its quarrying operation; or in the alternative that it be stipulated in the planning decision that the land of thuringia was obliged to take over the quarrying operation, the remaining land and the mining licence. on 2 february 2004, after the federal administrative court had stated that the relevant part of the planning decision was not sufficiently precise, the land modified it. subsequently, the applicant company and the land declared the matter resolved (erledigt) and the federal administrative court therefore decided in 2004 to discontinue the proceedings. on 26 march 2008 the administrative office of thuringia land (landesverwaltungsamt) expropriated the part of the applicant company’s land on which the motorway had been built and decided that the federal government should compensate the applicant company by a payment of some eur 865,000. there was no formal expropriation of the mining licence. both parties requested a judicial review. pursuant to section 124(3) of the federal mining act (bundesberggesetz, see “relevant domestic law”, paragraph 22), mining rights under the terms of that act were granted only on the statutory condition that they would have to yield to a public infrastructure project without compensation. consequently, the actual right to quarry and the linked costs and losses for relocation and the impeded landfill did not generate a compensation claim. on 27 january 2010 the thuringia court of appeal dismissed a prior appeal lodged by the applicant company. the relevant provisions, section 124(3) and (4) of the federal mining act, excluded compensation claims. the clarification of the planning decision had not generated a claim regarding the impairment of the applicant’s mining rights and the business operation linked to it, including the landfill. on 14 april 2011 the federal court of justice dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant company. the enterprise could not enjoy more extensive protection under the law than the economic basis it rested on: the mining right. referring to its case-law, it reiterated that it made no difference that the applicant company was the owner of the land and, at the same time, the holder of the mining licence. under german mining law, both entitlements needed to be assessed separately. the federal court of justice further acknowledged that quarrying was de facto no longer possible.
the applicants were or are still detained in korydallos prison in athens. 1 was released on 20 february 2009, applicants no. 2 and 4 were released on 1 july 2013, applicant no. 26 was released on 24 may 2013, applicant no. 33 was released on 4 october 2013, applicant no. 34 was released on 10 may 2013 and applicant no. 35 was transferred to larissa prison on 20 june 2013. the applicants alleged that the prison had held 2,400 prisoners while it had been designed to accommodate 700. the applicants had been detained in wings a, b, d and e in various cells which all had measured 9 sq. m, including the sanitary facilities, and accommodated four or five prisoners; the living space for each prisoner had therefore been approximately 2 sq. cells designed for one person had had two beds and two or three worn-out mattresses on the floor. the toilet facilities had been partially separated from the rest of the cells. access to natural light and ventilation had been inadequate. in addition, there had been insufficient heating and hot water. there had been no adequate medical care, in particular as regards psychological and physical health. the inmates had been confined to their cells for sixteen to seventeen hours per day, as recreational or educational activities had not been provided. more specifically, inmates had been required to stay in their cells as follows: from 6.30 p.m. (on average) to 8.30 a.m. and from 11.30 a.m. to 2.45 p.m. every day. they had had to take their meals, which were of poor quality and nutritional value, inside their cells. moreover, the prison had been understaffed and had not been able to secure the prisoners’ safety. on 21 june 2013 the applicants along with other prisoners lodged a complaint with the prison authorities, protesting about their conditions of detention, but did not receive any reply. the government asserted that irrespective of the number of prisoners in each cell, which in any case had not been constant, prisoners had had access to a large yard daily from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to thirty minutes before sunset. prisoners additionally had been able to use electric heating devices. every cell had been furnished with a washbasin, a toilet, wooden shelves, a table and chairs. all the cells had had a window ensuring sufficient light and ventilation. the cells had been regularly disinfected and had been cleaned twice a day by cleaning crews consisting of detainees. as regards prisoners’ meals, the government submitted the menu of two random weeks to demonstrate that they had been comprised of a variety of food. meals had been served in the cells and prisoners had eaten at in-cell tables. prisoners had been able to play sport and each prisoner had had a personal television set with a headset. in addition, they had had the opportunity to take up one of the 640 jobs available, to take part in educational courses or to attend the “second chance” school. in cases of emergency, inmates had been transferred to the korydallos prison hospital or to an external hospital.
the first applicant is a professional photographer. since 1998 he has owned and managed a single-member limited liability company through which he operates a photography studio in plovdiv. in january 2014 the french authorities informed the bulgarian border police that a turkish national who had a permit to reside in bulgaria was suspected of forging bulgarian identity documents and providing them to turkish nationals residing unlawfully in france. electronic surveillance had showed that he had exchanged email messages with an alleged accomplice whose email account was hosted by a bulgarian internet service provider. they discussed the receipt of the photographs of two people. on 10-11 march 2014 the turkish national travelled from bulgaria to france by car, and was arrested shortly after entering french territory. two days later, on 13 march 2014, the plovdiv district prosecutor’s office applied for warrants to search the photography studio, the first applicant’s car and the applicants’ house, and seize evidence there. according to the available information, he had received assistance from the first applicant. between 3.30 and 4 p.m. the same day, a judge of the plovdiv district court, sitting in private, issued three warrants authorising the searches and seizures in the following terms:
“the submitted materials make it clear that it is necessary to carry out a search and seizure in [these places] with a view to finding the items set out in the application[s] ‑ relating to the forging of identity documents and others, relevant to the case which is the subject matter of the criminal proceedings.” the parties’ accounts of the ensuing events differ widely. according to the government, whose account was based on a statement informally obtained from one of the officers who took part in the search, the first applicant attempted to run back to the house, possibly to conceal evidence, and was only handcuffed for that reason. the officers searched the house with restraint, specifically endeavouring not to frighten the two children. they were only looking for computers, mobile telephones and similar devices, and did not rummage needlessly through things in the house. the police seized eleven sim cards, identity and other documents, a laptop computer, three mobile internet dongles, and a mobile telephone. the officers then put the first applicant in a police car and drove to the photography studio, very close to the corner of a busy pedestrian street in the centre of plovdiv, which they searched between 11.35 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. they again refused to allow the first applicant to acquaint himself with the search warrant. according to the record of that search, the officers seized three desktop computers, two video cameras, two still cameras, several flash memory cards, flash memory drives, and cash. at about the same time, between 11.15 and 11.30 a.m. the police searched the first applicant himself, without a judicial warrant. they seized three flash memory drives and two mobile telephones. according to the first applicant, he was kept in handcuffs the whole time. she kept calling her daughters and trying to call her husband throughout the day. on 6 june 2014 the investigator asked the same expert to copy the data from the laptop computer seized in the applicants’ house to an external hard drive and to inspect the three desktop computers seized in the photography studio for the presence of software or files which could be used for the forging of documents. in his report, submitted on 18 june 2014, the expert said that he had copied 192,610 files with a total size of 333,204 megabytes from the laptop computer to an external hard drive, which he enclosed with his report, and that his inspection of the desktop computers had revealed that two of them contained software programs which could be used to edit image files, and that the third computer was defective and could not be booted up. it is unclear what happened with the data copied from the laptop computer and the two memory cards. the next day, 21 march 2014, those items were given back to the first applicant. the remainder of the seized items were given back to the first applicant a little more than three months after the seizure, on 18 june 2014, immediately after their contents had been inspected by the expert (see paragraph 21 above). on 9 july 2014 the police sent the case file to the plovdiv district prosecutor’s office, recommending that the proceedings be discontinued. on 2 september 2014 that office disagreed and instead decided to stay the proceedings on the grounds that the author of the presumed offence had not been identified. on 10 september 2014 it sent the case file back to the police for further investigation. it appears that the proceedings are still pending. neither the first nor the second applicant has been charged with an offence.
on 28 april 1993 the applicant rented a municipally-owned shop in the town of primorsko. the shop consisted of a metal structure built on a concrete foundation on a municipally-owned plot of land. she also expressed the wish to buy the plot of land on which the shop was built. as she did not receive a reply, she applied for judicial review of its tacit refusal to sell the shop to her. she brought judicial review proceedings in respect of those refusals. in the meantime, in march and april 1996, the municipal company managing the shop informed the applicant that she had no lease contract for 1996 and invited her to vacate the premises. on an unknown date in 1997, that company lodged a rei vindicatio claim against the applicant. on an unknown date in 1999, the municipal company sold the shop to a private company. following a complaint lodged by the applicant with the prosecutor, on 27 may 1999 the latter established that the buyer had acted in an abusive manner and ordered the police to assist the applicant in regaining possession of the shop. according to the applicant, after she had re-entered the property she discovered that the electricity supply had been cut off. it appears that she ran the shop without electricity until an unspecified date in 2001, when the electricity supply was restored. in 2000 the buyer brought a rei vindicatio claim in court against the applicant. even though on the following day, 15 february 2006, the mayor revoked his own order, the buyer dismantled the shop on 18 february 2006 with the assistance of the police. the parties dispute what happened to the applicant’s goods and belongings. according to the government, they were listed and taken for safekeeping. according to the applicant, they were destroyed together with the shop. in a decision of february 2007 the prosecutor refused her request. on 18 october 2006 and 22 may 2008 respectively the applicant again requested primorsko municipal council to examine her privatisation proposal. the agency nonetheless held that the municipality was obliged to comply with court judgments. in the first set of proceedings, in which she challenged the mayor’s order of 14 february 2006 that the shop be demolished (see paragraph 16 above), the applicant sought damages for loss of opportunity (пропуснати ползи). the court dismissed the applicant’s claim and terminated the proceedings. that ruling was upheld by the supreme administrative court in a final decision of 17 october 2011. in the second set of proceedings the applicant sought both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages stemming from the failure of the municipal council to decide on her privatisation request by implementing the final court judgments ordering it to offer to sell the shop to her. as to the merits, the court held that the claim for pecuniary damages was unjustified and also that there was no causal link between the municipal council’s refusal to privatise the shop and the applicant’s claims for loss of financial opportunity as a result of the impossibility of buying the land and building on it. the administrative procedure concerning the privatisation of the shop had begun with the applicant’s initial request of 18 september 1995 (see paragraph 6 above) and had not been completed. the applicant, however, was not among those persons. on 5 january 2015 the applicant asked the supreme administrative court to rectify its judgment of 3 december 2014 in the part in which it had ordered her to pay the legal costs claimed by the other party (the municipal council). she pointed out that the municipal council had not presented proof that it had indeed incurred those expenses and that, in any event, the council should not be allowed to benefit from its unlawful failure to implement the judgments in her favour. the applicant sought, alternatively, a reduction in those costs. on 25 november 2015 the bailiff invited the applicant to voluntarily comply with the final judgment of 3 december 2014, indicating that failure to pay the sum due would result in the forced sale of items of the applicant’s personal movable and immovable property.
the applicants were domestic court judges. it decided to make submission to parliament to have the applicant dismissed from the post of judge for “breach of oath”. on 2 november 2010 the applicant unsuccessfully applied to the court of appeal for a copy of the decision of 26 october 2010. the hcj also considered that the applicant had incurred expenses which were manifestly incommensurate with his official income. the hcj concluded that the facts of the case suggested that the applicant had dishonoured the judicial profession and cast doubt on his objectivity and impartiality. objections raised by the applicant were rejected as unsubstantiated. the applicant instituted proceedings in the hac challenging the hcj’s decisions and the parliamentary resolution concerning his dismissal. the applicant instituted proceedings against parliament challenging his dismissal before the hac. in his claim he also argued that the conclusions of the hcj were unfounded and unlawful; there had been violations in the proceedings before the hcj. on 26 may 2010 the hcj established that the applicant had breached the judicial oath. on 17 june 2010 parliament voted for the dismissal of the applicant and adopted a resolution to that effect. on 23 september 2010 the hac considered the case. it found that the hcj’s decision was lawful and substantiated. the applicant instituted proceedings in the hac challenging the second resolution of parliament. on 31 may 2011 the hac rejected the claim as unsubstantiated. it concluded that the violation had cast doubt on the applicant’s objectivity and impartiality, and suggested that he had not duly performed his duties and had dishonoured the judicial profession. the hcj noted that the applicant had violated procedural rules when administering justice and that he had interfered with the activities of the law-enforcement authorities when they carried out a search operation. the hcj rejected objections raised by the applicant as unfounded. on 23 december 2010 parliament once again voted for the dismissal of the applicant (on the basis of the hcj’s decision of 26 may 2010) and adopted a resolution to that effect. objections raised by the applicant were dismissed as unfounded. it considered that those violations suggested that the applicant had dishonoured the judicial profession and had not acted diligently and impartially. on 12 april 2012 parliament voted for the applicant’s dismissal and adopted a resolution to that effect. by several decisions the hac refused to open proceedings, noting that the applicant had failed to prepare and submit his claim in accordance with the requirements of the caj. the applicant instituted proceedings before the hac, challenging the parliamentary resolution on his dismissal. between february and august 2012 the applicant attempted to institute proceedings in the hac, challenging the hcj’s decision. on 27 june 2012 the hac rejected the applicant’s claim as unsubstantiated. on 4 july 2012 the hac rejected the applicant’s claim against the hcj as unsubstantiated. according to the applicant, he received the full text of the decision between 24 and 26 july 2012. it noted that the hcj’s decision of 29 may 2012 had been earlier reviewed by the hac. it further found that the parliamentary procedure for the applicant’s dismissal and the resolution to that effect were lawful.
the applicant was born in 1967 and lives in lviv. between march 1995 and july 1996 the applicant underwent outpatient treatment for overactive thyroid at the state oncology centre in lviv. in july 1996 the applicant’s health deteriorated; she was examined at the state endocrinology centre in lviv and was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. from 13 november to 10 december 1996 the applicant underwent inpatient treatment for hypothyroidism at the endocrinology centre. the applicant told the doctors that her hypothyroidism resulted from the treatment with a radiopharmaceutical, j-131 (radioactive iodine), which dr s. had administered to her between march 1995 and july 1996. the doctors from the endocrinology centre recorded in the applicant’s medical file that the applicant suffered from hypothyroidism resulting from the treatment with radiopharmaceuticals. eventually, the applicant lost her thyroid and was recognized as suffering from the second highest official degree of disability. on 10 october 1997, at the applicant’s request, dr s. issued her a certificate stating that throughout 1996 the applicant’s treatment included injections of a radiopharmaceutical, namely radioactive iodine j-131. dr s. did not specify the dosage or dates on which the applicant had received the injections. in may and june 1998 the applicant complained to the lviv department of the ministry of health (“the department”) that the radiopharmaceuticals administered to her by dr s. had seriously damaged her health. the department invited the applicant to undergo a medical examination at one of the hospitals in lviv, however she refused. the department checked the records of the oncology centre and found that they contained no data as regards the applicant’s alleged treatment with radiopharmaceuticals. it was further noted that, according to the applicant’s medical records, between 1995 and 1996 her diagnosis had been unclear. that being the case, the treatment mentioned in the certificate of 10 october 1997 had been inadequate. the department recommended the oncology centre to dismiss dr s. for that reason. shortly afterwards dr s. retired from the oncology centre of her own motion. in july 1998 the applicant complained to the lviv prosecutor’s office that dr s. had treated her with j-131, that the treatment had been inadequate and that it had destroyed her thyroid. to support her complaint, the applicant submitted the certificate of 10 october 1997. in january 1999 an official investigation was launched into the applicant’s complaint which was carried out initially by the prosecutors and later by the police. in the course of the investigation the applicant, dr s. and a number of other persons were questioned. also, several forensic examinations were performed. a number of decisions were taken rejecting the applicant’s complaint principally for the reason that, according to the forensic reports, it was impossible to establish the cause of the destruction of the applicant’s thyroid. those decisions were eventually quashed for incomplete investigation. the most recent decision in that regard was taken by the frankivskyy district court in lviv on 18 january 2016, by which it instructed the police to carry out further investigation in the applicant’s case, finding inter alia that the police had failed to examine all pertinent evidence and that an additional forensic examination was necessary. the investigation has not been completed to date.
the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in kaunas. in march 2008 the applicant’s mother passed away. at the time of her death, her estate consisted of an apartment, a car, and cash savings of 6,360 lithuanian litai (ltl, approximately 1,842 euros (eur)). in her will she left half of the apartment to the applicant’s niece and the remaining property to the applicant and his sister in equal parts. brought a claim against the applicant before the kaunas district court. argued that by renouncing his part of the inheritance the applicant had violated her rights as a creditor because the inherited property could have been used to cover the applicant’s debt. therefore invoked article 6.66 of the civil code (see paragraph 23 below) and asked the court to annul the renouncement as being contrary to the interests of the applicant’s creditors. she also asked the court to recognise that the applicant had de facto accepted the inheritance because he had been using his mother’s estate since her death (see paragraph 21 below). she submitted that the applicant had been under an obligation to pay her maintenance and that he owed her ltl 8,734 (approximately eur 2,530). in march 2009 the kaunas district court decided to examine v.l. the kaunas district court held an oral hearing on 11 november 2009 in which the applicant and both claimants were present. it held that the applicant had acted in bad faith by renouncing the inheritance while being insolvent and owing money to the claimants. the applicant appealed against that judgment. was given ten days to correct the deficiencies in her appeal. on 28 january 2010 the kaunas district court held that d.l. had not submitted a corrected appeal within that time-limit so it considered that she had not appealed (see paragraph 25 below). on 3 february 2010 the applicant received notice from the kaunas district court that the civil case and both his and d.l. the applicant sent a letter to the kaunas regional court requesting a copy of the appeal. he received it on 10 april 2010 and submitted a reply on 16 april 2010. the court upheld the findings of the first-instance judgment that the applicant had acted in bad faith by renouncing the inheritance while being insolvent and owing money to his creditors (see paragraph 10 above). brought a new claim against the applicant and his sister. on 5 march 2012 the kaunas district court dismissed d.l. on that basis, the kaunas district court held that the applicant’s sister had not inherited any property which could have been used to cover the applicant’s debt to d.l., and thus there were no legal grounds to satisfy d.l. that judgment was not appealed against and became final. in march 2011 the applicant submitted a complaint to the commission on judicial ethics and discipline concerning the judge of the kaunas district court who had examined the civil case (see paragraph 10 above). ’s appeal to the kaunas regional court because that appeal had not been submitted in accordance with procedural rules (see paragraph 11 above). on 8 june 2011 the commission dismissed the applicant’s complaint. it held that although the judge had been “insufficiently attentive” and had referred d.l. the prosecutor’s decision was subsequently upheld by the courts.
the applicants, mr khamtokhu and mr aksenchik, were born in 1970 and 1985 respectively. they are currently serving life sentences in the yamalo-nenetskiy region of russia. on 14 december 2000 the supreme court of the adygea republic found the first applicant guilty of multiple offences, including escape from prison, attempted murder of police officers and state officials, and illegal possession of firearms, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. on 19 october 2001 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the first applicant’s conviction on appeal. on 26 march 2008 the presidium of the supreme court of the russian federation quashed the appeal judgment of 19 october 2001 by way of supervisory review and remitted the matter for fresh consideration. on 30 june 2008 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the first applicant’s conviction on appeal. the court reclassified some of the charges against him but the life sentence remained unchanged. on 28 april 2010 the tomsk regional court found the second applicant guilty on three counts of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. on 12 august 2010 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld that conviction on appeal.
the applicant was born in 1980 and lives in skuodas. he worked as a traffic police officer in the skuodas region. a criminal investigation was opened the same day. the applicant submitted that he did not remember hitting the children “because everything had happened very fast”. he was detained on remand and suspended from his post as a police officer. the accident attracted considerable media attention. the article stated that it was “suspected that the car was being driven by the police officer s. paulikas” because the car belonged to his mother. especially as this was not the first time that police officers, who are supposed to stop traffic violations, have themselves caused terrible accidents. on 12 november 2007 the police commissioner general and the minister of the interior resigned. a crime committed by an officer cannot be a simple statistical fact. it must be thoroughly examined and especially strictly evaluated (kruopščiai ištirtas ir itin griežtai įvertintas). many more articles in the press reported on the accident, the suspicion that the applicant had driven while being drunk, the funerals of the three children, reactions within the village, public protests in front of skuodas police station, previous traffic accidents caused by police officers, and the resignations of the minister of the interior and the police commissioner general. according to the rules of territorial jurisdiction, the case against the applicant should have been examined by the skuodas district court. who had been driving in a different car and had helped the applicant to leave the scene of the accident. however, he stated that he had not been drunk and had not exceeded the speed limit. he also argued that the accident had been caused by the weather and the reckless actions of some of the children. excerpts of the testimony of many of the witnesses, both in favour of and against the applicant, as well as the applicant’s final statement, were reprinted word-for-word. on 17 march 2008 the klaipėda district court found the applicant guilty of both charges. it examined a video-recording from the restaurant where the applicant and m.k. had stopped after lunch showed the applicant buying two more bottles of vodka. on the basis of that evidence, the court found that before the accident the applicant had consumed between 200 and 250 grams of alcohol. by failing to do so, he had breached article 144 of the criminal code (see paragraphs 29-30 below). however, the fact that the victims had been minors was considered as an aggravating circumstance. as a result, the klaipėda district court held that the applicant’s punishment should be close to the maximum provided by law (see paragraph 29 below). the applicant appealed against the judgment. however, the klaipėda regional court accepted the applicant’s argument that the age of the victims should not have been considered as an aggravating circumstance because the criminal offence had not been premeditated. the prohibition on driving a vehicle for three years was upheld. however, the court held that the first-instance judgment had been well-reasoned and based on reliable evidence, so there were no grounds to find that the judges had been influenced by the media or the statements of any of the officials. it stated that the appellate court had provided an adequate examination of the applicant’s complaints concerning the fairness of his trial and that there was no need to re-examine them. in january 2015 the applicant was released on probation.
the applicant was born in 1980 and lives in vilnius. on 5 march 2009 the applicant and his grandmother’s neighbour, 88‑year-old j.s., signed a contract on lifelong maintenance (išlaikymo iki gyvos galvos sutartis). transferred the rights to her apartment to the applicant, who undertook to take care of her until she died by providing her with food and medication, looking after her apartment, walking her dog, and providing any other necessary assistance. lodged an application with a court to terminate the contract on the grounds that the applicant had not fulfilled his obligations and had not been taking proper care of her. the applicant objected to the termination and argued that he had complied with the terms of the contract. relying on the testimony of several witnesses, on 29 january 2010 the vilnius regional court, in an oral hearing at which both the applicant and j.s. ’s application and annulled the contract. the applicant appealed, arguing that he had complied with the terms of the contract and that it should therefore not have been terminated. on 11 october 2010 the court of appeal held an oral hearing at which j.s. ’s lawyer was present but the applicant and his lawyer were not. according to the government, a notification letter was sent to the applicant on 21 september 2010. during the hearing the court noted that the applicant had been notified of the hearing (apie posėdį pranešta) and proceeded to examine the case in his absence. the court of appeal delivered its judgment on 22 october 2010, upholding the first-instance judgment in its entirety. the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the supreme court. he complained, inter alia, that he had not been duly notified of the hearing before the court of appeal and had thus been unable effectively to defend his interests. the applicant submitted that he had received the notification about the time and place of the hearing by standard (non-registered) post only on 14 october 2010, when he had found it in his letter box. however, on 4 november 2010 the supreme court refused to examine the applicant’s cassation appeal as raising no important legal questions. the applicant lodged two other cassation appeals, but on 6 december 2010 and 10 january 2011 the supreme court refused to examine them, citing the same grounds as previously.
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in tržišče. his company runs a car repair shop which is also authorised to remodel cars intended to be used for competition. he was also suspected of the criminal offences of forgery, certifying false documents as genuine and smuggling. the applicant requested the return of the car several times because he needed it for future competitions from which he could not withdraw owing to contractual obligations towards his sponsors. he also insisted that he had not committed any of the offences he was suspected of. on 19 march 2003 the novo mesto district court approved the request. on the same day he competed in a hill climb race with the leased car. he also competed with it in hill climb races on 19 april 2003, 30 may 2003, 23 august 2003 and 13 september 2003 and in rallies on 16 may 2003, 4 july 2003, 5 september 2003, 3 october 2003 and 17 october 2003. on 26 may 2003 customs offences proceedings were instituted against the applicant. on 27 may 2003 the customs office issued a seizure order in respect of the same car on suspicion that the applicant had in december 2002 avoided paying duties when importing the car into slovenia. it calculated the amount on the basis of documents submitted by the applicant. in the note, the market value of the vehicle was set at eur 34,000. on 7 july 2003 the applicant paid the customs duties and the car was returned to him. he submitted in writing at the same time that he had only paid the customs duties to prevent further losses. on 30 june 2004 the proceedings for customs offences were discontinued because prosecution had in the meantime become time-barred. he claimed eur 74,600, the amount he had paid to lease another car. on the same day the trebnje local court dismissed the charges of forgery and the certification of false documents. on 21 august 2007 the ljubljana district court dismissed the applicant’s application to reopen the proceedings. after a successful appeal, the proceedings were reopened on 2 april 2008. in the reopened proceedings the parties submitted the following arguments. he also submitted that the customs office’s seizure order had been issued only on 27 may 2003 and was thus irrelevant to the question of liability for damage. such a process included obtaining new approval papers and the registration of the vehicle as a special vehicle. he pointed out that he had finished that process and obtained all the necessary documents once the car had been returned to him. the search warrant had been general and lacking in precision and therefore could not be subjected to any scrutiny. however, the court found that the causal link between the unlawful seizure and the damage incurred by the applicant had been broken because the applicant would in any event have been unable to use the car for several reasons. secondly, no customs duties had been paid on parts that had been imported and then used in the car. he had only been able to complete that process later, after the car had been returned to him. he also referred to the fact that subsequently he had not encountered any problems in obtaining the necessary certificates in order to register the car. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (revizija), challenging the conclusions of the court in respect of the break in the causal link and arguing that the loss had already been incurred before the issue of customs duties had arose. on 17 december 2009 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law, confirming that the link in causality had been broken because the applicant had imported some of the car parts in violation of customs regulations.
in 1961 the applicants’ predecessors were deprived of certain land in favour of the state. on 26 january 2006 the niš municipal court ordered pik niš (the debtor), a company predominantly comprised of socially-owned capital, as the end user of that land, to pay the applicants specified amounts on account of the compensation for the land in question. on 25 october 2006 and 1 february 2007 respectively, upon the applicants’ request to that effect, the niš municipal court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor to pay the applicants the enforcement costs. this judgment became both, final and enforceable by 16 august 2006. only one applicant, mr tomislav đorđević, never lodged an enforcement request. on 3 june 2009 the niš commercial court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor (st. only one applicant, ms milica nikolić jajčević, duly submitted her claims therein. these insolvency proceedings are still ongoing. on 2 march 2009, 31 august 2009 and 9 june 2010 respectively, all applicants lodged their constitutional appeals. on 17 march 2011, 4 april 2012 and 23 may 2012, respectively, the constitutional court found a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time in respect of all applicants, except mr tomislav đorđević. however, the court did not award the applicants any damages, merely stating that the applicants “had not claimed non-pecuniary damages”. the constitutional court dismissed the appeal in respect of one applicant, mr tomislav đorđević, since he had failed to request enforcement of the judgment in question.
the applicants – a married couple – were born in 1967 and 1955 respectively and live in colletorto. to that end, they contacted a moscow-based clinic. on 16 february 2011 the russian clinic certified that the second applicant’s seminal fluid had been used for the embryos to be implanted in the surrogate mother’s womb. her written declaration, bearing the same date and read aloud at the hospital in the presence of her doctor, the chief physician and the head of the hospital department, is worded as follows (english translation of the original russian version):
“i, the undersigned... have given birth to a boy in the ... maternity hospital in moscow. the second applicant, who had remained in italy, was able to communicate with her regularly via internet. on 10 march 2011 the applicants were registered as the new-born baby’s parents by the registry office in moscow. on 29 april 2011 the first applicant went to the italian consulate in moscow, with the birth certificate, in order to obtain the documents that would enable her to return to italy with the child. the italian consulate issued the documents enabling the child to leave for italy with the first applicant. on 30 april 2011 the first applicant and the child arrived in italy. on 16 may 2011 the minors court placed the child under guardianship at the request of the public prosecutor. according to the report, the child was in excellent health and his well-being was self-evident, since he was being cared for by the applicants to the highest standards. the applicant explained that this practice was perfectly legal in russia and had made it possible for her to obtain a birth certificate which identified the applicants as parents. on 27 june 2011 the applicants were heard by the minors court. the result of these tests showed that there was no genetic link between them. by an immediately enforceable decision of 20 october 2011, the campobasso minors court ordered that the child be removed from the applicants, taken into the care of the social services and placed in a children’s home (casa famiglia). a court-appointed expert witness was then instructed to establish whether the minor child was the biological son of giovanni campanelli. in her report the court-appointed expert witness, ms [l.s.], on the other hand, it has been established that the minor [t.c.] at the present time the only certainty is the identity of the woman who gave birth to the baby. accordingly, it is necessary to remove the minor child from mr campanelli and mrs paradiso and place him in an appropriate structure with a view to identifying a suitable couple to foster the child as soon as possible. in the light of the conduct of mr campanelli and mrs paradiso during the events under examination, all of this throws a consistent shadow over their possession of genuine affective and educational abilities and of the instinct of human solidarity which must be present in any person wishing to bring the children of others into their lives as their own children. the applicants lodged an appeal (reclamo) before the campobasso court of appeal. the applicants challenged the preventive seizure order. in november 2012 the public prosecutor transmitted the decision regarding the preventive seizure to the minors court and indicated that a conviction under section 72 of the adoption act would deprive the applicants of the possibility of fostering (affido) the child and of adopting him or other minors. according to the public prosecutor, the child seemed destined for another separation, even more painful than that from the mother who had given birth to him and then from the woman who claimed to be his mother. an appeal having been lodged to contest the registry office’s refusal to enter the particulars of the russian birth certificate in the civil‑status register, the larino court declined jurisdiction on 29 september 2011. in the court of appeal’s view, given that there was nothing to show that the child had russian citizenship, the applicants’ argument that italian law was inapplicable ran counter to section 33 of the private international law act, which stated that the legal parent-child relationship was determined by the national law governing the child at the time of his or her birth. all contact between the applicants and the child was prohibited. they were unable to obtain any news of him. it seems that those proceedings are still pending.
the applicant was born in 1948 and lives in donetsk, ukraine. on the morning of 23 august 2001 the applicant had a fight with d. in the course of which blows were exchanged. at least three people witnessed the fight. the applicant submits that he did not yield to such pressure and did not make any statements nor confess to committing the murder. however, the arrest report refers to 15 september 2001. on the latter date the district court ordered the applicant’s detention on remand. it is not clear from the applicant’s submissions whether he appealed against that court decision. on 26 november 2001 the indictment was approved by the district prosecutor and sent to the district court. on 11 december 2001 the district court took over the case and commenced the trial. on 10 september 2002, after four hearings, the district court found the applicant guilty of the murder of d. and sentenced him to eleven years’ imprisonment. on 13 june 2004 the applicant refused the assistance of his lawyer, alleging the latter’s collusion and incompetence, and on 21 july 2004 the applicant requested that the court appoint another specified lawyer to represent him. on 21 and 30 july 2004 the district court dismissed all those requests. in june and july 2004 additional forensic examinations were held. in another special ruling given on the same day, the court informed the head of police of its subordinates’ failure to bring the applicant to the courthouse for the hearings scheduled for 9 march, 28 and 29 july and 2 august 2004 notwithstanding the court’s requests; such a failure, according to the court, had delayed the examination of the applicant’s case. at this stage of the proceedings the applicant again challenged the lawfulness of the minutes of the court hearings, obliging the district court to give interlocutory decisions. the applicant further appealed against the judgment of 2 august 2004. on 29 march 2005 the applicant repeatedly refused the assistance of his lawyer, alleging his collusion and incompetence. according to the government, on 9 december 2005 the applicant refused legal assistance from any lawyer. according to the applicant, he familiarised himself with that decision on 28 november 2007. 2948 (акт судово‑медичного освідування) concluded that these injuries had been caused two or three days before the examination, during a fight or in self‑defence. the applicant denies that he had made that statement. according to the government, both decisions were sent to the sizo for the applicant’s information. in fact, a copy of the decision of 20 june 2002 was not sent to him until 11 june 2008. on 9 december 2005, having examined the applicant’s appeal against the judgment of 2 august 2004, the court of appeal remitted the case to the district court and ordered the local prosecutor’s office to hold an inquiry into the applicant’s complaints of alleged ill-treatment in the course of the pre-trial investigation. on 7 february 2006 the district court remitted the case to the prosecutor in compliance with the appellate court’s instructions. according to the government, the prosecutor sent the copies of the earlier decisions of 13 april and 20 june 2002 to the court and the latter was satisfied with them. on 27 february 2004 the district court dismissed the request, limiting its reasoning to a statement that “there [were] no grounds for replacing the applicant’s detention on remand with a non-custodial preventive measure”. in the operative part the court noted that its decision could be appealed against to the court of appeal. on 12 october 2006, the latest available decision, the local police again refused to institute the requested proceedings. it appears that the applicant did not challenge the aforesaid refusals before any domestic court.
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in riga. 37586/06, § 49, 2 november 2010 and case-law cited therein), including a property consisting of a plot of land and buildings in jurmala which had belonged to a private person m.g. after the regaining of independence, in 1991 property reform legislation came into force in latvia and provided that former owners or their heirs could reclaim nationalised property by submitting a request to the local municipality by 1 june 1994. in 1998 the jurmala municipality land commission divided the property into two plots on the grounds that no one had requested the restoration of property rights to the land previously owned by m.g. on 19 july 2000 the cabinet of ministers issued order no. instituted proceedings in the jurmala city court, with jurmala municipality as the defendant. she requested the restoration of her property rights to the whole nationalised real estate. on 2 february 2001 the jurmala city court ruled in favour of v.p.e. during the court hearing a representative of jurmala municipality supported the claim and confirmed that the property was not the subject of any dispute. however, she had not completed the process owing to ill health. the judgment was not appealed against and became final on 29 february 2001. at the time the judgment was adopted the ministry of finance had not been registered as the owner of the contested property (see paragraph 10 above). was registered in the land register as the owner of both plots of land. on 21 and 22 may 2001 she sold the contested property to the applicant for 39,000 latvian lati (lvl) (about 56,000 euros (eur)). the objection was based on the grounds that the jurmala city court had wrongly applied the land reform legislation, that it had not been competent to hear the case and that it had not taken into consideration the important evidence of order no. 349, by which the state had become entitled to the contested property. most importantly, jurmala municipality had failed to inform the jurmala city court about evidence that was pertinent to the restoration of v.p.e. as defendants and jurmala municipality as a third party. when he had purchased it and that he should enjoy protection as a bona fide acquirer of the property. 349 (see paragraph 41 below), the riga regional court recognised that the state had acquired the contested property in 2000. to return him an amount equal to the value of the contested property. they had allegedly already been transferred to the state. the senate agreed that the appellate court had erred in considering that the contracts concluded between the applicant and v.p.e. on 12 november 2003 the supreme court again decided to annul the purchase contracts concluded between v.p.e. ’s and the applicant’s property rights in the land register, and to recognise the state’s property rights. after the applicant submitted an appeal on points of law, the senate of the supreme court on 3 march 2004 quashed the supreme court’s judgment of 12 november 2003 and remitted the case to that court. the ministry of finance, being the lawful owner of the contested property, could file a property claim against any person who had taken possession of its property. however, the claimant could not seek to annul a contract to which it was not a party and therefore the ministry’s claim in relation to that was dismissed. on 29 september 2006 the lease rights were entered in the land register. the long-term lease is valid until 31 august 2030.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in simferopol. in 1990 the applicant graduated from the ukrainian printing and publishing institute with a diploma in technological engineering. in june 1997 the applicant asked n., the director of tavrida, to place him on the reserve list for promotion to an engineering position corresponding to his qualifications. having received no follow-up, in 2000 the applicant applied for the second time. on 6 march 2000 this application was refused. on an unspecified date in 2000 the applicant appealed to the central district court of simferopol (hereinafter “the central district court”) seeking, in particular, to oblige his employer to consider him for an engineering position. in the summer of 1997 the human resources department had obtained from the military enlistment office a certificate stating that the applicant had indeed been dispensed under article 5b, which read as follows: “psychosis and psychotic disorders connected to organic cerebral lesions with residual moderately manifested deviations in the mental sphere”. the defendant company further noted that as the applicant had not provided any subsequent information concerning his state of health, his appointment to an engineering position – which implied managerial responsibilities and supervision of other employees – was considered unwarranted. a copy of the certificate issued by the military enlistment office was provided to the court for examination during the public hearings. b., the applicant’s supervisor questioned by the court during the trial, submitted that the applicant had been a diligent employee. however, in his view he lacked the necessary personal skills to occupy a position with managerial responsibilities. in particular, occasionally the applicant had been involved in conflicts with his colleagues. all of them, when questioned by b., had suggested that they did not want to have the applicant as their supervisor. in august 2003 the applicant was appointed as a foreman and in april 2006 as an engineer-technologist. in october 2000 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against tavrida seeking damages and apologies from its management for his purported defamation resulting from the dissemination of information concerning the medical grounds for his dispensation from military service. he alleged, in particular, that the defendant company had had no right to enquire of the enlistment office in 1997 about the grounds for his dispensation, to use this information in deciding on his promotion and to disseminate it to his direct supervisor and other colleagues, as well as to communicate it to the court in the framework of the civil dispute. on 23 january 2001 the central district court rejected the applicant’s claim as lacking legal basis. the court also noted that section 46 of the information act expressly restricted dissemination of confidential medical information. on 23 july 2003 the central district court took a fresh decision rejecting the applicant’s claims, referring, again, to article 7 of the civil code and having found that there was nothing unlawful either in tavrida’s or its director’s personal conduct with respect to the processing of the disputed information. without referring to any legal provisions, the court noted that the director had been authorised to know the reasons for the applicant’s dispensation from military service, as this information had been a part of the personnel record compiled and kept by employers in the ordinary course of business. in doing so, the director had acted within the limits of managerial discretion. the applicant appealed against this decision. should his employer have had any doubts concerning his psychiatric health, it could have asked the applicant to provide a current medical certificate of fitness for work. in addition, the applicant noted that the central district court had not cited any references to any legal provisions entitling employers to enquire without their employees’ consent about the reasons for their dispensation from military service, and to have them recorded in their personnel files. in the applicant’s view, this information was not pertinent to his ability to perform engineering duties. on 1 december 2003 the court of appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal, upholding the final conclusions reached by the central district court, but having amended the reasoning. on 30 november 2006 the kyivskiy district court of simferopol rejected the applicant’s claim as unsubstantiated. at the same time, it noted that the scope of individual involvement of each of the defendants in collecting and processing this information was not entirely clear. in any event, this processing had been lawful, as according to applicable law, the human resources departments were obliged to keep the military duty records of their staff on file and to synchronise them with the military enlistment offices. on 24 january 2007

“using a distorted form of the plaintiff’s patronymic and last name ... breaches the plaintiff’s right to a name and to a good name, which is unacceptable under the law. since the defendant committed a breach of the plaintiff’s intangible assets by way of distorting his patronymic and last name in a negative way, the latter shall have the right to compensation in accordance with article 152 of the civil code. [the contested extracts] undermine the honour and dignity of the plaintiff as a person, pedagogue and musician because they contain negative information about the plaintiff presented in an affirmative form. pursuant to article 152 § 1 of the civil code, the burden to prove the truth of the allegations is on the defendant, who did not submit any evidence to the court showing that the impugned statements were true.” the town court awarded the plaintiff 5,000 russian roubles (rub) in damages and directed the applicant to publish a retraction on his website. on 23 october 2008 the supreme court of the komi republic dismissed an appeal by the applicant. it endorsed the findings of the lower court in a summary judgment. it held that article 10 of the convention had not been breached because “the defendant published statements on the internet which undermined the honour and dignity of the plaintiff as a person, pedagogue and musician and which contained negative information about him”.

[the applicant] was kept in the police station and before the investigator for less than three hours, which means that he was not ‘arrested’ [or] ‘detained’ within the meaning of article 92 of the ccrp.” it turned out later on that there had been a mistake in the summons: the interview was planned for 7 april 2006. on 14 april, 23 may and 1 june 2006 the investigator issued orders for the applicant to be taken to the investigating authority (article 113 of the ccrp). according to the government, the police did not enforce these orders since the applicant was not present at his residential and office addresses. it appears that the investigating officer issued summonses for further interviews to be held on 28 and 31 july 2006. it also appears that the applicant did not attend the interview on 31 july 2006. a further decision to bring the applicant in for interview was issued on 1 november 2006. on 2 november 2006 investigator b. issued a decision ordering the authorities to determine the applicant’s whereabouts and suspending the investigation. thus, he ordered that the applicant be brought before him on 25 december 2006 at 3 p.m. 36. it is unclear whether the applicant left the police station at 5 or 7 p.m. 37. according to the government (who referred to the police station’s logbook), the applicant was kept in the police station without being locked up between 3 and 4 p.m. and was then taken before the investigator. by a judgment of 15 january 2007, the district court rejected his claim. apparently, on an unspecified date this decision was quashed. in october 2005 she employed the applicant as a legal consultant. it appears that on an unspecified date he was appointed as the managing director of the firm. according to the applicant, on 13 october 2006 several officers, including the investigator, arrived in the office. he made no request for a lawyer to be present during the search. before the beginning of the search [the applicant] made no request for counsel while having had access to the search order ...

the applicant was born in 1967 and lives in bar (montenegro). on 6 february and 4 march 2009 the applicant entered croatia from montenegro and deposited – on each occasion – the sum of eur 90,000 with a commercial bank in dubrovnik, without declaring these amounts to the custom authorities. on 2 june 2009 the money laundering prevention office (ured za sprječavanje pranja novca) informed the financial inspectorate of the ministry of finance (ministarstvo financija, financijski inspektorat, hereinafter “the ministry”) that on 30 march 2009 the applicant had ordered a transfer of eur 95,000 from his bank account to the account of a certain mr s.k. the money laundering prevention office stated that the funds had originated from the two above-mentioned cash deposits of eur 90,000 each. on the same day, 2 june 2009, administrative offence proceedings (prekršajni postupak) were instituted against the applicant before the administrative offences council (vijeće za prekršajni postupak) of the ministry for his failure to declare the sum of eur 180,000 while entering croatia, an administrative offence as defined in section 40(1) of the foreign currency act and section 74 of the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism act (see paragraphs 16-17 below). on the same day the administrative offences council ordered the bank to transfer eur 180,000 from the applicant’s account to the ministry’s account, to be kept there until the conclusion of the administrative offence proceedings. on 1 july, 17 august and 17 september 2009 hearings were held before the administrative offences council. in his defence, the applicant explained that he had sold business premises in montenegro, and that he had intended to use the money gained from that sale to purchase a flat in podgorica (montenegro) from a croatian national, s.k., who had insisted that the money be paid to him from a croatian bank account. the applicant provided a written copy of the contract of sale in respect of his business premises dated 25 december 2007, and a preliminary agreement relating to the purchase of the flat in podgorica dated 18 march 2009. by a decision of 19 october 2009 the administrative offences council found the applicant guilty of the administrative offence in question and fined him 10,000 croatian kunas (hrk). at the same time, the administrative offences council imposed a protective measure (zaštitna mjera), confiscating the eur 180,000 pursuant to section 69(2) of the foreign currency act (see paragraph 16 below). the administrative offences council held that the evidence presented did not corroborate the applicant’s defence. in particular, while the applicant had indeed submitted a preliminary agreement relating to the purchase of a flat in podgorica which had been concluded between himself and s.k., that agreement had been concluded two weeks after the commission of the offence, and the sale price indicated in it (eur 125,000) did not correspond to the amount he had brought into croatia. the administrative offences council also held that its decision to apply the protective measure was influenced by the fact that the applicant had been unable to provide sufficient evidence to justify his earlier money transfers to accounts in tunisia and jordan belonging to s.k. ’s wife, totalling eur 882,900 in the period between 2005 and 2008, and the fact that he had stated that he had opened a non-resident’s account in his name in order to do a favour to s.k., namely in order to transfer money from the sale of s.k. ’s wife’s house, deposited on his account, to s.k. with respect to the scope of the confiscation and the amount of the fine, the administrative offences council held as follows:
“with this type of administrative offence, what is important for the purposes of ordering a protective measure is whether the statements of the accused can be supported by relevant documents. if, in terms of amounts and dates, there is no link between the transfers whereby the accused acquired the funds and the business transactions for which those funds were intended, or if [those transfers] do not have a basis in lawful transactions, the administrative offences council cannot apply section 69(4) of the foreign currency act, which allows that, in particularly justified situations where special mitigating circumstances exist, the authority adjudicating on the administrative offence may decide not to confiscate or confiscate only in part the cash that was the object of the offence. earlier transfers from [the applicant’s] account and the motives for opening that non-resident’s account also influenced the decision to impose the protective measure ...
in determining the amount of the fine the [administrative offences] council took into account [the applicant’s] admission of guilt and the absence of a criminal record as mitigating circumstances, and the value of the object of the administrative offence as an aggravating circumstance. [ therefore] it imposed a fine which corresponds to the gravity of the offence.” the applicant appealed by arguing, inter alia, that the imposition of the protective measure of confiscation was disproportionate in the circumstances and therefore contrary to article 1 of protocol no. in so arguing, he referred to the court’s case-law, in particular to the case of gabrić v. croatia (no. by a decision of 23 december 2009 the high court for administrative offences (visoki prekršajni sud republike hrvatske) dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the administrative offences council’s decision, endorsing the reasons given therein. the applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint, alleging, inter alia, a violation of his constitutionally protected right of ownership. by a decision of 9 december 2010 the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible on the grounds that the case did not raise a constitutional issue.

the applicants were born in 1970 and 1935 respectively and live in sofia and ruse. father of the second applicant and grandfather of the first applicant, and his son p.r., father of the first applicant, owned a plot of land and a house in popovo. by two decisions of the mayor of 9 may 1988 and 27 february 1989 the property was expropriated with a view to constructing a residential building. the decisions, based on section 98(1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973 (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство – hereinafter “the tupa”), provided that d.d. was to be compensated with a two-room flat in a building which the municipality planned to construct on the expropriated plot, and p.r. with the right to build a house on municipally owned land. in 1989 the expropriated house was pulled down and in 1994 construction work was started on the site. by a supplementary decision of 19 april 1991, based on section 100 of the tupa, the mayor specified the exact location and size of the future flat to be offered to d.d. no supplementary decision was issued however with regard to the right to build a house on municipally owned land which was due to p.r. passed away in 1998 and 2002 respectively, and d.d. this left the two applicants as heirs of d.d., and the first applicant as sole heir of p.r. on an unspecified date in 2005 the applicants requested that the mayor of popovo revoke the expropriation order in respect of their predecessors’ property, under paragraph 9(2) of the transitional provisions of the territorial planning act (закон за устройство на територията, see paragraph 17 below). the mayor did not respond, which under domestic law was considered a tacit refusal. after the applicants applied for judicial review, the refusal was upheld by the courts, in judgments of the targovishte administrative court (“the targovishte court”) and the supreme administrative court of 9 march and 11 july 2006 respectively. following a fresh request by the applicants for the revocation of the expropriation order, in judgments of 10 november 2006 and 25 april 2007 the targovishte court and the supreme administrative court annulled a new tacit refusal on the part of the mayor, acknowledging that the preconditions for such a revocation had indeed not been met, but instructing the mayor to examine the applicants’ request under paragraph 9(1) of the transitional provisions of the territorial planning act, providing for the possibility of monetary compensation (see paragraph 17 below). as the mayor failed once again to take a decision on the applicants’ request, on an unspecified date they challenged his new tacit refusal, which was annulled once again by the targovishte court and the supreme administrative court, in judgments of 27 september 2007 and 3 april 2008 respectively. following that, on two occasions (3 june 2009 and 15 june 2010) the mayor refused expressly to revoke the expropriation order in respect of the applicants’ property. after the applicants challenged these refusals, they were found to be null and void by the courts, the first one in a final judgment of the supreme administrative court of 21 may 2010, and the second one in a judgment of the varna administrative court of 25 march 2011. the courts, finding that the fresh refusals were in contradiction with the earlier court judgments in cases between the same parties, sent the case back to the mayor, instructing him once again to examine it under paragraph 9(1) of the transitional provisions of the territorial planning act. in april 2011 an expert commission of the municipality assessed the value of the expropriated property and set the amount of compensation to be provided to the applicants at 67,300 bulgarian levs (bgn). after the applicants challenged that amount, in a judgment of 21 december 2011 the targovishte court increased it to bgn 83,500. that sum was paid to the applicants in june 2012.
the applicant was born in 1955 and is currently serving a prison sentence in dnipro. on 20 december 2005 a panel of judges and lay assessors of the odesa regional court of appeal, sitting as a first-instance court, found the applicant and eighteen other persons guilty of different crimes which they had committed as a gang in the odesa region between 1995 and 1999, including banditry, illegal possession of firearms, theft, robbery, burglary, infliction of bodily injuries and murder. the applicant was sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment with confiscation of property. during the investigation and trial the applicant either refused to give any statements concerning the charges against him or denied that he had committed any crimes. according to the applicant, the presiding judge on the panel of the court of appeal dealing with his case had not been impartial, as allegedly he and the investigator in the case had studied together at the same law school and one of the witnesses had been the judge’s relative. the applicant provided no document in that regard. allegedly in protest to the unlawful manner in which his case was heard by the first-instance court, on 20 may 2005 the applicant stitched up his lips together and went on hunger strike. in this connection, the applicant underwent a medical examination, according to which he had no mental illness. the applicant’s appeal against his conviction 11. the applicant’s request was granted and he was given the file to study on many occasions between march 2006 and february 2007. allegedly that period was too short and sometimes the applicant had to study the case file together with several other convicts in one cell. consequently, he did not familiarize himself with the entire case file. on 17 march 2006 the applicant lodged his initial appeal with the supreme court, challenging the judgment of 20 december 2005. the applicant mainly argued that his conviction had been based on false evidence. in july 2006 the applicant asked the court of appeal to appoint a lawyer to assist him in the preparation of his appeal and in the proceedings before the supreme court, as he had no money to hire a lawyer. a judge of that court replied to the applicant that he had to request the local bar association to appoint him a lawyer. the applicant lodged a similar request with the odesa bar association. on 30 october 2007 the supreme court, having heard the applicant’s and his co-defendants’ appeals, found that the trial had been held in compliance with the procedure and that the first-instance court’s findings of fact had been based on sufficient evidence. while upholding the applicant’s sentence, the supreme court partly changed the applicant’s conviction. in particular, the charges of theft were excluded as not based on the correct application of law. in march 2006 the applicant lodged the present application with the court, while he was being detained at odesa pre-trial detention centre (“the sizo”) since august 2001. according to the applicant, the sizo authorities persecuted him in that connection. in particular, on 22 november 2007 he was allegedly beaten by the sizo guards and sustained a head injury. the applicant was given no medical assistance as regards his injury and was placed in an isolation cell until 21 december 2007. between 22 november and 21 december 2007 the applicant allegedly could not sent letters to the court. on 21 december 2007 the applicant was transferred to dnipropetrovsk correctional colony (“the prison”) to serve his sentence. subsequently, the guards took the applicant for medical examination, which did not reveal any serious health issue. in connection with this incident the applicant was disciplined and placed in an isolation cell for fifteen days. on 7 december 2011 the applicant was disciplined and placed in an isolation cell for fourteen days for having insulted and threatened prison guards. the government stated that the applicant’s letters had been duly dispatched by the sizo and prison authorities and that the prison authorities had joined to those letters copies of the documents from his prison file which the applicant had asked them to send.
the applicants were born in 1944, 1964 and 1966 respectively and live in razgrad. her husband and father of the other two applicants, owned a house with a yard and garage in razgrad. by a decision of the mayor of 28 june 1988 the property was expropriated with a view to constructing a residential building. the decision, based on section 98(1) of the territorial and urban planning act (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство – “the tupa”), provided that the first applicant and h.p. were to be compensated with a flat and a garage. by a supplementary decision of 24 july 1991, based on section 100 of the tupa, the mayor determined the exact location, size and other details in respect of the garage to be offered in compensation, which was to be located in a residential building which the municipality planned to construct. had to pay for the cost of the garage that was not covered by the value of their expropriated property 4,479 old bulgarian levs (bgl). it appears that at the time they did not pay that sum, which has since then devalued significantly. on unspecified dates the flat due to be given to first applicant and h.p. the expropriated house and garage were pulled down. in 1996 the mayor of razgrad offered the first applicant and h.p. the building where the garage offered to them was to be situated was never constructed. in 2006 the municipality authorised the construction of another building by a private investor in the same place, which did not include garages. in a letter dated 18 august 2006 the mayor advised the first applicant and h.p. that they could request financial compensation for their expropriated property in lieu of compensation with a garage. in reply, they stated that they did not want such compensation and insisted on receiving a garage. passed away and was succeeded by the three applicants. on an unspecified date in 2010 the applicants brought an action in tort, seeking pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages for the allegedly unlawful failure on the part of the razgrad municipality to build and provide them with a garage. the action was dismissed by the supreme administrative court in a final judgment on 16 november 2011. it noted that the municipality had not acted unlawfully and had offered various solutions which the first applicant and her husband had rejected.
the applicant is a lawyer who also writes articles for various russian law journals and online legal information databases and networks. according to the applicant, his work usually requires extensive scientific research, including in the field of law enforcement in the khabarovsk region. he supported his assertion with copies of contracts with well-known russian publishing houses and owners of a number of legal magazines, including one supervised by the secretariat of the president of the russian federation. under the contracts he undertook the task of writing articles on specific topics of legal and social interest. having received an assignment to write an article on prostitution and the fight against it in the khabarovsk region, on 12 may 2009 the applicant wrote to the head of the khabarovsk region police department by registered letter, asking for statistical data for his research. ...
[i] stress that i do not need any specific personal information about individuals found administratively or criminally liable; [i only need] general statistical information for writing a scientific article.” it appears from an acknowledgement of receipt that the letter reached the khabarovsk region police department on 25 may 2009. under russian law, state officials must provide a reply to letters from individuals within thirty days. in the absence of any response, on 26 june 2009 the applicant lodged a claim with the tsentralniy district court of khabarovsk (“the district court”), complaining that the police authorities had failed to provide him with the information he had requested and requesting for access. relying on the information act (see below) and article 10 of the convention, he argued that the officials’ implied refusal to provide him with the information had been unlawful as he had not asked for access to any confidential personal information, state secrets or information related to internal police working methods. he claimed that his request had related purely to statistical data of a general nature collected by the information centre of the khabarovsk region police department (hereinafter “the information centre”). on 18 july 2009 the applicant received a letter from the head of the information centre, notifying him that information as specific as he had asked for could only be collected on production of a written order issued by a deputy minister of internal affairs, a head of a regional or municipal police department or their divisions or a prosecutor or investigator from a prosecutor’s office. the information centre did not collect such information at the request of private individuals. general statistical data summarised by the information centre was provided to the federal service of state statistics and in particular its regional office for the khabarovsk region, to whom the applicant could apply for the statistical data. on 19 july 2009 the applicant wrote to the khabarovsk region service of state statistics (hereinafter “the statistics service”) by registered letter, asking for the statistical data for his research. on 23 july 2009 the head of the statistics service replied, stating that specific statistical information on the fight against prostitution had never been provided by the khabarovsk regional police department. the applicant filed copies of his letters from the information centre and statistics service with the district court. on 4 august 2009 it dismissed the applicant’s claim on the grounds that the information centre was not authorised to process data requests from private individuals. under domestic law, the statistics service was tasked with dissemination of official statistical data on a broad variety of subjects, including those falling within the applicant’s field of interest. it also noted that the applicant had failed to obtain the information sought from open sources, such as libraries, archives and the internet. the district court also stressed that the information requested did not touch upon the applicant’s rights and legitimate interests, so the authorities’ refusal to grant him access to such information had been lawful and well-founded under section 8(2) of the information act. the applicant appealed, arguing, among other things, that the police authorities had exclusive possession of the information sought by him and that he had no other means, including through assistance from the statistics service, of obtaining the necessary data. in addition, he submitted that the fact that his rights and legitimate interests were not affected by the requested information had no bearing on the case as under russian law, it was not only those directly concerned who were granted access to public information. on 16 september 2009 the khabarovsk regional court upheld the judgment of 4 august 2009. relying on section 8(2) of the information act, it concluded that the authorities were not obliged to provide the applicant with the information as it did not touch upon his rights and legitimate interests.
the applicant was born in 1933 and lives in moscow. on 15 march 1994 the russian ministry of railways (“the mps”) approved the construction of garages alongside the oktyabrskaya railway in moscow. on 14 april 1994 the main directorate for architecture and planning of the architecture and urban development committee of the government of moscow (главное архитектурно-планировочное управление комитета по архитектуре и градостроительству г. on 3 december 1994 the applicant joined the gsk and paid his share for a garage (6,500 united states dollars (usd) at the material time). the lease provided that the land plot was allocated for further use of 324 garage boxes and 86 open parking spaces situated on it. that lease agreement remained in force until 31 august 2004. under the agreement the lease was valid until 28 february 2004. the parties subsequently extended the validity of the agreement on three occasions: until 28 july, 30 september and 31 december 2004 respectively. thereafter they tacitly renewed the agreement for an indefinite duration. the gsk continued to pay the rent due under the lease until 31 july 2007. under clause 1.3 of the lease agreement, the land plot was allocated for placement of garage boxes. clause 2.2.10 stipulated that at the end of the lease, all temporary structures were to be removed. on 5 march 2008 the federal agency for state property management responsible for moscow signed a lease agreement with the rzd in respect of the plot of land on which the garages were situated. the district court held as follows:
“it follows from the case-file material that on 3 march 2003 the federal state unitary enterprise “oktyabrskaya railway of the mps” and the gsk signed a lease agreement in respect of a plot of land situated within a railway right of way [полоса отвода железной дороги] for the purposes of reimbursement of its maintenance costs, valid until 28 february 2004, which was subsequently extended on the basis of additional agreements. 17-fz of 10 january 2003 on the railway system in the russian federation. 17-fz of 10 january 2003 on the railway system in the russian federation, railway land is land used or intended for maintaining the activities of rail transport organisations and/or for buildings, constructions, structures and other rail transport facilities, including plots of land situated within railway rights of way and safety areas. 3020-1 of the supreme soviet of the russian federation of 27 december 1991 on the division of state property in the russian federation; and federal law no. no documents have been provided by the defendant or the gsk confirming their right to use the land underneath the garage either. the rzd is the user of the plot of land in question. ...
to support his assertion about the lawfulness of his possession of the disputed garage, the defendant submitted to the court a certificate issued by the gsk confirming that he had paid in full his share for the garage. the defendant’s garage [is] an unauthorised construction because it was built on a plot of land that was not allocated for that purpose in accordance with the procedure provided for by law and in the absence of permission issued by a competent authority, whereas a railway right of way can be used exclusively for the construction of rail transport facilities. the approval by the prefect of the local administration of the inspection certificate does not confirm the existence of permission by the federal authorities to use the plot of land in question for building garages, regard being had [to the fact] that the owner of the plot is the russian federation and not the city of moscow. 169 had it not been an unauthorised construction. 169 from the plot of land with cadastral number 77:02:21017:032 ...” 22. he claimed, in particular, that he was entitled to compensation. on 10 february 2012 the moscow city court upheld the above judgment on appeal. on 3 april 2012 the ostankinskiy district bailiffs’ service in moscow instituted enforcement proceedings. the applicant was notified on 12 april 2012. as the applicant refused to comply voluntarily with the judgment of 21 november 2011, as upheld on appeal on 10 february 2012, the rzd proceeded to demolish his garage. on 19 june 2012 the enforcement proceedings were terminated.
the applicant was born in 1981 and lives in niš. from the applicant’s custody and, in so doing, assaulted the latter physically, knocking her unconscious. on 5 august 2005 a bailiff accompanied the applicant to the respondent’s home, requesting that the child be surrendered. on 20 september 2005 a new attempt was made to enforce the interim order, this time in the presence of a psychologist from the doljevac social care centre, civilian police officers, the enforcement judge, a bailiff and the applicant. the child started to cry and refused to go with the applicant. the applicant was of the opinion that the child had been given instructions and put under pressure and was in fact strongly attached to her. she wanted to take the child immediately, regardless of her behaviour. she also noted in the minutes that the parents should cease their manipulation of the child. on 3 october 2005 the first meeting between mother and child was held on the premises of the centre, but the applicant later told the court that it had not been successful because the child was allegedly subjected to pressure by her father. after leaving the premises of the niš social care centre, the applicant and respondent and other persons present started to fight. the respondent and the child did not appear. on 29 may 2006 the next enforcement attempt was made. according to his representative, he had not been properly summoned. both gave their opinion concerning the forced return of the child to her mother, the psychologist from niš contending that it was the only option, since the father was not willing to hand over the child voluntarily, and the psychologist from doljevac arguing against it, on the basis that it could have a negative influence on the child’s further development. throughout the meeting he claimed that he was willing to hand over the child to the mother but that the child was refusing to cooperate. on 25 december 2006 the court asked the niš mental care institute to prepare an opinion concerning the enforcement of the interim custody order because of the difficulties encountered in the proceedings. the report contained the opinions of a psychologist, a sociologist and a neuropsychiatrist, all of whom had conducted interviews with the child and both her parents. they also found that both parents were manipulating the child and not doing what was in her best interests. to remain with her father since a separation could prove psychologically detrimental. in addition, the supreme court found that there was no evidence that the respondent had committed acts of violence against the child or the applicant. she also argued that the supreme court’s ultimate ruling on the issue of a.c. on 18 august 2008, acting upon the applicant’s initiative, the niš municipal public prosecutor requested the revocation of the respondent’s probation, but withdrew the request on 16 december 2008 because the respondent had in the meantime been granted custody of a.c. to contribute towards her maintenance on a monthly basis. himself no longer had any objections to this arrangement. moved to the applicant’s flat shortly thereafter. for failure to make maintenance payments. however, it seems from the documents submitted by the government that the mother-daughter relationship was not well re-established. kept returning to her father whenever she had a misunderstanding with her mother. moved to her father’s home and it appears that she is still living with him by choice. and that those proceedings are still pending.
the applicants were convicted in russia of various crimes. the applicants and their lawyers, except for mr yakupov, whose lawyer was present, were refused leave to attend the appeal hearings on the ground that their presence was unnecessary or without addressing this issue at all. following communication of the cases, the supervisory-review courts quashed the appeal judgments at the prosecutor’s request and remitted the cases for fresh examinations before the appellate courts. in most of the cases the applicants and their lawyers were present at the new appeal hearings. mr trifonov and mr sidelnikov did not ask for leave to appear and did not attend the new hearings, but they were represented by lawyers. detailed information about the applicants’ attendance and dates of the hearings is set out in appendix ii. on 12 november 2002 criminal proceedings were initiated against mr zakhodyakin. since then the criminal proceedings were suspended and reopened several times. on 26 june 2007 the vuktyl town court of the komi republic found the applicant guilty of abuse of office and sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment. on 24 august 2007 the supreme court of the komi republic upheld that judgment on appeal. on 8 october 2008 the presidium of the supreme court of the komi republic quashed the judgment of 24 august 2007 and remitted the case for a fresh examination. on 7 november 2008 the supreme court of the komi republic upheld the judgment of 26 june 2007. on 3 october 2012 the presidium of the supreme court of the komi republic quashed the judgment of 7 november 2008 and remitted the case for a fresh examination. on 18 december 2012 the supreme court of the komi republic upheld the judgment of 26 june 2007.
the applicant was born in 1972 and lives in șopârlița. the evidence proved that his injuries were not caused deliberately by the police officers. from 1 to 3 july 2013 the applicant was in bagdasar‑arseni emergency hospital in bucharest. according to a medical report produced upon his discharge from hospital, he was diagnosed with a cervical spine injury and a minor cranial cerebral trauma. on 3 july 2013 the applicant’s father lodged a criminal complaint against police officers c.b. on the grounds that they had physically abused his son. on 12 september 2013 the applicant took up (şi‑a ȋnsuşit) the criminal complaint lodged by his father against the police officers. he stated, inter alia, that his son had not been suffering from a psychological illness. afterwards, they had dragged him away and banged his head against a metal gate owned by m.v. his mother stated, inter alia, that the police officers had not allowed her son to get dressed, had chased him through the courtyard, and had tripped him. on 31 october 2013 the olt county forensic medical service examined the applicant and the available medical documents. subsequently, he had been transferred to the hospital’s psychiatric unit and had been sedated. the following day he had started complaining of pain in his cervical spine area, and of paralysis of his right hand. he had been examined and had been diagnosed with a cervical spine injury. most probably, the injury had been caused by a forced rotation movement of the neck when the applicant had been immobilised and handcuffed. the applicant had needed seventy to eighty days of medical care from the moment of his injury. had arrived at the scene of the incident, they had asked the applicant to calm down and accompany them to the police station. moreover, in such a case, it would have been highly unlikely that an individual would call the emergency services for no reason. according to the prosecutor, those arguments were also supported by the fact that, in the medical report produced by the psychiatric unit of slatina emergency hospital, where the applicant had been taken after the incident, it was stated that the applicant was suffering from a polymorphic personality disorder, which was aggravated by alcohol consumption. the prosecutor also held that the applicant was known in his village as a violent and aggressive person with psychological problems. the following day he had started complaining of a cervical spine injury, which had eventually required surgical treatment. ’s and the applicant’s parents’ testimonies that the applicant’s head had repeatedly been banged against m.v. also, the police officers had stated that they had not hurt the applicant, and had confirmed that he had been drunk, and that he had been transported and admitted to hospital. on 29 january 2014 a more senior prosecutor attached to the olt prosecutor’s office dismissed the applicant’s challenge as ill-founded, and upheld the decision of 10 january 2014. the applicant appealed against the decision of 29 january 2014 before the slatina district court. in particular, they had foreseen the result of their actions, and even if they had not intended that result, they had accepted that it was a possibility. had not committed the offence of abusive behaviour. the court further held that, according to the available medical evidence, the applicant had been in an extreme state of psychomotor agitation, and the cranial x-ray had not shown any post-traumatic injury of the skull. they had occurred in circumstances where he had been drunk, violent and extremely agitated, and therefore the police officers could not have controlled their actions towards him. on 8 june 2015 the caracal branch of an office specialising in expert medical assessment of a person’s ability to work, which was attached to the olt retirement agency, acknowledged that the applicant was suffering from a serious functional deficiency and had completely lost his ability to work.
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in tryszczyn. in 2005 the applicant filed a court complaint that m.k. in 2006 the applicant’s meetings with his son were on some occasions made impossible by the mother, but most of them took place. wanted to reduce the amount of time the applicant could spend with j. she also indicated her intention to move to germany with her son for financial reasons. had been interfering with his contact visits. the applicant asked the court to order that he be able to see his son twice a month from 10 a.m. on friday to 7 p.m. on sunday; one day at christmas or easter from 10 a.m. to 10 a.m. the next day; and three weeks in the summer holidays and one week in the winter holidays. moved to germany with the child without the applicant’s consent. had joint custody of j. under polish law. on 14 january 2008 the german central agency communicated the above decisions to the polish ministry of justice. the applicant was informed on 15 january 2008. the mother and the child returned to poland on 6 january 2008. it was agreed that the applicant would be informed whenever j.’s place of residence changed. to contact j. when the child was under his care and agreed that he would not see the child on 19 and 20 july 2008 as well as on 18 and 19 july 2009. the court ordered the preparation of several expert opinions. the applicant contested the conclusions of the opinions. on 19 march 2011 the bydgoszcz district court dismissed the applicant’s application to order that j.’s place of residence be with him, leaving the child in m.k. retained joint custody of j. the court established that in the period up to 2008 the bond between the applicant and the child had weakened considerably owing to a lack of contact between them. however, their relations had significantly improved because after the settlement of 1 april 2008 contact between the applicant and his son had taken place without disturbance. on 19 may 2012 the applicant asked the court to further modify the contact arrangements. applied to annul the settlement of 29 september 2009. the boy, eleven years old at the time, stated that he no longer wished to see his father. he stated that the applicant had paid no attention to him during visits and that he had been allowed to play computer games all day. on 28 may 2013 the bydgoszcz regional court quashed the interim order of 19 february 2013. asked the court to order that contact should take place every other weekend and be in her or her parents’ presence because j. had not seen the applicant for a long time and would feel unsafe with him. the boy was accompanied by his mother and was aggressive and hostile to the applicant. at a hearing on 24 june 2014 the applicant declared that he was no longer attending the meetings because of his son’s disruptive and aggressive behaviour. the last meeting took place in november 2013. on 8 september 2014 the rodk issued another report which stated that the boy had been loyal to his mother and had turned away from the applicant. the court again ordered the parties to have counselling so they could learn how to reach agreement with each other. it appears that he withdrew the claim at an unspecified later date.
the applicants were accredited journalists who were authorised to report from the national parliament. soon thereafter, parliament security officers entered the chamber. they pulled the speaker out of the chamber and started forcibly removing the opposition mps. the applicants denied that the reasons for their removal had been explained to them. the applicants contested that there had been live stream while the ejection of the opposition mps had been ongoing, given that the cameras had allegedly been turned against the walls. according to the government, several people were injured in those protests. in a letter of 26 december 2012 addressed to the media, the speaker stated, inter alia:
“having regard to the announcements (најави) that the opposition would not allow the budget act to be adopted and that there would be protests and incidents, i requested, under section 43 of the parliament act, that the parliament security service ensure proper work at the session. as speaker, i regret that such a measure regarding the journalists was taken ...” 9. in a letter dated 6 january 2013, the dcps informed the applicants that a group of mps had surrounded the speaker during the incident of 24 december 2012, and had attempted to physically confront him. they had also insulted and threatened him, whilst at the same time damaging technical equipment. however, the disturbance in the chamber had continued. in the circumstances, the speaker had requested, under section 43 of the parliament act (“the act”, see paragraph 17 below), that the parliament’s security service restore order so that the discussions could continue. journalists had been asked to leave the gallery until order was restored. all that threatened the security in the parliament. most of the journalists understood the seriousness of the situation and complied with that request. a smaller group of people in the gallery, including [the applicants], confronted the security officers, disregarded their orders and resisted actively and passively. on 14 june 2013 the president of the state set up an ad hoc commission of inquiry regarding the events in the national parliament of 24 december 2012. it was composed of five national members, two of whom were mps. it further included two non-national observers appointed by the european union. with regard to the lawfulness of the measures taken, the applicants argued that section 43 of the act could not be interpreted as allowing the forcible removal of journalists from the gallery by parliament security officers. accordingly, they had not and could not have contributed to the disturbance in the chamber. the disturbance in the chamber continued. most of the journalists complied with that instruction. as a result, a [security] officer sustained an injury to his leg. when the debate was over, the video material was made available to the public on that website ...
...
the above provisions of the parliament act [see paragraph 17 below] and the rules of parliament [see paragraph 23 below] ... provide that the speaker is responsible for maintaining order in the parliament. in the event of disorder, he or she can take several measures (warning, denial of the right to speak, exclusion of mps). ...
the legal ground for the impugned measure was section 43 of the parliament act, which specified who was responsible for keeping order in the parliament building – a special security unit, and which authorised the speaker to decide and take measures in the event of disturbance of that order by mps and other external persons participating in the work of parliament. in this connection it is to be noted ... that a larger group of mps assaulted the speaker, who was immediately removed from the chamber by security officers. in such circumstances, the parliament security service considered that in order to protect the journalists in the gallery, they should be moved to a safer place where they would not be in danger. after they left the gallery, [the applicants] and other media representatives were allowed to remain in the parliamentary press centre ... from where they could have followed the live broadcast on the parliament website and on the dedicated tv channel.
the applicant was born in 1940 in troschenreuth, in the former german democratic republic (gdr), and lives in bayreuth. the applicant is the natural and only daughter of mr a.w., she lived in the territory of the former gdr until 1984, while her father lived in the federal republic of germany (frg), having married. the father and the daughter corresponded regularly during that period. between 1954 and 1959, the applicant also visited her father and his wife once a year. after the applicant obtained an exit permit in 1984 for herself, her husband and her younger daughter, she left the gdr and moved to bavaria. thereafter the applicant visited her father on a regular basis until 2007. on 14 january 2009 the applicant applied to the memmingen district court for the right to administer her father’s estate, asserting the incapacity of her father’s wife to protect the applicant’s inheritance due to a grave illness, and notified the district court of her inheritance claims. furthermore, she asked to receive copies of all documents relating to the estate. she asserted that between 2002 and 2007 she had regularly visited her father at his retirement home and had talked to him on the telephone. subsequently, her own health had prevented her from visiting. telephone calls had been impossible because her father’s health had meant he had no longer been able to use a telephone. the retirement home had been in possession of her address and telephone number, and had phoned her on several occasions. in a decision of 28 january 2009 the memmingen district court dismissed the applicant’s application, as there were no indications that the applicant’s father’s wife could not protect the inheritance. in addition, being born before 1 july 1949 and thus not being a statutory heir, she had no right to receive copies of documents about the estate. on 6 february 2009 the applicant appealed to the memmingen regional court, arguing in particular that she needed the power to administer the estate because her father’s wife suffered from dementia and that she was a statutory heir because she was her father’s natural daughter. in a decision of 23 february 2009 the memmingen regional court upheld the district court’s decision refusing to give her the power to administer her father’s estate, holding that the applicant was not a statutory heir and thus had no right to apply. the regional court referred to the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act of 19 august 1969 (see paragraph 15 below) and to a decision of the federal constitutional court of 8 december 1976, in which the provision had been found to be in conformity with the basic law (see paragraph 16 below). on 8 march 2009 the applicant appealed to the munich court of appeal, arguing that the application of the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act would discriminate against her and breach her inheritance rights and was therefore not in conformity with the basic law. the applicant pointed out that in her case there was no need to protect the legitimate expectations of the deceased or other heirs as she was her father’s only daughter and her father had been separated from his wife for more than ten years when he had died. furthermore, cultural and social changes within society had to be considered when interpreting the basic law. in the court of appeal’s view, the provision did not contravene the basic law, despite german reunification, as the federal constitutional court had held in a decision of 20 november 2003 (file no. on 17 july 2009 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the federal constitutional court, claiming discrimination as a result of the application of the aforementioned provision. according to her there were no apparent reasons why children born outside marriage should be treated differently from those born within marriage. that was particularly true in her case because she was her father’s only child. the applicant argued that the munich court of appeal, when considering an appeal, had to respect article 6 § 5 of the basic law, which provided that children born outside marriage must be provided by legislation with the same opportunities for physical and mental development and for their position in society as those enjoyed by children born within marriage. that provision prohibited a generalised application of the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act. in a decision of 8 december 2009 the federal constitutional court declined to consider the complaint, which it considered inadmissible for lack of sufficient substantiation (no. it observed, in particular, that the applicant had failed sufficiently to address the arguments of the munich court of appeal’s decision. as the applicant doubted the validity of the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act, which had previously been declared valid by the federal constitutional court, she had been obliged to give further reasons, which she had failed to do.

at the time when the application was submitted, the applicant was serving a sentence of imprisonment in oslo, norway. in december 2004 a group of individuals transported a considerable quantity (possibly three tons) of hashish (which in the netherlands is a banned substance) from one hiding-place to another. throughout the ensuing criminal proceedings he claimed to be innocent. the prosecution sought an eight-year prison sentence. it sentenced the applicant to four years and six months’ imprisonment. both the applicant and the prosecution appealed. further adjournments were ordered, on the same ground, on 18 january 2008 and 4 april 2008. the court of appeal held a scheduling hearing (regiezitting) on 23 september 2008. two more adjournments were ordered, one until 2 december 2008 for the purpose of securing the attendance of further witnesses and one until 24 february 2009 to allow the applicant’s new counsel, who had replaced the lawyer who had conducted the applicant’s defence at first instance, to acquaint himself with the case file. at the hearing of 24 february 2009 it was decided that the hearing on the merits of the case would be held on 18, 19 and 27 may 2009. on 26 march 2009 the applicant was released, having served two-thirds of the sentence handed to him by the regional court. he asked for the applicant to be brought to the netherlands a few days before the following hearing so as to consult with him. on 29 march 2010 the applicant received a summons at his detention address in norway to appear at the hearing of the amsterdam court of appeal to be held on 1 and 4 june. on 10 may 2010 the applicant’s counsel sent an e-mail to the advocate general (advocaat-generaal) to the court of appeal, with a copy to the president of the criminal division, restating his request for the applicant to be brought to the netherlands in advance of the hearing of the court of appeal and announced his intention to oppose resumption of the hearing if this were not done. on 25 may 2010 the applicant’s counsel informed the court of appeal by e-mail of his intention to seek an adjournment of the coming hearing. in so doing, the court of appeal will base itself on the following facts and circumstances:
-  the present case began in 2005. -  the [applicant] was released on 26 march 2009. the [applicant] was to remain in pre-trial detention until at least 4 november 2009. the hearing on the merits could therefore not be held on 27, 29 and 30 2009 october as planned and was moved to 1 and 4 june 2010. -  counsel and [applicant] have had sufficient time to prepare the defence before the hearing on the merits [planned for] 18, 19 and 27 may 2009, which hearing was postponed until 27, 29 and 30 october 2009 only shortly before [it was due to begin]. it does not make any difference that the [applicant] was arrested in norway on 4 october 2009. the hearing was continued on 4 june 2010. the applicant’s counsel conducted the defence in the applicant’s absence. the fact that the court of appeal did not react in so many words to counsel’s suggestion that the outcome of the norwegian criminal proceedings should be awaited does not change this. the sentence reflecting the decision that all parts of the request had been refused] was sufficient. furthermore, the suspect appeared at the first instance hearings alongside his counsel, in addition to several appeal hearings which he attended together with his counsel. contrary to the argument made by the drafter of the point of appeal, the court of appeal was under no obligation to consider the seriousness of the charges against the applicant in deciding on the request for an adjournment but it was at liberty to consider the presence of counsel authorised to conduct the defence and the length of the criminal proceedings. it would appear that the applicant returned to the netherlands at some time in mid-2013. on 27 january 2011 the oslo district court convicted the applicant of drugs offences and sentenced the applicant to eleven years’ imprisonment. this judgment became final on 14 december 2011.

he is currently serving a sentence in a prison in panama. following an undercover operation set up by the police with the help of two undercover agents, the applicant and a dutch national, v.d.p., were arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking. in november 2002, the prosecutor’s office attached to the timişoara court of appeal committed the applicant and his co-accused for trial for drug trafficking and the case was registered with the arad county court. the applicant’s counsel asked the court to hear evidence from the undercover agents. his request was refused on the ground that the anonymity of the undercover agents was protected. following another request lodged by the applicant’s counsel, on 5 march 2003 the court ordered the prosecutor to submit the authorisations it had issued for the undercover operation. the applicant’s counsel claimed that his client had committed the drug offence only after being incited to do so by the undercover police agents. on 9 april 2003 the arad county court convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment. the county court imposed a lenient sentence in the light of the applicant’s good behavior after his arrest and the fact that he had pleaded guilty as charged. the court based his conviction on the report drafted by the undercover agents after the applicant had been caught red-handed, as well as a search report and the statements given by the applicant and his co-accused. the applicant appealed, complaining, inter alia, that the undercover agent had overstepped the legitimate limits of investigation by inciting him to sell drugs. by a decision delivered on 25 june 2003 the timişoara court of appeal increased his prison sentence to ten years’ imprisonment. it held that the good behaviour of the applicant after he had committed the offence could not justify a lenient sentence. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. in his grounds for appeal he did not complain about the unlawfulness of his conviction but only about the length of his sentence. he requested the appellate court to impose a milder sentence and accordingly, to overturn the decision of the timisoara court of appeal and to uphold the judgment of the arad county court by which he had been convicted to only three years’ imprisonment. by a final decision delivered on 27 november 2003, the supreme court of justice dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as unfounded. the applicant was detained in jilava prison between 25 july 2003 and 6 january 2004. the applicant alleged that he had been kept in poor hygienic conditions in overcrowded cells. the water provided had been of very poor quality, being of a yellow colour, smelling and containing worms. sometimes, there had been no water – either for drinking or for the toilet. the food had also been of very poor quality. the government contended that the records held by the prison authorities concerning the cells’ size and their occupancy rate were no longer available as the archives for that period had been destroyed, pursuant to the domestic law. however, as regards the general detention conditions in jilava prison the government submitted that every cell had been equipped with two squat toilets connected to the water network and separated from the rest of the room by a wall. it had been possible to let in fresh air by opening the window to each cell. the prisoners had been allowed to take one hot shower per week in the communal bathrooms located in each section of the prison (between nineteen and twenty-three showers had been available). the applicant had been allowed to walk outside his cell for thirty minutes each day.
the applicant was born in 1986 and lives in botârlău. on 23 february 2007 x, a plain-clothes police officer from the buzău county police organised crime unit, approached the applicant in a nightclub. according to a report drafted on 1 march 2007, the meeting had been planned in order to verify information received by the police that the applicant might have been dealing drugs. the report mentioned that x had discussed with the applicant, who claimed that he could get drugs and promised to call with more details. in a second report drafted on 14 april 2007 it was stated that the applicant had called x to ask whether he was interested in buying 2,000 ecstasy tablets at a cost of 10 euros (eur) each. a request to intercept his telephone conversations and make ambient voice recordings was authorised by a judge of the buzău county court. on the same date the prosecutor from the organised crime department authorised the use of x as undercover police agent in order to determine the facts of the case, identify the offenders and obtain evidence. the report also mentioned that the applicant had replied on several occasions that he was not in possession of the drugs, which were to be brought into the country by friends of his who had not yet returned from abroad. in the early evening of 19 july 2007 the applicant called x and set up a meeting for later that evening. x was accompanied by y, a colleague in plain clothes. the four of them drove to a petrol station where a meeting had been arranged with c.a.o. as the deal got underway in the car park of the petrol station, the case prosecutor and ten police officers suddenly intervened and arrested the applicant, c.a.o. the police operation was recorded on video. on 25 october 2007 the applicant was indicted with c.a.o. on 17 january 2008 the applicant and c.a.o. and x because the latter had asked him whether he could get drugs for him. moreover, x had set the price for the drugs. stated that the drugs found on him had been for his own personal use and that he had had no intention of selling them. on 14 february 2008 the court heard evidence from x, g.c. and one of the witnesses proposed by the applicant who appeared in court. the buzău county court gave judgment on 22 february 2008. it convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment. the conviction was based on the reports of 1 march and 14 april 2007 and the offence report of 19 july 2007 (see paragraphs 6 and 10 above), as well as on transcripts of the applicant’s telephone conversations with x, ambient recordings of discussions between x and c.a.o. and the in-court testimonies given by the applicant, the co‑defendants and x. the court considered that the applicant’s allegations that he had been incited by x were clearly disproved by the above‑mentioned evidence taken as a whole. the applicant appealed against the judgment. he alleged that x had exceeded his authority and that y should have also been called to testify in court. on 26 may 2008 the ploieşti court of appeal rejected the appeal. the statement of y was irrelevant to the case since he had not directly witnessed the deal. the court considered that the applicant had not been incited by x since it was apparent from the evidence in the file that he had called the officer on several occasions and had planned the meeting of 19 july 2007 (see paragraph 10 above). the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (recurs), reiterating his previous arguments.
the applicant company is a joint-stock company incorporated under moldovan law. ms roșca was born in 1984 and lives in chișinău. on 23 february 2000 the economic district court ordered the applicant company to pay another company, e., 1,908,145 moldovan lei (mdl) (equivalent to 152,190 euros (eur)). on 14 july 2005 e. sought to restart the time-limit for the enforcement of the judgment dated 23 february 2000, arguing that it had been unable to initiate enforcement proceedings within the three-year statutory period because the bailiff had lost the original writ of enforcement. on 2 may 2006 the economic court of appeal, by a final judgment, dismissed e.’s application as being ill-founded, noting that a duplicate of the writ had been issued in 2003. on 17 december 2008 the economic court of appeal upheld an application by e. for a revision of the judgment, quashed the decision of 2 may 2006 and allowed the statutory time-limit to run anew. the court did not reply to the applicant company’s contention that the application was time‑barred. after communication, e. initiated enforcement proceedings and the applicant company paid mdl 294,405.37 (equivalent to eur 18,400). on 28 february 2007 the ciocana district court acknowledged the applicant’s entitlement, as a young family, to a plot of land for construction purposes. the court ordered the tohatin local administration to grant the applicant ownership of such a plot of land. as there was no appeal, the judgment became final on 20 march 2007. the applicant sought enforcement of the judgment of 28 february 2007, but to no avail. on 11 february 2009 the tohatin local administration lodged an application for a revision of the judgment, arguing that the applicant had not qualified as a young family because her husband had died in 2006 and she had therefore lost her entitlement to any land. on 22 april 2009 the ciocana district court dismissed the application for revision, finding that the applicant had requested the plot of land in 2005. her husband’s death had not qualified as a new circumstance because the local administration had been aware of that matter at the time of the proceedings. on 24 june 2009, in the applicant’s absence, the chișinău court of appeal allowed the appeal, quashed the decision of 22 april 2009 and upheld the application for revision. it also quashed the ciocana district court’s judgment of 28 february 2007 and delivered a new judgment on the merits that dismissed her claims as unsubstantiated. after communication, the applicant brought a civil action, claiming damages for a violation of her right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time, pursuant to law no. she referred to the period of twenty-six months between 20 march 2007 and 24 june 2009, during which the judgment of 28 february 2007 had not been enforced. on 16 march 2012 the rîșcani district court found for the applicant, acknowledged a violation of her rights and awarded her mdl 450,000 (equivalent to eur 27,250) in respect of pecuniary damage, mdl 66,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and mdl 38,193 for legal costs. the court noted that the compensation for pecuniary damage represented the average market price of a plot of land of 0.09 ha. it said that it had used the reference size of 0.09 ha because the tohatin local administration had granted plots of that size when executing similar judgments in respect of young families. on 25 october 2012 the chișinău court of appeal, by a final judgment, found the length of the proceedings to have been excessive, which it attributed to the acts of the authorities. it awarded the applicant mdl 30,000 (equivalent to eur 1,895) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and mdl 5,000 (equivalent to eur 316) for costs and expenses. the court dismissed the remainder of the claim, noting that the applicant had failed to substantiate alleged costs for renting alternative accommodation and finding that no compensation for the land should be awarded because the judgment acknowledging her entitlement to that land had been quashed.
according to the last information received by the court on 6 october 2016, the applicant is detained in lisbon. on 5 december 2013 criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicant by the public prosecutor of the department of investigation and prosecution (departamento de investigação e ação penal) in sintra in respect of allegations of him having committed the crimes of coercion (coação), aggravated attacks upon the physical integrity of a person (ofensas à integridade física qualificada), rape (violação), and failing to assist a person in danger (omissão de auxílio). on 2 june 2014 the public prosecutor issued a european arrest warrant (“eaw”) in respect of the applicant in order to secure his presence before a judicial authority to be questioned (primeiro interrogatório judicial). on 28 august 2014 the applicant was arrested in the united kingdom. under the eaw issued by the portuguese authorities, he was surrendered to the portuguese authorities on 27 february 2015. on 27 february 2015, the applicant was given the status of defendant in the criminal proceedings against him (constituição de arguido) and questioned by the investigating judge (primeiro interrogatório judicial). on the same day, the investigating judge remanded the applicant in custody. on 19 march 2015 the applicant lodged an appeal with the lisbon court of appeal, challenging the lawfulness of the decision remanding him in custody, pursuant to article 219 § 1 of the code of criminal procedure. on 2 april 2015 the investigating judge declared the appeal admissible and requested that the public prosecutor be asked to submit observations on the applicant’s appeal. on 27 april 2015 the public prosecutor submitted observations on the applicant’s appeal. on 29 april 2015 the investigating judge ordered that the applicant be notified of the public prosecutor’s observations and that the file be sent to the lisbon court of appeal. on 4 may 2015 the file was sent to the lisbon court of appeal. on 11 may 2015 it was received and distributed. on 13 may 2015 the public prosecutor issued an opinion on the appeal, pursuant to article 416 of the code of criminal procedure. the applicant was subsequently notified of the opinion and given ten days to reply, pursuant to article 417 of the code of criminal procedure. on an unknown date, a judge rapporteur appointed to the case made a preliminary examination of the applicant’s appeal and prepared a draft decision which was presented to two other judges. the judge rapporteur’s analysis of the appeal was afterwards put on the agenda for discussion by the judge rapporteur and the two other judges. on 24 june 2015 the applicant lodged a habeas corpus application with the supreme court, claiming that the lack of analysis of his appeal in respect of the lawfulness of the decision placing him in pre-trial detention had violated article 5 § 4 of the convention. he further argued that the time-limit of thirty days established under article 219 § 1 of the code of criminal procedure had not been complied with. therefore, his pre-trial detention had been unlawful. on 2 july 2015 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s habeas corpus application. examining the effects of the thirty-day time-limit on pre-trial detention orders, it considered that the thirty-day time-limit on pre-trial detention orders simply constituted a guiding principle illustrating the urgency of such matters. it further noted that the lack of a speedy review of an order remanding a person in custody did not constitute a ground for a habeas corpus application under article 222 of the code and pointed out that article 219 § 1 did not, in any case, stipulate the maximum length of any pre-trial detention. in this regard, the non-compliance with the thirty-day time-limit did not mean that the applicant’s pre-trial detention had been unlawful. on 2 july 2015 the lisbon court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the investigating judge’s decision of 27 february 2015 to hold him in pre-trial detention.

“the [present] appeal on points of law does not comply with the requirements laid down in article 213 of the code of administrative justice, as the applicant failed to pay the court fee and to provide a number of copies of the appeal on points of law corresponding to the number of persons involved in the proceedings ...
[the court decides to] set for gavrilov v.v. a deadline of 1 november 2005 for rectifying the shortcomings of the appeal on points of law submitted by him. [the court brings to] the attention of gavrilov v.v. that if he fails to rectify the above shortcomings, in accordance with article 108 of the code of administrative justice, the appeal on points of law will be returned to the applicant and considered not submitted.” the applicant dispatched his rectified appeal on points of law by registered post on 24 october 2005. it appears that the applicant resubmitted several copies of the appeal dated 30 august 2005 accompanied, in accordance with the instructions of the higher administrative court of ukraine, with proof of payment of the court fee. according to the acknowledgment of receipt form, the letter was received by the court registry on 27 october 2005. on 7 november 2005 the higher administrative court of ukraine adopted a decision which stated, inter alia, as follows:
“gavrilov v.v. failed to rectify the shortcomings indicated in the ruling [of 17 october 2005] within the time-limit granted by the court, the appeal on points of law should, therefore, be considered as not submitted and be returned to the applicant.”
the applicant, mr volodymyr oleksandrovych kryvenkyy, is a ukrainian national who was born in 1934 and lives in velyki gadomtsi. on 25 march 1997 the applicant obtained a certificate (cертифікат на право на земельну частку (пай)) attesting his entitlement to a nominal 3.61-ha share of the land belonging to the v.g. at the same time, according to him, he was allocated a specific plot measuring 3.61 ha, which, he had farmed and paid land tax on since that time. a neighbouring collective farming company, which was designated as its successor. subsequently the two farms separated again. closed joint stock company for the exploitation of kaolin deposits. was obliged, in particular, to compensate the local council for the damage suffered by the agricultural producers in connection with the expropriation of the land. this plot was de facto located on the land which had been registered as belonging to v.g.. the draft certificate mentioned, in particular, that u.c.c. had to obtain and register a relevant state land-use certificate. according to the applicant, until 2004 u.c.c. took no action to register its land-use rights and the plot designated for expropriation by parliament’s decision of 18 march 1999 remained in the hands of the members of the v.g. the 0.6021-ha parcel of the land farmed by the applicant was affected by the parliament’s decision. meanwhile, on 17 january 2003 the berdychiv district administration approved a draft certificate determining the boundaries of the plots of land to be designated to individual farmers from the lands allocated to v.g. and ordered production of the respective individual land-ownership certificates. on the basis of this decision, on 4 june 2003 the applicant was issued with the land-ownership certificate for the aforementioned 0.6021-ha plot. the issuance had therefore been devoid of legal basis. on 17 august 2006 the berdychiv court allowed the aforementioned claim. blocked the road leading to the plot disputed by the u.c.c. and it became impossible for the applicant to access it or use it for farming. on 12 december 2006 the zhytomyr regional court of appeal upheld the above judgment. the applicant appealed in cassation before the supreme court of ukraine. he noted, in particular, that he had obtained the disputed land lawfully and in good faith. he could therefore not be deprived of it unless fair compensation was paid. in february 2007 the applicant added to his cassation appeal, informing the supreme court of ukraine that on 12 february 2007 the regional court had annulled the decision of 22 july 2005 and revalidated the decision of 17 january 2003, on the basis of which he had obtained his land-ownership certificate (see paragraph 23 below). on 4 april 2007 the supreme court of ukraine rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal in cassation. instituted administrative proceedings against the berdychiv district administration. ’s land, while the land, whose boundaries had been in dispute, had belonged to v.g., which had been a separate legal entity on the date of the decision at issue. on 23 july 2008 the higher administrative court of ukraine quashed the above decision and remitted the case for retrial. on 6 december 2011 and 27 august 2013 the judgment of 14 september 2011 was upheld by the zhytomyr regional administrative court and the supreme court of ukraine respectively.
in december 1996 the first applicant concluded a three-year military service contract with the ministry of defence. in march 1999 its housing commission allocated him a studio in a residence hall for students and employees of the national defence academy of ukraine (“the defence academy”), located on z. street in kyiv, and the applicants moved into this accommodation. in december 1999 the first applicant concluded another three-year military service contract. on an unspecified date in 2001 the applicants’ daughter was born. in december 2001 the first applicant rescinded his contract with the ministry of defence and resigned from military service, citing family circumstances. on 4 april 2002 he was employed as a salesman by g., a private company. on an unspecified date and for unknown reasons the first applicant registered himself as a temporary resident at an address on p. street in kyiv. however, according to the applicants’ submissions, the family continued to live in and pay charges for the z. street studio, which they had renovated and modernised at their own expense. article 132 paragraph 1 of the housing code, which concerned accommodation for seasonal and temporary employees, did not apply in their case. they also noted that the first applicant had a dependent wife and young child, and that the family had no other accommodation in kyiv. on 11 november 2003, after hearing oral submissions of all interested parties and having examined the written evidence presented, the court ruled for the plaintiffs. it found that the disputed accommodation had been provided to the applicants on a temporary basis, as a privilege in connection with the first applicant’s military service. since it had been his decision to terminate the contract early, there was no right to keep the accommodation or any duty of the state to provide other accommodation under the applicable law. article 132 paragraph 1 of the housing code was therefore applicable and the applicants’ family was legally obliged to vacate the z. street accommodation. on 29 january 2004 the court of appeal upheld the judgment of 11 november 2003, following a hearing attended by representatives of the defence academy but not by the first applicant. the court held, in particular, that his service contract had contained no clauses obliging the ministry to provide him with housing during his service. the fact that he had been provided with temporary accommodation at the ministry’s discretion did not mean that the state had a duty to accommodate him or his family after termination of the contract. they further stated that on two occasions – in april 2004 and sometime in 2005 (the applicants could not recall the exact dates) – the first applicant had visited the court to enquire about the status of the proceedings, but did not receive any meaningful response. according to the applicants, on 28 april 2004 they were evicted from the z. street accommodation. on 7 may 2004 the official gazette of ukraine (офіційний вісник україни) published the new code of civil procedure (hereinafter “the 2004 code”), which was adopted on 18 march 2004 and entered into force on 1 september 2005. on 12 august and 26 september 2005 the first applicant lodged written complaints with the president of the court of appeal concerning the delay in examining his appeal. on 16 and 24 november 2005 the first applicant wrote to the court of appeal with a request to be provided with a copy of the decision taken on 29 january 2004. on 29 november 2005 the applicants received a copy of that decision. on 13 december 2005 the applicants lodged a request with the supreme court of ukraine for leave to appeal in cassation out of time against the rulings of 11 november 2003 and 29 january 2004, on the grounds that they had not been notified of the latter ruling until 29 november 2005. they argued, in particular, that the court of appeal had failed, in breach of the requirements of the applicable law, to notify them of the date and time of the appeal hearing and the decision taken in their case. they had hence been deprived of their statutory right to attend the appeal hearing and to lodge a cassation appeal within the statutory time-limit. they also argued that the lower courts had erred in their assessment of the facts and application of the law in their case. in particular, since the first applicant had resigned from military service in connection with family circumstances, his situation fell within the ambit of paragraph 3, not paragraph 1 of article 132 of the housing code. accordingly, his family could only be evicted from the accommodation reserved for military personnel if they had been provided with other comparable accommodation. the applicants also relied on section 12 of the social protection of military servicemen act (see paragraph 36 below) as the basis for their entitlement to permanent accommodation.
the applicant was born in 1972 and lives in kharkiv. according to the applicant, at 2 p.m. on 3 may 2005 he was arrested at his home, without any reason being given, and taken to the ordzhonikidzevskyy district police station (орджонікідзевський районний відділ харківського міського управління міністерства внутрішніх справ україни в харківській області), where he was handcuffed to a radiator. this treatment continued for one hour and the applicant was then placed in a cell. the government denied all allegations of ill-treatment. on 4 may 2005 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant and two other persons for a robbery which had taken place on 12 april 2005. on the same date the applicant complained to the duty officer that he was experiencing acute abdominal pain. his state of health had been classified as being of medium gravity. the relevant treatment was prescribed to the applicant. he was discharged from hospital in a satisfactory condition, after being given the relevant recommendations as to further medical treatment. the applicant alleged that the police forced the hospital officials to discharge him despite his poor state of health. on the same date the applicant, having waived his right to legal assistance, confessed to the crime in question and was arrested. he was taken for a forensic medical examination, which was conducted in the presence of a police officer. he confirmed the statements he had given earlier. 2”), where he underwent a full-scale medical examination. he was diagnosed with a twisted sigmoid colon and acute intestinal obstruction requiring surgery. on 13 april 2007 the ordzhonikidzevskyy district court sentenced the applicant to seven years’ imprisonment on one count of robbery. his name was put on the list for regular medical check-ups. on 3 june 2005 the sizo generalist doctor advised that the previously prescribed treatment should be continued. on 23 august 2005 the generalist doctor diagnosed the applicant as having peritoneal adhesions and prescribed him the relevant treatment. on 17 october 2006 the applicant complained to the medical unit about stomach problems. the relevant treatment was prescribed to him. on 8 december 2006, following further complaints about his health, the applicant was diagnosed with angioneurosis and prescribed the respective treatment. the appropriate treatment was prescribed and the applicant was further recommended to consult a tuberculotherapist, which he did on 28 february 2007. no signs of active tuberculosis were found. on 1 and 7 march 2007 follow-up examinations were conducted. the applicant’s health was found to be improving. on 24 may 2007 the prosecutor again refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers. on 1 june 2007 the prosecutor’s office again refused to institute criminal proceedings in response to the applicant’s complaint as there was no medical or other evidence to support the applicant’s allegations. in the judgment of 13 april 2007, by which the applicant was convicted, his ill‑treatment complaint was dismissed as unsubstantiated mainly on the basis of the forensic medical report of 5 may 2005 and the results of the inquiries conducted by prosecutors in respect of the applicant’s complaints. he stated, in particular, that this evidence of his ill-treatment had been completely disregarded by the trial court.
the applicant was born in 1948 and lives in kaunas. in november 1995 the applicant wrote to the authorities to ask why the buildings and the land had been sold to other persons in 1992. on 27 april 1999 the applicant lodged a claim with the kaunas district court, asking it to establish as a legal fact that before the 1940 nationalisation her father had owned the buildings and a plot of land. on 18 august 1999 the kaunas district court stated that there was a dispute about the applicable law and left the applicant’s claim unexamined. on 9 october 2003 the authorities adopted a decision to restore the applicant’s and her sister’s property rights by paying them ltl 36,000 (approximately eur 10,426) in total in securities. the applicant lodged a separate complaint, where she claimed that the authorities assessed the value of the buildings incorrectly, and complaining that the assessment of the value of the buildings had been made before the decision to restore her property rights had been taken. the court therefore dismissed the applicant’s complaint. the applicant appealed raising the same complaints as she did before the kaunas district court (see paragraph 14 above), and on 13 june 2005 the kaunas regional court held that the assessment of value of the buildings had been based on several methods of calculation and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law. it therefore dismissed the applicant’s appeal. her requests were granted and the examination of the case was postponed until 9 may 2006. on 9 may 2006, during the hearing at the kaunas regional administrative court, the applicant asked for the appointment of an expert to determine the market value of the buildings. in april 2007 the expert stated that on 14 july 2003 the market value of the buildings had been ltl 56,850 (approximately eur 16,465) and that the market value of the buildings at the time that the examination of the case had started had been ltl 164,900 (approximately eur 47,758). subsequently the court proceedings were resumed, and on 21 september 2007 the kaunas regional administrative court held that the new assessment of value of the buildings was more accurate and decided to annul the assessment of value of 14 july 2003 by the centre of registers and that part of the decision of 9 october 2003 to restore the applicant’s property rights in which the value of the buildings was set at ltl 36,000 (approximately eur 10,426) (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). the applicant did not appeal and the decision became final on 5 october 2007. on an unspecified date, the applicant lodged a claim with the kaunas regional administrative court, asking, inter alia, for the authorities to be obliged to urgently re-issue the annulled part of the decision of 9 october 2003 (see paragraph 11 above). the court concluded that the decision of the authorities of 9 october 2003 was still in force and that the question of the amount of the compensation was a matter for the public authorities and that it was not within the court’s power to give instructions to them. the applicant appealed, but on 26 july 2010 the supreme administrative court dismissed her appeal. the court held that the applicant’s request had been for the value of the buildings to be set at what their value had been at the moment when the expert valuation had been carried out in 2007 (see paragraph 17 above). the applicant requested that the proceedings be reopened. on 17 december 2010 the supreme administrative court refused her request. in october 2007 the relevant authorities were informed that an additional assessment of the value of the buildings had to be made and then the kaunas municipality administration asked the centre of registers to urgently assess their value. the assessment was made on 17 march 2008 and the value of the buildings was set at ltl 57,000 (approximately eur 16,508) in total, of which the applicant’s part was ltl 28,500 (approximately eur 8,254). on 16 august 2010 the applicant submitted a request to be compensated in securities of a state-owned enterprise. on 27 january 2011 the applicant was sent a document of acceptance in respect of 11,875 units of securities, the nominal value of each unit being ltl 1 (approximately eur 0.29). the state property fund asked the applicant to sign the document of acceptance and indicated that the nominal value of one security was ltl 1 (approximately eur 0.29) but that the real value was ltl 2.4 (approximately eur 0.7). the transfer of the securities was finalised on 1 february 2011. on 12 december 2012 the applicant asked the authorities to set the value of the buildings at the value that they had as of january 2011 and to pay her additional compensation. however, the applicant failed to do so in an acceptable manner and on 25 october 2010 the kaunas regional administrative court declined to examine her claim. it was suggested by the court that the applicant contest the order of 5 june 2009, because it was that document which had legal consequences for her. this, according to the information in the court’s possession, she never did.

the applicant is a non-governmental organisation that publishes orlovskaya iskra, a newspaper in the orel region. this information was specified on the front page of the newspaper. the applicant organisation signed a contract with the communist party for this purpose for publications on 7, 14, 21 and 28 november 2007. governor stroyev was a candidate at those elections: he was no. the first article was entitled ‘hatred, stroyev style’. according to journalist o., that decision was a direct consequence of a conflict between mr stroyev and the newspaper’s former editor-in-chief who kept criticising stroyev’s policies. the speaker of the municipal council, who was politically weak owing to a corruption scandal involving municipal land, was unable to oppose the decision of the governor to close the newspaper. the second deputy was a history professor. the article suggested that his decision to leave the communist party was also forced. the journalist ironically supposed that in fact mr stroyev did not want united russia to win the elections, since he was doing everything to make the electorate angry with the ruling party. his case was still pending; the article suggested that regional law-enforcement agencies being discouraged from pursuing the investigation actively. mr stroyev tried to get credit for that funding, but it was not united russia’s money that had been used, as they claimed, but taxpayers’money. in the opinion of the author, by trying to present the whole situation as his personal achievement mr stroyev was making a fool of president putin and of the population of the orel region. that case concerned a defamation claim lodged by a governor of another russian region against a journalist of a local newspaper. next, it touched upon the story of ms ch., forty-two other workers of the forest authority also lost their jobs. sued the regional authorities, and at the relevant time the proceedings were pending. however, in the opinion of the journalist, there was little hope for impartiality on the part of the regional courts. on 17 november 2007 the working group on informational disputes of the regional electoral committee examined both articles. the case was then submitted to a justice of the peace. on 29 november 2007 the justice of the peace examined the case. the applicant organisation appealed to the zheleznodorozhny district court of orel. the relevant extract from the judgment reads as follows:
“having regard to the fact that the publication of the above articles took place during an election campaign period, the judge considers that the above-mentioned articles contained elements of election campaigning, and therefore could be described as campaign literature. the appeal decision entered into legal force on the same date. without holding a hearing, on 29 january 2008 the acting president of the court issued a decision dismissing the application. the reasoning of the decision of the acting president was identical to that of the lower courts. the scope of this application remains unclear. on 19 june 2008 the vice-president dismissed it. on an unspecified date the applicant organisation introduced an individual application before the constitutional court of russia, arguing that the impugned provisions of the electoral rights act and the state duma deputies election act ran counter to freedom of the press. the acts de facto regarded any critical material published during a pre-election period as “campaigning”, and imposed additional requirements on such publications.

the applicant, mr angelo de tommaso, is an italian national who was born in 1963 and lives in casamassima. 1423/1956, and impose a compulsory residence order on him during that time. the public prosecutor submitted that the applicant’s previous convictions for drug trafficking, absconding and unlawful possession of weapons showed that he associated with criminals and was a dangerous individual. he also noted that the applicant had been given a “warning” by the police but had persisted in his criminal conduct. in submissions of 6 march 2008 the applicant challenged the prosecutor’s recommendation. he argued that there had been a case of mistaken identity and that the alleged breaches of the terms of his special supervision concerned a person who shared his first name and surname but had been born in 1973. he further submitted that no criminal charges had been brought against him since a conviction dating back to 2002. although he had been convicted of absconding in 2004, that was not a decisive factor for the imposition of the measure in question. he argued that there was no need to place him under special supervision. in a decision of 11 april 2008, served on 4 july 2008, the bari district court placed the applicant under special supervision for two years. it rejected his arguments, finding that the statutory requirements for the imposition of the measure were indeed satisfied, there being no doubt that he was dangerous. the district court found that the applicant had “active” criminal tendencies and that the evidence before it showed that he had derived most of his means of subsistence from criminal activity. the court observed, in particular:
“the subject was issued with a ‘verbal warning for public safety’ on 18 september 2006, but this did nothing to improve his conduct; he continued to associate regularly with key figures in the local underworld (malavita locale) and carried on committing offences (see statement of charges pending: breach of supervision order on 25 april 2007; breach of supervision order on 29 april 2007).” on 14 july 2008 the applicant appealed to the bari court of appeal. on 31 july 2008 the bari prefecture ordered the withdrawal of the applicant’s driving licence. the court of appeal observed, firstly, that for a preventive measure to be imposed it was necessary to establish that the individual posed a “current danger”, which was not necessarily linked to the commission of a specific offence, but rather to the existence of a complex situation of a certain duration indicating that the individual had a particular lifestyle that prompted alarm for public safety. the court found that at the time the measure had been imposed, the applicant’s dangerousness could not have been inferred from any criminal activity. it then observed that in several final judgments delivered between september 1995 and august 1999 the applicant had been convicted of tobacco smuggling. he had subsequently changed his sphere of activity and until 18 july 2002 had been involved in drug trafficking and handling illegal weapons, offences for which he had been sentenced to four years’ imprisonment in a judgment of 15 march 2003, which had become final on 10 march 2004; he had served his sentence from 18 july 2002 to 4 december 2005. the court of appeal accordingly noted that the applicant’s most recent illegal activities relating to drugs dated back to more than five years before the preventive measure had been imposed. all that the court could hold against him was an offence of absconding, committed on 14 december 2004 (while he had been subject to a compulsory residence order). the court also pointed out that the breaches of the terms of special supervision committed on 25 and 29 april 2007 concerned a different person, who had the same first name and surname as the applicant but had been born in 1973. the court of appeal held that the district court had omitted to assess the impact of the rehabilitation purpose of the sentence on the applicant’s personality. it observed in particular:
“while it is true that the application of special supervision is compatible with the status of detention, which relates solely to the time of the execution of the sentence, the assessment of dangerousness is inevitably even more significant in the case of an individual who has fully served his sentence and has committed no further offences after his release, as is the case for mr de tommaso. the note of 26 january 2008 in which the carabinieri mentioned that mr de tommaso associated with convicted offenders (to whom he had been caught speaking) does not appear sufficient to establish his dangerousness, bearing in mind that mr de tommaso has not been the subject of any further judicial proceedings since the decision to impose the preventive measure. lastly, the court of appeal notes that the material produced by the defence before the district court and at the hearing before this division indicates that, notwithstanding the typically casual nature of work as a farm labourer, the subject has, at least since his release from prison in 2005 up to the present day, consistently been in lawful employment providing him with a respectable source of income. the government’s partial unilateral declaration 28. 399/02, 13 november 2007; perre and others v. italy, no. 1905/05, 8 july 2008; and bongiorno and others v. italy, no. 4514/07, 5 january 2010), acknowledged that there had been a violation of article 6 § 1 of the convention on account of the lack of a public hearing, offered to pay a specified sum in respect of the costs relating to this part of the application and requested that this part of the application be struck out.

the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in london. from 1997 to 1998, the applicant was the ceo of the central wechsel- und creditbank ag (“cwag”), a sub-company of the hungarian national bank (“unb”). on 22 december 2000 the ministry of finance (bundesministerium für finanzen) received anonymous information accusing the applicant of having received untaxed remuneration in the amount of 35,000,000 austrian schilling (approximately 2,550,000 euros (eur))[1] via the liechtenstein company tudor ag. on 15 february 2001 the investigation department for criminal matters (hereinafter, the “idcm”) was ordered to conduct investigations. on 21 september 2001 the idcm submitted criminal information on suspicion of tax evasion with the vienna public prosecutor’s office (staatsanwaltschaft wien). on 9 october 2001 the vienna regional criminal court (landesgericht für strafsachen wien) opened preliminary investigation proceedings against the applicant on the request of the public prosecutor’s office. at the same time the vienna regional criminal court instructed the vienna tax authority to investigate the case and to submit a final report concerning the amount of taxes evaded. on 28 november 2001 the applicant’s house was searched and the applicant was informed about the investigations against him for the first time. on 22 april 2003 the vienna local tax authority informed the vienna regional criminal court that they had completed the investigations and had sent their findings to another vienna local tax authority which would assess the facts and prepare the final report. on 5 march 2004 the applicant lodged a request for the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings with the vienna regional criminal court. on 14 april 2004 the vienna regional criminal court rejected the applicant’s request as it could not determine the case without having first obtained a final report from the tax authority. on 8 june 2004 the tax authority issued a decision, in which it assessed the applicant’s income tax for the years 1997 and 1998 anew. on 5 july 2004 the applicant lodged an appeal with the vienna independent financial panel (unabhängiger finanzsenat, außenstelle wien, hereinafter, the “ifp”). on 4 december 2007 the applicant’s appeal lodged with the ifp was dismissed as unfounded. on 7 april 2009 the applicant lodged a further request for the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings against him. on 27 july 2009 the vienna regional criminal court dismissed the applicant’s second request for the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings stating that the persecution of the applicant did not seem inadmissible. on 27 november 2009 that decision was confirmed by the vienna court of appeal. the court noted however that the tax authority had still not submitted its final report even though it had concluded the investigations in 2003 and had already issued new tax assessment orders in 2004. it further noted that the measures set by the court and the public prosecutor to accelerate the proceedings were insufficient and amounted to a violation of article 6 § 1 of the convention because the administrative proceedings had already ended on 4 december 2007 (when the applicant’s appeal had been dismissed by the ifp). it therefore ordered the public prosecutor to obtain the final report without further delay and thereupon to close the investigative phase as soon as possible. on 23 june 2010 the tax authority submitted the final report, covering three pages. on 2 august 2010 the public prosecutor issued a bill of indictment against the applicant on the suspicion of tax evasion. on 15 december 2010 the applicant’s appeal lodged with the administrative court was dismissed. on 21 december 2010 the applicant filed an official liability action against the republic of austria, claiming compensation for, inter alia the unreasonable length of the criminal proceedings and the caused loss of earnings. on 30 june 2011 the vienna regional civil court (landesgericht für zivilrechtssachen wien), upon the applicant’s request, suspended the official liability proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings. on 15 april 2011 the vienna court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s objection to the bill of indictment. on 15 june 2011 the vienna regional criminal court held an oral hearing and convicted the applicant pursuant to section 33 § 1 of the tax offences act for tax evasion and imposed on him a fine of eur 150,000. on 8 march 2012 the supreme court quashed the judgment and referred the case back to the vienna regional criminal court. on 31 august 2012 the vienna regional criminal court held a hearing and acquitted the applicant of all charges. following the termination of the criminal proceedings, the official liability proceedings were apparently continued and were still pending at the date of the last information available to the court (22 july 2016).
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in remanzaccio. however, in 2011 the applicant followed her husband to italy in order to provide her children with the opportunity of a more serene future. he was found in the street in a state of intoxication, with scratches on the left side of his face. the applicant alleged that she had not, however, been informed of the possibility of lodging a complaint or contacting a shelter for battered women. the government, referring to the police report, submitted that there was no evidence that the applicant had gone to the accident and emergency unit. she recounted the following events as follows. she then decided to go back to the cellar. attacked her there with a knife and forced her to follow him in order to have sexual relations with his friends. hoping that she would be able to seek help once outside, she resigned herself to following him. she asked a police patrol in the street for help. ’s identity papers, and despite the applicant’s assertions that she had been threatened and beaten by her husband, they invited her to go home without offering her help and told a.t. was fined for unauthorised possession of a lethal weapon. shortly after she had returned home, the applicant called the emergency services and was taken to hospital. it was deemed that her injuries would heal up within a week. began harassing the applicant by telephoning her and sending her insulting messages. was placed under judicial investigation on charges of ill-treating family members, inflicting grievous bodily harm and making threats. the police sent the criminal complaint to the prosecution on 9 october 2012. on 18 march 2013 the prosecution, finding that no investigative measure had been carried out, again asked the police to investigate the applicant’s allegations rapidly. regarding the episode of june 2012 she stated that a.t. had, however, pretended to turn the knife on himself. she said that when she had been living at the shelter provided by the association, she had not spoken to her husband on the telephone because she had been told not to. with regard to the offence of causing bodily harm, the proceedings were continued before the magistrate. was committed for trial on 28 october 2013. was ordered to pay a fine of 2,000 euros (eur) on 1 october 2015. the applicant’s son attempted to stop him and was stabbed three times. succeeded in catching up with her in the street, where he stabbed her several times in the chest. criminal proceedings instituted against a.t. with regard to the ill-treatment, the preliminary hearings judge, after hearing witnesses and the applicant’s daughter, considered that the applicant and her children had been living in a climate of violence. at his trial, had confessed to experiencing feelings of hatred towards his wife. however, neither of the parties annexed the judgment to their observations.
the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in london. after claiming asylum, it would appear that the family were given a period of leave to remain in the netherlands. the applicant’s family travelled to the united kingdom in 1998. the applicant initially remained in the netherlands but on 11 december 1999 he arrived in the united kingdom, where he claimed asylum. although the asylum application was unsuccessful the applicant was granted exceptional leave to remain until 2004. the applicant received ten criminal convictions over the period from 16 november 2001 to 4 august 2005. in december 2007 he was convicted of a public order offence and of failing to surrender. he was sentenced to four and a half months’ imprisonment. the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision to deport him on 1 february 2008. that appeal was dismissed on 30 june 2008 and his appeal rights were exhausted on 8 july 2008. on 2 june 2009 removal directions were set for 17 june 2009. however, they were cancelled on 16 june 2009 when the applicant made an application to this court (application no. a similar point features in some, if not all, of the later forms. likewise, the form for july 2010 states that “[t]he length of detention is a direct result of his appeals against deportation and, although it is now 29 months, he has the real option of return to somalia with the facilitated returns scheme. furthermore, the form from december 2010 indicated that the applicant “could minimise his time in detention by withdrawing [the application to the echr] and taking up frs which is offered each month” and that he could “end his detention by volunteering to return (with or without frs) at any time”. applications for bail were refused on 9 november 2009, 21 april 2010 and 14 july 2010 as the immigration judges were not satisfied that the applicant would answer to any conditions set. the applicant made further representations against removal on 10 june 2010. however, following an appeal by the applicant, the secretary of state withdrew the refusal decision on 12 july 2011. permission was granted on 17 june 2011 but a further application for bail was refused. on 13 july 2011, some two weeks after the court ruled in sufi and elmi v. the united kingdom (nos. in a judgment dated 14 november 2011 the administrative court dismissed the claim. it agreed with the immigration judges and also concluded that the risk was plainly substantial on the evidence available. however, the fact remained that while he was free he was committing offences of such seriousness as to require him to be imprisoned, including robbery and public order offences. the court also considered whether alternatives to detention could be used such as electronic tagging, monitoring by telephone and regular reporting. at the time the administrative court noted that the interim measure under rule 39 of the rules of court, was awaiting a lead judgment on returns to mogadishu (sufi and elmi, cited above) and it was clear that there would be no resolution of the applicant’s claim - and the interim measure would therefore not be lifted - before that judgment was handed down. moreover, while the applicants in sufi and elmi would have had a reasonable to good prospect of success, a positive outcome had not been inevitable. the applicant was granted permission to appeal to the court of appeal. it also took account of correspondence between the government and the registry of this court from which it was clear that from april 2009 the court would be granting a fact-insensitive rule 39 measure to any applicant with removal directions to mogadishu as well as the separate correspondence between the government and this court concerning the progress of sufi and elmi, cited above and the linked domestic case law. finally, the court found that article 5 § 1(f) of the convention added nothing of substance in the present case. the supreme court refused the applicant leave to appeal on 26 march 2013.
the applicant was born in 1954 and is currently residing in kostyantynivka. before his arrest the applicant was the managing director of a private company, a. 5. a. concluded a contract with e., a russian company, undertaking to export a certain amount of ferromanganese to russia. during the period from march 2000 to april 2001 the applicant, in his capacity as the director of a., concluded contracts with four ukrainian companies, f., t., m. and sh. (“ on a number of occasions between march 2000 and april 2001 a. exported ferromanganese to russia, delivered it to e. and received payment for it. in 2002 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant. the applicant had then forged certificates of quality and fraudulently obtained certificates of origin for the goods. he had then obtained or applied for vat refunds based on the fictitious documents. the applicant stated that the contracts had not been fictitious and the certificates had not been forged. a. had legally bought ferromanganese from the private companies, exported it to russia and received tax refunds. they made certain statements the domestic courts subsequently found to be incriminating. in particular, managers of the four seller companies said that the contracts had been either forged or fictitious and that no actual shipments of the goods had taken place. some of the managers repeated those statements in the course of confrontations with the applicant conducted in the course of the pre-trial investigation. on an unspecified date the investigation was completed and the case was referred to the kostyantynivka court for trial. at the court hearing held on the same day the prosecutor, in the light of the above-mentioned information from the police, asked the court to read out the pre-trial statements of the witnesses who had failed to appear, including all those listed in the table below. the defence did not object and the statements were read out. the court then proceeded to examine the documents in the file. on 29 september 2004 the applicant’s lawyer requested the court to summon s., k. and r. again (see elements 1-3 in the table below), because the examination of documents had revealed inconsistencies in their pre-trial statements and because the reasons for their failure to appear had not been established. the final sentence was thus seven years and six months of imprisonment with a ban on holding managerial positions for two years. in convicting the applicant the court relied, in particular, on the statements of a number of witnesses given during the pre-trial investigation, as shown in the below table:
table. s., director: contract was forged
none since company sh. had been wound up and its documentation destroyed 
confrontation conducted. r., director: contract was fictitious
the modus operandi used with company m. was the same as that for other companies. operations with company f. n., deputy director: contract was fictitious
the company which was supposed to supply the goods to company f. was deemed by the tax authorities to be fictitious

“the claimant’s arguments that he is unable to receive visits from his relatives cannot be taken into account, because the possibility of receiving visits from next of kin and relatives is governed by the norms of the russian code on the execution of sentences and is unrelated to the location of any penal facility.” on 14 january 2013 the moscow city court upheld the first-instance judgment. the applicant, who had been granted legal aid. the conviction was upheld on appeal and became final. in his statement of claims he requested to be present at court hearings. on 4 june 2014 the moscow city court held a hearing in the applicant’s absence, which was explained as follows: “under article 167 of the code of civil procedure the appellate collegium deems it possible to examine the case in the absence of the parties to the proceedings; they have been notified of the date and place of the court hearing”. the applicant’s mother and sister could not afford to visit him in kharp.
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in zhangala, kazakhstan. in june 2000 the applicant moved from kazakhstan to russia, where he married ms g.k., a russian citizen, with whom he had two

crossing in the saratov region when the border control department of the russian federal security service informed him that he had been denied re-entry to the russian federation. according to the notice handed to the applicant at the border crossing, he was subject to exclusion from russia. he was banned from re-entering russia until january 2030 on the basis of a report (представление) dated 14 january 2014 from the saratov region department of the federal security service (федеральная служба безопасности (фсб)) (hereinafter “the fss”), drafted pursuant to section 27 § 1 of the entry procedure act, that is to say “for the purposes of ensuring the defensive capacity or security of the state, or protecting public order or health”. on 13 may 2014 the applicant, through his representative, lodged an appeal against the exclusion order with the frunzenskiy district court of saratov (hereinafter “the district court”). in his appeal the applicant requested that the exclusion order be overruled and the ban lifted as this measure had adversely affected his family life. the applicant stated, in particular, that since 2000 he had been married to a russian national and had two

january 2014 contained “some operational activities data” which had not been included in the case file (although it had been “reviewed” by the court) as it constituted a state secret. the court neither specified the nature of that data nor provided any details regarding its origins or the circumstances of its collection. the court further noted that the appropriate procedure had been followed and stated that “mr kamenov’s request that the state body [the fss] that issued the [exclusion] decision be obliged to rescind it cannot be granted as the court [can only verify] the lawfulness of [the procedure of] the taking of such a decision. as regards any overruling of that decision, such competence lies with the executive body that took it”. therefore, the public interest prevailed over the private interest of the applicant”. the applicant’s representative lodged an appeal against the above decision with the administrative cases chamber of the supreme court of the russian federation (hereinafter “the supreme court”) stating, among other things, that in spite of the fact that he had submitted a signed undertaking of confidentiality to the regional court, he had not been given the chance to familiarise himself with the contents of the fss report of 14 january 2014 and the other documents which had served as the basis for the exclusion and that the actual reasons for that measure remained unknown to the applicant. he stressed that the applicant had never committed criminal or administrative violations and that the exclusion and the re-entry ban had disrupted the applicant’s family life. on 24 december 2014 the supreme court upheld the decision of 25 july 2014 stating that the regional court had duly examined the necessary legal basis for the exclusion and that its decision had been lawful and reasonable. the supreme court did not specify the evidence which had served as the basis for the fss report of 14 january 2014, nor did it make any reference to its contents. as for the applicant’s complaint concerning the interference order with his right to respect for family life caused by the sixteen-year exclusion, the supreme court left this unexamined. in reply to the court’s request for the information and documents that had served as the basis for the applicant’s exclusion, the government furnished copies of the courts’ decisions in the applicant’s case and a copy of the records of the hearing on 25 july 2014 by the regional court of the applicant’s appeal. in addition, the government submitted copies of the decisions of the regional court taken between 2011 and 2015 in respect of the following decisions taken by the domestic authorities: eight decisions granting appeals against expulsion orders imposed on account of criminal convictions and violations of immigration regulations, and three decisions granting appeals against exclusion orders and re-entry bans imposed on account of violations of immigration regulations. none of the documents furnished by the government concerned an appeal against an exclusion order and/or a re-entry ban imposed on the grounds of national security.

esma döner 13. the applicants’ signed statements suggest that interpretation services were provided to three of them (ayşe döner, fatma yılmaz and güli akyol) on request. on 13 january 2002 the lawyer applied to the public prosecutor’s office at the istanbul state security court for information in relation to twelve of the applicants (esma döner, gülperi döner, ayşe döner, hanım gülün, şahide gümüş, hasibe yılmaz, fatma yılmaz, tenzile akyol, güli akyol, fatma duruşkan, meryem peker and mehmet şirin döner). in particular, he enquired about their legal status and the charges they were facing, and asked to meet them and to provide them with the necessary legal assistance. on 16 january 2002 the istanbul state security court rejected a request by the lawyer to have the decision rendered by the judge set aside. in the meantime, on 14 january 2002 the public prosecutor informed the lawyer that the applicants in question were in custody on suspicion of being affiliated with an illegal organisation, and that there was no need to decide on the lawyer’s request to have access to them as no authorisation for their detention in police custody had yet been issued by the public prosecutor’s office. it appears that shortly after that decision, still on 14 january 2002, the public prosecutor authorised the applicants’ detention in police custody for four days between 13 and 17 january 2002. they denied any involvement with the pkk. some of the applicants claimed that they had submitted petitions after hearing about it from other parents at school or on television. at an unspecified time on 17 january 2002 the applicants (except for meryem peker, mehmet şirin döner and yılmaz yavuz) were brought before a judge at the istanbul state security court, who ordered their release after taking statements from them. it appears that meryem peker, mehmet şirin döner and yılmaz yavuz were also released that day, but the decision ordering their release was not submitted to the court. on the same day the public prosecutor filed an objection concerning the decision to release the applicants, claiming that it was evident from the statements made by them following their arrest that they had submitted the petitions in an organised manner with the aim of assisting the pkk’s “politicisation” process. the court did not provide any reasons for its decision. the next day they were remanded in custody. it appears that the remaining four applicants named in the warrant could not be located. on 21 january 2002 the applicants esma döner and zübeyde yavuz filed objections concerning their detention on remand. on 6 february 2002 the public prosecutor at the istanbul state security court decided not to prosecute the applicant yılmaz yavuz because of a lack of evidence against him. on the same day the public prosecutor issued an indictment against thirty-eight suspects, including the remaining applicants, accusing them of aiding and abetting an armed organisation under article 169 of the criminal code and section 5 of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. in the indictment the public prosecutor stated that following the arrest and conviction of their leader abdullah öcalan, the pkk had set out to pursue new policies. when viewed against this background, the petitions in question – which had been submitted to certain authorities on predetermined dates and times – could not be considered to be individual acts. they had actually been part of an organised movement which had aimed to implement the decisions adopted by the pkk and thereby undermine the authority of the state. on 12 february 2002 the first-instance court ordered the release of the applicants esma döner, hasibe yılmaz and zübeyde yavuz pending the criminal proceedings. the judgment became final on 5 june 2003.
the applicant was born in 2001 and lives in st petersburg. she recommended a consultation with a neurologist in order to verify whether the eye tics could have neurological causes. sometimes he had been made to lie on a folding bed in the toilets. they had been threatened that if they complained to their parents about the teachers they would be punished. had attempted to convince her and other staff members to falsely accuse the applicant’s father of assaulting ms k. and ms pt. it also noted that the local department of education had failed in its obligation under section 9 of the minors act to inform the district prosecutor’s office of the applicant’s ill-treatment (see paragraph 134 below). ms k. had used physical force against those children who had resisted. 42, finding no evidence of a criminal offence. the applicant’s parents were not given a copy of that decision. he had, however, on occasions suffered allergic reactions. on 11 june 2008, in reply to a complaint by the applicant’s mother, the st petersburg prosecutor’s office again criticised the kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office for delays in the conduct of the pre-investigation inquiry and for its ineffectiveness. on 1 december 2008 the investigator questioned the mother of another child who had attended the nursery school with the applicant. he further showed the investigator where and how he had been bound with sellotape and where and how he had been given eye drops. she initially cited her right to remain silent and refused to testify. she then denied ill‑treating the applicant or other children. she stated that she had been the one who had administered eye drops to the children on 7 november 2005 because one of them had had an eye infection. when she had learned from the applicant’s mother that the applicant had eye tics, she had talked to ms k. and ms p., who had affirmed that the applicant had had nervous tics before 7 november 2005. however, when questioned on 24 october 2011 and 24 july 2012 ms pt. ms k. and ms p. had often shouted at the children and had punished them by locking them up in the toilets. on 12 december 2011 and 16 july 2012 the investigator questioned the then director of nursery school no. she gave positive references for ms p. and ms k. she stated that she had never seen them mistreating the children or received any complaints from the parents in respect of her. she described the incident of 7 november 2005 and her son’s subsequent development of nervous tics. on 6 april and 2 november 2011 the investigator questioned a psychiatric expert chosen by the applicant’s mother. on 11 march 2009 the psychologist treating the applicant stated to the investigator that the applicant had been suffering from a neurological disorder since november 2005. the decisions to suspend the investigation were taken by the investigator on the basis of medical certificates showing that ms k. was on maternity leave and could not therefore participate in investigative measures. on 5 december 2011 ms k. asked the investigator to discontinue the proceedings. she further argued that the applicant had sustained severe damage to his health (rather than damage of medium severity) as a result of the ill-treatment he had suffered. on 13 august 2012 the kirovskiy district court found that the investigator had still not organised an additional expert examination of the applicant, even though he had been instructed to do so in august 2010 and again in august 2011. on 16 october 2012 the st petersburg city court quashed that decision on appeal for procedural defects. it however rejected the remainder of her complaints relating to the alleged ineffectiveness of the investigation.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in chernigiv. on 25 january 2007 the desnyanskiy district court in chernigiv (“the district court”) issued a warrant to search the applicant’s flat for a mobile telephone, which had been reported stolen. the relevant part of the ruling read:
“acting investigator has applied to the court with a request to authorize search of the dwelling of [the applicant] ... with a view to locating a mobile telephone “nokia‑7270” stolen from private entrepreneur [k.] ... [theft] having taken place on 2 december 2006 at night. during the hearing, the acting investigator and the prosecutor have supported their request ...
having heard the acting investigator [and] the opinion of the prosecutor, and having examined the material of the criminal case, the court concludes that ... [it] has been provided with sufficient data indicating a possibility that the nokia 7270 mobile telephone may be at the [applicant’s] place of residence.” on 30 january 2007 the police searched the applicant’s flat in his presence and seized three mobile telephones, which, according to the applicant, belonged to him and his family members. as appears from a poorly legible copy of the list of the seized items prepared by the police, two of these telephones were apparently of samsung and one – of nokia make. according to the applicant, on an unspecified date the seized telephones were returned, and neither he nor any of his family members were ever indicted or involved in any other way in the criminal proceedings giving rise to the search warrant. on 3 march 2007 the applicant lodged an administrative complaint with the district court, alleging that his home had been searched arbitrarily and seeking moral damages for breaching inviolability of his home. on 5 march 2007 the district court refused to examine the above complaint, citing a lack of jurisdiction. it noted that all complaints regarding the unlawfulness of procedural actions by law-enforcement authorities taken in connection with a criminal investigation had to be lodged within the framework of relevant criminal proceedings based on articles 234 and 236 of the code of criminal procedure of ukraine (“the ccp”), then in force. the applicant appealed against that decision. he alleged that there was no meaningful opportunity for him to obtain redress on the basis of the ccp provisions, since a criminal court could only examine complaints concerning the actions of investigation authorities in the context of its examination of a criminal case. in the applicant’s situation, such a remedy would not be effective, since he had no procedural status in the criminal proceedings at issue, and had never been informed of the progress of those proceedings. moreover, it was not certain whether or when the case would reach trial stage. however, as the applicant considered himself to have been a victim of an arbitrary search, regardless of the outcome of the relevant criminal investigation, he also considered that he had standing to bring an administrative complaint under articles 2 and 4 of the code of administrative justice of ukraine (“the caj”). on 15 may 2007 the kyiv administrative court of appeal rejected the appeal by the applicant, having essentially endorsed the findings of the first-instance court. he reiterated the arguments raised in his ordinary appeal and additionally submitted that his claim against the police for non-pecuniary damages could not be examined and resolved within the framework of criminal proceedings against a third party. on 13 may 2009 the higher administrative court of ukraine rejected the applicant’s cassation appeal.
the applicant was born in 1941 and lives in staryy oskol, belgorod region. on 6 may 2005 the applicant concluded a preliminary sale agreement with mr n. regarding a plot of land with a small house under construction situated in the belgorod region. after the signature of this agreement, the applicant started using the plot of land, she finalised the construction of the house and beautified the plot of land. on 10 october 2008 the son of the deceased, mr n. junior, sold the plot of land to another person, who registered her property right. later, the applicant sought to register her property right over the plot of land and found that it already had another registered owner. she then sued mr n. junior before courts. on 9 april 2009 the starooskolskiy town court of the belgorod region declared the sale contract of 10 october 2008 null and void. mr n. junior was declared the owner of the plot of land and of the house. on 17 june 2009 the town court granted the applicant’s claims against mr n. junior and awarded her 613,280 russian roubles (rub) for unjust enrichment and damages corresponding to different sums invested by the applicant in the plot of land and the house as well as the reimbursement of cost and expenses. on 4 august 2009 the belgorod regional court partly modified this judgment. it decreased the amount of damages to rub 246,569, notably quashing the part relating to unjust enrichment. on unspecified date the applicant lodged a supervisory review application. on 17 december 2009 the presidium of the belgorod regional court partly quashed the judgment of 4 august 2009 and sent the case for consideration anew before the second instance court. the presidium considered that the belgorod regional court misapplied the provisions of the civil code on unjust enrichment and miscalculated the amount of damages to which the applicant was entitled to. it concluded that these were significant violations of substantive or procedural law which influenced the outcome of the proceedings and must be corrected in order to restore and protect the applicant’s right to a fair trial as guaranteed by article 46 § 1 of the constitution, article 6 § 1 of the convention and article 1 of protocol no. on 19 january 2010 the belgorod regional court restored the judgment of 17 june 2009. on 11 may 2010 mr n.’s son lodged a supervisory review application. on 8 july 2010 the presidium of the belgorod regional court rejected the supervisory review application lodged by mr n.’s son, considering that the arguments it contained were limited to a different assessment of evidence. it however quashed the judgment of 19 january 2010 and restored the judgment of 4 august 2009 on its own motion, considering that:
“in the interest of lawfulness and taking into account the principle of legal certainty recognised by the russian federation the presidium considers it possible and necessary to go beyond the arguments developed in the supervisory review application. as repeatedly indicated the european court (ryabykh v. russia, no. 52854/99, §§ 51‑53, echr 2003‑ix, khotuleva v. russia, no. 27114/04, 30 july 2009) in order to preserve the aforementioned principle final judgments shall remain unchanged. the mere existence of two points of view on the same matter does not justify the reopening of the case. legal certainty presupposes that it is not permissible to have a second examination of the once decided case in the absence of fundamental errors. taking into account the aforementioned principle, the final decision in the present case should be the judgment of the belgorod regional court of 4 august 2009 which granted certain damages to the claimant and rejected her claims for the rest, including as regards unjust enrichment. in the course of the new examination by the cassation court the principles above have not been taken into account, this omission resulted in a violation of the principle of legal certainty provided by article 6 § 1 of the convention and undermined the stability of a binding judicial act. the claimant’s argument that the judgment of 19 january 2010 was lawful is not deemed to be sufficient by the presidium to disregard the aforementioned principles. the fact that the presidium of the regional court disagreed with the aforementioned judicial decision does not constitute in itself a ground for quashing of a final and binding judgment and for reopening of the proceedings. in view of the above, the judgment of 19 january 2010 subject to the present application shall be quashed and the judgment of 4 august 2009 restored.” on 3 november 2010 a single judge at the supreme court refused the applicant’s supervisory review application.
on 25 march 2004 the applicant company concluded a contract with univerzal banka ad (hereinafter “the bank”), a private institution based in belgrade. under the terms of this contract, the applicant company acquired a debt belonging to the bank resulting from a final court judgment of 28 december 1999. that judgment was rendered against a socially-owned company called mehanizacija (hereinafter “the debtor company”) with its seat in vladičin han. on 29 august 2000, upon the bank’s application to that effect, the leskovac commercial court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and the debtor company subsequently paid a part of the judgment debt. on 14 april 2005, upon the applicant company’s application to that effect, the leskovac commercial court again ordered the full enforcement of the judgment in question. on 26 july 2005 the applicant company concluded a settlement with the debtor company, which was later annulled following an application by the debtor company by a decision of the leskovac commercial court of 22 january 2009. that decision became final on 3 march 2010. on 24 december 2001 the leskovac commercial court ordered the debtor company to pay the applicant company specified amounts. on 2 february 2005, upon the applicant company’s application to that effect, the leskovac commercial court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment. on 1 march 2010 the leskovac commercial court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor company. as a result, all of the other ongoing enforcement proceedings against the debtor company were stayed. the applicant company duly reported its claims based on the above-mentioned judgments. on 15 october 2010 the leskovac commercial court recognised a part of the applicant company’s claims and instructed the applicant company to initiate civil proceedings in respect of the remainder. on 29 may 2012 the leskovac commercial court ruled partly in favour of the applicant company and dismissed the remainder of its claims. that decision was upheld by the commercial appeals court on 25 october 2013. the domestic courts found that the contract which the applicant company had concluded with the bank (see paragraph 5 above) entitled it only to the recovery of the amount paid for the transfer of the debt owed to the bank in question, not the judgment debt itself. the insolvency proceedings are still ongoing.

the applicant was born in 1944 and lives in kaliningrad. until 1999 the applicant was married to z. and was living with her in a state-owned flat which had been provided to z.’s parents. the applicant was registered as living in that flat. in 1999 the applicant and z. divorced and the applicant moved in with his new partner, b. at that time he did not apply for deregistration from the flat which he had occupied with his former wife. later z. privatised that flat, and the applicant lost occupational right to it. b. occupied a room in a three-room communal flat under a social tenancy agreement. the other two rooms were occupied by her neighbours. the applicant and b. lived together in that room for the following ten years. they never married and the applicant was not registered as living in the room. in may 2009 b. died and her neighbours locked the applicant out of the flat. the local housing authority informed the applicant that he had to vacate the room, since he had no legal right to occupy it. he submitted that he and b. had been living in the room as husband and wife since 1988, but that after her death her neighbours had locked him out of the room. the local administration submitted that the applicant had not been registered as living in b.’s room, he was not a member of b.’s family and, therefore, he had not acquired any right to occupy her room. b.’s neighbours were invited to participate in the proceedings as third parties. they confirmed that between 1999 and 2009 the applicant had lived in the room with b. and had provided her with financial support. the local administration did not appeal against the judgment of 6 may 2010. the third parties appealed against that judgment to the kaliningrad regional court (“the regional court”). they submitted that b. had on several occasions chased the applicant away. the applicant had not paid any utility charges for the room and had been registered as living elsewhere until b.’s death. on 22 september 2010 the regional court quashed the judgment of 6 may 2010 and dismissed the applicant’s claims. n. [the applicant], the court [the district court] proceeded from the premise that there existed exceptional circumstances allowing it to recognise him as a member of ms brazhnikova’s [b.’s] family in accordance with article 69 § 1 of the housing code. the civil chamber [of the kaliningrad regional court] cannot agree with such a decision. b.] since 1999 and had shared a common household with her. throughout the period in which he lived together with ms brazhnikova l.p., 6, pionerskaya street in the village of aleksandrovka in the zelenogradskiy district. he asked to be removed from the register on 8 september 2009 after the death of ms brazhnikova and just before applying to the court. n. as a family member of the social tenant ms brazhnikova l.p. as well as acknowledging his right to occupy the flat in question. it follows that the court judgment should be quashed and a new decision should be taken dismissing those claims.” on 3 march 2011 a judge of the supreme court of russia (“the supreme court”) refused to refer the applicant’s application for supervisory review of the decision of 22 september 2010 to the civil chamber of the supreme court for examination, finding no grounds for such review and relying on the principle of legal certainty.
on 26 june 2006 the leskovac commercial court ordered ad perper-agrar, a socially-owned company based in bošnjace (hereinafter “the debtor”) to pay the applicant specified amounts on account of damages. that judgment became final on 14 july 2006. on 31 october 2006, upon the applicant’s request to that effect, the leskovac commercial court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor to pay the applicant the enforcement costs. on 27 may 2011 the leskovac commercial court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor. on 3 february 2012 the applicant’s claim was formally recognised. the insolvency proceedings are still ongoing. on 22 april 2003, the debtor had been privatised and changed its name to ad perper-agrar. on 5 may 2005 the privatisation contract had been annulled and on 8 september 2006 the debtor’s name was changed to agrar fruit. according to the serbian ministry of economy, the debtor is still a company predominantly comprised of socially-owned capital (see http://www.priv.rs/ministarstvo-privrede/90/agrar-fruit--u-stecaju.shtml/companyid=1238, accessed on 6 december 2016). in their additional observations of 19 april 2016 the government informed the court that the applicant had transferred its judgment claims to a third person on 28 october 2015. on 9 november 2016, as a response to the government’s additional observations, the applicant submitted that the contract regarding the transfer of the claims in question had been terminated by 11 december 2015.

- he could not assess which parent was more fit to be awarded custody of the children because the applicant had refused to undergo a psychiatric evaluation; and
- there were no signs indicating that i.b. and
- granted the applicant contact rights, to be exercised every second weekend in i., from friday evening until sunday afternoon so that the father could bring the children to her in i. and she could return them to him in s. 51. at a hearing held on 18 august 2011 the enforcement court heard the parties. started taking the children for regular treatment to dr d.b., ... [t]he mother has so far done everything she can, that is to say she has been calling, asking about the children. when talking to me he cooperates and takes on board all my advice, but i do not know which [part of it he accepts], and how he implements it. the older son cried, refused to see the applicant and stated that he wanted her to leave. the recommendations of the specialist, the expert ... team and the supervising officer are to provide the children with psychological support with a view to processing difficult emotions related to the situation in the family and their relationship with the parents. ...

( by a decision of 6 august 2012 the split municipal court ordered that contact between the applicant and her children was to take place on the last weekend of every month, specifically on saturday from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. and on sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., under the supervising officer’s supervision. the younger son ran away from her and told her that he did not want to go to her. on 10 january 2013 the split county court dismissed an appeal by the applicant against the first-instance decision of 6 august 2012 (see paragraph 69 above). the children yet again refused to meet her. on 26 june 2013 the court invited the ivanić-grad and split social welfare centres to make a psychological evaluation of the family and to submit a joint opinion and recommendation. in her report of 19 september 2013 the psychiatrist dr d.b., of the experts’ opinion; subsequently he agreed to undergo the recommended psychotherapy. at a hearing held on 31 august 2015 the applicant, relying on the above expert opinion, requested that i.b.

the applicant was born in 1982 and lives in kharkiv. according to the applicant, on 31 january 2009 she was arrested by a group of police officers in a café, k., and detained without record at a police station until 2 february 2009. who tried to obtain false confessions from her concerning her and other persons’ involvement in drug dealing. however, the applicant was neither arrested, nor detained by the police at that time. on 17 april 2009 this complaint was rejected as unsubstantiated. there is no further information concerning the final outcome or present status of the aforementioned case against the applicant. she refused to be admitted as an inpatient for treatment, which was recommended to her, and left the hospital. on 26 june 2009 a new set of criminal proceedings was instituted against the applicant on suspicion of selling opium to three men on 24 june 2009 and of storing a jar of opium in her house (“the second set of criminal proceedings”). on the same date the applicant complained to the kharkiv regional department of the interior that she had been ill-treated by the police. she submitted, in particular, that on 24 june 2009 four police officers had forced their way into her house without a court order, searching for drugs. as the applicant had protested, he had threatened and punched her on various parts of her body. according to the applicant, during her visit to the department of the interior, she had felt so unwell that an ambulance had been called and she had been admitted as an urgent case to hospital no. he further concluded that he was not competent to decide on the cerebral trauma, in particular, as he had not been provided with a comprehensive medical record. on 27 july 2009 another medical expert, after examining the applicant and various medical records, concluded that the applicant’s cerebral trauma could be classified as a moderately serious injury. two men identified as the lay witnesses gave statements largely consistent with the police officers’ submissions. the three men identified by the police officers as the drug buyers denied buying any opium from the applicant and submitted that they had visited her that day to borrow some money. her brother), and two persons identified by the applicant as the guests present during the purported forced entry, gave statements similar to the ones the applicant had provided to the department of the interior on 26 june 2009. on 22 september 2009 the applicant joined those proceedings as an aggrieved party. he further decided to transfer the file of the case against the applicant to the kharkiv prosecutor’s office in order for it to be joined to the case concerning the applicant’s alleged ill-treatment. on 21 january 2011 a further medical report was obtained. it stated that it was not possible to determine the severity of the applicant’s cerebral injury because the medical history that had been provided to the expert writing the report had been incomplete, and because the applicant herself had not reported for an examination in person. it was further reported that the data concerning the other injuries (bruises and contusions) were inconclusive, but that based on the available information it was not improbable that the injuries had been self-inflicted. noting that the three men earlier identified as the drug buyers and one of the two people identified as the applicant’s guests who had been present during the purported forced entry had retracted their testimony incriminating a.a. on 12 september 2011 the kyivskyy district court of kharkiv allowed the appeal, referring the case for further preliminary inquiry. as his accomplice, he had been given witness status only, which had restricted his procedural rights, including the right to defence. the applicant’s former partner) and a.b. ( her brother), also questioned again in september 2011, confirmed their previous statements that they had witnessed a forced entry and assault on the applicant. based on the case file, the second guest (the fourth person, who had earlier contended that he had witnessed the forced entry), was not questioned. on 26 november 2011 the kharkiv prosecutor’s office refused to reopen the criminal investigation into the applicant’s ill-treatment complaints for want of any evidence that the police officers had committed a crime. it appears that the applicant was not informed of the above decision in due time, as in 2012 the applicant’s lawyers unsuccessfully contacted the law-enforcement authorities to obtain information on whether there had been any progress in the proceedings.
the applicant was born in 1934 and lives in strausberg. before the reunification of germany he lived in the former gdr, serving in the police force from 1952 to 1954. he was sentenced to one year and eight months’ imprisonment and served 14 months in prison. on 8 february 1994 the frankfurt (oder) regional court annulled the 1958 judgment for its incompatibility with the principles of the rule of law and rehabilitated the applicant pursuant to section 1 § 1 of the criminal rehabilitation act (gesetz über die rehabilitierung und entschädigung von opfern rechtsstaatswidriger strafverfolgungsmaßnahmen im beitrittsgebiet ‑ strafrechtliches rehabilitierungsgesetz) designed to rehabilitate and compensate prisoners of the gdr regime for deprivation of their liberty incompatible with the principles of the rule of law. on 25 april 1994 the applicant lodged an application for compensation under the criminal rehabilitation act. he again confirmed that he had never offended against the principles of humanity and the rule of law and never worked for the former gdr’s ministry of state security. a respective request for information was submitted on 19 november 2007. on 25 february 2008 the federal commissioner informed the president of the regional court that the applicant, between 22 september 1953 and 25 november 1954, had been a secret informant of the ministry of state security while he was a member of the police force. this information was based on a number of documents, including 32 handwritten reports allegedly drafted by the applicant and a declaration to commit to serve as a secret informant to the state security service. on 18 february 2009 the president of the regional court, relying on section 48 §§ 1 and 2, third sentence, no. the president considered that the decisions had been unlawful from the beginning as the prerequisites for either entitlement had never been met and that the applicant could not legitimately rely on these decisions being maintained, as he had obtained them by giving information that was substantially incorrect. on 9 march 2009 the applicant applied for judicial review of that decision and asked to be heard in person. he claimed that the information contained in the documents of the federal commissioner was incomplete and not accurate. the fact that at the time of recruitment he was only 19 years old and had been severely traumatised when fleeing his home town in silesia in 1945 and experiencing the bombing of dresden on 13 february 1945, followed by several months of homelessness after the war had ended, also had to be taken into account. his father had returned, incapacitated for work, from soviet captivity only in 1947 or 1948. while serving in the police forces he had not been aware of working for other government agencies. in any case, he ruled out that the wording was his own and that he had known that the reports were to be used by the state security service. on 16 february 2010 the frankfurt (oder) regional court, sitting as a chamber of three judges, dismissed the applicant’s request for judicial review, finding that his work as a secret informant for the ministry of state security was of such nature, scope and duration that it was reprehensible enough to justify ruling out the applicant’s eligibility for compensation payments pursuant to section 16 § 2 of the criminal rehabilitation act. acknowledging that in a dictatorship which lasted for decades, minor involvement with the regime was frequent, it considered that the applicant’s position as a secret informant of the state security service did not itself suffice to trigger the application of that provision. this could be assumed when a secret informant voluntarily reported on others and the reports could potentially cause persecution by the state security service. in that case compensation payments were ruled out, no matter how great the offender’s own suffering had been. the courts were not to compare the extent of suffering involved. thus the applicant’s submission that he had believed that he was reporting to police officers and not to the state security service was, in the light of that declaration, not credible (“nicht glaubhaft”). the applicant mainly reported on their contacts with west germany and west berlin. an intention to leave the former gdr without permission, in particular, could have led to severe criminal persecution of the persons involved. the reports were not meaningless but contained valuable information for the state security service. the regional court also pointed out that it was unnecessary to hear the applicant in person. however, there were no such indications and the applicant had made no claims in this regard. he had reported twice on others, even before being recruited by the state security service. on 24 august 2010 the brandenburg court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal, endorsing the regional court’s reasons.
the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in sofia. the applicant’s father co-owned a plot of land and a house in sofia. by a decision of the mayor of 15 july 1981 the property was expropriated with a view to constructing residential buildings. the decision, based on section 98 (1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973 (закон за териториалното и селищно устройство), provided that the applicant’s father and the applicant were to receive a three-room flat in compensation. by a supplementary decision of 25 march 1987, based on section 100 of the territorial and urban planning act, the mayor determined the exact location, size and other details in respect of the future flat offered in compensation. it was to have a surface of 109 square metres and was identified as flat no. 17 on the fifth floor of a residential building which was to be constructed by a state-owned enterprise. lastly, it was decided that the flat would be given directly to the applicant. in 1989 the applicant paid to the authorities the part of the value of the future flat which had not been covered by the value of the expropriated property. in 1990 the sofia municipality settled him temporarily in a flat which was property of the state-owned enterprise b. 9. on an unspecified date the construction of the building where the flat was to be located was commenced. in 1996 the sofia municipality concluded a contract with the company b., successor of the state-owned enterprise, delegating to it the construction works. the company was under an obligation to build, at its own expense, and deliver to the municipality, within twenty-four months, the flats earmarked for compensation of the expropriated owners; in exchange of that it was to become the owner of the remainder of the building. however, the construction was not completed within the deadline set. in 2005, in the context of the winding-up of the company b., the building, still unfinished, was sold to another company. the latter apparently resold the property to a third company, which in 2006 obtained a notary deed declaring it the owner of the building and the flats in it, including one half of flat no. 17 on the fifth floor; however, unlike what was indicated in the decision of 25 march 1987 (see paragraph 7 above), that flat was described as having a surface of 91, and not 109, square metres. the applicant submitted a certificate of occupancy of the building at issue, dated 5 october 2007, but claimed that it only concerned “certain construction activities” and that the building was not in use. in the meantime, the applicant filed several requests with the municipal authorities in sofia asking them to complete the compensation procedure and deliver the flat due to him. in a letter of 25 july 2000 the municipality informed him that the company b. had reassured the authorities that it was making effort to fulfill its obligations. in another letter of 13 august 2004 the municipality informed the applicant that it was the company that was responsible to deliver the flat to him. lastly, in a letter of 8 november 2011 the sofia municipality informed the applicant that he should have raised his claims in the winding-up procedure of the company b., or should contact the current owner of the building to claim the flat due to him. in 2007 the applicant was evicted from the flat where he had been temporarily settled, after it had been sold to a private party in the context of the winding-up of the company b. in the ensuing judicial proceedings whereby he challenged unsuccessfully the eviction it was established that at that time the applicant was not living in the flat, and that it was uninhabitable and in a very poor state of repair.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in athens. the applicant is a businessman and chairman of a public limited company. on 23 september 2010 the public prosecutor at the athens court of appeal ordered the attica police department to carry out searches at fifteen residential and business premises in various locations in athens and the attica region, including the applicant’s address, in the context of a preliminary police investigation being conducted in respect of s.g. the applicant was not referred to by name as being suspected of involvement in the offences in question. the prosecutor’s warrant was worded as follows:
“on the basis of decision no. 2940/29-7-2010 of the prosecutor at the court of cassation, we are conducting an investigation to verify whether criminal offences have been committed, in particular the setting up of a criminal organisation (article 187 of the criminal code) by s.g. and by other persons connected with them and acting in collaboration with them. in view of the material gathered to date and in order to avoid the loss of decisive evidence, we hereby order searches, in application of articles 253-259 of the code of criminal procedure, at the residential and professional premises located in the following streets:
28-30 rue meletopoulou, palaio psychiko;

in addition, should you consider it necessary, carry out body searches of the persons present in these homes and offices. in any event, seize any object or document found therein which, in your opinion, has a link with the case under consideration, and draw up the relevant reports for submission to us as rapidly as possible ...” 8. on 24 september 2010 a police officer, accompanied by a deputy prosecutor, went to the applicant’s home. since the applicant was not at home the police officer and the prosecutor contacted a locksmith, who opened the entrance door. in the presence of a witness (a neighbour, a national of the netherlands), they conducted a search and seized numerous items (two computers and hundreds of documents). the search lasted for twelve and a half hours. a 41-page list of items and documents was drawn up. in may 2012, on completion of the preliminary police investigation, the public prosecutor at the athens court of appeal instituted proceedings against a number of individuals, including the applicant, for involvement in a criminal organisation. on 8 november 2012 the applicant applied to the indictment division at the athens court of appeal to have the search declared null and void, the seizure order lifted and the seized items returned. on 13 february 2013 the indictment division dismissed his application. the main issue examined by it was whether a search and seizure operation could be carried out in the course of a preliminary police investigation. it noted that the preliminary police investigation (προκαταρκτική εξέταση) and the subsequent pre-trial investigation (προανάκριση) pursued a common goal, that of establishing the truth. the only difference between them was that the second procedure concerned an “accused”, while the first procedure concerned a “suspect”, who, in the indictment division’s finding, nonetheless enjoyed all the rights granted to an accused. it held that this difference was not such as to deprive the bodies responsible for investigating a case of an important tool for uncovering decisive items of evidence, otherwise there would be a serious risk of a finding that there was no case to answer without the authorities having been able to exhaust all the investigatory options available to them. referring to a legal opinion by professors d. tsatsos, a. papadima and k. chrysogonos (published in the poiniki dikaiosyni magazine, no. the indictment division held that the preliminary police investigation was judicial and not administrative in nature and that it was one stage in the criminal procedure. the indictment division further noted that the preliminary police investigation was conducted in accordance with the procedure for a pre-trial investigation, a specific reference being made to articles 240 and 241 of the code of criminal procedure (ccp). the indictment division held that article 256 of the ccp, providing for the right of the occupant of premises being searched to be present, did not impose an obligation on the person conducting the search to await the occupant or invite him or her to be present, and that, should the occupant be absent, the presence of a neighbour was sufficient. with regard to the authorities’ refusal to return the seized objects, the indictment division noted that a considerable amount of evidence had been seized during the searches of the applicant’s home and also at the residential premises of the other individuals concerned, and that this evidence provided sufficient proof of the existence of a criminal organisation involving persons who had committed serious offences, most of them crimes, in respect of which prosecutions had been brought. it pointed out that any subsequent proceedings would have been impossible if this evidence had not been gathered, and that, given that these items were particularly decisive and crucial for the investigation of the case, they ought to remain in the case file. on 12 march 2013 the applicant invited the public prosecutor at the court of cassation to lodge an appeal against the indictment division’s decision. on 13 march 2013 the prosecutor dismissed that request. he held that the conditions for lodging an appeal on points of law had not been met, in that the indictment division had provided comprehensive reasoning for the contested decision and that, since no further investigative acts had been conducted, no decision by the indictment division at the court of appeal was necessary in order to approve them.
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in reykjavik. at the material time he was an editor of the web-based media site pressan. in particular, the sisters warned against a, a relative of theirs, who was standing for election. in the letter they alleged that a had sexually abused them when they were children. on 8 november 2010 pressan published an article about comments made by a to a newspaper where he rejected all the allegations and threatened pressan with a lawsuit for being the first to publish the allegations. on 22 and 23 february and 30 may 2011, pressan published further articles about the matter, based on the sisters’ statements on their website and in other media interviews, on a’ s comments in other media and on a’s daughter’s comments in a television interview. pictures of the sisters were published with all the articles. other media also published articles and interviews with the sisters. a argued that responsibility for the statements lay with the applicant as the editor of pressan by virtue of section 15 of the printing act, applied by analogy, since the author of the articles was not identified. he gave a statement before the district court, but was not involved further in the proceedings. b had also tried to contact the child protection services, without success. by judgment of 22 february 2012 the district court found in favour of the applicant. however, the district court stated that a supervisory obligation was placed on editors of web media, where articles were published without identifying the authors, and that the editor was obliged to ensure that material published on web-based media did not cause others harm or interfere with a person’s private life. it was a gathering of 25 elected members, established by law by parliament, which would prepare a proposal for a new constitution. there would be general elections, where the same rules about eligibility and the right to vote applied as in the parliamentary election”...
when the statements in sections a-c are compared to the sisters’ writings on their website on 2 november 2010, the court has to agree with [the applicant] that both the headline in section a and the statements in sections b and c are verbatim from their letter. [...] the applicant’s] arguments about the public having the right to be informed about the candidates in public elections cannot be ignored. disputes, resolved and unresolved, regarding their earlier behaviour are matters to which one can expect attention to be drawn. the statements in sections d and e were published on 23 february 2011 when the elections for the constitutional assembly were over. [ the sisters reacted to this criticism on their website and then [pressan] published their reactions. [...] the statement in section d that appeared as a headline on [pressan] quotes the sisters’ replies but is partly rephrased. however, this statement can be understood as a statement by the media itself. on 1 august 2012 a appealed to the supreme court against the district court’s judgment. under article 241 of the penal code the statements were declared null and void. the supreme court referred in this respect to a supreme court judgment of 24 november 2011. everyone shall be free to express his thoughts, but shall also be liable to answer for them in court. article 236
“anyone who, against his or her better knowledge, makes or disseminates a defamatory insinuation shall be liable to up to two years’ imprisonment. a person who is found guilty of a defamatory allegation may be ordered to pay to the injured person, on the latter’s demand, a reasonable amount to cover the cost of the publication of a judgment, its main contents or reasoning, as circumstances may warrant in one or more public newspapers or publications.” 38/2011 (lög um fjölmiðla), which entered into force on 21 april 2011, reads:

the applicant was born in 1987 and is detained in lublin. from 8 may 2009 the applicant was detained on remand on suspicion of having committed several armed robberies. he was charged with several counts of armed robbery. on 24 february 2011 the lublin district court gave a judgment in the applicant’s case (ix k 79/11). the measures applied in the applicant’s case comprised confinement in a special high-security prison wing and increased supervision of his movements within and outside the cell, which meant that he had to wear joined shackles whenever he was taken out of his cell. the measures involved his segregation from the prison community and restrictions on contact with his family. it its decision of 24 february 2011 the commission relied on the fact that the applicant had assaulted a prison guard (article 88a § 2 (2 b) of the code of execution of criminal sentences). the governor of the lublin remand centre, in his application to impose the regime, stated that on 21 february 2011 the applicant had refused to undergo a strip-search, had been aggressive and had attempted to hit a prison officer in the face. the incident of 21 february 2011 was notified to a prosecutor who investigated whether an offence had been committed. it appears that the applicant was originally convicted of the offence but the judgment was quashed by the lublin district court. the outcome of this set of proceedings is not known. the applicant appealed against the decision of 24 february 2011, but on 27 april 2011 the lublin regional court upheld it. the court held that the applicant posed a serious danger to the security of the lublin remand centre. the lublin remand centre in its subsequent applications to extend the measure against the applicant underlined that his behaviour had not improved and he had remained unpredictable. the applicant appealed against that decision. on 26 october 2011 the lublin regional court upheld the decision. on 15 november 2011 the governor of the lublin remand centre applied to the commission to lift the measure against the applicant. the applicant, as noted by the prison officers and a psychologist, was calm, disciplined, and following the internal regulations. on 16 november 2011 the commission, having heard evidence from the applicant, lifted the measure. on 5 december 2011 the applicant was transferred to opole lubelskie prison. on 3 january 2012 the governor of opole lubelskie prison applied to the prison commission to impose the “dangerous detainee” regime on the applicant. he submitted that since the applicant’s arrival at the prison he had been aggressive towards the prison officers and had been trying to gain prominence in the prison community by plotting to assault a senior officer of the service. there exists a real risk to the security of the prison. his negative attitude is a destructive influence on the atmosphere and order in the wing and in the prison. the governor considered that the applicant remained interested in belonging to the prison community and that his behaviour continued to pose a risk to the security of the prison. the governor noted that the applicant had received some punishments and three rewards, but that it could still not be guaranteed that he would function correctly in the prison. on 27 september and 27 december 2012 the prison commission extended the application of the regime on the applicant. the applicant’s behaviour had improved, he complied with internal regulations and was no longer aggressive towards the prison officers. according to the authorities he no longer posed a threat to the security of the prison. in december 2012 he obtained further pln 150 out of which half (pln 75) was placed in his release savings fund.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in sarbice pierwsze. he was treated in hamburg until 27 february 1999. in june 1999 the applicant moved to new zealand and the proceedings against him were stayed. on 29 march 2004 the minister of justice requested that the applicant be extradited to poland. the court again referred to the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he was charged and on the severity of the penalty to which he would be liable if found guilty. he submitted that he was suffering from serious neurological and orthopaedic problems which, if not treated properly, would pose a serious danger to his health. on 29 july 2010 the cracow court of appeal (sąd apelacyjny) upheld the challenged decision, confirming the regional court’s view that the detention had been justified by the severe penalty and the possibility that the applicant might obstruct the proceedings. on 19 october 2010 the first hearing took place. further hearings were scheduled for 2 and 30 december 2010, 25 january, 17 february, 17 march, 5 and 28 april, 17 may, 16 june, 14 july, 4 august, 6, 27 and 29 september, 6 and 27 october, 10 and 24 november, and 8 december 2011. apart from the grounds previously relied on, the court noted that the applicant had requested that several new witnesses be heard and considered that he might influence their testimony if released. the court noted that the results of the applicant’s recent treatment in the łódź prison hospital ward had been satisfactory and that according to the experts in neurology and orthopaedics (see paragraph 21 above) he could be treated in prison facilities. meanwhile, on 28 june 2011, the applicant underwent a medical examination ordered by the kielce regional court. the government contested this submission. the lawyer referred to the applicant’s state of health. the post-operation rehabilitation should take place in a good rehabilitation ward  ... it may also take place in detention, however i do not know in which detention centre such a ward exists.” on 14 november 2011 the applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal against the court’s decision of 8 november 2011. apparently, the court had not yet become aware of the medical expert opinion of 14 november 2011. however, given the applicant’s state of health, his release was necessary. according to the last information available to the court, the criminal proceedings against him are still pending. between 12 and 20 january 2016 he was hospitalised again in a hospital in katowice. on 26 april 2010 the applicant was examined by a physician. he advised pharmacological treatment and physiotherapy. - neurological examination”
the applicant submitted another note made by a neurologist, which read:
“today [he] lost consciousness. i and j. (another cell inmate) would carry the applicant up these stairs. when j. was not there one of guards would come and help us out.” while undressing, he easily lifts his legs without manifesting pain. when he stands up he drags his left leg and claims that he cannot stand on that leg because it is weak. in connection with the pain reported by the applicant and the results of his medical examinations, the specialist opinion of an expert neurosurgeon or neurologist is necessary in order to determine whether the applicant may be transported to court without a wheelchair. he also consulted a dermatologist, orthopaedist, neurologist and ophthalmologist. after his release from the prison hospital the applicant was advised to continue performing the exercises he had been taught.
the applicant was born in 1964 and lives in otwock. by depriving the alleged victims of their liberty and threatening to kill them. interlocutory appeals against those decisions were rejected, as were requests for release lodged by the applicant and his lawyer. on 7 november 2003 the jarosław district court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment. the time which he had already spent in detention, namely three years, three months and twenty seven days (from 11 july 2000 to 7 november 2003), was deducted from his sentence. throughout the entire proceedings the applicant was represented by two lawyers of his choice. on 29 november 2000 the siedlce regional court upheld the detention order. the applicant lodged several applications for release. subsequently, the applicant’s detention on remand was extended by the mińsk mazowiecki district court on 6 february, 11 april, 12 july and 15 october 2001, and on 10 january 2002. meanwhile, on 2 april 2002 the applicant’s case was severed from that of his co‑accused, to be dealt with in a different trial. the first hearing was scheduled for 18 june 2002 but was ultimately adjourned. this decision was upheld by the siedlce regional court on 2 october 2002. on 5 november 2002 the mińsk mazowiecki district court once more extended the applicant’s detention. in addition, the second-instance court addressed the arguments which had been raised in an interlocutory appeal brought by the applicant against the district court’s decision. on 27 february 2003 the siedlce regional court quashed that decision and ordered the applicant’s release from custody. on 11 december 2003 the jarosław district court ordered that the applicant undergo psychiatric observation in the psychiatric wing of the warszawa-mokotów remand centre. on 28 january 2004 the siedlce regional court dismissed an interlocutory appeal brought by the applicant against this decision. this decision was upheld on 15 july 2004 by the siedlce regional court. it appears that the first-instance court held fourteen and adjourned five hearings. that decision was upheld on 29 march 2006. in the courts’ view, the latter element in turn created a presumption that the applicant would attempt to obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings if released. it appears that the court held seven hearings in the case. the following day the applicant was released from the remand centre. two years and nine months of the applicant’s detention on remand (from 11 july 2005 to 10 april 2008) were deducted from his sentence. on 30 january 2007 the applicant finalised his complaint. in connection with the second part of the complaint (see paragraph 61 above), the constitutional court held that the applicant did not have the standing to challenge article 263 § 3 of the code because this provision had not been applicable to his detention in the relevant period. he claimed that they had been selling alcohol, cigarettes and drugs to prisoners. on 18 july 2003 the lubaczów district prosecutor discontinued criminal proceedings against several judges of the jarosław district court who, in the applicant’s view, had monitored his correspondence with his lawyer. on 8 august 2002 the registry of the court received another letter from the applicant, dated 22 july 2002. it was delivered in an envelope bearing the stamp “jarosław district court” and a handwritten note stating “censored on 26 july 2002” (cenzurowano dn.
the applicant was born in 1943 and lived in sremska mitrovica. on 26 december 1993 the applicant was detained on remand by the “police of the republic of serbian krajina” (policija republike srpske krajine) under suspicion of murder. his detention was subsequently extended by the “investigative judge” (istražni sudija) on 29 december 1993 and by the “district court of beli manastir” (okružni sud u belom manastiru) on 25 january 1994, 15 february 1994, 8 april 1994 and 9 may 1994. on 9 may 1994 the “district court of beli manastir” sentenced the applicant to 8 years of imprisonment for murder. it found that the applicant, after a quarrel in which his neighbour accused him of war profiteering, intentionally shot the neighbour in the head with a rifle, leaving him dead on the spot. it further found that the entire event had taken place in front of several eyewitnesses. the applicant was then sent to serve his prison sentence in “beli manastir district prison” (okružni zatvor u belom manastiru). all of the above institutions were at the relevant time under the control of the “republic of serbian krajina” (republika srpska krajina), an internationally unrecognised self-proclaimed entity established on the territory of the republic of croatia during the wars in the former yugoslavia. the entity ceased to exist after the adoption of the basic agreement on the region of eastern slavonia, baranja and western sirmium of 12 november 1995 (hereinafter erdut agreement) by which the republic of croatia assumed sovereignty over the entirety of its territory. the entity was never recognised as a state by the respondent state. shortly after the adoption of the erdut agreement, and upon the request of the “beli manastir district prison”, the applicant was transferred on 20 june 1996 to sremska mitrovica prison (kazneno-popravni zavod sremska mitrovica), which is on the territory of the respondent state. the reason for the transfer was listed as “security concerns”. no proceedings for recognition and enforcement of a foreign prison sentence were conducted by the authorities of the republic of serbia. the applicant remained in sremska mitrovica prison until 5 february 1999, when he was released for annual leave until 15 february 1999. due to the applicant’s failure to return to the prison on the specified date, a warrant for his arrest was issued. on 7 july 2010, the applicant was arrested when he attempted to enter serbia from croatia. he was sent to sremska mitrovica prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. the applicant remained in prison until 15 november 2012 when he was pardoned by the president of the republic of serbia and released. on 4 february 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal challenging the lawfulness of his imprisonment. on 10 may 2012 the constitutional court found that there was no violation of the applicant’s right to liberty. it concluded that the legal ground for the applicant’s detention was his conviction by the “supreme court of serbian krajina” of 21 july 1994. it further noted that the procedure governing the recognition of a foreign criminal sentence and its enforcement was not applicable in the applicant’s case because serbian krajina was not a state. the court concluded that the applicant’s transfer had been carried out for factual reasons – the deteriorating security situation in the war zone which could lead to the applicant’s escape from prison or his death. the court further noted that the applicant had been convicted of murder by which the right to life was violated, and that states have positive obligations to protect this right. it finally held that the lack of procedure for recognition of a foreign judgment was proportionate to the obligation to enforce a prison sentence for murder especially given that the applicant had access to the constitutional court which had the power to review the legality of his detention and that he had access to other procedures available to any other prisoner in serbia, including the procedure for applying for a pardon. on 7 march 2011 the applicant initiated civil proceedings for compensation for unlawful imprisonment. on 13 december 2012 the first instance court in belgrade rejected the applicant’s claim finding that he had been lawfully convicted of murder by the courts of the “republic of srpska krajina” and that his imprisonment cannot be considered as unlawful. on 16 april 2014 the belgrade appellate court confirmed this judgment. on 6 june 2014 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law before the supreme court of cassation. on 8 july 2015 the supreme court of cassation rejected the applicant’s appeal on points of law on procedural grounds, finding that the value of the dispute in question was below the applicable statutory threshold.
the applicant is a man who is intellectually disabled. on 14 february 2001 he was taken, with his two brothers, into public care by the child welfare authorities and placed temporarily with a foster family with whom they had already been living since august 2000. in june 2006 the foster family, the applicant and one of his brothers moved to a village in the north of finland. the removal of the children was not authorised by the competent child welfare authority. in june 2007 the applicant finished his compulsory school education as a special needs student integrated into a normal school. one of his brothers was placed in the same home in the autumn of 2007. on 13 august 2008 he began studying at a local vocational school. on 4 november 2008 a mentor (edunvalvoja, intressebevakare) was appointed for the applicant for matters other than those pertaining to his person. the applicant could thus freely make his own decisions in matters pertaining to his own person. on 25 january 2009 the former foster parents took the applicant to the north of finland, invoking his decision to move there to live with them. he considered them to be his real family. the next day, the social welfare authorities arrived with the police to fetch the applicant and to take him back, against his will, to his home town. he was placed in his home town in a special living unit for intellectually disabled adults. on 18 june 2009 the district court, on the basis of the guardianship service act, appointed a mentor for the applicant in matters concerning his property and economy, as well as matters pertaining to his person to the extent that the applicant was unable to understand their significance. on 7 february 2011, after having received a psychologist’s report dated 26 november 2010 on the applicant, the appointed mentor decided, against the applicant’s will, that it was in his best interests for him to live in his home town, where his family members also lived. on 8 april 2011 the applicant asked the district court to discharge the mentor appointed for him from her duties as far as matters pertaining to his place of residence and education were concerned. he requested that another person of his choosing be appointed as his mentor in those matters. consequently, the evaluation concluded that the applicant was not able to consider whether his plans about future were realistic and what consequences or implications they would have. it was likely that his opinion was influenced by that of the former foster parents. the applicant had in his home town a support network consisting of relatives, friends and staff of the social welfare authorities, a job, hobbies and educational possibilities. as matter of law, the district court stated that as, on the evidence, the applicant was not able to understand the significance of the envisaged decision, the mentor was not required, or even permitted, to resolve the question of the applicant’s place of residence in accordance with the applicant’s own wishes. when the applicant had been removed from the former foster family in 2007 and placed in a children’s home in southern finland, no specific reasons had been given as to why this measure had been in the applicant’s best interests. the decision taken subsequently by the mentor in february 2011 had merely confirmed the earlier decision. on 8 february 2013 the supreme court refused the applicant leave to appeal. since 2 january 2015 he has been residing in sheltered accommodation, in a small two-room flat. he is employed by his home town, undertaking work five days a week in a shelter for intellectually disabled people. he is a talkative, efficient and well-liked employee and fits in very well in the working community. according to the government, the applicant has not discussed the possibility of moving elsewhere for a long time. he is happy with his work and plays floorball twice a week as a hobby. there is nothing in his home town that keeps him there or makes him want to stay there.
the first applicant was born in 1943 and lives in cologne and the second applicant was born in 1940 and lives in stuttgart. the first applicant is the natural son of a mr h., who recognised paternity several months after his birth. the first applicant had a personal relationship with his father and worked in his business. on 7 november 2007 the cologne district court granted the certificate, upon which the first applicant took the estate into his possession and disposed of it. the first applicant appealed against that decision, but on 25 august 2008 the cologne regional court upheld it. in a decision of 3 november 2009 the cologne district court dismissed the first applicant’s application, holding that the judgment in brauer (cited above) was not applicable to his case. instead, it granted certificates of partial inheritance to the first applicant’s half-sister and to the grandchildren of the deceased’s wife. the principles developed in brauer (cited above) were not applicable to the present case. there was a need to protect the legitimate expectations of the deceased and other heirs. on 18 march 2010 the first applicant appealed to the cologne court of appeal, arguing that the application of the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act would discriminate against him and breach his inheritance rights and therefore violate his right to equality before the law under article 3 and his rights under article 6 § 5 of the basic law. the first applicant’s father had assumed that the first applicant would be his sole heir. in a decision of 11 october 2010 the cologne court of appeal dismissed the first applicant’s appeal on the grounds that it was bound by the decisions of the federal constitutional court and that it had found that the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act was in conformity with the basic law. the first applicant’s argument, therefore, that he had had a close relationship with his father, which was a statement of fact, could not be taken into account when deciding on the appeal because it had been submitted for the first time before the court of appeal. the second applicant is the natural son of a mr b. and was born in the former gdr, where he lived until his flight from the country in 1957. in 1949 mr b. was ordered by the hamburg-blankensee district court to pay maintenance for the applicant. the father died on 26 june 2006, naming his daughter as sole heir in his will. in 2009, after the european court of human rights had issued its judgment in brauer (cited above), the second applicant brought an action for a compulsory portion of the deceased’s estate (plichtteilsklage) with the hamburg regional court. that provision was in conformity with the basic law. the regional court referred to the federal constitutional court’s judgment of 8 december 1976. it noted that brauer (cited above) was not applicable to the case at hand because there had been no regular contact between the second applicant and his father, the deceased had a natural daughter and the second applicant had not lived in the former gdr for most of his life. in a decision of 15 june 2010 the hamburg court of appeal upheld the regional court’s decision, endorsing its reasoning. the federal court of justice also noted that the facts at issue did not fall within the ambit of article 8 or that of article 14 of the convention. that led to a violation of article 8 and article 14 of the convention. the second applicant also lodged a constitutional complaint with the federal constitutional court. as a consequence he had been denied his inheritance rights. it declared both applicants’ constitutional complaints admissible. the difference between children born outside marriage before and after 1 july 1949 had been abolished by the second inheritance rights equalisation act of 12 april 2011. the general discrimination against children born before and after that date therefore no longer existed. any discriminatory treatment was therefore of a lesser degree. making the reform retroactive was not necessary as the conformity of the relevant provision of the children born outside marriage (legal status) act had been repeatedly confirmed by the federal constitutional court.
the applicant was born in 1988 and lives in zagreb. with whom the applicant and her partner had had a verbal and physical conflict. who had also been involved in the conflict. a preliminary report prepared by the police stated that the applicant and her partner had first had an argument with i.m. had then attacked the applicant’s partner. on the same day the applicant was examined at a hospital, where her injuries were confirmed. he had realised that it had been two young men and he had told the applicant to ignore them because they were drunk (“wasted”). saying “fuck your gypsy mother, who is wasted? stated that he had then panicked and had drawn a knife in order to scare them. however, the attackers had managed to get hold of š.š. at that point the applicant had tried to help and had also been hit. saying that he was a rom and should be killed. in her police interview of 9 june 2013 the applicant stated that she lived with š.š., fuck your gypsy mother, you should all be exterminated, this will be a white croatia again, you are garbage” (tko je pijan, jebem ti mater cigansku, vas treba istrijebiti, ovo će ponovno biti bijela hrvatska, smeće jedno). but another woman had prevented her from doing so. while she had run away and looked for help. in their interviews of 9 june 2013 the two assailants explained that the conflict had broken out because š.š. and motivated by the latter’s roma origin. repeated the statement he had given during the first police interview. during her questioning as a witness, the applicant repeated the statement she had given during the first police interview (see paragraph 12 above). upon completion of the investigation, on 30 october 2013 the zagreb municipal state attorney’s office indicted s.k. at a hearing on 9 october 2014 the zagreb municipal criminal court questioned š.š. he repeated the statements given to the police. guilty as charged and sentenced them to one year and six months’ imprisonment. in the meantime, on 29 july 2013 the applicant and her partner, represented by the lawyer l.k., threatening to kill him and the applicant. the applicant’s representative then informed the zagreb municipal state attorney’s office that the applicant and her partner would participate in the proceedings as victims and requested to be informed of all relevant procedural steps. however, the statements of the witnesses š.š. who is of roma origin, but because they were drunk and they accidentally pushed her towards the stalls. in particular, the injury which maja škorjanec sustained would, by its nature, suggest an injury within the meaning of article 177 § 1 of the criminal code. ...
the applicants were born in 1945 and 1935 respectively and live in moscow and lyubertsy. the draft guidelines were published in a local newspaper on 6 august 2002. it appears that they were eventually adopted in 2003. a committee composed of officials attached to various public authorities was asked to make a proposal regarding a plot of land for constructing blocks of flats. the municipality and the investor would own 5% and 95% of the newly built housing space respectively. in october 2002 a private company, ors-grupp, replaced the state enterprise as the project investor. the court was not provided with a copy of this valuation report. according to the government, on 3 july 2003 there was a meeting between kirova street residents and, apparently, a representative of the local authorities or the private company. however, she turned down these offers, considering them insufficient or the location of the alternative housing unsuitable. m] ...

the assessment object is situated in the centre of the old town of lyubertsy. on 23 november 2004, in reply to an enquiry raised by the investor company, the municipality announced that it had no available plots of land that would be equivalent to the land to be expropriated from the applicants, namely those assigned for the construction of individual housing. in late 2004 the town administration brought proceedings in the lyubertsy town court of the moscow region (“the town court”) seeking judicial authorisation for the expropriation of the applicants’ house and land. after hearing evidence from a representative of the municipality, it decided to join the cases. in the meantime, the moscow region prosecutor’s office replied to a request for information from the second applicant, informing him that the regional ministry had acted ultra vires in taking a decision on the general plan in 1999 and that no copy of it existed (see paragraph 10 above). it appears that on 11 february 2005 the court ordered a new report from expert centre. in february 2005 a group of three experts compiled a report indicating usd 23,300 and 5,200 as the market values of the first applicant’s land and part of the house respectively, and usd 70,000 and 15,600 as the second applicant’s (compare the earlier assessment in paragraph 27 above). (c)  the court considered that the applicants had failed to adduce evidence to substantiate their claims for better housing in moscow and a higher amount of compensation for the land. m. the second applicant would receive compensation for the land and his part in the house of usd 85,600 and a social tenancy contract for a four-room flat in lyubertsy for his family measuring some 70 sq. on 4 july 2005 the moscow regional court upheld the first-instance judgment. in the meantime, on 22 august 2005 the applicants were evicted and had their belongings removed from the house. the bank issued a certificate allowing the accountholder to use the money. on 22 november 2005 the application was examined and rejected by another judge of the regional court. in a letter of 11 october 2006 he agreed with the lower courts’ decisions. it appears that the relevant procedural orders were annulled because they reached the applicant after the respective time limits for complying with them had expired. (b)  pecuniary claims relating to delayed enforcement and loss of belongings 51. on 26 february 2009 the moscow regional court quashed that judgment on appeal and instead awarded the applicant rub 3,161, considering that the judgment had been enforced on 26 august 2005 when the expropriation compensation had been credited into the bank account opened for her. in 2008 the applicant lodged a complaint with the bailiff service, requesting compensation for belongings that had either been lost or damaged during or following demolition of the house. on 22 may 2008 the district bailiff office replied that an inventory of her belongings had been compiled before the demolition. they had all been transferred to her social housing flat and entrusted to a public official for safekeeping; she had had three years to reclaim them. between august 2008 and january 2009 various courts in moscow declined jurisdiction or turned down for procedural reasons a related civil claim by her against the federal ministry of justice.
the applicant was born in 1953 and lives in tbilisi. on 15 may 1999 the applicant was appointed president of the abasha district court for a ten-year term. on 3 december 2004 the supreme council of justice initiated disciplinary proceedings against the applicant under section 2(2)-(e) of the act of 22 february 2000 on disciplinary proceedings against judges of ordinary courts (hereinafter, “the disciplinary proceedings act” – see paragraphs 15-18 below). he was accused in particular of having retained a criminal case file for six months after withdrawing from the case on 29 october 2003. on 23 december 2004 a panel of the disciplinary council of judges (hereinafter, “the panel”), composed of mr k.k. ( the president of the panel and rapporteur), mr g.ch, mr d.s. according to the transcript of the hearing, the applicant admitted to the act of negligence he had been accused of. after examining the circumstances of the case, the panel found the applicant guilty of the misconduct in question. it considered his conduct all the more serious because the defendants in the case had been in detention at the time and because he had had a duty, under article 6 of the convention, to act promptly and without fault. the panel took into account the nature of the misconduct, which it classified as serious, and the existence of another disciplinary measure against the applicant in the past, and decided to remove him from office. on 29 december 2004 the applicant lodged an appeal with the disciplinary council of judges (hereinafter, “the disciplinary council”) on points of fact and law under section 60(1) of the disciplinary proceedings act (see paragraph 17 below). he questioned the assessment of the circumstances of the case and the application of the legal provisions to the established facts in the decision of 23 december 2004. his appeal was examined at a plenary session of the disciplinary council composed of eight members, including the same four, mr k.k., and mr th.th, who had sat at the first hearing. acted as president and rapporteur in the examination of the applicant’s appeal. by a decision of 27 january 2005, the disciplinary council unanimously upheld the panel’s decision of 23 december 2004 in its entirety. the appellate instance confirmed that the lower body had correctly established the facts and applied the relevant law to the factual findings. the applicant then lodged an appeal on points of law with the supreme court under section 74 of the disciplinary proceedings act, as amended on 25 february 2005 (see paragraph 18 below). he argued that he had not been given notice that he could appear before the panel and that there had been a delay in the disciplinary council examining his appeal. he also stated that under article 6 of the convention the four members of the panel who had taken the decision of 23 december 2004 had not had the right to sit subsequently in the disciplinary council appeal hearing. in a judgment of 11 july 2005, the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal as ill-founded. based on the transcript, it found that he had in fact been present at the panel hearing on 23 december 2004 and had been able to state his case without impediment, contrary to his allegation. at the hearing the applicant had admitted to the act of negligence with which he had been charged. the supreme court rejected the allegation of a delay in the examination of the case by the disciplinary council by noting that the latter had given its ruling within the statutory time-limit of one month. the supreme court also found that the presence of four members of the panel as participants in the subsequent disciplinary council proceedings had not contravened the requirements of sections 22 and 24 of the disciplinary proceedings act (see paragraph 17 below).
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in kaluđerica. on 22 december 2006 the applicant was deprived of liberty on suspicion of participating in criminal association within the police operation “customs mafia” during which 43 persons were also arrested. the applicant was released on 15 june 2007. on 31 july 2009 the investigation against all the accused was transferred to the prosecutor’s office for organised crime. on 28 june 2012 the investigation was closed. on 17 january 2013 the criminal proceedings against the applicant were suspended.
the applicant was born in 1986 and lives in nizhniy novgorod. the applicant’s interview took place in room no. he was asked questions concerning the rape of a girl he knew, but stated that he had nothing to do with the crime. about forty minutes later they untied him and requested that he confess to the rape. four or five police officers punched and kicked him in the head and body, throttled him with a baton, put a plastic bag over his head and blocked off his access to air, sat and jumped on him having covered him with a blanket, grabbed him by the ears and forced him to do the splits. after being questioned by s. he was released. he remained at the police station for approximately ten hours. no documents concerning his detention were issued. he was unable to attend school until 15 june 2004, having been issued a sick note on 26 may 2004 for concussion. no criminal proceedings were brought against him. they were each set aside because a comprehensive inquiry had not been carried out. on 28 february 2006 the applicant was granted victim status. police officers a. and g. gave statements saying that on 24 may 2004 they had invited the applicant to accompany them to the police station. they denied any ill-treatment of the applicant. on the same day the investigation was suspended on the grounds that the perpetrator had not been identified. on 27 july 2006 the investigation was resumed and the applicant identified f. during an identification parade. on 24 august 2006 a face-to-face confrontation was carried out between the applicant and f. the applicant stated that f. had taken part in his ill‑treatment and had taken the confession from him. he was unable to recall any specific acts of violence by him. on 25 august 2006 the criminal proceedings against f. were discontinued under article 27 (1) § 1 of the ccrp on the grounds that he had not been involved in the crime. on 26 january 2007 a confrontation was held between the applicant and police officers a. and g., who again both denied using any violence towards the applicant. he explained that he had not previously identified a. because he had poor eyesight. the applicant stated that g. had not assaulted him, but had interviewed him and had been present during his ill-treatment. the investigation was subsequently resumed and on 19 april 2007 was suspended again on the same grounds. on 17 november 2008 the sovetskiy district court of nizhniy novgorod (“the district court”) acknowledged a violation of the applicant’s right not to be subjected to treatment proscribed under article 3 of the convention, allowed the applicant’s civil claim in part and awarded him rub 50,000 (about 1,450 euros (eur)). the district court noted that the applicant had been a minor at the time and that, according to his submissions at the hearing, various acts of violence, to which the police officers of the sovetskiy district police had, in the exercise of their duties, subjected him (see paragraph 9 above), had caused him mental and physical suffering. over the next few days he had been weak and dizzy and had felt heaviness in the back of his head. when the police officers had tried to throttle him he had feared for his life. he had been scared, subdued and depressed. the parties appealed against the judgment. the applicant contested the amount of compensation, considering it to be disproportionate to the suffering he had endured.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in kragujevac. on 13 july 2006 the applicant filed a civil suit together with 18 other persons with the kragujevac municipal court against his former employer telekom srbija ad beograd requesting the payment of funds from profit made in 2005. the applicant’s previous representative did not attend first preliminary hearing fixed for 15 november 2006, since he had been deleted from the register of the attorneys–at-law in may 2006. the applicant appointed the present representative on 25 january 2007. the preliminary hearing was held on 13 february 2007. on 27 august 2007 the proceedings were split to separate proceedings for each of the plaintiffs concerned. the preliminary hearing was held on 21 march 2008. within the period from 21 october 2008 until 29 april 2011 seven out of eight hearings were postponed for various reasons, mainly because the representatives on the both sides provided new submissions and evidence and on the proposal of both sides due to the cost-efficiency of the proceedings. on 29 april 2011 the kragujevac first instance court ruled against the applicant. on 20 february 2012 the kragujevac appeals court upheld that judgment. on 27 june 2013 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s appeal.
the applicant was born in 1964 and lives in kostrena. the company primarily provides public utility services such as parking, waste disposal, funeral services, maintaining green spaces, cemeteries and so forth. in an article published in the daily novi list of 19 september 2007, mr m.u., ‘i cannot speak for the others, but after everything that has happened, i can say that mirela marunić has betrayed the trust of the members of the general meeting because she disclosed information which should only have been discussed at the general meeting. our municipal utility company does not carry out the type of business for which it was established. for example, žurkovo bay was leased as a parking lot and a dry [dock] marina, and the same applies to the parking lot near kostrenka. had it stayed in our hands we would, apart from making a profit, also have had the chance to employ someone’. the relevant part of that article reads as follows:
“the mayor of kostrena, m.u., ‘they betrayed my trust by not believing me. i first informed my [political] party but there was no reaction. then they asked me not to talk about it in the presence of d.g. [ marunić illustrates this by referring to the viktor lenac parking lot where the municipal utility company has been charging for parking on land which was not even owned by kostrena municipality. kostrena needs professionals, but they are being removed, the proof of which is the proposal to remove t.s. by a decision of the company’s general meeting of 11 october 2007 the applicant was summarily dismissed because of the statements she had made in the media, which were regarded as being damaging to the company’s business reputation. the relevant part of that decision reads as follows:
“on 27 september 2007 the novi list daily published an article ... stating that the director of kd kostrena, mirela marunić, had given a statement to [a] journalist of novi list saying that kd kostrena was acting unlawfully, that it was charging for parking where it was not allowed, that she demanded an audit of kd kostrena, and the involvement of the office for the prevention of corruption and organised crime and the state attorney’s office with a view to looking into kd kostrena’s operations. if, on the other hand, those allegations are not true but were nevertheless made in the publication that has the largest circulation in the area [of the country] then those allegations gravely harm the [business] reputation of the company because they suggest that kd kosterna operates unlawfully. the applicant argued, inter alia, as follows:
“i contest entirely the argument that by making statements in the media i acted inappropriately and allegedly attacked the [business] reputation of the company ...
the utility company is a public company which belongs to the [local] community ... it was my duty, as a member of the [company’s] management, to contact the media and inform the public because it is a public company and not someone’s private property. it is a well-known fact that the media show a great interest in kostrena municipality because of political turbulence among those heading the municipality. on 21 november 2007 she therefore brought a civil action for wrongful dismissal against the company in the rijeka municipal court (općinski sud u rijeci). by a judgment of 12 june 2008 the municipal court ruled in favour of the applicant. furthermore, since the decision to dismiss her had specifically related only to her job as director, it could not be assumed that it had also entailed the termination of her entire employment relationship with the company, including the job to which she was supposed to have been transferred after 1 october 2007. the court thus found that the dismissal had been wrongful and that the applicant’s employment relationship had not been terminated. it accordingly ordered that she be reinstated and assigned to another job within the company. however, the county court also disagreed with the view of the municipal court that the applicant’s behaviour, namely her statements in the media, had constituted a serious breach of employment-related duties such as to justify summary dismissal. that argument is incorrect [having regard to her statements in] the article published in novi list of 27 september 2009 ...
the constitutional court notes that the right ‘of a citizen’ to publicly express his or her personal opinions cannot justify a breach of employment-related rights and obligations stemming from an employment contract and the relevant legislation.” by a judgment of 3 march 2008 the court dismissed kd kostrena’s action. the final outcome of those proceedings is unknown. however, an extract from the land register concerning the two plots of land that were the subject of the proceedings suggests that the water and sewage company transferred ownership of the plots to shipbuilding company viktor lenac on 13 february 2014. the plaintiff company claimed that kd kostrena had been charging for parking on land owned by the plaintiff. she still holds that position at the time of the court’s judgment.
the applicant was born in 1964 and lives in antalya. according to the incident report drawn up by the gendarmerie, the woman, identified as ç.v., was crying when they approached the car and said that she had been kidnapped and beaten up by the applicant. on the way to the station the applicant, who had been allowed to drive his own car, was caught trying to get rid of a knife, a hatchet and a mobile phone that he was hiding in the car. upon arrival at the gendarmerie station, ç.v. two years before to help her through her divorce, including financially. had become very demanding and aggressive, and had threatened to expose their relationship and spread lies about him numerous times. and claimed that it was she who had wanted to meet. which recorded a 0.5 cm cut on her tongue, a red ecchymosis of 3 cm x 2 cm on the right side of her neck, a red lesion on her upper right chest, and pain in her left thumb. claimed that she had submitted the written statement under duress and that her initial accusations had been truthful. on 16 september 2004 the samsun public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the samsun assize court against the applicant, charging him with attempted rape, false imprisonment and robbery. maintained her allegations against the applicant, save for the attempted sexual assault. she claimed in this connection that although the applicant had said he would rape her, had taken off his pants and had told her to get undressed, he had never actually attempted to assault her sexually. the applicant, on the other hand, continued to deny the accusations against him. the applicant submitted to the trial court copies of her phone bills, which she had given him for payment. pointed to her bleeding mouth and signalled a gun with her hand. upon his demand, the applicant retrieved the gun from the boot and handed it over to the commander. on account of the latter’s wish to break up with him and therefore assaulted ç.v. appealed against the judgment of the samsun assize court. did not contest the absence of a conviction on the charge of attempted rape. it upheld the applicant’s acquittal for the remaining charges. the applicant submitted an objection to this decision to the samsun administrative court. on 29 september 2005 the samsun administrative court upheld the dismissal decision of the disciplinary council as lawful. the administrative court opined that ç.v. ’s initial statements to the gendarmerie, along with her medical report and the articles confiscated from the applicant’s car on the date of the incident, some of which he had attempted to hide from the gendarmerie, constituted sufficient evidence to hold that the applicant had committed the acts of attempted rape, false imprisonment and threatening with a weapon held against him, although there were no witnesses to corroborate ç.v. notwithstanding the fact that the victim and the applicant gave different accounts of the events and that the specific allegations were not corroborated by witnesses, the court notes, on the basis of the preliminary investigation report of the samsun prosecutor’s office, that an anonymous caller notified the authorities that a cry for help came from a white şahin type civilian type vehicle in the vicinity of alanlı village, and that the applicant and ç.v. were later spotted by the gendarmerie close to that area, sitting in a similar car. ’s complaint and that a gun, a knife, a hatchet, handcuffs, a truncheon, duct tape, rope and a bloodstained blue towel were found. therefore, the disciplinary offence of which the applicant was accused and the corresponding sanction he received cannot be deemed unlawful.” this decision was served on the applicant on 12 july 2007.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in waldegg, austria. on 28 september 1994 the applicant initiated civil proceedings requesting the division of a certain estate. on 5 january 2009 the ivanjica municipal court suspended the said proceedings until conclusion of another civil case. it would appear that the said civil proceedings are still pending. on 23 june 2011 the constitutional court found a breach of the applicant’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time and ordered the speeding up of the impugned proceedings. the court, additionally, declared that the applicant was entitled to the non-pecuniary damages sought, in accordance with article 90 of the constitutional court act (see paragraph 13, article 90, below). it seems that, the applicant contacted the commission for compensation on 11 december 2011 and requested the payment of the compensation awarded, but apparently received no response.
the applicants found themselves staying in the transit zone of sheremetyevo airport of moscow. the applicant is an iraqi national who was born in 1987. he later moved to china to look for a job. the applicant was sent to moscow on 27 july 2015. the applicant described the conditions of his stay in the transit zone as follows. he slept on a mattress on the floor in the boarding area of the airport, which was constantly lit, crowded and noisy. he sustained himself on emergency rations provided by the russian office of unhcr. there were no showers in the transit area. the applicant’s lawyer was served with the decision of 29 december 2015 on 23 january 2016. on 1 february 2016 the applicant lodged an appeal against the decisions of 10 november and 29 december 2015 with the basmannyy district court of moscow. on 17 march 2016, having been resettled by unhcr, the applicant left for denmark. on 12 may 2016 the basmannyy district court of moscow upheld the russian fms’s decision. he holds a passport issued by the palestinian authority. from 23 august 2015 the applicant stayed in the transit zone of sheremetyevo airport. the applicant’s lawyer appealed to the russian fms, arguing that the applicant did not have any possibility to return to his home in the gaza strip, that the moscow region fms had failed to assess his personal situation and the risk he would face if returned to palestine, and that the moscow region fms, in breach of the refugees act (fz-4528-1 of 19 february 1993), had not issued him with an examination certificate. on 9 april 2015 the applicant was deported from cuba to russia. the russian border guard service did not allow him to pass through passport control. on 10 april 2015 the applicant lodged an application for refugee status, arguing that he had fled somalia in 2005 because he had received threats from members of a terrorist group. on 1 july 2015 the moscow region fms interviewed the applicant. however, they did not issue him with an examination certificate. on 17 october 2015 the applicant’s brother was killed in mogadishu, somalia. on 22 december 2015 the moscow region fms refused to grant the applicant temporary asylum. on the same date the applicant’s lawyer appealed. on 9 march 2017 he left for mogadishu, somalia. on 10 september 2014 he applied for temporary asylum to the moscow city department of the federal migration service (“the moscow city fms”), claiming to have fled syria because of the ongoing civil war there. it appears that the applicant remained in russia despite that refusal. the turkish authorities denied the applicant entry to the country and sent him back to moscow on 20 august 2015. on 8 september 2015 the applicant took a flight to beirut, but the lebanese authorities denied him entry to the country and sent him back to moscow. given the absence of any refrigerator or kitchen, his rations were extremely limited. on 7 april 2016 the applicant once again tried to lodge an application for refugee status through the border guard service.
mr grigoryan and ms sergeyeva were born in 1981 and 1975 respectively and live in kyiv. it appears that at the relevant time they were unmarried life partners. according to the applicants, the police stopped the car and asked the mr grigoryan to get out. according to the police, mr grigoryan, while leaning out of the car window, made obscene gestures and swore at them. the police asked him to get out of the car and show his identification, which he eventually did. indeed, in his submissions it is suggested that he was fully cooperative, got out of the car voluntarily and identified himself. on arrival at the police station the patrol officers handed over the applicants to police major a., the station’s duty officer. the reports state that they were drawn up at 11.50 p.m. on 6 april 2010. on the pre-printed part of the report forms, the grounds for arresting them are cited as the need to stop the commission of the offence and to draw up a report (see relevant provisions of the code of administrative offences in paragraph 34 (i) and (iii) below). according to the applicants, the reports were given to them to sign only the next morning immediately prior to their release. it is evident from subsequent findings made by the authorities (see paragraph 32 below) that, while the administrative reports were being drawn up, mr grigoryan continued yelling, swearing and attempting to hit the officers. to stop this, his arms were twisted behind his back and he was bound. the police then overcame his resistance and tied him up for another thirty minutes. according to ms sergeyeva, she was able to hear mr grigoryan being beaten from her cell and this caused her distress. she alleged that while tying her up, the officers also hit her, spat on her, called her an “armenian whore” and threatened to rape her. reports on the tying up of both applicants were drawn up by major a. on pre-printed forms. the pre-printed forms state that the tying up procedure was used to stop unruly conduct (“буйство”) and prevent self‑harm by an intoxicated individual. at 4.30 a.m. on 7 april 2010 the applicants were transferred to the central police station of the svyatoshynskyy district (hereinafter “the district”), arriving there at 5.20 a.m. there, a senior district police official ruled on their case, imposing fines equivalent to about eur 4.70 on each of them. between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. the applicants signed the aforementioned administrative offence reports (see paragraph 10 above), without adding any objections, and were released. later the same day forensic medical expert n. examined the applicants at their request and drew up a report noting that they had numerous bruises on their faces and bodies, which could have been inflicted on 7 april 2010. the expert also observed bloating and bluish colour on his right hand and two parallel left-to-right abrasions on his forehead and chin. when questioned by the prosecutor’s office in the course of the subsequent pre-investigation enquiries, the expert expressed the opinion that the above injuries suffered by mr grigoryan were the result of at least twenty impacts by blunt objects. on 12 april 2010 mr grigoryan lodged a similar complaint. he stated in particular that on arrival at the police station he had immediately been put in a cell. he had started hitting the cell door, also wishing to receive an explanation. there had been no other arrestees at the police station that night. on 9 september 2010 the district prosecutor again refused to institute criminal proceedings. he found that the grounds for arrest had been that mr grigoryan had made obscene gestures towards police officers and that the second applicant had sworn at them. on 17 march, 18 august and 12 december 2011 respectively the kyiv svyatoshynsky district court declared those decisions premature. it would appear that this report contains the only coherent official account of the events of the night of 6 to 7 april 2010.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in ganja. the applicant had ownership rights to a shop at 32 attarlar street in ganja. m and it had been purchased by the applicant from the state for 1,309,000 old azerbaijani manats (azm) (equivalent to 261.8 new azerbaijani manats (azn) or approximately 230 euros). the shop had concrete foundations, the external and internal walls were made of metal and wood, while the roof was made of metal and covered with slate tiles. the property was classified as a non‑residential building used for wholesale or retail trade purposes. the document further stated that the plot of land on which the shop was located had been allocated on the basis of relevant documents. no other documents concerning the ownership of the land have been submitted by the parties. the applicant paid land tax for 2004 of azm 19,400 for the plot underneath the shop. in 2004 the ganja city executive authority (“the gcea”) decided to renovate and widen attarlar and nizami streets in accordance with the city’s planning scheme because the streets were not wide enough for the pedestrian and car traffic. according to the applicant, in november 2004 gcea officials asked him verbally to vacate the shop in connection with the above decision. the applicant refused and brought a legal action asking the court to order the gcea to stop its allegedly unlawful activities. according to the government, the shop, being a transportable metal construction, was lifted away by crane and moved to an unspecified part of the city. on an unspecified date in december 2004 the applicant asked aysel‑m, a private valuation firm, to assess the shop’s market value. the applicant supplemented his court action against the gcea with additional claims, asking for compensation of azm 588,000,000 for the shop, azm 99,000 for an unspecified “state fee” and azm 490,000 for aysel-m’s fee for the report. the respondent argued that the applicant’s shop had not been destroyed but, being a metal construction, had been removed by crane to another, unspecified location in the city. the applicant had been offered another plot of land in the city to continue operating his shop but he had refused. the applicant had not owned the original plot of land. the respondent argued that the compensation claimed by the applicant was excessive, taking into account the price he had paid the state for it in 2003. following the respondent’s submissions concerning the alleged excessiveness of the compensation claim, by an interim decision of 15 july 2005 the khojavand district court requested a new valuation by a state expert. on an unspecified date the state expert refused to issue an opinion, noting that the shop at 32 attarlar street no longer existed and that therefore it was technically impossible to examine it and assess its market value. accordingly, the interim decision of 15 july 2005 remained unexecuted. in its reasoning the court accepted the gcea’s explanation that the shop in question had been removed in accordance with town‑planning policy. being a metal construction it had been possible to move it in one piece. it had not been destroyed but simply transported to another location. it further decided to reject the applicant’s compensation claim based on aysel-m’s report, without providing any reasons. however, the court ordered the gcea to allocate the applicant a plot of land in ganja equivalent in size to the shop in question. the applicant appealed, reiterating that his shop had been unlawfully destroyed and asking for compensation. the appellate judgment contained no references to applicable domestic legal provisions. following a further appeal by the applicant, on 14 july 2006 the supreme court upheld the court of appeal’s judgment. no information is available in the case file as to whether a new land plot was allocated to the applicant or as to its location or any other details.
the applicant was born in 1949 and lives in makhachkala, republic of dagestan, russia. several hundred people took part, alleging corruption by local public officials. murad nagmetov was wounded by a tear-gas grenade and died from his wounds. five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested. the forensic expert was given the following two objects for examination: a grenade with a special charge; and an obturator with a special charge (a 23 mm cartridge used with a carbine type ks-23 (ks-23m)). however, the reports were not produced, apparently, on account of lack of sufficient technical facilities. it appears from the decision that it concerned persons other than the applicant’s son. the above-mentioned cases were subsequently joined. on 8 november 2006 the federal office of forensic examination issued a report, the relevant parts of which read:
“ ... as the relevant 23 mm cartridges had not been submitted for test shots, a request for 23 mm volna cartridges was made to the relevant department of the ministry of the interior of the russian federation ... [footnote: volna cartridges are used for training purposes relating to the use of ks-23 and ks-23m carbines. these cartridges are similar to those normally used with these carbines. the only difference is that they do not contain the irritating chemical substance.] ... these cartridges are similar to those that were submitted for the examination ... 6. ... in view of the variance of the results of the test shots, it was impracticable to identify the relevant carbine on the basis of the striae left on the obturators ... in particular, on account of the elasticity and low thermo-resistance of the material used in the obturators ...” 23. on 26 february 2007 the expert from the institute issued a report stating that it was not practicable to determine which of the examined carbines had been used to shoot the cartridge. on 26 february 2007 the investigating authority suspended the investigation. on 25 july 2008 the district court held that the suspension of the investigation was justified. in particular, armourers from the special mobile unit were interviewed. it remains unclear what reply was received to this enquiry. the decision reads as follows:
“having examined the file, i conclude that the investigation did not exhaust the measures aimed at establishing the circumstances of the crime, at collecting the evidence and identifying the rifle used to cause the victim’s death ... in particular, the request for a ballistics report to the institute was submitted with volna cartridges instead of the type of cartridges used for causing the victim’s death. the different geometric parameters of these cartridges prevented the experts from identifying the carbine used against the victim ...
following the resumption of the investigation in december 2009 the investigator merely made an enquiry instead of actually submitting grenades for comparative research ...
it does not follow from the expert report of 26 february 2007 that it would have been impossible to identify the rifle, provided that cartridges of the relevant type were provided. in so doing they violated a directive dated 5 november 1996 ... and acted in excess of their powers. the applicant did not challenge this decision. with regard to just satisfaction claims, i would draw your attention to rule 60 and would remind you that failure to submit within the time allowed quantified claims, together with the required supporting documents, entails the consequence that the chamber will either make no award of just satisfaction or else reject the claim in part. these costs must be itemised, and it must be established that they are reasonable and have been actually and necessarily incurred. these time-limits will not normally be extended.” however, none were submitted by that date. the rules of court (adopted by the plenary court pursuant to article 25 of the convention) read in the relevant parts as follows at the relevant time:
“rule 36 – representation of applicants
... 2. ...
rule 75 – ruling on just satisfaction 1. submitting claims for just satisfaction: formal requirements 5. applicants who consider themselves victims of more than one violation may claim either a single lump sum covering all alleged violations or a separate sum in respect of each alleged violation.
the applicant was born in 1947 and lives in yerevan. on an unspecified date the applicant brought a claim in the arabkir and kanaker-zeytun district court of yerevan against k., a private individual, seeking payment of a certain amount of money. it appears that before the beginning of the court’s examination of the case the applicant and k. concluded an agreement to settle the debt, which envisaged, inter alia, a time-frame for payment. on 3 may 2005 the district court delivered a judgment upholding the settlement. it also stated that bailiffs would enforce the judgment if it was not complied with. no appeal was lodged and the judgment became final. as k. did not comply with the terms of the settlement, the district court issued a writ of execution and on 13 june 2005 a bailiff instituted enforcement proceedings. according to the applicant, the bailiff found no funds or property belonging to k. during the enforcement procedure. by a letter of 7 june 2007 the bailiff informed the applicant that he had found out during the enforcement proceedings that k. had inherited a house but had not registered her ownership of it. the bailiff advised the applicant to institute proceedings against k. in order to have her ownership of the house recognised. it appears that later in 2007 the applicant brought a claim in the arabkir and kanaker-zeytun district court to have k.’s ownership of the house recognised. on 24 october 2007 the district court, relying on article 1225 § 5 of the civil code, granted the applicant’s claim and recognised k. as the owner of the house in question. there was no appeal and the judgment became final. on 19 november 2007 the bailiff, acting on a writ of execution issued by the district court, instituted proceedings to enforce the judgment of 24 october 2007. on 22 november 2007 the bailiff requested that the state committee of the real estate registry recognise k.’s ownership of the house, register it and issue a copy of the ownership certificate. in reply, the real estate registry on 4 december 2007 informed the bailiff that in order to register k.’s rights to the house it needed an application from k., the original of the district court’s judgment of 24 october 2007 and receipts for the state fee and other related payments. it also mentioned that k. was unlawfully occupying a plot of land whose status was unclear. on 8 february, 4 july and 4 august 2008 respectively, the bailiff made similar requests to the real estate registry in which he stated, with reference to section 22 of the law on the state registration of property rights, that an application from k. was not required. he also stated that the issue of registration-related payments would be decided upon initiation of the registration process and that receipts would be submitted. in 2008 the applicant brought a claim in the administrative court against the real estate registry and the bailiff, seeking to oblige them respectively to register k.’s ownership of the house and to confiscate it from her. on 1 december 2008 the administrative court granted the applicant’s claim by ordering the real estate registry to register k.’s rights to the house and the bailiff to confiscate it from her. in particular, the administrative court found that both the refusal of the real estate registry to register k.’s ownership rights and the non-enforcement by the bailiff of the judgment of 3 may 2005 owing to a lack of funds on the part of k. had been groundless as k.’s ownership of the house had been recognised by the final court judgment of 24 october 2007. it appears that no appeal was lodged against the administrative court’s judgment and it became final. according to the applicant, none of the three court judgments was enforced. on 18 february 2010 the applicant sought the payment of interest by k. via a claim in the district court. on 1 march 2011 the district court accepted his claim and ordered k. to pay him 17,727 us dollars (usd), to be converted into armenian drams. the judgment became final on 1 april 2011. the applicant sought enforcement of the judgment on 2 april 2012 but was refused by the bailiff since he had failed to act within the time-limit of one year starting from the final judgment. moreover, the applicant had also failed to submit a power of attorney to the bailiff. on 10 february 2012 k. submitted a receipt for the payment of the debt to the bailiff and he terminated the enforcement proceedings on 13 february 2012.
the applicants were born in 1938, 1940 and 1961 respectively. the first two applicants live in dolni dabnik and the third applicant lives in sofia. the first two applicants are the third applicant’s parents. in 1990 the three applicants bought from the state a flat in sofia measuring 144 square metres, which had become property of the state by virtue of the nationalisations carried out by the communist regime after 1945. in 1992 the heir of the pre-nationalisation owner of the flat brought an action against the applicants under section 7 of the restitution law, seeking to establish that their title was null and void. she also brought a rei vindicatio claim against them. the proceedings ended with a final judgment of the supreme court of cassation on 22 june 2004. the domestic courts dealing with the proceedings allowed both actions against the applicants. in relation to the action under section 7 of the restitution law, the courts found the applicants’ title null and void, since they had bought their flat in breach of the law: the area where the flat was located had been earmarked for the construction of buildings of more than three storeys, and the applicants’ building was of two storeys; and the legislation at the time prohibited the sale of flats in such buildings. it appears that on an unspecified date after that the applicants applied for compensation bonds; however, the parties have not informed the court of the outcome of the procedure. in 2005 the applicants brought a tort action against the sofia municipality (which was the legal successor of the state with regard to residential property). on 20 january 2010 the sofia city court allowed their claim. that judgment was quashed on 4 november 2010 by the sofia court of appeal, which dismissed the claim in its entirety. in a final judgment of 4 april 2012 the supreme court of cassation, finding that the applicants were only entitled to receive the price they had paid for the flat in 1990, which had devalued enormously over the years, awarded them the equivalent of about 12 euros (eur).
the applicants were placed in pre-trial detention at thessaloniki general police headquarters on monasteriou st in thessaloniki. they were detained for periods ranging from one to eight months. the applicants mentioned below left the general police headquarters on the following dates: the first applicant on 16 august 2012, the sixth applicant on 20 august 2012, the thirteenth applicant on 14 august 2012 and the nineteenth applicant on 17 june 2012. the eleventh applicant was detained at thessaloniki general police headquarters from 7 may 2012 to 18 september 2012, except for the period between 5 july 2012 and 1 august 2012, when he was detained at the thessaloniki aliens division. the eighteenth applicant was detained at thessaloniki general police headquarters from 16 july 2012 to 25 december 2012, except for 16 august 2012 to 16 october 2012, when he was held at menemeni police station. the cells had been insufficiently lit and ventilated, which, in addition to overcrowding, had led to their cells smelling badly. detainees had been confined to their cells owing to the lack of an exercise yard. recreational activities had not been offered and cells had not been equipped with televisions. detainees had had to ask permission from the guards to use the restroom, which had been situated outside the cells and had been shared by seventy people. there had not been sufficient separation between detainees who were drug users or smokers and other detainees. additionally, the cells had never been disinfected nor the mattresses cleaned. detainees had not been allowed to bring their own sheets and towels, but had been obliged to use dirty ones provided by the prison authorities. as regards nutrition, meals had been of an insufficient quality and quantity and had never included meat. detainees had not been provided with water but had had to buy it themselves. the eleventh, fourteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth applicants submitted in their written observations of 13 september 2013 that the conditions of their detention at the thessaloniki aliens division and menemeni police station had essentially been the same as those at the police headquarters, in particular as regards the lack of outdoor activities, the quality of the food and the filthiness of the premises. fifteen cells with capacity for fifty-five inmates had accommodated male detainees, one cell for six people had accommodated females while three cells with capacity for twelve people had been set aside for minors. most of the cells had windows, which had been partially covered by walls and rails but which had still admitted natural light and fresh air. the sanitary facilities had been no different from the ones used by the police headquarters staff and had been cleaned by a cleaning company every day, along with the rest of the premises. if detainees had suffered from a contagious disease, their sheets and blankets had been destroyed following their departure. detainees were allowed access to newspapers, magazines and four payphones. additionally, they were allowed visits from their lawyers at any time and from friends and family four times per week. detainees were served food from the restaurant situated in the building, which was the same as that used by police officers. the eleventh, sixteenth and seventeenth applicants had been detained in cell no. 3 along with a number of other detainees whose number had varied from nine to fifteen. the cells had been sufficiently well-lit and ventilated and had been regularly cleaned. detainees had access to newspapers and televisions and were allowed visits from their family and friends three times per week. the fourteenth and eighteenth applicants had been detained in a cell of 26 square metres accommodating five detainees. the cells had been sufficiently well-lit and ventilated and a cleaning company had maintained the cleanliness of the premises. detainees had received 5.87 euros per day to order food from restaurants. the government further contended that the applicants’ allegations of a lack of separation between drug users and other detainees should be rejected as the applicants had not alleged that they themselves had been detained in the same cells as drug users.
the applicant was born in 1949 and lives in antratsit, ukraine. in 1996 the applicant was dismissed from the state enterprise coal mine “yur-shor” («государственное предприятие «шахта «юр‑шор», “the coal mine”). according to the government, the mine was incorporated as a state unitary enterprise. in january 1999 the insolvency proceedings were opened in respect of the mine. on 28 october 1999 the vorkuta town court of the komi republic (the town court) awarded the applicant the equivalent of 1,591 euros (eur) in salary and allowances’ arrears against the coal mine. it appears that the award became final ten days later. the applicant submits, without further details, that the bailiffs did not take measures to execute the judgment. on 27 december 1999 a prosecutor advised the applicant that as from 1 january 1999 the coal mine’s own funds had discontinued and the salary arrears were to be paid from the federal budget. he informed the applicant that the judgment in his favour could not be enforced, since no funds had been allocated from the federal budget for these purposes. on 3 april 2001 the town court ordered the coal mine to pay the applicant eur 51 for court expenses. on 24 april 2002 the town court allowed the applicant’s claim for index-linking of the award of 28 october 1999 and held that the coal mine should pay him eur 912 under this head. it appears that the awards of 28 october 1999, 3 april 2001 and 24 april 2002 in the applicant’s favour have not been enforced to date. the applicant sued various domestic authorities for non-pecuniary damages and index-linking of unpaid salary. on 21 january 2004 the town court granted his action in part, having found, inter alia, that the coal mine could not claim lack of funds as an excuse for non-enforcement of the earlier judgments in the applicant’s favour. the court further found that awards made on 28 october 1999, 3 april 2001 and 24 april 2002 in the amount of eur 1,966 should be paid to the applicant by the ministry of energy, since the latter had been designated by the government to finance the debts of the coal mine, in so far as the salary arrears and related social payments prior to the decision to wind up the company were concerned. the court specified that the awarded sums should be transferred by a local branch of the state treasury to the coal mine, with view of their subsequent transfer to the applicant. the payment was to be made via a state-owned enterprise “sotsugol” («гп «соцуголь»). the judgment became final on 23 september 2004, as upheld by the supreme court of the komi republic. on 21 january 2004 the town court by a separate decision obliged the coal mine to index-link the unpaid court awards and to pay the applicant eur 527. the decision acquired legal force on 23 september 2004. on 7 december 2004 the town court ordered to index-link the awards of 21 january 2004 and held that the ministry of energy should pay the applicant eur 155 and the coal mine eur 41 respectively. the judgment entered into force on 20 december 2004. it appears that the judgments of 21 january 2004 and 7 december 2004 and the decision of 21 january 2004 have not been enforced to date. at some point the applicant claimed modification of the judgment of 21 january 2004, so that the respondent ministry be replaced in the enforcement proceedings by the ministry of industry and energy of the russian federation. on 30 november 2005 his application was rejected by the town court as having no grounds in the domestic law. it appears that the decision was not appealed against. on 28 december 2005 the liquidation commission of the ministry of energy informed the applicant that the ministry had been liquidated and had no longer been in receipt of the funds from the federal budget and that the execution documents in respect of the ministry’s debts could no longer be accepted by the commission. the applicant further claimed that the respondent ministry be replaced by “sotsugol”. on 8 june 2006 the supreme court of the komi republic in the final instance rejected his request.
the application concerns the murder on 15 january 2005 of elmas, zerrin and eylül güzelyurtlu, all cypriot nationals of turkish cypriot origin. the car was taken away for further inspection. on the same day the victims’ bodies were taken to the mortuary at larnaca general hospital for a post-mortem examination. according to the witness statements taken by the police, at the time the murders were committed a bmw car without number plates was seen parked behind the victims’ car. the other two suspects were linked to the murder through other evidence. on the same day the larnaca district court issued european arrest warrants in respect of all five suspects. as can be seen from an email dated 7 march 2005 from the director of the diplomatic office of the president of the republic to the chief european union negotiator for cyprus, the cypriot authorities around this time forwarded to unficyp an interim report by the laboratory of forensic genetics of the cyprus institute of neurology and genetics in order to facilitate its mediation of the handing over of the suspects in the instant case. the latter agreed with the larnaca police investigation department’s proposal and on 24 april 2008 instructed the police to re-submit (εναποβληθεί) the investigation file if and when the arrest of all or any of the suspects was effected. on 6 august 2008 the attorney-general gave instructions for the preparation of extradition requests to turkey under the european convention on extradition of 13 december 1957, to which both states were parties (see paragraphs 164 and 165 below). and to inform them whether he was in turkey or not. an additional statement was taken on 11 february 2005 from the fifth suspect. he denied any involvement in the murders. according to this report, the last action undertaken as part of the investigation appears to have occurred on 22 march 2007, when the fifth suspect’s car, which had been inspected by the “trnc” police, had been handed over to the “trnc” nicosia customs and tax office (lefkoşa gümrük ve rüsumat dairesi). the inspection had not resulted in the collection of any evidence concerning the crime. in its judgment the kyrenia assize court noted that it had to examine the voluntary statements made before it more carefully in the light of the fact that the first suspect had retracted the statements and submitted different statements. the first applicant identified one of the suspects. in march 2007 the cypriot police informed the first applicant that the car and the material removed from the victims’ home and office could be returned. on 15 july 2007 there was an attempt to kill the first applicant at his home in the “trnc”. during that month the applicants were also informed by the cypriot police that the arrest warrant in respect of one of the suspects had been cancelled. three of the applicants had attended with their counsel and a local lawyer. the spa stated that she had had, on the same day, a long meeting concerning the murders with the “trnc” chief of police in the presence of other officers and the “trnc” attorney-general. (e)  police note dated 25 january 2005 131. (g)  note by the cypriot police to the chief of police dated 18 may 2006 133. this note stated that as concerned a meeting held on 17 may 2006 between the spa, the dspa, and members of the cypriot police and investigation team, the dspa had raised his concerns as to an increased level of collaboration between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot criminals and their movements across the island. as a first step the report concerning the dna analysis is needed to get the court order to have the suspects in custody during the lawsuit. (f)  from the minutes of a meeting on 18 february 2005 144. in a letter to the applicants’ representatives dated 23 february 2006 the spa, stated, inter alia, the following:
“1. in an e-mail sent by the dspa to the applicants’ representative, ms meleagrou on 25 october 2006, the following, inter alia, was stated:
“i note your request and assure you of the un’s utmost cooperation in dealing with any matter of a criminal nature, particularly ... in this most serious case. therefore unficyp stands ready to facilitate [in any way] it can in this case, i can see no resolution being [arrived at] until such time as one side or the other cedes their current position. they also agreed to meet again in three months to review the work of the working groups and the technical committees and, using their results, to start full-fledged negotiations under united nations auspices.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in split. he is the owner of a flat in split with a surface area of 106.90 square metres. according to the applicant, that flat is the only real estate in his ownership and his only property of value. it would appear that in 1971 the housing authorities awarded a specially protected tenancy (stanarsko pravo) of the flat to a certain ms n.r. on 5 november 1996 the lease of flats act entered into force. it abolished the legal concept of the specially protected tenancy and provided that the holders of such tenancies in respect of, inter alia, privately owned flats were to become “protected lessees” (zaštićeni najmoprimci). under the act such lessees are subject to a number of protective measures, such as the duty of landlords to contract a lease of indefinite duration, payment of protected rent (zaštićena najamnina), the amount of which is set by the government and significantly lower than the market rent; and better protection against termination of the lease. the applicant refused to conclude a lease contract with n.r. therefore, on 16 october 1997 she brought a civil action against him in the split municipal court (općinski sud u splitu) with a view to obtaining a judgment in lieu of such a contract. at the hearing held on 4 november 1998 the applicant argued that n.r. was not entitled to protected rent because she owned a house in the tourist village of rogoznica, some 53 kilometres from split. at the hearing held on 15 april 2002 the applicant submitted a counter-claim seeking to obtain a judgment ordering n.r. and her family to vacate the flat in question. he argued that he intended to move into the flat. by a judgment of 27 february 2008 the municipal court found in favour of n.r. and imposed on the applicant a lease contract stipulating protected rent in the amount of 163.56 croatian kunas (hrk)[1] per month. on 21 october 2008 the split county court (županijski sud u splitu) dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the first-instance judgment. the municipal and the county court established that n.r. was living in the flat with her son m.r., her daughter-in-law and her grandson whereas the applicant was living with his mother in a flat located in the same building. his mother also owned an adjacent building where he was running his medical practice in one of the flats. indeed owned a small summer home in rogoznica surfacing 18 square metres only. against this factual background the municipal and the county court held that the conditions provided in section 40(1) of the lease of flats act, as interpreted by the supreme court (see statileo v. croatia, no. 12027/10, §§ 48-49, 10 july 2014), had not been met and that the applicant was therefore not entitled to refuse to enter into a lease contract with n.r. in particular, even though the applicant intended to move into the flat and had no other accommodation, he was neither entitled to permanent social assistance or was over sixty years of age, nor was n.r. ’s summer home in rogoznica located in the same municipality or township. those courts also held that, apart from being protected from eviction, n.r. was also entitled to protected rent; the applicant thus having no right to charge her the market rent for living in his flat. ’s summer home did not constitute a habitable house within the meaning of section 31(2) of the lease of flats act (see statileo, cited above, § 41). by a decision of 21 november 2012 the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint against the judgments of the municipal and the county court, and served its decision on the applicant’s representative on 7 december 2012.

the applicant was born in 1946 and lives in st petersburg. according to the applicant’s medical history he has suffered from various mental conditions since 1979 and has been admitted to hospital and treated in various psychiatric facilities several times. on each occasion there was no apparent reason for the call. the applicant behaved aggressively towards medical personnel, made sexual advances to female doctors and consumed alcohol in their presence. the service requested a police escort for further visits to his address. they stated that visits to the applicant meant there were delays in providing assistance to people who were in genuinely life-threatening situations and presented a danger to ambulance staff. according to a police report of 2 april 2007 the applicant contacted the police three times in two days alleging that nomadic tribes had attacked him, that he had found an unexploded second world war shell, and that explosives had been placed at an industrial facility. the applicant’s alerts were acted upon and found to be groundless. on 3 april 2007 the applicant was admitted without his consent to st petersburg psychiatric hospital no. the applicant refused to be treated or admitted to hospital voluntarily. on the same day a panel composed of the hospital’s resident psychiatrists examined the applicant and his medical history and diagnosed him with an organic mental disorder coupled with a psychiatric and paranoid personality disorder. admissions to hospital were, as a rule, ‘involuntary’. in the course of clinical development the organic defects have become predominant manifesting themselves through circumstantiality, a coarsening of emotions, and the exacerbation of his querulous tendencies. the current admission is due to inappropriate behaviour: informed the police that explosives had been planted somewhere, conflicts with [nomadic tribes], called for emergency medical services and when they arrived threatened the personnel, behaved improperly towards women. during examination – fully aware of his surroundings, answers questions in detail. ‘ believes that he is being persecuted by police because he is ‘a person of the stalinist era, and they do not want to work’, shows an uncritical attitude towards [his] own behaviour, does not correct ideas of own relevance and persecution. having regard to the lack of a critical attitude towards his improper behaviour, the presence of ideas about his own relevance and persecution, [it] can be concluded that he falls under section 29 (a) and (c) of the law of the russian federation on psychiatric assistance and guarantees of citizens’ rights related to its administration of 1992 (“the psychiatric assistance act 1992”).” on 4 april 2007 the hospital applied for a court order for the involuntary placement of the applicant in a hospital under section 29 (a) and (c) of the psychiatric assistance act 1992 as the applicant was a danger to himself and others and risked significant damage to his health from a likely deterioration or aggravation of his condition if there was no psychiatric treatment. on 9 april 2007 the primorskiy district court of st petersburg (приморский районный суд г. санкт-петербурга) granted the application to admit the applicant to hospital without his consent. the hearing was attended by the applicant, a court-appointed lawyer, mrs l., the psychiatrists, and the prosecutor. the trial record indicates that during the hearing the applicant claimed that informing the police about the alleged presence of explosives at a factory was his civic duty, complained about hospital regime and facilities and referred to his friendship with certain media personas in russia. did not consent to his admission to hospital since he refused treatment. having considered the evidence in the case, having heard the opinion of the doctors, of the lawyer, mrs l., who considered inpatient treatment to be reasonable, and the opinion of the prosecutor ... the court concludes that the application of the hospital’s chief physician is well-founded because mr v.k. suffers from a severe disorder which indicates a risk of significant damage to [his] health due to a deterioration or aggravation of his psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric help.” on 20 april 2007 the applicant was formally discharged from hospital after an improvement in his mental health. on the same day the applicant left hospital. on 2 august 2007 the applicant’s appeal was summarily dismissed in a short decision by the st petersburg city court (санкт-петербургский городской суд). the arguments in the statement of appeal that legal aid lawyer mrs l. did not duly discharge her professional functions may not serve as a ground for annulment of the order, which is lawful on the merits ... ” 18. nothing in the materials available to the court suggests that the applicant had ever been restricted in his legal capacity or appointed a legal guardian.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in nairobi, kenya. the applicant left kenya on 29 march 2005. he was detained in wing 1b of nicosia central prisons. he was presented with the above orders but refused to sign them. by a letter dated 11 june 2006 the applicant made a complaint to the commissioner for administration of the republic of cyprus (“the ombudsman”) concerning, inter alia, the deportation and detention orders. he was placed in a room at the airport and the door was closed. they wrapped bandages around his head and neck, almost entirely covering those parts. they warned him not to cause any more trouble. he stated that the captain and crew had witnessed everything. on 4 february 2008 the ombudsman informed the applicant that she would investigate his complaints and inform him of the outcome. the applicant started shouting and asked to call his lawyer, which the officers allowed him to do before leaving the detention facilities. stated that the officers had behaved impeccably and with patience, despite the fact that the applicant had been provocative throughout. certain members of the irs, including n.s., later the same day the applicant gave a second written statement to the investigator, providing further details of his alleged ill-treatment during the deportation process. on 21 june 2010 the investigator was informed by an officer working at the warehouse and storeroom at police headquarters that the irs had introduced blue uniforms on 31 may 2007. this was verified by another officer who kept the warehouse and storeroom records. stated that he had also noticed that he had tried to hit himself against the chairs and walls in the room. the officers had asked him to calm down but to no avail. for that reason, with the help of members of the irs who had restrained the applicant, they had wrapped the applicant’s head in bandages to protect him from possible self-harm. the lawyer stated that on 9 march 2007 he had spoken to the applicant by telephone while the applicant was still at nicosia central prisons. the applicant had informed him that he was being deported. informed the investigator on that date that he refused to answer any questions and referred the investigator to his lawyer. on 22 july 2010 the investigator prepared a report on the investigation procedure and his findings. the report stated that the various police records (records of action and log or duty books) were deficient and had failed to keep track of ongoing events (such as the applicant’s being moved from block 10 to another area on the night of his deportation and the officers’ actions during the deportation). he observed that that had clearly aimed at hiding the truth (προφανώς για σκοπούς συσκότισης). the investigator considered that it was questionable whether the medical certificate provided by the applicant could be accepted as evidence in any procedure given that it did not mention the name of the doctor or doctors who had examined him. at the same time, omissions by the officers involved have been identified; they are not, however, of such a nature as to justify disciplinary action. relying on a letter issued by the prison director in june 2009 the government made submissions about the conditions of the applicant’s detention as follows. - open area for exercise: there is an open area and it is considered sufficient
- chair and table in each cell: tables and chairs have been placed inside the cells. in her reply of 5 december 2006 the ombudsman informed him that she would be conducting an investigation into the conditions of detention of foreigners in general in order to make suggestions for improving the situation.
at the material time the applicant union, founded in 1955 with its registered office in istanbul, represented workers in the food-processing sector. on 20 february 2004, arguing that the number of its members at the three factories had attained the minimum level set in the trade union act (law no. 2821; ...), the applicant union applied to the ministry of labour and social security (“the ministry”) for certification of its representative status (yetki belgesi) so that it could enter into collective labour agreements with tukaş on behalf of its members. in a decision of 26 may 2004 the ministry granted the application and confirmed the applicant union’s representative status. on the basis of a report drawn up by labour inspectors on the nature of tukaş’s activities and its labour force, the ministry found that, in view of the number of employees belonging to the applicant union and the total number of staff at the three factories, which operated in the food-processing sector, the conditions laid down in the trade union act (law no. 2821) for engaging in collective bargaining were satisfied. it also stated that the staff at tukaş’s head office belonged to the “business, computing, education and arts” sector. on 31 may 2004 tukaş applied to the i̇zmir 3rd labour court for judicial review of the ministry’s decision of 26 may 2004, submitting that the applicant union did not satisfy the requirements for engaging in collective bargaining. on 13 november 2004 the expert submitted his report to the court. the applicant union challenged the expert report before the labour court. it argued that, pursuant to section 60(17) of the trade union act (law no. 2821), employees at the tukaş head office belonged to a different occupational sector, namely the “business, computing, education and arts” sector, and consequently could not form part of its membership. that being so, it contended that the expert report should not have included staff at the head office in its calculations. in a judgment of 2 december 2004 the i̇zmir 3rd labour court found in favour of the company and withdrew the applicant union’s representative status. it based its decision on the arguments set out in the first approach referred to in the expert report of 13 november 2004. accordingly, it held that the applicant union’s members accounted for only 152 of the 443 tukaş employees, a figure that was too low for the applicant union to qualify as representative in the light of the requirement for “the majority of a company’s employees” to be members. on 21 december 2004 the applicant union appealed on points of law and reiterated the observations it had made before the labour court. in a judgment of 22 march 2005 the court of cassation dismissed the applicant union’s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment. the judgment was finalised on 15 april 2005. meanwhile, at the start of 2004 tukaş had invited employees who were members of the applicant union to cancel their membership on pain of dismissal. some had complied but forty employees had refused. shortly afterwards, tukaş had dismissed the forty employees in question on economic grounds (market fluctuations) or for professional shortcomings (underperformance). in march 2004 the employees dismissed by tukaş applied to the i̇zmir labour courts, claiming wrongful dismissal and seeking their reinstatement in the company. in judgments delivered between july and december 2004, different i̇zmir labour courts (nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) found in favour of the dismissed employees, holding that they had been dismissed on the grounds of their membership of a trade union. they observed that tukaş had failed to persuade them that there had been any economic or performance-related reasons to justify the dismissals, which had therefore been wrongful. they ordered tukaş to reinstate the dismissed employees, or failing that, to pay each of them compensation for wrongful dismissal equivalent to one year’s wages. in judgments delivered between december 2004 and june 2005 the court of cassation upheld the judgments of the i̇zmir labour courts. tukaş did not reinstate any of the employees it had dismissed and paid them compensation as ordered by the labour courts. by 2005 the applicant union no longer had any members among the staff of tukaş.
the applicant was born in 1941 and lives in belgrade. on 27 june 2001 the obrenovac municipal court ordered a socially-owned company, holding - prva iskra ad barič (hereinafter “the debtor”), to pay the applicant specified amounts on account of compensation for expropriated real estate plus the costs of the civil proceedings. on 18 march 2003, upon the applicant’s request to that effect, the obrenovac municipal court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor to pay the applicant the enforcement costs. on 23 april 2003 the privatisation agency ordered the restructuring of the applicant’s debtor. as a consequence, the ongoing enforcement proceedings against the debtor would appear to have been stayed. on 29 february 2016 the belgrade commercial court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor. the applicant duly reported her claims based on the above-mentioned judgment to the insolvency administration. the insolvency proceedings are still ongoing and the said court judgment remains unenforced to the present day. according to publically available information the debtor is still, predominantly comprised of socially-owned capital (see http://pretraga2.apr.‌gov.rs/objedinjenepretrage/search/search, accessed on 7 february 2017). on 7 october 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal with the constitutional court. in terms of redress, relying on the constitutional court act 2007, the applicant sought, inter alia, compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage suffered due to the impugned non-enforcement. on 15 may 2012 the applicant noted the adoption of the amendments to the constitutional court act, and specified her compensation claims accordingly. specifically, on account of the pecuniary damage, the applicant requested the respective amounts awarded to her by the final judgment in question, whilst as regards the non‑pecuniary damage sustained she claimed 1,000,000 serbian dinars (approximately 9,500 euros (eur)). on 21 may 2014 the constitutional court found, in the operative part of its ruling (u izreci), that the applicant had indeed suffered a violation of her right to a fair trial within a reasonable time, as well as a violation of her property rights and awarded her eur 1,000 in respect of the non-pecuniary damage in question. however, it rejected the compensation claim regarding the pecuniary damages sought by the applicant. the constitutional court, lastly, ordered the speeding up of the impugned enforcement proceedings. in its reasoning, the constitutional court stated in respect of the compensation issue that the applicant’s pecuniary damage claim had been lodged out of time. in so doing, it merely referred to article 85 § 3 of the constitutional court act, as amended in 2011, requiring that such claims be brought simultaneously with the lodging of a constitutional appeal.
the applicant was born in 1949 and is currently serving a prison sentence in lepoglava. a businessman from russia, approached the state attorney’s office for the suppression of corruption and organised crime (ured za suzbijanje korupcije i organiziranog kriminaliteta – hereinafter: “the state attorney’s office”) alleging that he had been trying to make various business investments in croatia and that he had been introduced to a certain a.p., to deposit 2,250,000 euros (eur) in various bank accounts. she also stated that everybody should make out well in this business undertaking. and that he had already had a number of contacts with various officials concerning m.m. in this connection, the day before he had also contacted the applicant, in his capacity as vice-president of the fund, who had allegedly requested a provision of 5% of the total investment value, which was approximately between eur 23,000,000 and 25,000,000, to help with the realisation of the project. as an informant, and conducting a simulated purchase operation. various meetings between the applicant and j.k. in its request for investigation the state attorney’s office relied on the results of the special investigative measures suggesting that the applicant, in his capacity as vice-president of the fund, had requested bribes in order to support m.m. returned ninety-eight secret surveillance cd recordings in the case at issue that did not contain the communications of the suspects in respect of whom the investigation had been opened. in particular, the state attorney’s office indicated the particular sequence of the relevant recordings which it intended to submit as evidence at the trial. on 30 april 2008 a three-judge panel of the zagreb county court returned the indictment to the state attorney’s office on the grounds that one count of the indictment, concerning the applicant’s alleged participation in the bribery of the president of the fund, had been confusing. and several other individuals, and the sequences of the telephone conversations and text messages concerned. the defence lawyer of one of the co-accused contended that the defence had not been provided with the surveillance recordings and that those measures had been ordered contrary to the requirements of the relevant domestic law. who explained that he had represented russian investors in croatia regarding their interest in the construction of luxury villas on the site of a former brick factory in the zadar region. produced further transcripts of the secret surveillance recordings related to the zagreb county court’s order of 2 december 2008 (see paragraph 39 above). the expert report was served on the defence at a hearing on 10 december 2008. they argued that according to the available information there were in total 515 cd and 160 dvd recordings which had never been provided to the defence. on 12 december 2008 the defence counsel sent a letter to the zagreb county court asking for access to and the possibility to examine the secret surveillance recordings. on 22 december 2008 the president of the trial panel commissioned another expert report from m.đ. concerning several other secret surveillance recordings. and to take further evidence concerning his activities in the fund. further hearings were held on 17, 23-26 and 30 march 2009 at which the trial bench heard evidence from several witnesses. further hearings were held between 8 and 12 may 2009 at which the trial bench heard the parties’ closing arguments. this panel also considers that the recordings at issue were made solely for their examination at the trial and had they been provided to the parties, the court would not have had any legal basis at its disposal to prevent and prohibit the parties from reproducing [them] outside of the court[-house] before their examination at trial, and [the court would not have had any legal means] to prevent possible misuse of the recorded material. because on an investment of twenty-two million euros to give one hundred thousand ... for him that would not be even 2% ... i would be overly modest if that would be so, you understand [sic].” he also complained that the relevant evidence had not been disclosed to the defence, and that the first-instance court had erred in the legal qualification of his position as falling under the term “public official” under article 89 § 3 of the criminal code. it is true that the [oscoc act] is lex specialis, but the appellants failed to observe that section 41(1) of that act provides that the investigating judge may order, ‘save for the measures under article 180 of the code of criminal procedure’, two additional measures which are not provided under the code of criminal procedure, namely the use of simulated business services and simulated business contracts. the only evidence on which a conviction can be based is the recordings, in respect of which no objections were made. on 1 june 2012 the applicant, represented by i.f.,

it was also reported that at the beginning of may the american magazine time published a list of thirty-six individuals dubbed the european heroes, among which was nataša kandić, too. nataša kandić provokes stormy reactions wherever she appears. most of all they blame her for never pursuing the crimes against serbs but exclusively dealing with those committed by serbs against other ethnicities. i don’t think that they hate me, only my message’. nevertheless, she once made a public complaint: ‘even my son has accused me of protecting everybody except the serbs.’ although later, she adds, she heard him defending her concern for the weak. nataša kandić was born in 1946 in topola, to her father radoslav and mother vera. in 1966 she went to study in great britain and upon her return she enrolled in the faculty of philosophy at the university of belgrade. she participated in the 1968 student demonstrations. in the 1970s she started working in the belgrade municipality of palilula. with a group of like-minded people she founded the humanitarian law centre at the beginning of 1993. a year later, on the invitation of ms jeri laber, the helsinki watch executive director, she left for new york. upon discussion with top people at the hague tribunal[8], the humanitarian law centre took charge of its work in respect of the so‑called serbian crimes against muslims in bosnia and herzegovina, as well as violations and abuses of muslim and croatian minority rights in the fry. that is how this organisation became the [icty] ‘investigator’. starting from the second half of the 1990s the centre became involved in the kosovo and metohija issues. on 10 november 2003 ms kandić started a private prosecution against the applicant. she explicitly refused to lodge any civil compensation claim within these proceedings. the applicant, in her defence, stated that she was not expressing her own opinion of ms kandić, whom she did not intend to insult, and that she had written the entire article on the basis of the documentation of other magazines. on 1 september 2005, after a remittal, the first municipal court (prvi opštinski sud) in belgrade found that the applicant had committed a criminal offence of insult when having stated for ms kandić “although she has been called a witch and a prostitute” and gave her a judicial warning. the court established that the impugned phrase had been indeed previously published in another article by another author in a different magazine. however, the applicant did not put it in quotation marks which meant that she agreed with it, thus expressing her opinion. no prison sentence or fines were imposed. on an unspecified date thereafter the applicant appealed. the fact that she wrote also on the negative attitudes towards the private prosecutor and her work could not and must not make her, the applicant, criminally liable. she also submitted that such an attitude towards the freedom of press could have long-reaching consequences. in separate proceedings, on 2 october 2006 the belgrade first municipal court ordered the applicant to pay ms kandić rsd 33,125 (around 386 euros (eur)) in respect of costs and expenses. the applicant did not appeal against that decision.
the applicant was a member of a hunting association, v., based in čaglin (hereafter “the association”). on 17 june 2012 the association’s executive board initiated internal proceedings against the applicant before its disciplinary commission. the executive board sought the applicant’s suspension until the next session of the association’s general meeting (skupština) for reporting a member of the association to the police, falsely accusing him of the criminal offence of intimidation. the executive board argued that by doing so the applicant had committed a serious breach of his duties as a member, a disciplinary offence stipulated in the association’s internal regulations. by a decision of 25 august 2012 the disciplinary commission dismissed the disciplinary action against the applicant. no appeals were lodged against that decision. the executive board nevertheless referred the matter to the general meeting for re-examination, convening an extraordinary session. on 2 september 2012 the general meeting adopted, by twenty votes to seven, a resolution expelling the applicant from the association. he was informed that he could appeal against that decision and that any appeal would be examined at the general meeting’s (regular) annual session. the applicant appealed, but the general meeting’s resolution was upheld by twenty-one votes to three following the adoption of another resolution at the annual session held on 20 february 2013. the general meeting did not give any reasons for expelling the applicant in either of its resolutions. in particular, he submitted that, in the absence of appeals against the disciplinary commission’s decision of 25 august 2012 (see paragraph 8 above), the general meeting could not have overridden that decision because under the association’s statute that commission was the only body authorised to decide on the expulsion of a member. by a decision of 4 march 2014 the county court declared the applicant’s action inadmissible, on the grounds that the matter was outside the jurisdiction of the courts. the relevant part of that decision reads as follows:
“section 26(1) of the associations act suggests that legal protection by way of civil action in the county court could be sought only if the general meeting or the other relevant body of the association had failed to examine a member’s report regarding irregularities in the implementation of the statute [of the association], or had failed to correct such irregularities. such a civil action would therefore be aimed at securing the implementation of the statute of the association, and thus would not provide for legal protection in the sense that a specific decision ... of the association could be declared unlawful. under section 50 of the defendant association’s statute [statut] the disciplinary tribunal imposes disciplinary measures against members who have breached their duties stipulated in the statute. according to section 7(2) of the defendant association’s rules on disciplinary proceedings and disciplinary liability of members, a request for review may be lodged with the general meeting [to contest] the disciplinary tribunal’s decision to expel [a member]. the time-limit for the general meeting to adopt a resolution on the request is not stipulated. the general meeting’s resolution is final. ... since the plaintiff in his action does not seek [legal] protection envisaged in section 26(1) of the associations act, but asks [the court] to declare unlawful the defendant’s resolution to expel him, on which [issue] it is for the general meeting to make a final decision ... this case does not fall within the jurisdiction of the courts ...” 15. the applicant then appealed against that decision to the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske). the said provision ... governs jurisdiction of the courts regarding the right of the members of an association to supervise its conduct. in this connection it should be taken into account that the case concerns membership of a ... voluntary organisation [where] members may under the internal rules regulate the protection of [their] membership rights. therefore, the decision to expel a member does not fall within the jurisdiction of the courts under section 26(1) of the associations act. that is also the opinion of the constitutional court, as expressed in the case u-iii-140/2006. it follows that the county court was correct in deciding that courts have no jurisdiction to decide on the plaintiff’s action ...” 17. on 12 june 2014 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the supreme court’s decision. he alleged violations of his right to a fair procedure guaranteed by article 29 paragraph 1 of the croatian constitution (see paragraph 19 below), and also explicitly relied on article 6 § 1 of the convention. by a decision of 18 december 2014 the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible and served its decision on his representative on 30 january 2015. it found that the case did not raise any constitutional issues.
the applicant, who was born in 1989, was detained at the tekirdağ prison when the application was lodged. on 9 july 2010 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of a terrorist organisation. on 13 july 2010 the investigating judge at the istanbul assize court, after questioning the applicant, ordered his pre-trial detention having regard to the nature of the offence, the state of the evidence and the strong suspicion of the suspect’s having committed the offence in issue. on 7 september 2010 the istanbul public prosecutor filed an indictment with the istanbul assize court, charging the applicant with membership of an illegal terrorist organisation. the trial commenced before the 9th chamber of the istanbul assize court and the first hearing was held on 15 february 2011. in the hearings held on 21 february 2012 and 3 may 2012, respectively, the applicant appeared before the court, and the judges ordered his continued detention. the applicant filed objections against these decisions. on 7 march 2012 and 8 june 2012 respectively, the 10th chamber of istanbul assize court dismissed the applicant’s objections without holding an oral hearing and based on the public prosecutor’s opinion which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative. during the eleventh hearing held on 30 july 2013, the 9th chamber of the istanbul assize court ordered the applicant’s continued detention on remand.
the applicants’ dates of birth and places of residence are given in the appendix. on 12 january, 26 january, 10 march and 29 december 2013 demonstrations were planned to be held in baku. it appears that the organisers of the demonstrations gave no proper prior notice to the relevant authority, the baku city executive authority (“the bcea”). information about the demonstrations was disseminated through facebook or the press. according to the applicants, the demonstrations were intended to be peaceful and were conducted in a peaceful manner. the demonstrations of 12 january and 10 march 2013 were aimed at protesting about the deaths of soldiers in the army. all the applicants were arrested during the dispersal operations and were taken to various police stations. the applicants were questioned at the police stations they were taken to. according to most of the applicants, they were never served with copies of the administrative offence reports or with other documents from their case files. they were not given access to a lawyer after their arrest or while they were in police custody. 20589/13 and 33164/13 at the police stations on the day of their arrest (12 january and 10 march 2013 respectively), they refused the services of a lawyer. 20589/13 and 26424/14 were released after being kept in police custody for a few hours, subject to an undertaking to reappear at the police station on various dates. most of the applicants were taken to trial courts directly from the police stations, either on the day of their arrest or the following day. 20589/13 and 26424/14 were brought before first-instance courts on the day they returned to the police station. according to most of the applicants, the court hearing in each case was very brief. according to most of the applicants, they were not given an opportunity to appoint lawyers of their own choosing. state-funded lawyers were asked to assist some of them. 21219/13, 33164/13, 33593/13 and 26994/14 were not represented by a lawyer. 21219/13, 33164/13 and 26994/14 refused the assistance of a state-funded lawyer and decided to defend themselves in person. 20589/13, the state-funded lawyer stated briefly in his oral submissions that the applicant was guilty and asked the court for lenience. similarly, the state-funded lawyer for the applicant in application no. in addition, none of the material submitted to the court contains any record of showing that the state-funded lawyer, mr v.m., the only witnesses questioned during the court hearings with respect to the applicants in applications nos. 20589/13 and 26424/14 were the police officers who, according to the official records, had arrested them. the police officers testified that the applicants had staged unauthorised demonstrations. no witnesses were questioned by the courts in the other applicants’ cases. the first-instance courts found that the applicants had participated in unauthorised demonstrations. they asked the baku court of appeal to quash the first-instance courts’ decisions in their cases. the other applicants were not represented by a lawyer. on various dates the baku court of appeal dismissed the applicants’ appeals and upheld the decisions of the first-instance courts (see appendix).
the first and second applicants were born in 1981 and 2002 respectively, and live in sofia. the decision was upheld in ordinary appeal on 14 june 2007 and in cassation appeal on 1 october 2008. she brought enforcement proceedings later the same month. did not come to any of those appointments or cooperate with the bailiff. the first applicant obtained a writ of enforcement in october 2008 in respect of the final judgment on the divorce and on granting custody to her. on 11 december 2008, 5 march 2009, 2 september 2009 and 22 december 2009 the bailiff unsuccessfully attempted to hand the child over to the first applicant. it would appear that those meetings had been scheduled by the bailiff without prior consultation with the applicant as to her availability. in july 2005 while she was living with the child’s father, kh.p. did not return the latter to the third applicant’s home. the third applicant submitted that thereafter she had repeatedly attempted to reach an agreement with the child’s father on the child’s return to live with her, as well as that she had contacted two private bailiffs over the following months but neither of them had taken any action because they considered that the case was too difficult. in two reports issued on 25 january 2013 and 1 february 2013 the social services found that, while the child had developed a solid emotional connection with the father, he had not lost his bond to his mother. the father was categorically opposed to contact between the child and the mother, which meant the child was afraid to express his need and wish to maintain a relationship with her. ’s lack of cooperation, in not taking the child to the appointments. the bailiff postponed any further enforcement measures. on 3 september 2014 she asked the bailiff to order weekly meetings between her and the child on the premises of the social services, emphasising that that was something to which kh.p. had agreed but with which he had not complied. they also informed the third applicant that the bailiff had ordered the child to report to the social centre every thursday at 4 p.m. in order to meet with the third applicant. the third applicant subsequently received a letter from the state agency for child protection, which directed her to seek counselling from the social services. on 28 november 2014 the third applicant wrote to the bailiff, copying in the social services, and expressed her concern about the child’s well-being. had been obliged to comply with that decision. according to him, the bailiff informed him that as the meetings with the child were scheduled to take place at the weekend, when the bailiff was off work, the fourth applicant would be better being accompanied to the meetings by witnesses. notwithstanding those efforts, the fourth applicant submitted that he was still unable to see the child owing to the obstacles created by the mother. on appeal, the higher prosecutor returned the case for further examination. additional facts submitted by the government after communication
(a)  divorce and contact rights granted to the fourth applicant 67. the fourth applicant applied for a divorce on 15 june 2011. the fourth applicant submitted during those proceedings that he had had a hernia operation in july 2012 and had been put on sick leave until 31 march 2013. on 10 january 2014 the first-instance court granted r.d. (b)  enforcement of the fourth applicant’s contact rights 73. had not been preventing contact between the child and the applicant, but that the fourth applicant himself had not been seeking contact with his child. the stara zagora regional court quashed the fine on 20 june 2014 in a final decision, finding that r.d.
the applicants were born in 1974 and 1994 respectively and live in baku. at the material time the first applicant was a member of one of the main opposition parties in the country, the popular front party of azerbaijan, and the second applicant was a member of an opposition group, nida. the applicants participated in an assembly on 6 may 2014. the courtroom was full, and therefore some people gathered outside the court to wait for the outcome of the proceedings. when the court announced its judgment, those who had gathered outside began to protest against the judgment, since they considered it unfair. the protest was brief, spontaneous and peaceful. immediately after the protesters started chanting slogans, police officers and people in plain clothes began to forcibly disperse the demonstration. the applicants were arrested during the dispersal operation and were taken to a police station, where they were kept overnight. the applicants were questioned at the police station. on the day of the applicants’ arrest, administrative-offence reports on them (inzibati xəta haqqında protokol) were issued, which stated that they had committed an administrative offence under article 298.2 of the code of administrative offences (“the cao”): participation in a public assembly organised not in accordance with the law. according to the applicants, they were never served with copies of the administrative-offence reports or other documents from their case files. they were not given access to a lawyer either after their arrest or while they were in police custody. according to a police officer’s decision and an order dated 6 may 2014, a state-funded lawyer (mr o.a.) was invited to defend the first applicant. the applicants were brought before the nasimi district court on the day following their arrest. according to the applicants, the hearing before the first-instance court was very brief in both cases. members of the public were not allowed inside the courtroom, even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public. according to the applicants, they were not given an opportunity to appoint lawyers of their own choosing. a state-funded lawyer was invited to defend the first applicant. who had been invited to defend her in accordance with the above-mentioned police officer’s decision of 6 may 2014. the second applicant was not represented by a lawyer. according to the transcript of the hearing in his case, he refused the assistance of the state-funded lawyer and decided to defend himself in person. according to the transcript of the hearing concerning the first applicant, the state-funded lawyer did not make any oral or written submissions. they testified that the applicant had staged an unauthorised protest. with respect to the second applicant, the court did not question any witness. the court convicted the applicants under article 298.2 of the cao, and sentenced them to a period of administrative detention of thirty and twenty days respectively. the applicants also complained that their arrests had been unlawful, and that the hearings before the first-instance court had not been fair. they asked the baku court of appeal to quash the first‑instance court’s decisions in their respective cases. the first applicant was assisted by a lawyer of her own choosing before the baku court of appeal. on 16 and 22 may 2014 respectively the baku court of appeal dismissed the applicants’ appeals and upheld the decisions of the first‑instance court.
the applicant was born in 1936 and lives in skopje. he was a high-ranking official during the communist era. at the time of the events, he neither held a public office nor was a candidate for such an office. referring to a report registered as file no. the file further noted that in 1964 the applicant had shared his impressions about his stay in sweden with his father. on the basis of documents in another file, file no. the decision was served on the applicant on 4 june 2013. 6825 had been wrong since the file had obviously been about another person with the same name and not him. the documents were his birth certificate, which showed a date of birth that was different from the one in file no. he argued that he had never visited sweden and had lived since 1955 in skopje. lastly, he complained about the fact that the decision on the commission’s website had included his father’s name, despite the fact that the lustration act made no provision for the release of such information. he argued that his reputation, dignity, personal information and integrity had been compromised. the court held that the commission had correctly established the facts and applied the relevant law. as to his arguments that the commission had erred in finding “conscious, secret, organised and continuous collaboration” with state security bodies, the court held:
“[the applicant] was entitled to obtain access to the documents attesting to his collaboration. he complained that the lower authorities had not explained why they had considered that he had collaborated with the security bodies in an intentional, secret, organised and continuous manner, as set out in the lustration act. it found no grounds to depart from the facts as they had been established and the reasons given by the commission and the administrative court. it was composed of a president, a deputy president and nine other members, elected by parliament by a qualified two-thirds majority for a five-year term (section 6(1)). section 10 regulated the functioning of the commission. the commission was to deliberate in session in the presence of two-thirds of its members and decisions had to be taken by a majority of its members. the person was to have acted as a secret collaborator or secret informant, collecting information regarding an individual, in violation of their human rights, in return for material benefit or favours during employment or in getting promotion. that had to be done immediately and in any case no later than three days after completion of the procedure. it also had to submit the decision to parliament, the government and the state electoral commission. the commission’s decision was to be published on its website. the documents used as evidence to confirm collaboration with the state security services were also to be published. all ongoing lustration proceedings were to be concluded. section 4 provides that administrative disputes are decided by administrative court (at first instance) and by the higher administrative court (on appeal). section 30, as amended in 2010, no longer entitles a party to the proceedings to request that the administrative court hold an oral hearing. according to the amended text, the court, as a rule, decides at a hearing held in private. in such cases the facts are determined at a hearing in the presence of the parties. article 33 § 1 (3) of the criminal code provides that a convicted person can be prohibited from exercising a profession, activity or duty.
the applicant was born in 1937 and lives in sofia. the applicant’s husband owned part of a house and a yard in sofia. by a decision of the mayor of 15 october 1981 the property was expropriated with a view to constructing a metro station. the decision, based on section 98(1) of the territorial and urban planning act of 1973, provided that the applicant’s husband was to be compensated with a three‑room flat in a building which the municipality planned to construct. in 1989 the applicant and her husband were moved out of the expropriated property and settled in a two-room municipally-owned flat. the expropriated house was subsequently pulled down. by a supplementary decision of 1 september 1989, based on section 100 of the territorial and urban planning act, the mayor determined the exact location, size and other details in respect of the future flat offered in compensation, which was to measure 94 square metres. in 1993 the applicants’ husband passed away, after which the applicant became the owner of the future flat allocated in compensation to him. in the years that followed the applicant requested on many occasions that the authorities complete the compensation procedure and deliver the flat due to her, but to no avail. the construction of the building in which the flat was to be located did not commence. in 2001 the applicant brought a tort action, claiming wrongful failure on the part of the sofia municipality to build and provide her with the flat due to her during the period from january 1993 to september 2001. in a final judgment of 6 march 2008 the supreme court of cassation, holding that the municipality was responsible for the failure to deliver the flat within a reasonable time-limit, awarded the applicant 10,000 bulgarian levs (bgn) in non-pecuniary damage and bgn 44,320 for loss of profit. in 2009 the applicant brought a new tort action against the sofia municipality covering the period after october 2001. the action was dismissed in a final judgment of the supreme administrative court of 22 march 2013, on the ground that the applicant had had a special remedy at her disposal, namely the possibility provided for in section 9(1) of the transitional provisions of the territory planning act 2001 to claim monetary compensation for the expropriated property instead of compensation with a flat (see paragraph 16 below). in 2013 the sofia municipality informed the applicant that the construction of the building where the flat due to her was to be located was to start in the near future. according to the latest information submitted by the parties in 2014, the municipality was looking for a company to carry out the construction works.
on the date of lodging of the applications, the applicants were regarded for civil-law purposes as belonging to the male sex. the first applicant submitted three medical certificates issued by these doctors during the period in question. in the first two certificates, dated 12 april 2007, dr bo. in the third certificate, dated 16 january 2008, dr h. stated that he had been overseeing the applicant’s hormone treatment for “typical primary gender identity disorder since 1 june 2006, together with dr b.”, and that “following endocrinology and metabolic tests, including karyotyping, [he was being] treated with anti-androgens and oestrogen”. the first applicant also produced a medical certificate issued on 3 april 2008 by another psychiatrist, dr ba., the operation was carried out on 3 july 2008. she was accepted for the appropriate surgical treatment, namely gender reassignment surgery. ... the surgery consisted of an orchidectomy, a vaginoplasty, a clitoroplasty and a labiaplasty, combined in a single operation. the first applicant produced four further certificates. in the second certificate, dated 27 may 2009, a speech therapist stated that she had “worked with [a.p.] the third certificate, signed on 23 july 2009 by dr b., a psychiatrist, read as follows:
 “... [a.p.] is under supervision for typical harry benjamin syndrome, for which a gender reassignment process has been under way for several years. in the fourth certificate, dated 16 march 2010, dr p., a doctor specialising in fundamental psychopathology and psychoanalysis and a psychotherapist, stated that he had started psychotherapy sessions with the first applicant and, in particular, had “noted ... the consistency between ms [a.p.] (a)  interlocutory judgment of 17 february 2009 17. in an order of 13 march 2009 the deputy president of the paris court of appeal refused the first applicant leave to appeal against this interlocutory judgment. first of all, the court of appeal inferred from article 8 of the convention that “where, following medical and surgical treatment undergone for therapeutic purposes”, a person with a gender identity disorder no longer possessed all the characteristics of his or her original sex and had taken on a physical appearance closer to that of the opposite sex, which matched his or her social behaviour, the principle of respect for private life warranted amending the civil-status records to indicate the sex corresponding to the person’s appearance. the court of appeal further noted that the hormone treatment referred to in the certificates issued by dr h. on 16 january and 10 september 2008 dated back a long time. thirdly, he alleged a violation of article 14 of the convention taken in conjunction with article 8, taking the view that the court of appeal, in finding that he should have submitted to the expert assessment and in dismissing his appeal, had based its assessment on discriminatory grounds. he submitted that, although he had been entered in the register of births as male, he had been aware from a very young age of belonging to the female gender. owing to social pressure he had tried to hide his true nature and had married twice while living with the male identity entered on his birth certificate. he dressed as a woman and was perceived by others as a woman. the second applicant appealed on points of law against the judgment of 27 january 2011. on 13 february 2013 the court of cassation (first civil division) dismissed the appeal on points of law in the following terms:
“... in order to substantiate a request for correction of the gender markers on a birth certificate, the person concerned must demonstrate, in view of the widely accepted position within the scientific community, that he or she actually suffers from the gender identity disorder in question and that the change in his or her appearance is irreversible. once his daughter was grown up he had adapted his appearance and social conduct to match his female gender identity. while most of the documents he used in everyday life reflected his gender identity, this was not the case of his civil-status documents, passport, driving licence, vehicle registration papers or entry in the national identity register. as a result, he was constantly obliged to refer to his transgender identity, to the detriment of his private life. the third applicant refused to produce any medical documents, taking the view that he had demonstrated sufficiently that he was physically and psychologically female and was integrated socially as a woman. he simply stated that his general practitioner had prescribed hormone treatment for him which meant that he had female secondary sexual characteristics such as breasts. the person lived full-time in the desired gender role in his or her daily life and social and professional activities, and demonstrated his or her social integration in that role, chose a new forename and informed family members of the intended change. the fourth stage consisted in reassignment surgery.
the applicants were born in 1964, 1935, 1963, 1965 and 1963 respectively. the churches decide independently whether to levy a tax and what its rate should be. only members of a particular religious denomination authorised to levy the tax are obliged to pay it. according to the federal constitutional court’s settled case-law, if the spouse belonging to a church has no income in terms of the regulations of the income tax code, the church tax cannot be levied (see 56 paragraph below). in that case, in some german länder (inter alia, baden‑württemberg, bavaria and thuringia), the church entitled to levy taxes charges its members a special “church fee” (besonderes kirchgeld). although called a fee, the levy is, however, treated legally as a tax. the special church fee is only levied on the spouse who is a church member. at the same time, the special church fee levied on one spouse can be offset against any tax reimbursement due to the other spouse. if the calculation of the income tax leads to a demand to pay more tax, offsetting cannot take place. for the tax assessment period of 2008 the spouses opted for a joint tax assessment. as the spouses were jointly liable for income tax and the applicant’s wife’s income was below the minimum taxable amount, the wife’s special church fee was calculated as a proportion of her living expenses, which in turn were calculated on the basis of the spouses’ joint income (see paragraphs 12-14 above). the tax bill applied to both the first applicant and his wife. it finished with a credit for the first applicant of eur 1,203.00. zur einlegung des einspruches ist derjenige befugt, gegen den sich die kirchensteuerfestsetzung richtet.”). the first applicant filed an objection against the tax bill. the second applicant is a member of the protestant church. in 2005 he had an annual income of eur 10,144. his wife, who was not member of a church, had income of eur 162,522. in 2005, the second applicant and his wife were jointly liable for annual income tax. the second applicant lodged an action with the nuremberg tax court, asserting a violation of his basic rights. on 29 january 2010 the federal tax court dismissed an appeal by the second applicant against the decision refusing him leave to appeal and endorsed the nuremberg tax court’s reasoning. the third and fourth applicants are a married couple who live in gera in the german land of thuringia. on 29 august 2005, 5 february 2006 and 26 june 2008 the competent tax office levied church tax on the third applicant for the years 2004 to 2006. on 23 june 2008 the competent tax office dismissed an objection by the third and fourth applicants against the church tax calculation. on 28 october 2010, the federal constitutional court declined to consider the third and fourth applicants’ constitutional complaint after joining it, inter alia, with those of the second and fifth applicants (file no. the fifth applicant lives in nuremberg, situated in the german land of bavaria. the spouses opted for a joint income tax assessment for 2004 and 2005. the fifth applicant raised an objection against those decisions and applied for a suspension of enforcement. on 22 july 2009 the fifth applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the federal constitutional court, alleging, inter alia, a violation of her right to freedom of religion. she argued that she could not remain in her religious community if her husband, who was not a church member, did not agree to pay her special church fee.
the applicant was born in 1988 and lives in baku. the opposition planned to hold demonstrations on 12 and 26 january 2013 in baku. no prior notice was given to the relevant authority, the baku city executive authority (“the bcea”), by the organisers of the demonstrations. information about the demonstrations was disseminated through facebook or the press. according to the applicant, the demonstrations were intended to be peaceful and were conducted in a peaceful manner. the participants in the demonstration of 12 january 2013 were drawing the public’s attention to the deaths of soldiers in the army. the participants in the demonstration of 26 january 2013 were condemning the use of force by the police against those who had participated in previous demonstrations. the applicant attended both demonstrations, but shortly after they had begun the police started to disperse the assemblies. in both cases the applicant was arrested during the dispersal operation and was taken to a police station, where he was questioned. in both cases, on the day of applicant’s arrest an “administrative-offence report” (inzibati xəta haqqında protokol) was issued in respect of him. the reports stated that the applicant had committed an administrative offence under article 298.2 (participation in a public assembly that had not been organised in accordance with the law) of the code of administrative offences (“the cao”). according to the applicant, he was never served with copies of the administrative-offence reports or with other documents in his case files. in neither case was he given access to a lawyer after his arrest or while in police custody. a statement (ərizə) written by the applicant on 12 january 2013 at the police station and submitted to the court by the government showed that in the first case, the applicant had declared that he would defend himself in person. in the first case, after having been held for a few hours in police custody, the applicant was released, subject to an undertaking to reappear at the police station on 14 january 2013. in the first case, the applicant was brought before the nasimi district court on 14 january 2013, the day he reappeared at the police station. in the second case he was brought before the nasimi district court on 26 january 2013, the day of his arrest. according to the applicant, the hearing before the court in both cases was very brief. members of the public were not allowed to attend, even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public. according to the applicant, in both cases he was not given an opportunity to hire a lawyer of his own choice. a statement signed by the applicant on 14 january 2013 and submitted to the court by the government showed that in the first case, the applicant had declared that he did not need legal assistance and would defend himself in person. at the court hearing in the second case, a state-funded lawyer was appointed to assist the applicant. the record of the court hearing in the second case shows that in his oral submissions, the state-funded lawyer briefly stated that there had been elements of the administrative offence in the applicant’s actions, and asked the court to adopt a fair decision. in both cases, the court questioned police officers who had participated in the dispersal operations and police officers who had prepared the administrative-offence reports against the applicant. the police officers testified that the applicant had staged an unauthorised demonstration. in both cases, by decisions of 14 and 26 january 2013 respectively, the first-instance court convicted the applicant under article 298.2 of the cao. the court sentenced him to fines of 500 manats (azn) and azn 400 respectively. he also complained that his arrests had been unlawful and that the hearings before the respective first-instance courts had not been fair. in the first case, the applicant was not represented before the baku court of appeal by a lawyer. at the appellate court hearing in the second case the applicant was represented by the same lawyer who had represented him before the first-instance court.
the applicant was born in 1971 and lives in mondsee. on 3 october 2000 the vienna public prosecutor’s office (staatsanwaltschaft – hereinafter, “the prosecutor’s office”) requested the vienna regional criminal court (landesgericht für strafsachen – hereinafter, “the regional court”) to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant. among the injured parties there were also austrian banks. however, he subsequently absconded and did not appear at the court hearing in which his sentence was to be determined. on 1 march 2002 the united states issued an arrest warrant against the applicant. on 6 july 2007 the applicant was arrested in austria on the basis of the arrest warrant of 29 may 2002 (see paragraph 7 above) and subsequently placed in pre-trial detention. while the first two complaints were withdrawn by the applicant, the third was dismissed by the vienna court of appeal (oberlandesgericht) on 5 november 2007. the applicant unsuccessfully requested his release also on 28 january, 8 may and 12 august 2008. on 16 november 2007, 21 april and 15 july 2008 the applicant applied to be granted access to his case-file. on an unspecified date the regional court dismissed his requests. among other things, he declared that he was willing to give a statement concerning the accusations against him. on 26 march 2008 the regional court rejected his requests on formal grounds. on 14 april 2008 the applicant lodged a complaint relating to his fundamental rights (grundrechtsbeschwerde) with the supreme court (oberster gerichtshof), which was dismissed on 19 june 2008. on 21 july, 29 august and 1 september 2008 the applicant lodged further objections because of alleged violations of his rights. the applicant appealed against this decision. was nonetheless appointed to provide an opinion relating to the applicant’s businesses. on 9 october 2008 the applicant lodged another complaint relating to his fundamental rights with the supreme court. on 21 october 2008 he unsuccessfully lodged another request to be released. on 24 april 2009 the applicant was released from pre-trial detention. he argued that he had already been tried and sentenced in the united states for the same offences. on 7 october 2010 the regional court dismissed the application. on 14 march 2011 the vienna court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal, holding that even though it was difficult to clarify the facts of the case after more than ten years, the applicant had significantly contributed to the length of the investigations by having absconded. the applicant again objected to the expert and complained about the length of the pre-trial investigations. further, it held that the main reason for their length was that the applicant had filed a large number of objections and appeals. on 25 october 2011 b. was nonetheless appointed by the prosecutor’s office and given a deadline of nine months to provide the opinion. on 14 august 2013 the applicant lodged an objection because of an alleged violation of his rights, repeating his arguments that the expert b. was not impartial. on 26 december 2013 the regional court granted the objection, holding that the prosecutor’s office had not adequately reacted to the exceeding of the time-limit by the expert, who should have been discharged as a consequence. it therefore found that the applicant’s right to have the proceedings conducted within a reasonable time was violated. on 4 march 2014 the expert b. was discharged and on 5 may 2014 another expert, m., was appointed. therefore, it has become legally binding.
on an unspecified date in 1995 the applicants brought an action against the bucharest municipal council and the local council of the sixth district of bucharest, seeking the recovery of property rights over 1,761 sq. by a decision of 9 april 1998 the bucharest county court allowed the applicants’ action on the merits. the decision was not appealed against by the parties and thus became final. on 27 january 1999 the office of the mayor of bucharest, relying inter alia on article 322 § 5 of the romanian code of civil procedure (hereinafter “the rccp” – see paragraph 13 below), brought extraordinary appeal proceedings against the applicants, seeking review (revizuire) of the final judgment of 9 april 1998, and submitting that a new document had appeared concerning the land claimed by the applicants. they referred to a report drafted on 29 december 1998 by the management agency for markets of district no. 6 (administraţia pieţelor sectorul 6 bucureşti), which stated that the land claimed by the applicants was occupied by a marketplace. by a decision of 24 september 1999 the bucharest county court allowed the action brought by the office of the mayor of bucharest on the ground that the document had not been in the file during the first set of proceedings and that it showed that the land claimed by the applicants was occupied by a marketplace. by a decision of 29 january 2002 the bucharest court of appeal allowed an appeal by the applicants on the ground that the document invoked by the office of the mayor of bucharest was a document which did not comply with the requirements set out in article 322 § 5 of the rccp, since it had not existed at the time when the final decision of 9 april 1998 was delivered. furthermore, the court found that the domestic authorities had failed during the first set of proceedings to raise the issue of the legal situation of the land before the court without an objective reason and could have recovered the investment made on the land claimed by the applicants by bringing separate proceedings against the applicants and seeking recovery of the money. by a final decision of 14 january 2003 the supreme court of justice allowed the appeal (recurs) lodged by the office of the mayor of bucharest on the ground that although the document had not existed during the proceedings which had ended by the final judgment of 9 april 1998, it concerned a pre-existing situation. furthermore, the court found that the provisions of article 322 § 5 of the rccp had to be interpreted as referring to documents used by one party to prove, in the light of new elements, facts which generally had not been known by the court which had delivered the judgment under review. in the light of the above, the court held that the concept of “document” had to be interpreted restrictively. lastly, it considered irrelevant the fact that the document relied on by the party seeking review had been obtained by means of the undertaking of research into other documents which had existed at the time of the judgment of 9 april 1998 and which attested to the same facts, but had not been brought before the court delivering the judgment in question. on 12 february 2002 the applicants filed a request pursuant to law no. 10/2001 on the rules governing immovable property wrongfully seized by the state between 6 march 1945 and 22 december 1989; they requested the restitutio in natura of the plot of land of 1,761 sqm. it appears from the file that in 2010, the request was still pending before the administrative authorities, in so far as further documentation needed to be submitted.
the applicant was born in 1959 and lived in pamažupiai, pasvalys region. he stated that while he was unconscious, he was moved away from the location of the accident on the orders of his employer and all traces of the accident were removed. it appears that the other workers sustained only minor injuries. who stated that he had not seen the accident because he had been elsewhere on the site. the inspector also spoke to the person in charge of work safety in the company n. who informed him that, on the basis of the initial medical examination, the applicant had not sustained any serious injuries. the investigation was opened on the same day and conducted by an investigator from klaipėda police (hereinafter “the investigator”). on 9 october 2007 the investigator instructed a court medical expert to examine the applicant’s medical file in order to determine the number, severity and causes of his injuries. however, it also noted that the injury to the face would leave a big scar, possibly resulting in disfigurement and impairment of facial expression. he stated that just before the accident he and five other workers had been carrying a metal platform to attach to a reservoir tank. the weight of the platform was about 200 kg. at that point the applicant had lost consciousness. on 13 august 2008 the applicant was interviewed again. he relied on the state labour inspectorate report that no damage to the scaffolding on the day of the accident had been observed (see paragraph 9 above), and noted that none of the witnesses had corroborated the applicant’s description of how he had fallen. the applicant appealed against the prosecutor’s decision. on 2 april 2009 the prosecutor instructed the investigator to carry out several additional investigative measures. on 12 may 2009, in response to a prior complaint by the applicant, the deputy chief prosecutor of the klaipėda city prosecutor’s office informed him that there were no grounds to find that the pre-trial investigation in his case had been unduly protracted. on 21 may 2009 the applicant’s co-worker v.k. to attach the metal platform to the reservoir tank. on 3 july 2009 the prosecutor discontinued the pre-trial investigation. the prosecutor also concluded that the workers had not been ordered by their employer to attach the metal platform to the reservoir tank because the construction manager, v.j.s., had been present at the construction site at any time that day. the report noted that there was insufficient information in the case file concerning the technical characteristics of the metal platform and the scaffolding, so the way the accident had happened could be established only in part. accordingly, it concluded that the scaffolding had not been suitable for the work for which it was used, and that the workers had not been adequately informed about how to carry out their work safely. the prosecutor also observed that a separate pre-trial investigation should be opened in order to examine the claims of some witnesses that they had been pressured by their employer to give false testimony. submitted a request to continue the investigation and carry out additional investigative measures but that request was dismissed. on 1 april 2011 the prosecutor issued an indictment against v.j.s. the klaipėda district court held the first hearing on 30 june 2011 and decided to adjourn the case until 27 september 2011 because several witnesses were not present. ’s lawyer informed the klaipėda district court that his client was still sick and had a medical certificate that was valid for another seven days. submitted a medical certificate indicating that he would be sick from 16 to 23 january 2012, which also showed that he would undergo rehabilitation treatment from 23 january to 6 february 2012. the court adopted a decision on 14 may 2012 and terminated the case.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in moscow. prior to its privatisation, the flat at 103-29 dmitrovskoye shosse, moscow, had been owned by the city of moscow. n. and her son b. had resided there as tenants since 1968 under the social housing agreement with the city. on 11 june 2002 the municipal authority supervising real-property transactions in moscow (“moszhilservice”) authorised an exchange of flats between n., whose name had not been removed from the tenant register, and k. 8. on 16 october 2002 the moscow housing department transferred the title to the flat to k. under the privatisation scheme. on 18 november 2002 k. sold the flat to the applicant. on 19 november 2002 the registration committee registered the applicant’s title to the flat. the applicant moved into the flat with his family. on 14 august 2003 the police opened a criminal investigation into the fraudulent acquisition of the flat by k. and other persons. on 14 february 2004 the investigation was suspended as the whereabouts of the alleged perpetrators had not been established. the criminal investigation against him was closed. according to the government, the investigation was reopened in respect of the other suspects. the applicant lodged a counter-claim for damages against the city of moscow. according to the applicant, his counter-claim for damages was dismissed by the court as premature. on 17 april 2006 the timiryazevskiy district court of moscow granted the prosecutor’s claims. the court invalidated the exchange of flats between n. and k. it further considered that k. had defrauded the city of moscow by submitting falsified documents for the exchange and privatisation of the flat, which should be construed as execution of the relevant transaction in the absence of intent to do so on the party of the city of moscow. the court reinstated the city’s title to the flat and ordered the applicant’s eviction. the court confirmed that the lower court had correctly applied legal provisions which allowed the lawful owner of the property to recover it from a bona fide purchaser. on an unspecified date the applicant reintroduced his claim against the city of moscow for damages. on 18 september 2008 the moscow city court upheld the judgment on appeal. on 1 june 2007 the timiryazevskiy district court of moscow suspended for six months the enforcement of the part of the judgment concerning the applicant’s eviction. the applicant continued to reside in the flat. on 5 march 2012 the registration committee registered the city’s title to the flat. it appears that the bailiffs service lost the writ of enforcement and on 30 march 2012 the housing department applied for a duplicate. on 29 may 2012 the district court issued a duplicate of the writ of enforcement. on 22 june 2012 the city court upheld the decision of 29 may 2012 on appeal. on 31 august 2012 the bailiff opened enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgment of 17 april 2006. on 28 december 2013 the applicant rented another flat for the period from january to march 2014. on 11 february 2014 the enforcement proceedings were discontinued as the housing department had withdrawn the writ of enforcement. on 25 august 2014 the housing department entered into a permanent social tenancy agreement with the applicant.
the applicant was born in 1969 and lives in orenburg. in june and july 2006 the investigation division of the leninskiy district police department of orenburg instituted criminal proceedings into robberies committed by an organised group. on 31 august 2006 he was questioned as an accused in the presence of his lawyer and denied being involved in the crimes. there are no records of any investigative actions having been carried out that day with his participation. according to the applicant, once he arrived at the ubop offices five or six police officers, including l. and g., beat him in order to force him to confess to the robberies and subjected him to ill-treatment as follows. they shackled his hands and legs and tied his arms with a belt. they pushed him to the ground and almost suffocated him by putting a plastic bag and a gas mask over his head that cut off his air. they later took him to the basement of the building, which was equipped as a gym. they hung him on the parallel bars and hit him on the kidneys and extremities with a baseball bat. the applicant fainted several times so they burned him with cigarettes to make him come around. at 9 p.m. the applicant was taken back to the sizo. a routine examination by the medical assistant on duty, in the presence of a duty officer, revealed the following injuries: (i) a haematoma measuring 1 cm by 1 cm on the left frontal bone of the skull; (ii) hyperaemia (redness) measuring 1.5 by 3 cm on the right side of the forehead; (iii) a red and blue haematoma measuring 2 cm by 3 cm on the right shin; (iv) hyperaemia measuring 1 cm by 1 cm on both buttocks; and (v) hyperaemia measuring 2.5 by 4 cm on the right side of the lumbar region (medical report no. 249 of 18 september 2006, акт медицинского освидетельствования). according to the additional medical records on the applicant from the sizo for the period from 19 to 23 september 2006, he complained of headache, nausea, dizziness, vomiting and pain on the left side of his body when breathing. he had twitching eyelids and hand tremors. he was diagnosed with neurocirculatory dystonia of a hypertensive type and received treatment. the next day she asked for a forensic medical examination. according to l.’s report, the applicant had been brought to the ubop on 18 september 2006 as part of actions taken under the investigation, and had been taken to l.’s office for an interview. the applicant had jumped up from his chair and “hit his forehead and face on the corner of the chair with some force while shouting that he had to be taken back to the sizo; he became hysterical, fell on the wooden floor, which had a linoleum covering, and started rolling around on the floor, hitting himself against wooden chairs and tables”. on 6 october 2006, following a pre-investigation inquiry, s., an investigator at the promyshlennyy district prosecutor’s office of orenburg, found that the applicant’s allegations had not been confirmed. relying on article 24 § 1 (1) of the code of criminal procedure, he refused to institute criminal proceedings on the grounds that no crime had been committed. the investigator relied on l.’s denial of ill-treating the applicant. on the same day the promyshlennyy district deputy prosecutor annulled the investigator’s decision as unlawful and ordered an additional inquiry. on 27 october 2006 s. again refused to open a criminal case, citing the same grounds. the applicant argued that relying on the police officers’ statements was clearly insufficient. on 19 september 2007 a judge at the promyshlennyy district court of orenburg dismissed the applicant’s complaint. the court held that the inquiry had been thorough and comprehensive, it had not found any facts to confirm the applicant’s ill‑treatment, the medical experts’ conclusions had been consistent with the police officers’ statements and the refusal to institute criminal proceedings had been lawful and well-founded. on 6 march 2008 the orenburg regional court convicted the applicant on several counts of robbery and sentenced him to twelve years and four months’ imprisonment. it stated that the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment were unfounded, relying on the findings of the pre‑investigation inquiry and the statements by l. and the other police officers and investigators denying any wrongdoing on their part. on 24 november 2008 a deputy head of the investigation department of the orenburg town prosecutor’s office dismissed an appeal by the applicant against the investigator’s decision of 27 october 2006, considering that the inquiry had been thorough and objective.
the applicant was born in 1939 and lives in vienna. he is a former lawyer who was admitted to the bar in 1969. on 26 january 1999 the applicant renounced his right to practise as a lawyer because he had, as a result of his gambling addiction, committed criminal offences. on 28 june 1999 the applicant was convicted of aggravated fraud and embezzlement and sentenced to seven and a half years’ imprisonment. on 4 november 1999 the applicant applied to the committee of the vienna bar association (ausschuss der rechtsanwaltskammer; hereinafter, “the committee”) for an invalidity pension. he argued that due to his gambling addiction – a recognised mental illness – he was no longer capable of practising as a lawyer. on 7 march 2001 the applicant requested the committee to inform him why it had still not decided on his application, despite his repeated requests. on 22 june 2001 the applicant was interviewed by a medical expert, who submitted his report on 20 july 2001. on 5 february 2002 the competent division of the committee (hereinafter, “the committee’s division”) partly rejected as being lodged out of time and partly dismissed on the merits the applicant’s application for an invalidity pension. on 8 march 2002 the applicant filed an objection (vorstellung) against that decision. on 30 april 2002 the plenary of the committee (hereinafter, “the plenary”) dismissed the objection. on 20 october 2005 the administrative court quashed the plenary’s decision as unlawful. the applicant claimed that he had submitted a privately commissioned expert report on 30 march 2006 and requested a decision, but that the plenary still had not taken any procedural steps. on 4 july 2007 the administrative court requested the plenary, within three months, either to issue a decision or explain why it had not yet done so. on 13 october 2007 an expert appointed by the plenary submitted a report. on 16 october 2007 the administrative court, at the plenary’s request, extended the time-limit for a decision until 20 january 2008. on 18 january 2008 the applicant requested the administrative court to decide on the merits, claiming that the plenary still had not issued a decision. in addition, it had appointed another expert only at the end of the extended time-limit. subsequently, the administrative court was informed by the head of the bar association that the expert opinion had arrived but that it required supplementation, and that a decision would be issued within one month. on 25 january 2008 the expert submitted his report and on 11 february 2008 he submitted a supplementary report. on 8 april 2008 the committee’s division dismissed the applicant’s application for an invalidity pension. consequently, on 26 june 2008 the administrative court closed the proceedings regarding the applicant’s complaint of 14 june 2007 about the plenary’s failure to decide (see paragraph 11 above), and awarded costs to the applicant. on 21 april 2008 the applicant filed an objection against the committee’s division’s decision of 8 april 2008. on 15 july 2008 the plenary granted the objection and referred the case back to the committee’s division. on 20 october 2008 the applicant complained to the administrative court about the plenary’s decision. on 17 december 2009 the administrative court quashed the plenary’s decision, holding that the committee’s division had not been competent to issue its decision of 8 april 2008 (see paragraph 14 above), as the case had been pending before the plenary after the administrative court had quashed the latter’s decision of 30 april 2002 (see paragraph 10 above). therefore, the plenary should have quashed the committee’s division’s decision of 8 april 2008 and decided on the merits itself. on 15 july 2010, under article 132 of the federal constitution, the applicant complained to the administrative court about the plenary’s failure to decide. on 22 february 2012 the administrative court dismissed the complaint as unfounded. that decision was served on the applicant on 5 march 2012.
the applicant was born in 1990 and lives in budapest. the crime was initially considered to constitute aggravated armed robbery committed by unknown perpetrators. none of the police officers involved could positively identify the fugitive. he was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery. the applicant denied any involvement in the robbery and contested the accusations. referring to police reports, an on-site examination, witness testimonies, decisions on seizure and examinations of various exhibits, the court agreed with the prosecution concerning the reasonable suspicion. it held that pre-trial detention was necessary because the applicant had fled from the police and then turned himself in, but only to avoid criminal liability. indeed, there was a considerable risk of his absconding. the public defender failed to attend the hearing. on 15 april 2013 the budapest high court dismissed an appeal brought by the applicant, without hearing him in person. consequently, he did not have any opportunity to make any comments on the application. it considered that the reason for which he had surrendered to the police was only to escape punishment. it also referred to the impending severe punishment and the risk of his reoffending. on 3 october 2013 the buda central district court extended the applicant’s detention until 6 january 2014 under article 129 § 2 (b) to (d) of the code of criminal procedure. as regards collusion, the court reiterated that the third suspect’s identity had not been established and that some of the stolen goods were still missing. both the applicant and his lawyer were present at the hearing. on 11 october 2013 the budapest high court upheld this decision. in his application he complained that he had still not been provided with any evidence justifying his pre-trial detention. the expert opinions obtained by the authorities and forwarded to him did not contain anything supporting his involvement in the crime. on 3 april 2014 the budapest high court dismissed the applicant’s application for release and extended his detention until 6 june 2014. it also noted that the investigation was almost at an end and, in view of the nature of the investigatory steps yet to be carried out, it found it implausible that the applicant could interfere with its outcome. on 5 june 2014 the budapest high court extended the applicant’s detention until 6 august 2014 under article 129 § 2 (d) of the code of criminal procedure (risk of reoffending), pointing out the “professional” manner in which the crime had been committed. without hearing from the applicant, the court pointed out that the severity of a potential punishment was not in itself sufficient to establish a risk of a person absconding; however, the applicant’s personal circumstances, such as him being unreachable even to his family members, showed that such a risk existed. on 13 november 2014 a third suspect was apprehended. the public prosecutor’s application was served on the applicant some days after the detention decision had already been taken. on 29 july 2015 the budapest appeal court carried out the yearly review of the applicant’s pre-trial detention. the budapest high court held further hearings on 13 november 2014, 15 january, 7 april, 19 june, 15 september, 7 october, 3 november, 1 and 21 december 2015, 9 february and 23 march 2016. the applicant was convicted of robbery and illegally entering a private property and sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment. on the same day the high court extended his custody until the closure of the second-instance proceedings. the second-instance trial is still pending.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in norway. he had also been the owner of the magazine since 1996 and wrote analytical and investigative articles for each edition under his own name. in total, thirty-four proceedings were instituted against him by various public officials. according to the applicant, her husband regularly received threats because of his critical articles. 27 dated 10 march 2005 showed that death had resulted from bleeding caused by gunshot wounds. on the same day the investigator questioned the applicant as a witness in connection with her husband’s murder. he had always arrived when her husband had been absent and had asked various questions about his whereabouts and working hours. on 19 march 2005 the applicant was granted victim status. further to various requests sent in march 2005 to the russian authorities concerning the pistol found at the crime scene, the russian authorities confirmed that the pistol in question had been produced in russia as a gas pistol and had then been exported to bulgaria on the basis of a contract with a bulgarian company. in the meantime, the prosecuting authorities identified two mobile telephone numbers which had allegedly been used by the perpetrators of the murder. he further stated that he knew the men from georgia where he was born and they had told him that they were in baku on business. on the same day the investigator charged t.x., it appears from the investigator’s decision that t.x. had been identified as the person involved in the murder. on 27 may 2005 a panel composed of three experts issued report no. 4351/4352/4358 on the new ballistic and chemical examination of the pistol and the silencer. a georgian national, had been identified as another suspect. it can be seen in a document dated 8 june 2005, signed by the investigator, that he informed the applicant by telephone about the investigation. on the grounds that as they were georgian nationals they could not be extradited to a foreign country. in july and august 2005 the georgian authorities conducted various investigative actions at the request of their azerbaijani counterparts. on 9 august 2005 the investigator showed various photographs to the applicant for identification. the experts’ reports, dated 15 december 2005 and 19 january 2006, concluded that the pistol found at the scene of the murder of the applicant’s husband had not been used in the commission of the other murder. on 4 may 2006 the investigator questioned a cousin of t.x. as it had not been possible to establish his whereabouts. it was further stated that in accordance with articles 87 and 102 of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 61 below) the applicant had the right to familiarise herself with the case file and obtain copies of documents only when the preliminary investigation was over. lastly, it was noted that members of the investigative group had been sent to georgia several times and that the investigation was ongoing. stated that he had not seen them since his release from detention on 19 march 2007 and that he had no information about their whereabouts. on 4 july 2008 the applicant’s norwegian lawyer and the norwegian helsinki committee wrote to the prosecutor general’s office and the mns asking for the documents relating to the criminal investigation of the murder of the applicant’s husband. on 30 january 2009 the applicant herself wrote to the mns, reiterating her previous requests. by a letter of 17 march 2009 the national central bureau of interpol in azerbaijan informed the head of the investigation department of the mns that t.a.
the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in san marino. more than eleven million euros had been deposited but no trace of it could be found in the accounts. on the same day at 2.50 pm the applicant was taken to prison and placed in detention. 769/12 was partially classified and thus partially subject to non-disclosure. he complained of not being able to examine the investigative material, the short length of time he had been able to consult with his lawyer and of the delay in appearing before the judge. furthermore, access to further material was possible through other procedures that were available. it upheld the complaint about the non-disclosure of the documents, the content of which had served to justify his detention on remand given that the time-limit for classification of the file had expired. in connection with both files, in the text of its judgment the court considered that the applicant must be allowed access to such documents with the limited aim of allowing the applicant to be fully aware of the evidence already collected, especially that as a result of which the inquiring magistrate had ordered the applicant’s arrest and detention. 184/14 had been partially declassified before the appeal judge’s decision). by a decision of 18 july 2014, notified to the applicant’s legal representatives on 22 july 2014, the judge of criminal appeals upheld the order of 30 june 2014 and dismissed any further claims. he also complained of procedural irregularities. after a hearing, where oral and written submissions were made by the applicant and the attorney general, the third-instance judge on 8 september 2014 dismissed the applicant’s complaints. indeed, more information than that strictly required had been communicated to the applicant and the judicial communication at issue had been exemplary, both in respect of the quantity and the clarity of the information provided. referring extensively to the report of the inquiring judge, the third-instance judge found that it was necessary to keep the applicant in detention. by a decision of 17 july 2014 the inquiring judge dismissed that application in part. according to the applicant a further request to examine witnesses remained unheeded. by a decision of 13 october 2014, the judge of criminal appeals upheld the applicant’s appeal in part. moreover, despite the relevant time-limits having expired both files remained classified, and the applicant could not have knowledge of the further evidence collected and whether it supported suspicions against him, or the contrary. on 4 march 2015 the applicant asked to be released on the basis that the testimony of a certain p. had been retracted in the proceedings against m. it had been p. who had previously stated that he had seen m. give the applicant a walkie-talkie to communicate with his co-accused. on 6 march 2015 the inquiring judge dismissed the application. the matters that had been brought to light could not alter the grounds listed and explained in detail in previous decisions. by a decision of 20 march 2015 the judge of criminal appeals dismissed the applicant’s appeal. the court noted that the detention order of 23 june 2014 had stated that the reasons for considering detention necessary had been the fear of the applicant’s reoffending and tampering with evidence, which had been justified by the role played by the applicant in the organisation and by the complex and effective network he could benefit from. the order of 18 september 2014, apart from relying on the evidence in the proceedings against m., had been based on other, more significant and relevant reasons. referring to various evidentiary conclusions the court considered that in relation to the further charges of money laundering against the applicant, the evidentiary scenario was robust and exhaustive. it amply demonstrated that the applicant (with others) had participated in the transfer and concealment of funds generated from crimes committed in san marino or elsewhere. moreover, video surveillance images showed that the accused had received favourable treatment while in detention, with the director of the prison providing him with company, support and information, and even arranging meetings between the co-accused. the seriousness of the elements on which the suspicion against the applicant was based (quadro indiziario), the facts and the means by which the crimes had taken place, as well as the dense network of personal relations, the involvement of family members, professionals, state representatives and government personnel who were still in service, led to the conclusion that there was a real risk that evidence, namely documentary evidence, would be tampered with and that pressure would be put on people who had knowledge of the events at issue. moreover, the accused could still continue to hide the illicit origins of funds through the very complex and ingenious methods already applied. by an interlocutory decision of 2 july 2015, the third-instance judge suspended the order for the applicant’s detention on remand and ordered that he be put under house arrest until a decision on the merits of the constitutional challenge had been issued.
the applicant was born in 1940 and lives in plungė. the father of the applicant’s husband owned 9.24 hectares of land in telšiai region. participated in a meeting at the plungė district land service of the telšiai county administration (hereinafter “the plungė district land service”), where he was informed that all of his father’s land was already being used by others and could not be returned to him in natura. to choose the form of restitution of his property rights. replied that he had already chosen the form of restitution in 1991, which was restitution in natura. again refused to choose a different form of restitution. was also offered two plots of land of 2.5 and 0.5 hectares. he stated that he would have to think about the offer and would inform the authorities before 1 may 2002. was also informed that if a form of restitution was not chosen, the property rights would be restored in the form determined by the authorities. asked the authorities whether and when he would be paid damages for the failure to restore his property rights in natura or to provide him with a plot of land of equivalent value. in june 2005 the plungė district land service asked v.v. also again refused the plots of land offered to him, stating that they were not of equivalent value. he again replied that he had chosen that the land be returned to him in natura in 1991. reminded the authorities that he wanted the land to be returned in natura or to receive a plot of land of equivalent value. wanted in order to restore his property rights. two plots of land were shown to the representative and the next day she replied that she refused to accept them. the plungė district land service repeated that the document on a transfer of the land had already been prepared and the applicant had to sign it and indicate the area where she would like to receive a plot of land of equivalent value. in february 2007 the plungė district land service informed the applicant about the procedure for restitution and reiterated that the applicant had to sign the document on the transfer of land. in response, the applicant stated that she would sign the land transfer document after she had been shown a plot of equivalent value. in august 2007 during a meeting at the plungė district land service it had been decided to include v.v. ’s request to restore his property rights into the preparation of an additional territorial plan of the area. in their observations, the government provided a document to the court, indicating that the compensation had been paid on 2 december 2008 and 31 december 2008. finally, she complained that compensation calculated at ltl 3,437 (approximately eur 995) was too low. however, they had never expressly done so. moreover, the court held that the applicant had never changed the original wish to have the land returned in natura because she had refused to agree to the document on the transfer of land, which would have allowed her to have a plot of equivalent value returned to her. in october 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal. that had been contrary to the procedure established in the domestic law. the court further observed that the national authorities had decided to pay the applicant monetary compensation as the form of restitution. the national authorities could not transfer the monetary compensation to the applicant because of the absence of the document proving that she was an heir of v.v. the applicant submitted the relevant documents together with her account number and the compensation was transferred to her account on 14 november 2016.

the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in kosovo. in november 1994 the applicant was arrested for working illegally, and on 16 november 1994 the dornbirn district administrative authority (bezirkshauptmannschaft) issued a decision imposing a five-year residence ban (aufenthaltsverbot) on him. on 5 january 1995 the applicant lodged an asylum claim, which on 27 january 1995 was dismissed by the federal asylum office (bundesasylamt) as unfounded. his appeal against that decision was dismissed, and he voluntarily returned to kosovo in september 1997. on 1 july 1998 the applicant returned to austria and lodged a fresh asylum claim on 8 july 1998, this time together with his wife and their daughter. they received a temporary residence permit, which was extended several times. he was sentenced to a fine of eur 400, which was suspended on the basis of a probationary period. on 30 october 2003 the regional court convicted the applicant of aggravated burglary and sentenced him to twelve months’ imprisonment, eight and a half months of which were suspended on the basis of a probationary period. he was in pre-trial detention and then prison from 28 july to 11 november 2003. the applicant was in prison from 23 may until 12 november 2007. it was his ninth criminal conviction in austria. the vorarlberg security police authority (sicherheitspolizeidirektion) confirmed the ban in a decision of 5 november 2007. the applicant did not appeal against that decision. he had four children, born in 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2006 respectively. his parents, his three siblings and their spouses and children all lived in the same city as him. his parents and his older brother were recognised refugees. he and his parents lived in the same house. his father still owned some land and three shops in kosovo, which were run by relatives at that time. the applicant stated that if he had to return to kosovo he would not know what to do there or where to go. he had a “bad feeling” about returning, but did not fear any repression. he would, however, prefer to stay in austria, where his children went to school. turning to the applicant’s rights under article 8 of the convention, the federal asylum office acknowledged how established his private and family life was in austria, where his family members were living. however, it referred to his numerous convictions for crimes against life and limb as well as property, and concluded that the public interest in his expulsion outweighed his personal interest in remaining in the country. the federal asylum office specifically mentioned the two convictions for drug offences in 2007 and 2010, which it considered particularly serious. according to the applicant’s own statements, his father still owned some land and three shops in kosovo, so it could be assumed that he could find work. also, he could reapply for a residence permit in 2017 when the ban expired. the applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with the constitutional court. the asylum court replied on 13 september 2011 that the applicant had spoken of four children throughout the proceedings, but had never mentioned that one of them had in fact been born as a result of an extra-marital relationship and had never lived with him in the same household. he could continue to pay financial maintenance from kosovo for his daughter. on 14 december 2011 the constitutional court refused to deal with the applicant’s complaint.
the applicant was born in 1980 and lives in kresnice. although company p. had initially requested that the enforcement be carried out by seizing the applicant’s house, its claim was subsequently paid from the applicant’s bank account. having been unsuccessful in securing the payment of its claim by the sale of movable property, company j. subsequently requested that enforcement action be taken against the applicant’s house. taxes and the outstanding mortgage on the house were also paid from the proceeds. it sought enforcement of the principal amount of eur 124 plus default interest. on 2 june 2009 the ljubljana local court issued an enforcement decision – a writ of execution – against the applicant, ordering the seizure of his movable property as requested by company j. the decision contained a notice that an objection could be lodged by the debtor within a time-limit of eight days. the decision was served on the applicant on 24 june 2009. a report drawn up by the enforcement officer stated that nobody was at the property. on 21 april 2010, as part of the proceedings instituted by company p., the litija local court ordered a valuation of the applicant’s house. however, he failed to do so, and on 24 june 2010 the report was left in his mailbox (see paragraphs 52 and 53 below). in the meantime, on 29 april 2010, the enforcement officer inspected the interior of the applicant’s house in the presence of the applicant’s wife and concluded that it contained no objects which could be seized and sold to cover the debt concerned in the proceedings instituted by company j. the officer again left a note inviting the applicant to pay the debt, now amounting to eur 516, voluntarily. on 1 july 2010, the litija local court set the amount to be paid to the property valuer. on 1 september 2010 the litija local court ordered that a public auction of the applicant’s house be held on 7 october 2010. the decision was served on the applicant on 6 september 2010. on 7 october 2010 a first public auction of the applicant’s house was held. however, there were no interested buyers. for eur 70,000, namely 50% of its estimated market value. he requested that the enforcement be carried out by attachment of the applicant’s house. on 24 november 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal against the award decision in which he informed the court that he had repaid the debt (see paragraph 26 above). he argued, inter alia, that he had been unable to go to the auction and that he had only learned from the impugned decision that the auction had been held. he had been having financial difficulties throughout that year since his father had died and his mother had lost her job. in this connection he submitted that he had needed to support her in addition to his wife, who had also been unemployed, and his two children. the applicant lodged an objection to the above decision (see paragraph 32 above), stating that the enforcement proceedings instituted by company j. had already been discontinued and that he wished to have a.a. see paragraphs 26 and 29 above), which thus became final. therefore, the law had been correctly applied. the court further stated that the constitutional court, in its decisions nos. who had joined his claims to the enforcement proceedings after the house had already been sold; eur 1,372 to the tax office for taxes due for the sale of the house; and eur 58,888 to a bank on account of the outstanding mortgage on the house. in the meantime, on 28 july 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal against the decisions of 12 january and 25 may 2011 (see paragraphs 35 and 37 above). in particular, he argued that the court had been under no obligation to attach immovable property to the enforcement order. they first moved in with their relatives and later acquired a new home.
at the material time the applicant company was the publisher of kvartirnyy ryad, a newspaper specialising in coverage of the housing market in the moscow area (“the newspaper”). on 20 may 2004 the newspaper published an article by g. entitled “so sorry for the bird. the article described a conflict situation concerning a large commonhold association, bluebird (синяя птица), which included eight blocks of flats in the south-west of moscow. g. suggested in the article that a number of residents of the bluebird flats had been affected by the alleged misuse of common areas, in particular attics in the blocks of flats and that t., the head of the commonhold association, had been behind the misuse. g. emphasised that t. was also the deputy head of a district council in moscow and that he had declined to comment on the article’s contents prior to publication. the article asked t. and the local government questions pertaining to the misuse of the common areas. the relevant parts of the article read as follows:
“residents of eight blocks of flats in severnoe butovo keep sending letters to the courts, the prosecutor’s office, the city administration and even president putin to complain about the head of the “bluebird” commonhold association, t., [w]ho has developed an indecently hasty business activity spitting in the face of the association’s charter and a number of regional and federal laws. ... ... but t. has expressed his distrust in the commission elected by the general meeting and has appointed his own commission...as a result t. has managed to retain his position ...
... the commission was not elected, but appointed, which guaranteed the appointment of t. for a third term ...
... in sum, even though t. did not have the majority of the votes, he nonetheless managed to conclude the contract ...
... let’s ask one final question, which again pertains to t.: does a state official have the right to combine his official functions with a commercial business activity?” on 28 may 2004 t. lodged a defamation claim against the applicant company and g. with the presnenskiy district court of moscow (“the district court”). the plaintiff alleged that the statements contained in the article damaged his honour, dignity and business reputation. the court received the statement of claim on 15 june 2004. on 8 december 2004 the district court examined and partially allowed the claim, referring to article 152 of the civil code and resolution no. it reasoned:
“... the impugned statement: “... who [has] developed an indecently hasty business activity spitting in the face of the commonhold association’s charter and a number of regional and federal laws” should be retracted [by the defendants] ... as during the judicial examination of the case the defendants failed to prove that t.’s actions were unlawful. the defendants, a third party and witnesses explained that an attic ... had been unlawfully rented out. the lease agreement had been unlawfully concluded by t. ...
however, no evidence has been provided [by the defendants] to the court to prove that the plaintiff’s actions were unlawful or illegal or in violation of federal and regional law or the commonhold association’s charter. moreover, the issue of the lease of the attic ... was examined by the zyuzinskiy district court of moscow. by the decision of the zyuzinskiy district court of moscow of 19 may 2004 actions of the bluebird commonhold association headed by t. were found to be in compliance with the law in force. as to the statements: “... the commission was not elected, but appointed, which guaranteed the appointment of t. for a third term ... in sum, even though t. did not have the majority of the votes, he nonetheless managed to conclude the contract ...” ... they are not to be retracted as they are not damaging to the honour and dignity of the plaintiff. ... as to the statement: “let’s ask one final question, which again pertains to t.: does a state official have the right to combine his official functions with a commercial business activity?” it should not be retracted either as ... the author of the article [g.] is asking a rhetorical question ...” 10. the district court ordered the applicant company “to refute the statement [published] in the newspaper kvartirnyy ryad on 20 may 2004 ... that t. developed activities as the head of the “bluebird” commonhold association, violating the association’s charter as well as a whole range of laws of the capital area and federal law”. it also awarded t. non-pecuniary damages: 10,000 russian roubles (rub – approximately 270 euros) to be paid by the applicant company and rub 8,000 to be paid by g. 11. the applicant company and g. appealed against the judgment to the moscow city court (“the city court”). on 4 may 2005 it upheld the judgment of 8 december 2004 in full, referring to article 152 of the civil code and to resolution no. it provided the following succinct reasoning:
“the plaintiff has proven the fact that the contested statements were disseminated: he provided the court with an original issue of the newspaper of 20 may 2004 ...
... the court [of first instance] rightly held that the defendants had failed to prove the veracity of the disseminated statement ... that [the plaintiff] had developed an indecently hasty business activity spitting in the face of the association’s charter and the law. at the same time, the court [justifiably] referred to the judgment of the zyuzinskiy district court of moscow ... which found the actions of the commonhold association ... headed by t. to be in compliance with the law in force.” on 25 july 2005 the city court rejected a request by the applicant company for supervisory review. on 13 october 2005 the enforcement proceedings were terminated by a bailiff as the judgment of 8 december 2004 had been enforced in full.
the applicant was born in 1938 and lives in hamburg. on 19 march 1970 the applicant married a.s. from 1980 the couple lived in hamburg and as of 1986 they resided in a rented apartment. in 1992 they moved to riga but maintained their place of residence in hamburg. the couple maintained contact by telephone and post. on 15 december 2000 they both signed a paper which stated that “with view of regulating their separated life, [the applicant and a.s.] there is no information on the content of that document. according to the documents submitted by the applicant, her residence permit in latvia expired on 15 january 2002. the government maintained that the correct date had been 14 may 2003. also alleged that the applicant’s last known place of residence had been their apartment in riga and that, owing to their disagreements, he could not find out where the court summons should be sent to. upon receiving the information from post authorities that the applicant did not live at the above address, on 27 january 2004 the applicant was summoned to the hearing scheduled for 1 march 2004 with a notice in the official gazette. was represented by a lawyer who stated, inter alia, that a.s. no appeal was brought against this judgment and it came into force on 27 april 2004. one of the witnesses who had testified in the divorce proceedings. the government did not dispute this fact. had been aware of the applicant’s address in hamburg. could have placed a notice about the proceedings in a newspaper in hamburg, where the applicant resided. the president of the supreme court emphasised that owing to these violations the justice authority of the free and hanseatic city of hamburg had refused to recognise said judgment. the senate of the supreme court concluded that, since a.s. ’s claim had not contained a reference to the applicant’s address and since the riga city ziemeļu district court had therefore been unaware of her whereabouts, its actions had been compatible with the procedural requirements of the civil procedure law. section 59(2) of the civil procedure law imposed no obligation on the court; it only gave the plaintiff a right to publish the court’s summonses in other newspapers at his or her own expense. passed away on 30 april 2004, a fact which excludes any further proceedings. had been aware of the applicant’s place of residence and on whether the applicant had been aware of the divorce proceedings. ’s retirement pension and health insurance had been transferred to their shared bank account, as well as to their place of residence in hamburg. the government, in turn, relied on the information a.s. ’s submissions before the senate of the supreme court. on 3 november 2005 the applicant brought civil proceedings against a.a. she argued that it had been the spouses’ common property. on 30 november 2006 the riga regional court granted her claim in full. the court has no further information about these proceedings.
the present case concerns the applicant’s trial and conviction for attempted murder of m. g., a businessman and former parliamentarian. the facts of the case may be summarised as follows. on 29 december 2001 a bomb placed under m.g. ’s car detonated when the latter started the engine in the morning. with whom he had major disagreements over business-related issues, as the only possible offender. having acknowledged the existence of disagreements with m.g., he denied the offence and stated that he had been at home with his son, v.g., was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. the charges against him were eventually dropped several months later since his involvement in the offence had not been established. and that the applicant had always been against a.g. she mentioned that about a year before, the applicant had complained about m.g. the parents had maintained good relations and the family was in contact almost every day. the applicant’s neighbour, was interviewed. the applicant and their two children v.g. since 2001, when they had settled in the building. a friend of the family, was arrested following the discovery of a large quantity of firearms and explosives in his house. on 23 september 2005 the applicant was arrested and charged with instigation of attempted murder and property damage. on an unspecified date the investigation was concluded and the criminal case was referred to the avan and nor-nork district court of yerevan for trial. in the witness call list while it appears that a.at., since the contract concerned the sale of the house where she used to live, which she did. and tried not to maintain any contact with him. to be excluded from the witness call list, since the latter was the applicant’s daughter. expressed her wish to use the testimonial privilege. in this connection the district court mainly relied on the trial statements of s.a., had a strained relationship with the latter. since their divorce in 1999 and had no interest in his business activities. in the course of the proceedings before the criminal court of appeal y.w. ’s pre-trial statement of 29 january 2002, a.at. ’s pre-trial statement of 18 february 2002, as well as the pre-trial statements of two neighbours, a.a. by decision of 25 september 2009 the court of cassation reopened the proceedings, re-examined the applicant’s appeal on points of law and declared it inadmissible for lack of merit.
the applicant was born on 12 may 1988 and at the time of his most recent communication with the court was detained in toretsk (previously dzerzhynsk). it was established that a grinder tool had also gone missing. once at the police station, the applicant was separated from his father and questioned as to whether he had any information about the grinder which had disappeared from the shop. on learning that the police were searching for a grinder, the applicant had told him the story he had told the police (see paragraphs 8 above and 13 below). once the man had dropped the grinder, the applicant had picked it up and run away. on the evening of 20 february 2005 the applicant was placed in a cell in the police’s temporary detention facility with two adult detainees, k., born in 1975, and o., born in 1956, who were at the time registered as suffering from drug addiction. then he had picked up the grinder and taken it home. on 23 february 2005 the toretsk court remanded the applicant in custody pending the completion of the investigation. that decision was not appealed against and became final. he stated that he confirmed his prior statements about the murder. in the course of the subsequent investigation he was again questioned in the presence of the same lawyer and made detailed statements that repeated his confession. he also noted that he had kept to his initial confessions until his conviction because his cellmates and the police had told him that the police would make his life difficult in prison if he told anyone of the pressure on him. accordingly, he had said nothing to his lawyers about his ill-treatment. the prosecutor also appealed, in particular arguing that the sentence was excessively lenient. on 19 december 2005 and on several subsequent occasions the investigators attempted to question the applicant within the framework of the further investigations. however, he refused to answer any questions and denied any involvement in the crimes he had been charged with. on 11 and 12 january 2006 the investigator reclassified the charges against the applicant from simple murder to aggravated murder for gain, and from theft to robbery. it held that while the applicant had no prior convictions and had positive character references, he had no employment and had been charged with grave offences. no time-limit for his detention was fixed in that decision or in those made on 30 november 2006, 21 may 2007, 24 july and 30 december 2008, and 27 may 2009 (see below). on 21 march 2007 the applicant’s case was submitted to the regional court for a retrial. on 21 may 2007 the regional court again sent the case back for further investigation and, without giving reasons, ruled that the applicant should remain in custody. on 25 january 2008 the regional court convicted the applicant of robbery and the murder of d. 46. on 9 april 2009 the supreme court quashed that decision. in particular, it made the following findings. in particular, according to the forensic and other evidence, d. had been raped with a vodka bottle, which was not in line with the applicant’s initial statements that he had accidentally killed her after being surprised by her and had then run away almost immediately. (f)  while the statement in the arrest report that “eyewitnesses indicate the person who had committed the crime” (see paragraph 15 above) had been technically incorrect in the applicant’s case, the discovery of the grinder in the applicant’s home had in fact constituted an independent legal basis for his arrest. that threat had had a particularly strong impact on him given that he had already been made to spend several hours in a state of undress and vulnerability. on 26 january 2006 the toretsk prosecutor’s office, in response to the applicant’s mother’s complaint of 16 january 2006, refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the applicant’s complaints for lack of a corpus delicti in the police officers’ actions, concluding that there was no evidence of any physical or psychological ill‑treatment. the prosecutors also stated that there had been no irregularities in the applicant’s placement and holding in the police detention facility and that o. and k. with whom the applicant had been placed at that facility had had no prior convictions. o. had had a conviction at some point in the past but his conviction had been considered sufficiently old to have been considered expunged by time the applicant had been detained with him.
the applicant was born in 1952 and lives in cologne. in 2009 the applicant defended a client in criminal proceedings. in 2010 and 2011 the bochum public prosecution office conducted investigations into several individuals suspected of having committed fraud on a commercial basis as members of a gang. one of the suspects was the aforementioned applicant’s former client, who again retained the applicant as his defence lawyer. the inspection revealed that the client’s fiancée had received money (eur 7,400) which was suspected to have stemmed from illegal activities, and had transferred eur 1,500 for legal fees to the applicant’s bank account. on the basis of the bank transfer of fees from the fiancée to the applicant in relation to the first set of criminal proceedings, the bochum public prosecution office also contacted the applicant’s bank. on 1 march 2011 the public prosecutor asked for a list of all transactions concerning the applicant’s bank account from 1 january 2009 until that day. he asked the bank not to reveal the request to the applicant. (d)  do other accounts exist of which the person in question is the beneficiary? (f)  if bank accounts have been closed by the person in question, please submit information about the date of closure and the balance at the time of closure, and where the money was transferred after closure. (g)  which addresses of the person in question are known to you? (h)  are you aware of any money transfers to or other transactions with foreign countries? if so, please specify the bank, account and amount of each transfer or transaction. (i)  please submit a list of all transactions for all existing or closed accounts from 1 january 2009 onwards. (j)  are there any credit cards connected to any of the accounts?” the bank complied with both requests for information and submitted the information to the public prosecution office. in both instances, the public prosecutor did not order the bank to submit the information, but pointed to the obligations of witnesses set out in the ccp and the possible consequences of non‑compliance (see paragraph 23 below). the information received was analysed by the police and the public prosecutor, and a list of fifty-three transactions deemed to be relevant was included in the investigation file as evidence. from the case file he learned, for the first time, of the investigative measures concerning his own bank account. on 24 april 2012 the applicant asked the chief public prosecutor to hand over to him all data received from the bank and destroy all related data at the public prosecution office. he stated that there was a suspicion that the money transferred from the client’s fiancée stemmed from illegal activities. therefore, since the investigative measures were legitimate, the information received had to be kept in the investigation file. subsequently, the file was transferred to the bochum regional court (“the regional court”), because the criminal proceedings against the applicant’s client had started. the applicant therefore asked the regional court to return the data. on 19 july 2012 the regional court refused the applicant’s application. the court found that the investigation was lawful, that the bank had provided the information voluntarily, that the documents could therefore only be returned to the bank and not to the applicant, and that the prohibition of seizure under article 97 of the ccp (see paragraph 28 below) was not applicable, since the information had not been in the applicant’s possession. the applicant appealed against the decision. he challenged in particular the findings that the bank had acted voluntarily and that there had been sufficient suspicion for such an extensive analysis of his banking transactions. he further reiterated that, owing to his position as a lawyer, there were several safeguards in place concerning the seizure of documents (see paragraphs 26-29 below), and these should not have been circumvented because his and his clients’ personal information was stored at and by the bank, and not at his office. on 13 september 2012 the hamm court of appeal confirmed the decision of the regional court.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in shakhty, the rostov region. on 29 march 2005 the rostov-na-donu military court (“the military court”) ordered, inter alia, the commander of the military unit no. 3654 (“the military unit”) to provide the applicant certain monetary compensation and allowance for the periods specified in the operative part of the judgment. the judgment came into force on 15 april 2005. according to the applicant, having received the writ of execution, he forwarded it to the commander of the military unit who partly executed the judgment (see paragraph 9 below). according to the government, on 6 may 2005 the applicant received two writs of execution in his case and sent them to the military unit. according to the parties, the judgment was enforced only in part. on 22 august 2005 approximately 68,000 russian roubles were paid to the applicant in execution of the judgment. as the government submitted in their observations, the allowance for the period from 1 march 2003 until the date of the applicant’s reinstatement in military service as well as some additional payments due to the applicant under the judgment of 29 march 2005 had not been transferred to him. as submitted by the applicant, despite his subsequent requests, the original copy of the writ of execution in respect of the judgment of 29 march 2005 was never returned to him by the military unit. therefore, on an unspecified date he requested the military court to issue a duplicate of the enforcement document. in 2005, 2006 and 2008 the applicant applied for an additional decision to be made in his civil case against the military unit which resulted in the judgment of 29 march 2005. he considered that an additional decision specifying the amounts to be paid to him under the judgment of 29 march 2005 would resolve his difficulties in claiming the outstanding amounts. in his application of 26 may 2006 he also asked the court to index‑link the delayed payments and claimed non-pecuniary damage for the delayed enforcement of the judgment of 29 march 2005. the military court rejected all of the applicant’s claims, explaining that he should have applied for an additional decision before the entry into force of the judgment of 29 march 2005. on 3 april 2008 the military court refused the applicant’s request to clarify the judgment of 29 march 2005 by indicating the specific amounts to be paid. the court considered that the applicant’s request amounted to a call to amend the judgment rather than to clarify it. it held that the text of the judgment was clear enough and the applicant’s disagreement with the way it had been enforced was not a sufficient ground for clarifying the judgment. on 14 may 2008 this decision was upheld on appeal.
the facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. the applicant association intended to organise a demonstration to protest against the business practices of company x, which ran the shopping centre, for example by raising rents by 300%. the majority of the businesses are located in warehouses along nadrzeczna street. on 12 may 2008 the applicant association, acting through its lawyer, informed the mayor of the lesznowola commune (wójt gminy) about its intention to organise a demonstration on 19 may 2008. attempts to negotiate with the company had failed, so it had been necessary to organise common action. the organisers assured the mayor that the demonstration would be peaceful. 16 nadrzeczna street, opposite two warehouses. nadrzeczna street is used by public transport minibuses and by the school bus. therefore organising a demonstration on that street between 7 and 10 a.m. would block the entire length of the street and also limit or even make impossible any journey by car to krakowska street and in the farther direction of grojec. in the event of a traffic accident, the intervention of the police, the fire service or the ambulance service would be difficult, if not impossible. similarly, access to a doctor by the residents of wólka kosowska during the demonstration might be totally impossible. on 14 may 2008 the board of directors of company x sent a letter to the applicant association referring to the demonstration planned for 19 may 2008. according to the company, the only aim of such actions was disruption and they could not influence its position on the contested measures. on 16 may 2008 the applicant association lodged an appeal against the decision of 14 may 2008 (see paragraph 9 above). the planned demonstration would not block the entire street and would not make it impossible for cars and buses to pass. on 24 july 2008 the governor overruled the impugned decision and discontinued the proceedings as devoid of purpose, given that the demonstration was to have taken place more than two months previously. the decision was delivered to the applicant association’s lawyer on 25 august 2008. the mayor emphasised the fact that wolka kosowska had about 700 inhabitants, some of whom used nadrzeczna street to get to work and school in the mornings. access by those entrepreneurs and for deliveries would be impossible. nadrzeczna street was a single carriage way with no pavement. they pointed out that most of the entrepreneurs working in the warehouses intended to participate in the demonstration. moreover, the mayor had failed to notice that the duration of the planned demonstration had been halved in order to accommodate the arguments that the mayor had put forward in her first decision of 14 may 2008 (see paragraph 9 above). the time, venue and purpose of the demonstration were the same as in the two previous cases. she stated that disruption to traffic would make impossible any intervention by the police or other emergency services. moreover, any assessment of that danger should be based on facts and not assumptions. there was no basis for a decision to ban the demonstration. the demonstration planned for 2 october 2008 took place. on 24 october 2008 the applicant association lodged a complaint with the constitutional court. it relied on article 57 of the constitution, which guarantees freedom of assembly. an appeal by the applicant association against the decision was finally dismissed as lodged out of time on 16 september 2010.
the applicant was born in 1988 and lives in the village of trudobelikovskiy, krasnodar region. the police intervened immediately after the alleged assaults. according to the applicant, at the police station investigator n. demanded that he confess to the crime, and threatened him with ill‑treatment and rape in a cell at the pre-trial detention facility. the policeman then pushed the applicant into the cell so that the applicant hit his head against the wall and fell to the ground. according to the police record drawn up by operative police officer k., the applicant signed the “statement of surrender and confession” at 2.35 a.m. on 16 august 2007. the applicant was taken to a forensic medical expert who found that the applicant had the following physical injuries (examination report of 16 august 2007): (i) two abrasions on the left side of the forehead, measuring 2.5 cm by 0.7 cm and 0.7 cm by 0.5 cm; (ii) an abrasion on the bridge of the nose, measuring 4.5 cm by 1.5 cm; and (iii) a bruise around one eye, measuring 3 cm by 4 cm. the applicant explained to the expert that his injuries had been caused by the three police officers who had physically assaulted him at the police station in the night of 15 august 2007, in particular by hitting his face against the wall. on the same day the applicant complained to the ministry of the interior of the republic of komi that he had been ill-treated at the police station. he also asked the traumatology unit of the hospital in syktyvkar to record his injuries. on 17 august 2007 the applicant was arrested, questioned as a suspect and detained on remand by a court. the decision relied on the following statements. investigator n. stated that he had interviewed the applicant after he had signed his “statement of surrender and confession”. the applicant had not complained of any physical violence against him. n. had not seen any injuries on the applicant, or a footprint on his t-shirt, during his interview or prior to his release from the police station. n. had heard about the applicant hitting his head against the wall later on from k.l. investigator n. denied that the applicant had been put under any physical or psychological pressure. about the applicant striking his head against the bars of a cell. on 4 march 2008 the supreme court of the komi republic granted an appeal lodged by the applicant’s mother and quashed the district court’s decision, noting that no assessment had been made of the contradiction between the medical expert’s conclusions and the police officers’ allegations of the applicant’s self-harm. on 21 march 2008 the syktyvdinskiy district court ruled that the refusal to open a criminal case of 29 august 2007 had been unjustified for reasons largely similar to those cited by the supreme court. the court ordered the investigation authorities to rectify those deficiencies. on 24 april 2008 the investigative committee of the prosecutor’s office of the komi republic issued a new refusal to open a criminal case against the police officers and investigator n., finding, in accordance with article 24 § 1 (2) of the ccrp, that none of the elements of the crimes provided for in articles 130, 286 and 302 of the criminal code (on insulting behaviour, abuse of powers and forced confessions respectively) were present in their actions. such records were normally kept for three days and then automatically deleted. on 24 april 2008 the applicant was found guilty by the syktyvdinskiy district court. the applicant’s mother challenged the second refusal to open a criminal case against the police officers and investigator n. 25. on 16 june 2008 the syktyvdinskiy district court dismissed her appeal. it examined the explanations given by the police officers and investigator n., and held that the allegations regarding the applicant’s ill‑treatment had not been substantiated. the court also noted that the allegation regarding the applicant’s forced confession had been examined during the applicant’s criminal trial and had been dismissed as unfounded in the judgment of 24 april 2008. finally, the court concluded that the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment had been designed to discredit the law‑enforcement authorities. on 18 july 2008 the supreme court of komi upheld that decision on appeal. the applicant appealed against the judgment.
the applicant was born in 1953 and lives in zagreb. in this connection, she underwent further treatment until july 1997, when it was found that her condition was such that she would not recover. the applicant took early retirement on grounds of disability. in september 1998 the applicant urged the zagreb municipal civil court to schedule a hearing in her case. the parties exchanged further submissions in february and march 1999. the applicant submitted an expert report drafted by v.f., according to which her medical condition had notably deteriorated in january 1997. on 27 september 2000 a hearing was held at which the zagreb municipal civil court decided to commission an expert report concerning the circumstances of the applicant’s treatment. produced a report in which he stated that he had found no indications of medical malpractice in the applicant’s treatment. on the basis of an objection by the applicant to j.g. in april 2001 the applicant challenged j.g. ’s findings and asked the zagreb municipal civil court to question the experts at a hearing. on 8 november 2001 a hearing was held for the questioning of the experts, who reiterated their findings. an expert report was commissioned from the university of zagreb medical faculty on 14 january 2002. the university of zagreb medical faculty produced a report on 28 april 2005. it found that the applicant’s facial paralysis was a result of complications during surgery and not medical malpractice. the applicant did not express any objections concerning the report. in september and december 2006 the applicant urged the zagreb municipal civil court to schedule a hearing. they reiterated their findings, according to which the deterioration of the applicant’s condition had been a result of complications during surgery. the doctor who had treated the applicant, would be questioned as a witness. who at the time lived in serbia, had not been properly summoned to appear as a witness. at a hearing on 4 december 2008 the zagreb municipal civil court questioned the applicant. on 7 may 2009 the zagreb municipal civil court commissioned another expert report from d.v. in a report of 8 july 2009 the expert found that there was a direct causal link between the applicant’s condition and her retirement on grounds of disability. on 29 january 2010 the zagreb municipal civil court dismissed the applicant’s civil action, holding that in the case at issue the principle of presumed fault (presumirane krivnje) should be applied. on 17 march 2010 the applicant appealed against that judgment before the zagreb county court (županijski sud u zagrebu) alleging, inter alia, that the medical experts who had drafted the reports had a personal and professional conflict of interest in the proceedings, as they involved allegations of malpractice against their colleagues and the experts were financially dependent on the hospital system. on 14 september 2010 the zagreb county court dismissed the applicant’s appeal as unfounded on the grounds that there was no reason to doubt the quality and findings of the expert reports. on 26 september 2012 the constitutional court declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. the decision of the constitutional court was served on the applicant on 12 october 2012. the decision of the zagreb county court was served on the zagreb municipal civil court on 22 october 2008.
on 26 february 2014 the applicant began to serve a three-year prison sentence. he was placed in zagreb prison hospital (“zph”). he also had two brain arteriovenous malformations, one of which had been removed in february 2013 by means of gamma knife radiosurgery, and the three-year high-risk recovery period had not yet ended. the expert opinion is that two or three years are needed for his brain condition to stabilise after the gamma knife surgery. we consider his request for a stay of his prison term medically justified.” on 18 april 2014 a zagreb county court judge responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the applicant’s request. this decision was based entirely on an opinion given by dr b., an expert in internal medicine and cardiology. on 25 april 2014 the applicant lodged an appeal, in which he argued that since incarceration his medical condition had been deteriorating constantly, that the zph doctors had themselves recommended that his prison sentence be suspended on medical grounds, and that dr b. could not give a proper opinion on his health since he was not an expert in neurology. on 8 july 2014 a three-judge panel of zagreb county court quashed the first-instance decision and instructed the first-instance court to order an expert opinion from a neurologist. the decision was based mainly on the opinion given by dr m., an expert in neurology. on 27 august and 4 september 2014 the applicant lodged appeals, in which he contested the qualifications of dr m. and the validity of her opinion. he also asserted that his medical condition could only be properly treated in a specialist medical institution. following a suggestion by zph that there was no need for the applicant’s further hospitalisation, on 29 september 2014 the head office of the prisons administration ordered his transfer to zagreb prison. he asked for an urgent transfer to a suitable medical institution where a proper diagnostic examination could be carried out. the applicant’s appeal was dismissed on 14 october 2014 by the prisons administration. on 19 november 2014, at his request, the applicant was taken to the sisters of mercy hospital in zagreb so that neurological tests could be carried out. during his transfer in a police van he suffered an epileptic fit and lost consciousness. he spent ten hours at the hospital and was then returned to zagreb prison. on an unspecified date the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the decisions concerning his request for the suspension of his prison sentence and the decision concerning his transfer to zagreb prison. in addition to the complaints put forward in his previous requests and appeals, the applicant also complained that during his eight months at zph he had not had proper access to sanitary facilities and had been obliged to ask the guards to let him out of the room each time he needed the toilet, a request which they sometimes had not answered in time. since there had been no lift at zph, in order to have access to fresh air he had had to climb the stairs to his cell on the second floor, which had been a risk to his health. he further reiterated that zph had no neurology department or even a neurologist, so his condition could not have been properly treated there. even though specialists from the two civil hospitals where he had been treated prior to his imprisonment had recommended that check-ups be carried out every month, he had not been given them. the applicant also complained about the conditions in zagreb prison. there had been no lift, which had prevented him from accessing fresh air. on 5, 9, 15 and 17 january 2015 the applicant was taken to rebro hospital in zagreb. a report drawn up there on 15 january indicates that there was no need for any urgent measures. the county court further relied on zph reports dated 20 and 28 january 2015 stating that the applicant had not been following doctors’ orders, had not been taking measures aimed at his treatment and had been deliberately putting his health at risk. there was no comment on the applicant’s complaints concerning lack of access to daylight and fresh air. this appeal was dismissed by a three-judge panel of the zagreb county court on 21 april 2015.
the applicant was born in 1979 and is currently serving a prison sentence in frolovo, volgograd region. on 17 april 2009 mr k. was found with very serious bodily injuries in the entrance to a block of flats. according to the record of the examination of the scene of the incident, the applicant stated that he had physically assaulted k. and described the circumstances of the crime committed by him against k. at around 9.30 a.m. the applicant was brought to the police station of the krasnoarmeyskiy district of volgograd (увд по красноармейскому району г. according to the applicant, they demanded that he give statements concerning the circumstances of the crime committed by him and subjected him to ill-treatment which the applicant described as follows. having handcuffed him, they punched and kicked him, hitting him with a rubber truncheon and giving him electric shocks using a device called a “tp-50”. the applicant gave the statements as demanded. of the investigating unit of the krasnoarmeyskiy district police department of volgograd initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and his brother. on 20 april 2009 the krasnoarmeyskiy district court ordered his detention on remand. he complained of pain in his chest and in his left knee joint, and of generally feeling unwell. at the hospital he was diagnosed with contusion to the thoracic cage and left wrist, and his condition was assessed as not incompatible with being detained in a pre-trial detention facility. on 21 april 2009 the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention facility sizo-4, where he was examined by the sizo doctor who recorded multiple abrasions and haematomas on his trunk, and contusion to the thoracic cage and left wrist. the applicant was interviewed by the sizo officer. he stated that he had received the injuries as a result of ill-treatment by police officers on 18 april 2009 whilst held at the krasnoarmeyskiy district police department of volgograd. the sizo operative unit carried out an inquiry into the incident and concluded in a report of 22 april 2009 ‒ approved by the acting head of the sizo ‒ that the applicant’s injuries had been inflicted by police officers from the krasnoarmeyskiy district police department at about 11 a.m. on 18 april 2009 during the applicant’s interview. that he would find himself at the hands of those police officers again should he not give “correct” statements. the applicant described the circumstances of his alleged ill-treatment and retracted the statements he had given earlier incriminating his brother. the criminal proceedings against his brother were eventually discontinued for lack of evidence. the applicant reiterated his self-incriminating statements. between 9 may 2009 and 16 june 2010 investigators from the krasnoarmeyskiy district investigative committee issued eight refusals to initiate criminal proceedings into the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment, finding, in accordance with article 24 § 1 (2) of the code of criminal procedure, that none of the elements of the offences provided for in articles 285 and 286 of the criminal code (on abuse of powers) were present in respect of the police officers’ actions. those refusals were overruled by the head or deputy head of the krasnoarmeyskiy district investigative committee as being unlawful, and the investigators were ordered to carry out additional inquiries. on 10 september 2009 the krasnoarmeyskiy district court of volgograd convicted the applicant of manslaughter and sentenced him to nine years and six months’ imprisonment. the applicant was found to have invited the victim to his flat, to have inflicted many injuries on him, then moving the victim to the landing of the stairwell near the applicant’s flat and leaving him there. the applicant pleaded guilty and his confession served as a mitigating factor. the trial court found that the applicant’s injuries had been unrelated to the actions of the victim of the crime and had been sustained after the crime had been committed. according to police officers b., d. and m. ‒ as well as e., the head of the criminal investigating unit of the krasnoarmeyskiy district police department ‒ the applicant had been brought to the police station on suspicion of having inflicted very serious bodily injuries on k. at some point the applicant had been taken from a cell to e.’s office. the police officers had inteviewed the applicant and established the circumstances of the crime against k. according to b., the applicant had complained of pain in his chest, explaining that he had fallen down a flight of stairs. the applicant’s mother stated that on 16 april 2009 she had seen the applicant without any sign of physical injury. in his decision of 11 september 2010 the investigator noted that, while being questioned as a suspect on 18 april 2009, the applicant had explained that he had fallen down a flight of stairs the day before as a result of being in an inebriated state. the investigator further noted that the applicant’s forensic medical examination results indicated that the applicant’s multiple abrasions and haematomas could have come about as a result of blows from hard, blunt objects or collisions with such objects or surfaces – including the applicant falling from his own height. on 2 march 2010 the volgograd regional court upheld the judgment in the applicant’s criminal case on appeal.
the applicant was born in 1987 and lives in vilnius. the court considered that the available evidence (testimonies of witnesses and other suspects and other data collected by the authorities) was sufficient to hold that the applicant may have committed the crimes of which he was suspected. lastly the court noted that the pre-trial investigation was ongoing (see paragraph 40 below) and the remaining investigative actions had to be carried out urgently, so the applicant’s detention was necessary to ensure the unimpeded course of the investigation. the applicant appealed against that decision and asked the court to impose a different restrictive measure. he argued that the allegations against him were unfounded. he stated that he had a permanent place of residence with his parents and that he had been taking care of his sick grandmother, so detaining him would negatively affect his family. however, on 12 january 2010 the vilnius regional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. the vilnius regional court then found that the first-instance court had correctly assessed all the relevant circumstances, and upheld its findings in their entirety. however, on 14 april 2010 the vilnius regional court dismissed the appeal and upheld the lower court’s findings that the applicant might flee, attempt to interfere with the investigation or commit further crimes, that the criminal case was complex, and that the pre-trial investigation was being carried out with due diligence (see paragraph 40 below). on 30 june 2010 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. the court of appeal also held that the applicant might commit further crimes because he was suspected of having committed multiple crimes while participating in a criminal organisation which, allegedly, had been his main source of income. the court of appeal observed that, in accordance with the domestic law, detention on remand could last longer than six months only when the case was especially complex or of a large scale. on 14 september 2010 the vilnius regional court extended the applicant’s detention for a further three months. lastly it noted that over fifty suspects had been arrested in the case and that numerous investigative actions were still being carried out (see paragraph 40 below). on 20 september 2010 the applicant was officially notified that he was suspected of leading a criminal organisation armed with firearms (article 249 § 3 of the criminal code) and possession of a very large amount of narcotic and psychotropic substances with the intention to distribute them (article 260 § 3 of the criminal code). on 3 december 2010 the prosecutor charged the applicant with the aforementioned crimes (see paragraph 16 above), and the case was referred to the vilnius regional court for examination on the merits. he was given a suspended prison sentence of two years and one month. on 5 april 2012 the vilnius regional court upheld the conviction. on 10 march 2011 the vilnius regional court extended the applicant’s detention for a further three months on essentially the same grounds as before (see paragraphs 14, 15 and 18 above). thus, the court of appeal concluded that although the applicant had been detained for a very long time (two years and three months), the complexity and scope of the case made his detention essential for ensuring the unimpeded course of the criminal proceedings. from june to december 2012 the vilnius regional court extended the applicant’s detention every three months and the court of appeal dismissed his subsequent appeals, relying on essentially the same grounds as in previous court decisions (see paragraphs 14, 15, 18, 24 and 26 above). according to the applicant, he complied with all those conditions and soon after his release he found a job as a security guard. it also held that the applicant might commit further crimes because he had allegedly been the leader of a criminal organisation, had been suspected of committing crimes for personal gain, and had had several prior convictions, all of which contributed to a “negative description of his personality” (neigiamai charakterizuoja kaltinamojo asmenybę). in the applicant’s case, the court considered that the scope of the case (twenty-seven defendants and, at that time, eighty-two volumes of case-file material) and the complexity of the investigation justified the applicant’s continued detention. accordingly, the court of appeal extended the detention for three months. on 20 december 2013 the vilnius regional court again found that the applicant had been detained on remand in another criminal case and thus revoked his detention. it relied on essentially the same grounds as the court of appeal in its previous decisions (see paragraphs 33 and 35 above), also noting that the applicant had connections abroad, which might facilitate his absconding. on 15 april 2014 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the findings of the lower court. the applicant appealed against his conviction. according to the latest information submitted to the court, at the time of the present judgment his appeal was still pending.
the applicant was born in 1969 and lives in the town of lyskovo, nizhniy novgorod region. in 2004, after having been injected with a toxic drug, the applicant developed an arterial embolism and had to have his left leg amputated at thigh level. four years later he was certified as having a second-degree disability. on 2 february 2009 during a routine disability-related examination, he was also prescribed a cane. by 2010 the applicant had developed deep-vein thrombosis and post‑phlebitic syndrome of the right leg, a long-term complication of his main condition. on 26 november 2010 the police arrested the applicant on suspicion of drug trafficking. the removal of the prosthesis was not noted in the police records. on the same day the lyskovo district court of the nizhniy novgorod region remanded the applicant in custody. he remained in detention throughout the investigation and trial. after successful surgery the applicant was discharged from the hospital on 30 december 2010. on 13 january 2011 the applicant was examined by an orthopaedic medical board, which established that he needed a prosthesis, crutches, a cane and some other orthopaedic devices. in june 2011 the applicant applied for an examination by a special medical board with a view to determining whether his medical condition warranted early release. on 8 june 2011 the detention authorities wrote to him refusing to arrange the examination. on 23 june 2011 the lyskovo district court convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to imprisonment. three months later the nizhniy novgorod regional court quashed the conviction and ordered a retrial. in a letter dated 13 january 2012 the nizhniy novgorod state orthopedic service, which performs individual adjustment of prostheses, informed the court that such assistance could not be provided in a remand prison given the lack of special equipment there. ten days later an ngo, the committee for civil rights, complained to the lyskovo prosecutor of the poor quality of the applicant’s medical treatment and the authorities’ failure to give him a prosthetic leg. according to the applicant, no reply was received. on 28 april 2012 the district court found the applicant guilty of drug trafficking and sentenced him to five years and six months’ imprisonment. the sentence was upheld on appeal by the regional court and became final on 11 september 2012. the applicant was invited to apply for a special medical examination to determine whether he needed a transtibial prosthesis. according to the applicant, he promptly lodged an application as advised. in november 2012 the applicant was admitted to a prison hospital in nizhniy novgorod on account of an acute infectious inflammation of the leg and venal problems. on 3 december 2012, during his stay in the hospital, the following entry was made in the applicant’s medical file:
“prosthetics refusal record
we, the undersigned, have made the present record to state that [the applicant] has refused prosthetics of the left limb.” (the document was signed by the deputy head and two surgeons of the prison hospital.) ten days later the applicant was discharged from the hospital. at some point the prison authorities requested the applicant’s admission to the prison hospital in order to provide him with a prosthetic leg. on 20 may 2013 the applicant was taken to the hospital. four days later he formally asked the head of the hospital for a prosthetic leg. the applicant was released from detention in november 2014.
the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in athens, greece. she used to visit moldova on holiday every two to three years and she kept an apartment in causeni. on 15 september 2008, after a visit to moldova, the applicant was returning to greece from chisinau airport when she was stopped by customs officers because she had on her twenty-nine pieces of non-identical jewellery such as rings, bracelets, necklaces and pendants. the applicant was wearing seven pieces of the jewellery and the rest were in a jewellery box in her handbag. since the applicant had failed to declare the jewellery, she was taken to the airport police station. she also submitted that the jewellery in question had been brought to moldova from greece. she also submitted that she had not been asked to declare anything by the customs officers. all the jewellery, including the pieces allowed by law to be transported over the border, was seized by the police. the applicant missed her flight and spent two weeks in moldova during which time she went to the police station on several occasions. there she made an official declaration and signed a formal undertaking to appear before the prosecuting authorities and courts when necessary. she informed the authorities about her intention to leave the country and obtained their permission. she also gave her greek address and telephone number. on 1 october 2008 the applicant returned to greece because she could no longer be absent from work. she had no difficulties in leaving the country through the same airport. on 7 october 2008 the chişinău airport police formally initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant for attempted smuggling of jewellery. the offence was considered to be a minor one (infracțiune ușoară) with a maximum penalty of 6,000 moldovan lei (approximately eur 430) or 240 hours community service or imprisonment of two years. subsequently, the applicant was summoned to appear before the investigating authorities via her moldovan address. both of them stated that the applicant was in greece and that they did not know when she intended to return to moldova. it does not appear from the material in the case-file that the prosecutors asked the applicant’s relatives for her contact information in greece or to inform her that she had to appear before them. the reason relied upon by the prosecutors was that the applicant had absconded from prosecution when she left the country on 1 october 2008, in spite of her having given a written undertaking to appear when summoned. a public defender was appointed to represent the applicant. on 19 june 2009 the botanica district court ordered the applicant’s detention for a period of fifteen days. the publicly appointed lawyer did not challenge that decision. on an unspecified date the applicant’s representative lodged a habeas corpus application with the botanica district court in which it was argued, inter alia, that the applicant had not been aware of the criminal proceedings against her, that she had never been summoned to appear before the prosecutor’s office and that she had not been informed that she could not leave the country. the appeal was dismissed by the chişinău court of appeal on 30 september 2010. as a result, the applicant was arrested in greece and held in detention pending extradition proceedings for a period of twenty-three days. in the documents ordering the applicant’s arrest and detention, the greek authorities made specific reference to the detention order issued by the botanica district court on 19 june 2009 (see paragraph 12 above). the extradition proceedings ended on 21 september 2011 when the athens court of appeal rejected the moldovan authorities’ extradition request and ordered the applicant’s release from detention. in the absence of any such agreement between moldova and greece, the extradition request could not be upheld. it appears that the applicant has not returned to moldova ever since.

the applicants were born in 1971 and 1974 respectively and live in sesvete. on 12 december 1996 at about 8.30 p.m. one d.m., and one other person died and the second applicant was gravely injured. the first applicant, who worked in a nearby flower shop, came to the scene and found the second applicant lying on the floor, covered in blood. the report drawn up by them indicates that d.m. the relevant part of the report reads:
“on 12 december 1996 at about 8.30 p.m. at the n. pizza parlour ... soldier d.m. was consuming alcoholic beverages at the bar in the company of d.ma., an employee of the judicial police) and ž.b. who put it on the counter saying ‘what would i need this for?’, seeing that the grenade had been activated, took it in his right hand and turned sideways from the counter, after which an explosion occurred. [ sustained grievous bodily injuries and ž.b. ... the injured were transferred to dubrava hospital and d.ma. on 1 july 1998 the applicants brought a civil action against the state in the zagreb municipal court. during the proceedings it was established that the second applicant had sustained numerous injuries to his head, face, chest, belly and lower extremities and that he was suffering from permanent consequences, such as frequent headaches, pain throughout his body, impaired hearing, double vision, fatigue and incapacity for work. that judgment was quashed by the zagreb county court on 25 april 2005. the first-instance court again allowed the claim on 17 september 2010. however, on 5 april 2011 the zagreb county court, after an appeal lodged by the defendant, overturned the judgment and dismissed the applicants’ claim. the relevant part of that judgment reads:
“the first-instance court established the following:
- d.m. was a member of the croatian army – a military serviceman;
- d.m. had the correct check (for which the military police were responsible under section 14 of the above-mentioned instruction) [been exercised in respect of] the carrying of weapons – namely the grenade [held by d.m.] the damage most likely would not have occurred. however, this court considers that these facts, as established [by the first-instance court], do not serve as a sufficient basis for concluding that the requirements for the defendant to be held liable for the concrete damage have been met. ’s parents’ right to obtain a survivor’s pension on the basis of a decision of the croatian pension fund is not decisive for the defendant’s liability for damage since the right to a survivor’s pension was obtained on the basis of d.m. ’s status as a croatian homeland war veteran – that is to say an insured military person. was not on duty on the critical evening; that the m-75 grenade was not given to him by his military unit ([according to] a letter from the i croatian guard corps of 12 november 1998); that the record of the on-site inspection carried out on the day of [d.m. lastly, this court considers ... in respect of the failure of the defendant to carry out a check on the carrying of weapons and to seize [weapons] where there is no licence [to carry them], as the basis of the defendant’s liability, that there is no proof ... that the military police had a duty to carry out a check in the pizza parlour in question on the critical evening or that the competent authorities knew that d.m. possessed a grenade and failed to seize it from him. therefore, this court finds that the requirements for the defendant’s liability are not met ...” 11. the applicants’ subsequent constitutional complaint of 7 july 2011 was dismissed on 17 june 2014. this decision was served on the applicants on 3 july 2014.
the applicant was born in 1975 and is detained in sofia prison. on the same day the burgas investigation department instigated criminal proceedings against a person or persons unknown for armed robbery and homicide. on 3 october 1999 the applicant was arrested in sofia. none of the case papers indicate whether he received a copy of the 9 july 1999 order after his arrest. he remained in detention in sofia that day and the next. his detention was extended by a prosecutor that same day. at noon, assisted by his officially appointed lawyer, the applicant was formally charged with the double murder and the hold-up in the bureau de change in burgas. during his questioning in the presence of that lawyer on 12 october 1999 he remained silent and stated that he would give evidence at a later date. he admitted that he had prepared and committed the hold-up at the bureau de change and claimed that the two victims had been killed by a.s. on 4 january 2000 the applicant and a.s., on 16 february 2000 the burgas regional prosecutor returned the file to the investigator for further inquiries. on the same day the two suspects were questioned in the presence of their lawyers. the regional court considered the criminal case between 25 july 2000 and 14 june 2001. who was a close relative of the owner and an employee in the same establishment. the two individuals thus charged had been advised that their statements could be used in court with a view to establishing the facts, and their prior medical examination had revealed no sign of physical violence, which contradicted the defence lawyer’s allegation that the applicant’s initial confession had been extracted from him. the court of appeal turned its attention to the applicant’s version of events to the effect that the two murders and the robbery had been committed by a certain v., an iranian national, and that the applicant himself had been at his place of work in sofia at the material time. the factual and legal findings of the regional court had not been exclusively based on the accused’s confessions but on the whole body of consistent evidence gathered during the criminal proceedings. at the time his client had been assisted by an officially appointed lawyer who had not been nominated by the local bar association, as required by the applicable legislation. by a judgment of 17 december 2003 the supreme court of cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law. the applicant had had an opportunity to defend himself effectively during the criminal proceedings: he had given evidence and challenged the evidence against him. he was incarcerated in burgas prison from 27 january 2000 to the beginning of march 2000, and again from 14 april 2000 to 25 february 2004. the premises had had poor ventilation and lighting. m. it had contained a bed and a metal rack. there had been neither running water nor a toilet in his cell. the applicant was not involved in any organised activities in burgas prison. he had board and lodging in accordance with normal prison standards. m. there had been no running water in the cell and the prisoners had used a bucket as a toilet. he had been allowed to attend the prison chapel twice a year, at easter and christmas, although not during worship so that he would not meet other prisoners. m., with a bed, a table, a rack, a shower and a private toilet. his application was dismissed with final effect by a judgment of 14 september 2011 delivered by the supreme administrative court, which found that the impugned provisions of the implementing regulations were not contrary to the prisons act and that the adoption of the regulations had not involved any irregularities justifying their being declared void.
on the night of 25 july 2009 traffic police stopped the applicant’s car. following the applicant’s failure to produce his driving licence and suspecting that it had been withdrawn, police officers took him to the duty unit of the ezhvinskiy district police station, where he was kept in a cell for administrative detainees until the following morning. a record of the applicant’s administrative arrest was drawn up. on 26 july 2009 the justice of the peace of the vezhdinskiy court circuit of the ezhvinskiy district found the applicant guilty of driving a vehicle after the withdrawal of his driving licence (an administrative offence under article 12.7 § 2 of the russian code of administrative offences) and sentenced him to fifteen days of administrative detention. on 31 july 2009 the applicant made a written request to the head of the detention unit seeking a family visit. the next day the request was returned to the applicant bearing a handwritten note by the acting head of the detention unit, mr s., which stated that family visits were not “provided for [by law]”. on 14 august 2009 the applicant’s representative lodged a complaint with the syktyvkar town court, alleging that the applicant’s right to family life guaranteed by article 8 of the convention had been unlawfully restricted. the police officials filed a written objection, arguing that the internal rules governing detention facilities for administrative detainees did not provide administrative detainees with the right to have a family visit. on 15 september 2009 the syktyvkar city court dismissed the applicant’s complaint, having accepted the police authorities’ argument that administrative detainees were not entitled to a family visit under the domestic law in force and that the applicant had been subjected to those limitations of his rights as a negative consequence of the administrative detention. relying on the court’s judgments in the cases of messina v. italy (no. 25498/94, § 61, echr 2000‑x) and vlasov v. russia (no. 78146/01, § 123, 12 june 2008), he argued that the authorities’ assistance in maintaining contact with close family was an essential part of a detainee’s right to respect for family life. limitations imposed on the number of family visits constituted an interference with the applicant’s rights under article 8 of the convention. restrictions of that kind could only be applied “in accordance with the law”, should pursue one or more legitimate aims and, in addition, should be justified as being “necessary in a democratic society”. the representative submitted that there was no norm in russian law imposing restrictions on family visits for administrative detainees. on 22 october 2009 the supreme court of the komi republic upheld the city court’s decision, having reasoned as follows:
“there is no prohibition on family visits for administrative detainees. ...
[at the same time] a refusal to authorise a family visit has a basis in russian law; however, it should be warranted by circumstances and conditions providing the competent authorities with the right to apply the disputed restriction. providing law‑enforcement bodies with unlimited powers in issues pertaining to fundamental rights could run contrary to the superior role of the law and could result in arbitrary interference with human rights. in the case under examination, there are no grounds for concluding that the actions of the acting head [of the detention unit of the police station where the applicant had been detained] were unlawful because, having applied for a family visit, [the applicant] had not indicated whom he had wanted to see and what the relationship was between him and that person. if those important details are not provided, the authorisation of a family visit cannot be considered lawful.”
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in bela crkva. he was employed by “betonjerka”- dp, a socially-owned company based in bela crkva (hereinafter “the debtor”). on 20 may 2003 the bela crkva municipal court ordered the debtor to pay the applicant specified amounts on account of salary arrears and social insurance contributions, plus the costs of the civil proceedings. on the same day this judgment became final. on 14 october 2003 upon the applicant’s request to that effect, the bela crkva municipal court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor to pay the applicant the enforcement costs. the government in its observations maintained that the said judgment had been fully enforced by the domestic decisions of 2 december 2004, 4 november 2005 and 19 may 2006 respectively. the applicant did not contest this submission. on 10 february 2009 the bela crkva municipal court ordered the debtor to pay the applicant other specified amounts on account of salary arrears and social insurance contributions. in addition the domestic court ordered each party to pay its own costs of the civil proceedings. this judgment became final on 18 february 2009. on 30 april 2009 upon the applicant’s request to that effect, the bela crkva municipal court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor to pay the applicant the enforcement costs. the said decision remains unenforced to the present date. on 12 may 2009 the pančevo commercial court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor. on 22 september 2009, upon a submission to that effect, the pančevo commercial court recognized the applicant’s respective claims. on 27 august 2012 the pančevo commercial court terminated the insolvency proceedings against the debtor, having decided to continue with the insolvency action against the debtor’s estate. the insolvency proceedings are still pending. on 8 august 2013 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal complaining firstly about the fairness of the insolvency proceedings. further, he requested the constitutional court to adopt a decision obliging the respondent state to pay from its own funds his unpaid salaries. in particular, the applicant had referred only to the judgment which had been adopted in his favour on 10 february 2009. in so doing, the applicant also relied on the court’s case-law related to the non-enforcement of domestic court decision rendered against socially-owned companies in serbia. on 31 march 2015 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal finding that it is not vested with the power of the insolvency court to enable the payments of the claims recognized in the insolvency proceedings.
the applicant was born in 1960 and lives in vienna. he worked as a civil servant for the ministry of economics and labour (bundesministerium für wirtschaft und arbeit). on 23 august 2004 the disciplinary prosecutor (disziplinaranwalt) of the ministry of economics and labour reported to the disciplinary council (disziplinarkommission) of the ministry of economics and labour that it suspected the applicant of having committed disciplinary offences. the report indicated that the applicant had been working on a project for the implementation of an electronic administration system for foreign trade since 2001. the disciplinary prosecutor accused the applicant of not having conducted an award procedure (vergabeverfahren). furthermore, the applicant had allegedly placed orders without consulting the ministry and asking for permission beforehand. he had thereby caused damage amounting to around 200,000 euros (eur). furthermore, he had disobeyed orders from the ministry and subsequently tampered with the files. he had therefore breached his official duties (verletzung der dienstpflicht). in his submissions of 7 september 2004, the applicant contested these accusations. it held that the authority had only learned about the applicant’s offences on 1 july 2004 and therefore prosecution had not become time-barred. on 25 january 2005 the disciplinary council decided to institute disciplinary proceedings against the applicant. on 7 april 2005 the appeals commission dismissed the applicant’s appeal against this decision. on 11 october 2005, the vienna public prosecutor informed the applicant that criminal investigations against him on the grounds of suspected embezzlement had been discontinued. on 15 march 2006 the constitutional court (verfassungsgerichtshof) dismissed the applicant’s complaint against the appeals commission’s decision of 7 april 2005 (see paragraph 10 above). meanwhile, on 20 december 2005, the disciplinary council had decided to summon the applicant to an oral hearing and specified the offences of which he was accused, namely the breach of official duties. meanwhile, on 1, 24 and 27 march 2006 the applicant had lodged three requests for the re-opening of the disciplinary proceedings on issues which had already been decided by the authorities at previous stages. on 7 april 2006 the ministry of economics and labour ex officio placed the applicant in retirement as from 1 may 2006. it held that the applicant was suffering from a personality disorder, was not able to exercise his official duties and was therefore unfit for service. on 20 july 2006 the appeals commission rejected the applicant’s request for re-opening of 24 march 2006 (see paragraph 16 above). it found several procedural errors and ordered the disciplinary council to appoint a psychiatric expert to establish whether the applicant could be held accountable for his actions. on 9 january 2007 the appeals commission rejected the application for transfer of jurisdiction to the superior authority and on 15 march 2007 it dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the disciplinary council’s decision of 5 september 2006 (see paragraph 21 above). meanwhile, on 23 october 2007, the administrative court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of the ministry of economics and labour of 7 april 2006, and the applicant’s compulsory retirement became final (see paragraph 17 above). on 20 june 2008 the disciplinary council again convicted the applicant of breach of official duties and imposed as punishment the loss of all his rights. thereupon the disciplinary council held oral hearings on 27 april, 5 and 18 may, 3, 4 and 10 june and 1 july 2009. on 1 july 2009 the disciplinary council decided that the applicant was not guilty of having committed a breach of his official duties. the disciplinary prosecutor appealed against this decision. subsequently, the disciplinary prosecutor filed a complaint with the administrative court (verwaltungsgerichtshof). this decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 3 august 2010. by judgment of the vienna court of appeal of 25 may 2011 concerning the official liability proceedings instituted by the applicant, he was awarded eur 4,608, corresponding to the costs of his appeals against the disciplinary council’s decisions of 28 june 2006 and 20 june 2008 (see paragraphs 19 and 26 above), which were both quashed by the appeals commission due to procedural errors and lack of reasoning (see paragraphs 22 and 27 above).
the state authorities reclaimed the flats, and the applicants’ title to the real property in question was annulled. the flat at 21-110 belovezhskaya ulitsa, moscow, was owned by k. on 5 january 2005 k. died intestate with no surviving kin. on 18 may 2005 m. bought the flat from a person acting on k.’s behalf by virtue of a power of attorney. on 28 october 2005 m. sold the flat to o. 8. on 19 april 2006 v. sold the flat to the applicant and his minor daughter. on an unspecified date the police opened an investigation into the fraudulent sale of the flat after k.’s death. on 30 january 2008 the police informed the moscow department of housing policy and housing fund (the housing department) about the investigation. on an unspecified date the housing department brought an action against the applicant seeking the transfer of the title to the flat to the city of moscow and the applicant’s eviction. on 18 december 2012 the kuntsevskiy district court of moscow granted the housing department’s claims in full. the court established that k. had died intestate with no surviving kin and that the flat should have been considered bona vacantia. on 16 may 2013 the city court refused to allow the applicants’ cassation appeal. on 14 august 2013 the supreme court of the russian federation refused to allow the applicants’ second cassation appeal. on 24 december 2013 the city of moscow had its title to the flat registered. the flat at 10-1-339, orekhoviy bulvar, moscow, was owned by s. on 29 july 2009 s. died intestate with no surviving kin. on 16 april 2010 an unidentified person sold the flat to b. 20. on 10 june 2010 b. sold the flat to k., the applicant’s father. on 15 april 2011 the nagatinskiy district court of moscow approved a friendly settlement agreement between the applicant and her father recognising the applicant’s title to the flat. on 21 october 2011 the police opened an investigation into the fraudulent sale of the flat after s.’s death. on 29 february 2012 the police informed the housing department about the investigation. on 14 november 2013 the city court upheld the judgment of 19 june 2013 on appeal. according to the applicant, the judgment in the city’s favour has not been enforced and the applicant continues to reside in the flat. the flat at 33-31, stremyanniy pereulok, moscow, had been owned by n., who died intestate with no surviving kin on 14 april 2006. on an unspecified date p. and other unidentified persons forged n.’s will, naming p. as n.’s heir. on 6 february 2007 the registration board registered the flat purchase and issued the respective deed to the first applicant. the applicants moved into the flat and resided there. on an unspecified date the authorities opened a criminal investigation concerning the forgery of the will issued on behalf of n. 35. the court also found that the flat was bona vacantia which therefore vested in the state and, by having fraudulently acquired title to it and then sold it to the first applicant, p. had caused damage to the state. on 26 may 2014 the zamoskvoretskiy district court of moscow granted the housing department’s claims. it appears that the judgment in the city’s favour has not been enforced to date. the applicants continue to reside in the flat.

the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in samobor. on 20 april 2009 she sustained an injury in a car accident while returning home from work. on 8 may 2009 her injury was recognised as a work-related injury by the croatian health insurance fund for health protection at work (hrvatski zavod za zdravstveno osiguranje zaštite zdravlja na radu). on the basis of her work-related injury the applicant was granted sick leave between 21 april 2009 and 3 july 2009. on 26 october 2011 the applicant visited the emergency medicine centre of the university hospital centre zagreb (centar za hitnu medicinu kliničkog bolničkog centra zagreb) owing to the pain in her neck and back. there it was established that she was suffering from a severely sore spine with a deformity. on 3 november 2011 the applicant lodged a complaint against her general practitioner’s assessment of the reason for her sick leave. she argued that she should be granted sick leave entitlement on the basis of the work-related injury that she had sustained on 20 april 2009. she submitted medical documentation in support of her argument. following the lodging of the complaint, the applicant’s general practitioner referred the applicant for an expert medical evaluation, enclosing her medical documentation with the request for expert evaluation. on 6 december 2011 an authorised doctor of the zagreb office of the croatian health insurance fund (hrvatski zavod za zdravstveno osiguranje, područni ured zagreb – hereinafter “the zagreb office”), specialised in physical medicine and rehabilitation, examined the applicant’s medical documentation and reported finding no direct causal link between the work-related injury sustained by the applicant in 2009 and the sick leave she had begun on 27 october 2011. the zagreb office forwarded the report to the applicant and informed her of her right to seek the delivery of a written decision on the matter of her sick leave entitlement. the applicant availed herself of that right and asked for a written decision. by a decision of 23 january 2012 the zagreb office, relying on the report of 6 december 2011, refused the applicant’s request that the sick leave from 27 october 2011 be granted on the basis of her work-related injury. it also dismissed her claim for compensation for lost salary during the period of sick leave. following the appeal by the applicant, the central office asked an in-house medical commission to conduct an expert examination regarding the matter. on 16 march 2012 the medical commission, consisting of three doctors of medicine, examined the applicant’s overall medical documentation and reported that her sick leave from 27 october 2011 could not be granted on the basis of the work-related injury that she had sustained in 2009. the applicant then brought an administrative action in the zagreb administrative court (upravni sud u zagrebu). she requested that she be heard and that an expert medical report on the matter be obtained. on 27 june 2012 the central office submitted a response to the applicant’s administrative action. this response was forwarded to the applicant. on 27 august 2012 the zagreb administrative court held a public hearing, to which the applicant was duly summoned. she did not attend the hearing, but was represented by a lawyer. her lawyer reiterated the arguments adduced and evidence proposed in the administrative action. the representative of the central office contested this. the zagreb administrative court then dismissed the proposal to hear the applicant and to obtain a further expert medical report on the matter and closed the hearing. on 31 august 2012 the zagreb administrative court dismissed the applicant’s action as unfounded. it stressed, in particular, that two expert medical bodies of the fund, as well as the applicant’s chosen general practitioner, had established without a doubt that the applicant’s sick leave beginning on 27 october 2011 was not linked to the work-related injury she had sustained in 2009. on 6 february 2013 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as manifestly ill-founded. this decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 22 february 2013.
the applicant was born in 1961 and lives in beveren. the proactive investigation included using the special investigative method of infiltration. on 1 august 2006 the public prosecutor also authorised the use of the special investigative method of observation. pursuant to articles 47septies § 1 and 47nonies § 1 cic, a separate confidential case file was established (see paragraphs 47-49 below). the proactive investigation continued until 17 september 2008. on that date a report was drawn up by the police officer in charge summarising all the evidence gathered, summarising all the evidence gather in the framework of the proactive investigation. that report was followed by two more reports on 18 september 2008, one on the infiltration and the other on the observation operation, describing the evidence specifically gathered by means of those two special investigative measures. the three reports were added to the criminal file, which was subsequently to be made accessible to the defendants. by two decisions issued on 18 september 2008 the public prosecutor confirmed that authorisations had been given for both the observation and the infiltration operations. a “traditional” reactive investigation ensued, conducted by the investigating judge. in addition to the observation and infiltration operations, recourse was had to phone-tapping and international mutual legal assistance. a report drawn up on 25 september 2008 by the police officer in charge mentioned information on the existence of a criminal organisation which had served as the grounds for using observation and infiltration at the proactive search stage, as well as the confirmations obtained in the framework of the said special investigative measures. the investigation remained under the oversight and authority of the hasselt investigating judge. the observation and infiltration operations ended on 14 june 2009. subsequently, several defendants, including the applicant, were invited to present their case, assisted by their lawyers. it was thus found, on the one hand, that the overview of the case had been sufficiently established, and on the other, that sufficiently serious indications had been obtained to instigate a reactive investigation. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of 24 june 2010. that appeal was dismissed by judgment of the court of cassation on 21 september 2010. relying on article 6 of the convention, the applicant complained that the criminal file contained neither the report on the basis of which the public prosecutor had instigated a proactive investigation on 10 may 2006 nor the documents relating to that proactive investigation. on 16 march 2011 the applicant was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment and fined 137,500 euros by the hasselt court of first instance for drug trafficking, involvement in an international criminal organisation and money laundering. in the present case this aspect is especially important given that the infiltration continued over several years and that friendly links had grown up between the agents and several defendants and their partners. during the preliminary investigation photographs of the undercover agents were apparently published on the internet to alert others to their undercover status. the [applicant] and the second defendant only wish to put questions to the undercover agent billy concerning the recovery of the debit indicator allegedly thrown away by the [applicant]. the indictments division, which is an independent tribunal, held that the reports corresponded to the confidential file. this information shows that there was no incitement to crime. as he had done before the court of first instance, the applicant had requested that the court of appeal allow a face-to-face meeting with the undercover agents in order to assess the reliability of their statements. it added that it only ascribed relative evidentiary value to the statements of the undercover agents, and that the truth and proof of guilt had also been established on the basis of other evidence. before the trial court, the defendant can also draw on the criminal file to put forward any legal arguments he may wish against the investigative methods used. the ground of appeal accordingly has no basis in law.” as regards the face-to-face meeting with the undercover agents, the court of cassation primarily adduced the following:
“article 6 § 3 (d) of the [convention] secures the defendant’s right to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf; that provision does not prevent the judge from using his unfettered discretion to assess the necessity and relevance of hearing a witness who has been requested and to reject such request, unless that rejection violated the parties’ right to present evidence.
the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in bratislava. he is and at the relevant time was a supreme court judge. the judicial council of the slovak republic is the supreme governing body of the judiciary in slovakia. it has eighteen members, including its president (section 3(1) of the judicial council act (law no. under article 141a of the constitution (law no. as applicable at the relevant time, the president of the supreme court automatically held the office of the president of the judicial council. of the remaining seventeen members, eight were elected by judges and three were appointed by each the national council of slovakia, the president of slovakia, and the government of slovakia. on 8 september 2009, sitting it the above mentioned composition, the judicial council decided under section 22(1) and (2) of the judges and assessor judges act (law no. as amended – “the act”) to suspend (dočasné pozastavenie výkonu funkcie sudcu) the applicant in the exercise of his function with immediate effect. this decision followed another decision of the judicial council taken on the same day under section 120(2)(c) of the act to file disciplinary charges against the applicant. the accusation was that the applicant had committed what was classified as a “serious disciplinary offence” by failing to comply with his duties, such as abstaining from behaviour which might cast doubt on the respectability of his judicial office, abiding by the principles of judicial ethics and enhancing the good reputation of the judiciary. in particular, reference was made to the fact that the applicant (i) had filed a criminal complaint accusing the president of the supreme court of abuse of authority, and (ii) had publicly stated that the distribution of cases at the supreme court had been modified with a view to allowing its president to influence the outcome of proceedings. under section 22(7) of the act, the decision to suspend him entailed a 50% reduction in the applicant’s salary for the duration of the disciplinary proceedings. the same provision prevented him from spending time at the workplace, with the exception of time which was necessary for asserting his rights in relation to the administration of human resources. under section 22(5) of the act, the suspension could last at most two years. on 25 november 2009 the constitutional court declared the complaint inadmissible. as to the applicant’s submission to the judicial council, its president responded to it in a letter of 27 january 2010 informing the applicant that the law did not allow for decisions of the council to be challenged by means of appeals to the council and that its decisions were reviewable by administrative tribunals. the courts found that the decision to suspend the applicant had been of a preliminary nature, that it had not amounted to a determination of his rights with final effect, and that as such it had no bearing on his fundamental rights and freedoms. in such circumstances, the decision was excluded from judicial review under article 248 (a) of the code of civil procedure (law no. on 17 june 2011 the applicant lodged a fresh complaint with the constitutional court, alleging a breach of article 6 § 1 of the convention on account of the ordinary courts’ decisions, as detailed above. on 7 december 2011 the constitutional court declared the applicant’s complaint of 17 june 2011 inadmissible as being manifestly ill‑founded. it held that the supreme court had given sound reasons for its decision, and its decision was not arbitrary or otherwise contrary to the applicant’s right to a fair hearing. according to a communication from the judicial council dated 6 august 2016, submitted and relied on by the government, the applicant had addressed various submissions to the council, but had never requested it to lift his temporary suspension, pursuant to section 22(5) of the act (as applicable at the relevant time – see paragraph 24 below). the disciplinary charges against the applicant fell to be determined by the supreme court, sitting as a disciplinary tribunal. in accordance with a legislative amendment which took effect on 1 may 2011, the minister of justice became a party to pending disciplinary proceedings against judges which had been initiated by the judicial council. on 9 may 2011 the minister of justice withdrew the application to discipline the applicant. on that ground the supreme court discontinued the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant on 13 may 2011. the applicant challenged that decision by way of an appeal, only to withdraw it on 11 august 2011. the decision thus became final on 27 september 2011. the part of the applicant’s salary that was retained from him during the time of his suspension (see paragraph 10 above) was restored to him in july 2012.
the first applicant, mr kęstutis matiošaitis, was born on 3 february 1961 and is serving a life sentence at lukiškės prison (lukiškių tardymo izoliatorius – kalėjimas) in vilnius. the supreme court thus changed the applicant’s sentence from the death penalty to life imprisonment. the applicant started serving his life sentence nearly twenty four years ago, in june 1993. in may 2003 a new criminal code came into force. as from 2007 the applicant had been working in prison, but on 31 march 2009 he refused to work, explaining in writing that he would not work with prisoners belonging to a lower caste. his plea was rejected by the pardon commission at its meeting on 29 january 2013. in august 2014 the applicant submitted a request to lukiškės prison administration, stating that he would like to obtain vocational training (mokytis profesinėje mokykloje). by a judgment of 20 december 1993 the supreme court found the applicant guilty of aggravated murder for mercenary reasons, illegal possession of firearms and other crimes. his behaviour while in prison had been positive. the third applicant, mr stanislovas katkus, was born on 26 october 1956 and is currently serving a life sentence in lukiškės prison. he was sentenced to life imprisonment and all his property was confiscated. according to the government, the conviction was upheld by the higher courts. in a final decision of 5 december 2003, the court of appeal took into account the fact that, as noted in the court decision convicting the applicant, he had committed the crimes in cold blood (šaltakraujiškai), those crimes had had particularly grave consequences for society, and the applicant had two prior convictions. the applicant has been serving his sentence for eighteen years, since march 1999. even in his character report for 2008 the applicant was described as having no remorse about the crimes he had committed and had not made any serious resolutions. it was also relevant that until march 2011 the applicant had remained on a list of persons likely to attempt to escape (linkusių pabėgti asmenų įskaita). the courts thus held that it was not yet possible to conclude that the applicant had really changed and that therefore it was safe to make the conditions of serving his sentence less strict by transferring him to a correctional home. he also maintained good social contacts with his family. the fifth applicant, mr rolandas lenkaitis, was born on 31 december 1973 and is currently serving a life sentence in pravieniškės correctional institution. however, with regard to the crime of murder, the court found no reason to change the life imprisonment sentence. on 14 april 1995 the šiauliai regional court found him guilty of aggravated murder and theft. following the adoption of the new criminal code, the applicant asked the court to reclassify his crimes and to commute his sentence. the other prisoner survived only because he ran away and called for help. the applicant’s yearly character assessment for 2012 showed that he had taken part in social rehabilitation and recreation (užimtumo) programmes for convicts. he had received no disciplinary punishments, but had been commended twice. by a ruling of 14 may 2015 the vilnius regional administrative court refused to accept the request for examination. he started serving his life sentence seven years ago, in march 2010. he worked in the lukiškės prison and had been commended once. he had taken part in individual and collective discussions, but without showing much interest. after having served ten years in prison, they could ask for a milder detention regime – to be transferred to a correctional home.
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in szajol. the couple had one daughter, r.ó, born on 23 march 1994. on 24 march 2006 the couple divorced and agreed on custody of the child and other parental rights. moved out of the former family home and took up residence in budapest. the applicant could exercise contact on 25 and 26 june and 24 july 2006. however, his daughter was reluctant to stay with him during the summer holidays and preferred to spend her holidays with her grandparents. the applicant applied to the szolnok county guardianship authority to have the contact agreement enforced. in a decision of 11 september 2006 it ordered ms n.r. given the strained relationship between the parents, a notary initiated child protection proceedings (védelembe vétel) on 27 december 2006. subsequently, on a number of occasions ms n.r. was fined for not complying with the agreement. it appears from the case file that the applicant could exercise contact between 10 july 2007 and 10 november 2008. brought an action seeking to change the applicant’s contact rights and an increase in the amount of child allowance. in a counterclaim the applicant requested that the child be placed in his custody. the applicant also filed a criminal complaint against ms n.r. the court based its judgment on an expert opinion finding that the child should have had an adaptation period to re-establish her relationship with her father. the court dismissed the applicant’s claim concerning custody, stating that the child’s wishes had to be taken into account, given that she was now fourteen years of age. on 19 november 2008 the jász-nagykun-szolnok county regional court upheld the first-instance judgment in essence but amended the applicant’s contact rights to every other saturday between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. until 31 may 2009, and all weekend-long visits every other weekend as of 1 june 2009. in 2009 the applicant failed to turn up at numerous scheduled meetings for months, for which he was fined huf 10,000 (approximately eur 35). in 2010 the applicant’s contact rights and the amount of child allowance were subject to further litigation. on 29 january 2010 the szolnok district court dismissed an action brought by him seeking to decrease the amount of child allowance, and a review of the way contact should be exercised. the court established that since the court decision of 19 november 2008, no contact had taken place between the applicant and his daughter and, despite a request by the applicant, the guardianship authority had taken no steps to implement the judgment on the grounds that he had made no efforts to resolve the conflict with his daughter. in particular, he had paid no heed to her request to travel by public transport instead of in his car. in a final judgment of 15 april 2010 the jász-nagykun-szolnok county regional court reviewed the applicant’s parental rights, granting him contact every other weekend on the condition that the daughter, who was by now already 16 years old, be allowed to visit him by herself. the court dismissed the applicant’s request for a decrease in the child allowance. the applicant lodged a petition for review with the supreme court. it appears from the case file that meetings between the applicant and his daughter only took place sporadically in 2010 and did not happen at all in 2011, despite the applicant lodging numerous enforcement requests with the guardianship authority. in 2011 the applicant requested that the jász-nagykun-szolnok guardianship authority and all subordinate guardianship authorities be excluded from any further proceedings for bias. the applicant lodged a number of requests seeking to end his obligation to pay child allowance, which were finally accepted by the budapest iv and xv district court on 10 october 2012 and on appeal by the budapest high court on 3 september 2013. nonetheless, an additional request by him for the reimbursement of the child allowance he had already paid was dismissed at both levels of jurisdiction.
the applicant was born in 1948 and lives in rešetari. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. in 1978 the applicant was employed by the z.b. he worked as a driver in the company’s nova gradiška branch. after organisational changes within the company he was given notice of dismissal on 14 february 2000. pursuant to the notice his employment was terminated on 20 november 2000. on 27 november 2000 the applicant applied to the croatian employment bureau’s regional office in slavonski brod (hrvatski zavod za zapošljavanje, područna služba slavonski brod, hereinafter “the slavonski brod bureau”), for unemployment benefit. the applicant then received unemployment benefit on a regular basis until 31 march 2008. on 11 january 2001 the applicant’s employer brought a counterclaim and asked the court to set 20 november 2000 as the day of the termination of his employment (sudski raskid ugovora o radu). on 5 october 2005 it also sought reimbursement of the severance pay the applicant had received. on 23 january 2007 the nova gradiška municipal court ruled that the applicant’s dismissal from work had been unlawful and that his employment had never been terminated. it ordered the applicant’s reinstatement and awarded him compensation for lost salary. at the same time it ordered the applicant to reimburse the severance pay he had received, and dismissed the remainder of the employer’s counterclaim. on 15 february 2008 the slavonski brod county court (županijski sud u slavonskom brodu) reversed the first-instance judgment in the part ordering the applicant’s reinstatement and decided that his employment had been terminated on 23 january 2007. the judgment was served on the applicant on 5 march 2008. on 30 april 2008 the applicant applied to the slavonski brod bureau for unemployment benefit for the period after 23 january 2007. on 2 june 2008 the slavonski brod bureau rejected the applicant’s claim, finding that it had been lodged outside the time-limit from the termination of his employment on 23 january 2007, as provided by section 31 of the job placement and unemployment insurance act (hereinafter “the job placement act”). the applicant appealed to the central service of the croatian employment bureau (hrvatski zavod za zapošljavanje, središnja služba, hereinafter “the central bureau”). it also noted that the applicant himself had informed the slavonski brod bureau of the outcome of the labour dispute, and had communicated with one of its officials on 27 march 2008 and 2 april 2008. he had also been informed of the consequences of the slavonski brod county court judgment setting 23 january 2007 as the day of the termination of his employment. on 20 january 2011 the administrative court dismissed the applicant’s administrative claim and upheld the administrative authorities’ decisions. a subsequent constitutional complaint by the applicant was dismissed by the constitutional court on 4 april 2012. the decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 9 may 2012. on 21 november 2008 the slavonski brod bureau found that the applicant had not been due unemployment benefit from 21 november 2000 to 31 march 2008. on 16 july 2013 the central bureau upheld the decision of the slavonski brod bureau, save in the part concerning the start of the deadline for the applicant having to pay back the money. in particular, it ordered him to reimburse the funds within 15 days of the receipt of his compensation for lost salary. on 12 september 2014 the osijek administrative court dismissed an administrative claim by the applicant and upheld the administrative authorities’ decisions. in june 2008 the applicant applied to the croatian pension fund (hrvatski zavod za mirovinsko osiguranje, hereinafter “the fund”), to obtain an early retirement pension. on 18 august 2008 the fund granted him an early retirement pension of hrk 1,890.53 per month[2] from 11 july 2008. the applicant has been receiving that pension since.
the applicant was born in 1982 and lives in tiraspol. the background to the case, including the transdniestrian armed conflict of 1991-1992 and the subsequent events, is set out in ilaşcu and others v. moldova and russia ([gc], no. 48787/99, §§ 28-185, echr 2004‑vii) and catan and others v. the republic of moldova and russia ([gc], nos. 43370/04 and 2 others, §§ 8-42, echr 2012 (extracts)). on 21 january 2005 the applicant was arrested by the authorities of the break-away “moldavian republic of transdniestria” (the “mrt”) on charges of robbery. he was detained in custody until 8 july 2005 when he was released on bail. during detention he was allegedly detained in very poor conditions with persons with hiv and subjected to ill-treatment. he claims that a doctor infected him with hiv after using the same syringe on all the inmates. during the criminal proceedings, two and a half years after the robbery, the victim of the robbery was asked to identify the applicant from a picture. the applicant claims that no procedural guarantees were in place and suggests that the investigator indicated to the victim which picture to choose. moreover, the applicant’s alibi regarding his being away from the “mrt” on the date when the offence was committed had been dismissed without any investigation. according to the applicant, at the time of the alleged offence, he was in moscow. he obtained a letter from his employer to confirm that on the particular day of the offence the applicant had been at work. however, the investigators seized the original of that letter during a search of his parents’ home and it later disappeared. the courts refused to accept a copy of the letter as evidence and/or to check the information contained in it. on 29 august 2006 the tiraspol district court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment. the applicant was placed in detention in tiraspol colony no. 2 where the conditions allegedly were very poor. in particular, his cell was overcrowded, he did not have daily walks, the material conditions were very poor, there were shortages of electricity sometimes for several days, and he shared space with detainees suffering from contagious diseases. the food was inedible and therefore detainees had to rely on the food supplied to them by their relatives. according to the applicant, he requested on numerous occasions that he be seen by a doctor in relation to his hiv diagnosis. however, the prison authorities ignored his requests. there was no dentist in the prison, and the inmates had to remove each other’s teeth in emergencies. the applicant had his molar teeth removed in this way. on 26 september 2006 the supreme court of the “mrt” dismissed the applicant’s appeal. on an unspecified date after his final conviction, the applicant’s mother engaged a lawyer with a view to lodging an application to the court. she later went to visit the applicant to obtain his signature on the application form. however, the prison guards refused to allow her to do so on the grounds that the application was not in russian and that it had to be authorised first by the prison authorities. it appears that she eventually succeeded in having the application form signed by the applicant. on 24 april 2012 the applicant was released from detention.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in yaroslavl. on 19 february 2009 the applicant, former head of the department of pharmacology at the yaroslavl state medical academy, was arrested on suspicion of bribe-taking. on 20 february 2009 the leninskiy district court of yaroslavl (“the district court”) remanded the applicant in custody. when questioned as a suspect [the applicant] refused to testify, citing article 51 of the constitution of the russian federation. during the crime-scene inspection on 19 february 2009, 500-rouble and 1,000‑rouble banknotes were discovered in various parts of the [applicant’s office], the origin of which [the applicant] explained as personal savings. on 11 march 2009 the applicant was dismissed from the post of head of the department of pharmacology at the yaroslavl state medical academy. on 16 april and 17 june 2009 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 19 june and 31 july 2009 respectively. on both occasions the court held that the grounds relied on by the court when applying the custodial measure still persisted, and that the applicant was charged with eight counts of a serious crime, committed between december 2007 and february 2009 and punishable by three to seven years’ imprisonment. he was further suspected of having committed another fifteen similar offences, in respect of which he had refused to testify. he had confessed only in part and had refused to testify as either a suspect or an accused. although the applicant had been dismissed from his post, he remained on good terms with his colleagues from the pharmacology department, including its acting head. he could therefore have access to information and documents which might be of interest to him. all of the above, as well as the position which the applicant had taken in the proceedings, gave the court grounds to believe that, if released, he might exert pressure on witnesses (the students at the medical academy), destroy evidence or otherwise interfere with the proceedings. lastly, the court held that, in view of the above circumstances, the custodial measure could not be replaced by a more lenient preventive measure. on 28 april and 3 july 2009 the regional court upheld the above decisions on appeal. the court held that some of the grounds on which it had relied when extending the applicant’s detention were no longer valid. however, it noted the gravity of the charges against the applicant, the fact that he was suspected of having committed a further fifteen similar offences and that three more criminal cases had been opened against him in that connection in february-march 2009, and the fact that on 29 july 2009 seventeen other criminal cases had been opened against him on suspicion of twenty-nine criminal offences. the court found unconvincing the applicant’s argument to the effect that the students had already taken their pharmacology exams and were on summer holidays, since this did not exclude the risk of the applicant’s meeting them outside the academy. the court therefore found that it would not be appropriate to apply a more lenient preventive measure. on 16 september 2009 the charges against the applicant were finalised to include twenty-six counts of bribe-taking and forgery of official documents under articles 290 § 2 and 292 § 1 of the russian criminal code. on 5 march 2009 the applicant asked the investigator to allow his wife to visit him in the remand prison. on 23 march 2009 the investigator refused the request, because the applicant’s case was being investigated and a visit by his wife might obstruct the establishment of the truth. on 13 may, 10 june and 24 june 2009 the applicant applied for permission for his wife and daughter to visit him. on 18 may, 15 june and 29 june 2009 respectively, the investigator again refused the applicant’s requests, relying on the ongoing investigation and the risk of the family visits obstructing the establishment of the truth. on 2 july 2009 the district court found the decision of 15 june 2009 unlawful and obliged the investigator to grant the applicant’s request. the decision further stipulated that the visit had to take place in the presence of the investigator. on 11 august 2009 the leninskiy district court found the decision of 24 july 2009, in so far as it limited the duration of the visit and imposed the presence of the investigator, unlawful. on 27 august 2009 the investigator decided to allow the applicant to see his wife. however, according to the applicant, it was never communicated to him or his wife. as a result, he did not see his family until 17 september 2009 when the custodial measure was lifted.
the applicant was born in 1976 and, until his death in 2006, lived in vinnytsya. the background to the case, including the transdniestrian armed conflict of 1991-1992 and the subsequent events, is set out in ilaşcu and others v. moldova and russia ([gc], no. 48787/99, §§ 28-185, echr 2004‑vii) and catan and others v. the republic of moldova and russia ([gc], nos. 43370/04 and 2 others, §§ 8-42, echr 2012 (extracts)). in 2001 the applicant was arrested in the self-proclaimed “moldavian republic of transdniestria” (the “mrt”) on charges of murder. on 28 june 2002 he was convicted in a final judgment by the “mrt” supreme court and sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment. according to the applicant, during his pre-trial detention he was subjected to ill-treatment to make him confess to committing the murder. after his conviction the applicant’s mother made many requests to various ukrainian official bodies to obtain the transfer of her son to a ukrainian prison. the case file before the court contains approximately forty replies received by her from various ukrainian authorities. however, her efforts were not successful. in particular, the ministry of foreign affairs of ukraine informed the applicant that it had contacted its counterpart in moldova, which had informed it that moldova could not secure the applicant’s transfer to a ukrainian prison because it did not have control over the territory of the “mrt”. the ukrainian authorities also contacted the “mrt” authorities, but to no avail. in a letter to the applicant’s mother, the “mrt” authorities stated that they would only transfer the applicant to a ukrainian prison after the conclusion of a treaty between ukraine and the “mrt” which would make the transfer of prisoners possible. since ukraine refused to sign such a treaty with it, the transfer was not possible. the applicant’s mother went so far as to initiate court proceedings against the ukrainian ministry of foreign affairs, denouncing its lack of action, but she was not successful. on several occasions the applicant’s representative also contacted the moldovan authorities, enquiring about the status of the transdniestrian region and, on at least two occasions, asking them for assistance with the question of the applicant’s transfer to a ukrainian prison. it does not appear from the material submitted by the applicant and his mother that he complained to the moldovan authorities about alleged breaches of his convention rights by the “mrt” authorities. in a letter of 25 april 2003 the prosecutor general’s office of moldova informed the applicant’s representative that it had contacted the prosecuting authorities of the “mrt” and requested the necessary documents to have the applicant transferred to a ukrainian prison. it is not clear from the case file whether the “mrt” authorities reacted to that letter. in another letter sent to the applicant’s representative by the office of the president of the republic of moldova, the lawyer was informed that the moldovan authorities were unable to bring about the applicant’s transfer to a ukrainian prison while the transdniestrian conflict remained unsettled. the applicant’s mother also wrote to the osce mission in moldova, which informed her that her letter had been forwarded to the ukrainian embassy in chisinau. in around march 2006 the applicant broke his leg and was admitted to hospital. it appears from his mother’s statements that she was able to spend time with him during his stay in hospital. on 24 may 2006 the applicant was found hanged in the gym of the prison in which he was being detained. it does not appear that the applicant’s mother requested or obtained a medical forensic report concerning the circumstances of his death. however, it appears from her statements that the applicant did not have any signs of violence on his body.
the applicants, mr ernest vardanean and ms irina vardanean, are moldovan nationals who were born in 1980 and live in chisinau. the background to the case, including the transdniestrian armed conflict of 1991-1992 and the subsequent events, is set out in ilaşcu and others v. moldova and russia ([gc], no. 48787/99, §§ 28-185, echr 2004‑vii) and catan and others v. the republic of moldova and russia ([gc], nos. 43370/04, 8252/05 and 18454/06, §§ 8-42, echr 2012). the applicants are husband and wife and are journalists. at the time of the events they were living in the self-proclaimed “moldovan republic of transdniestria” (the “mrt”). the first applicant was employed by a russian news agency and by a moldovan newspaper. on 7 april 2010 the first applicant was arrested by agents of the secret service of the “mrt” on charges of treason and/or espionage undertaken for the republic of moldova. a search was carried out in the applicants’ apartment and many of their belongings – such as pictures, computers and a bank card – were seized. on 16 december 2010, a tribunal from the “mrt” convicted the first applicant and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment. following international pressure, on 5 may 2011 the president of the “mrt” pardoned him. after that date, the applicant and his family moved to chisinau. during his detention the first applicant met on several occasions with representatives of the “mrt” secret services, including the chief of the secret services, and was led to believe that his family might suffer if he refused to cooperate with them. he was asked to record a video of himself admitting having worked for the moldovan secret services. that video was aired on transdniestrian television. on another occasion he was asked to write a letter to the foreign ambassadors to moldova “disclosing” the fact that the moldovan secret services were spying on the foreign embassies based in chisinau. he subsequently was given to understand by representatives of the “mrt” secret services that the letter had served the purpose of creating tensions between chisinau and western countries and that the whole matter, including his arrest, was being coordinated from moscow. the second applicant could only visit the first applicant on a limited number of occasions during his detention and lawyers representing the first applicant in the proceedings before the court were denied access to him on the grounds that they were not members of the “transdniestrian bar association”. in the meantime, the moldovan authorities made numerous attempts to secure the first applicant’s release. in particular, the problem of his detention in the “mrt” was raised by the moldovan authorities with the european union and the united states authorities in april 2010 in brussels. the moldovan delegation distributed a circular letter during the april 2010 session of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe and raised the first applicant’s situation during meetings of the committee of ministers of the council of europe in january and february 2011. the first applicant’s situation was also raised by the moldovan authorities in their discussions with the osce representatives in chisinau, and a criminal investigation was initiated by the moldovan prosecutor’s office in respect of the applicant’s detention in the “mrt”. however, the criminal investigation was later discontinued. the moldovan government also awarded financial assistance to the first applicant’s family during the period of the first applicant’s detention in the “mrt” and transferred to them ownership of a flat in chisinau worth 53,000 euros (eur) after the first applicant’s release from detention.
the applicant was born in 1960 and is detained in vadul lui voda. on 22 february 2002 at 7 a.m. the applicant was arrested and placed in detention. she was released at 4.40 p.m. on the same day after a court had found that her detention had been abusive and had ordered her release. in the meantime, during her detention, the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment by the police. in particular, she was punched and strangled. after release, the applicant went to a hospital, where she was diagnosed with concussion and multiple bruises on her head and neck. she lodged a criminal complaint in relation to the above-mentioned facts; however, it was not successful. on an unspecified date, the applicant initiated civil proceedings against the state, claiming compensation for unlawful detention and ill‑treatment. by a final judgment of 9 august 2012, the supreme court of justice found a breach of the applicant’s rights, as guaranteed by articles 3 and 5 of the convention, on account of her unlawful detention and ill-treatment on 22 february 2002. the supreme court also found a breach of the applicant’s rights, as guaranteed by articles 6 and 13 of the convention, on account of the length and ineffectiveness of the criminal investigation conducted into the applicant’s complaints of abusive actions on the part of the police. the supreme court awarded her 3,200 euros (eur) in compensation.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in khachmaz. was on guard duty with one other soldier (q.s.) during the telephone conversation he was in a good mood and did not complain about any problems. left the post in order to change the guard and z.b. a few minutes later the soldiers heard a gunshot and went to the post, where they discovered z.b. ’s body, the cartridge, the pen and the note were taken. commit suicide and nobody is responsible for that. i commit suicide because i don’t want to be a burden to anyone. had never been ill-treated during his military service. had been in a bad mood and had told him about his family problems. on 17 november 2009 the investigator also took signature and writing samples from the soldiers of the military unit in order to identify the author of the written note found at the crime scene. on 24 november 2009 the investigator also sent an operational request (əməliyyat tapşırığı) to the head of the military counterintelligence department of military unit no. replied to the investigator’s request of 24 november 2009. had had no family problems, that he had not been engaged to anyone and that his relatives had not been suffering from any psychological illnesses. had asked the applicant to tell his mother to leave her mobile telephone turned on as he would call her later. the applicant further stated that at the request of his son he had bought mobile top-up cards and sent their passwords to him by a telephone message. the report further found that the seam of the left pocket of z.b. 16713 dated 28 december 2009 concluded that a comparison of the samples submitted to the examination showed that the note had similarities with z.b. on 14 november 2009 and submitted that z.b. on 21 january 2010 the applicant was again questioned by the investigator. had committed suicide because he had probably been in a state of depression. on 27 february 2010 the applicant lodged a complaint with the gazakh military court against the investigator’s decision of 9 february 2010, complaining of the ineffectiveness of the criminal investigation. he disputed the investigator’s conclusions relating to the suicide of his son, pointing out that z.b. on 25 march 2010 the investigator also questioned two soldiers, who stated that they did not remember whether z.b. had called his parents “ana” (mum) and “ata” (dad) or “mama” and “papa”. he further complained that the new investigator had failed to question s.h. in that connection, the investigator found that z.b. relying on the letter dated 10 september 2010 from the intelligence department of military unit no. had not been confirmed during the investigation. on 1 november 2010 the applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with the baku military court, arguing that the investigator had failed to carry out an effective investigation.
the applicants were born in 1978, 1980 and 2007 respectively. the first applicant came to bulgaria in 1997. in 2001 he was granted long-term resident status, and in 2003 – permanent resident status. in 2005 he married the second applicant, and in 2007 the third applicant, their son, was born. on 29 may 2008 the head of the national security service issued an order withdrawing the first applicant’s residence permit, ordering his expulsion and imposing a ten-year ban on his re‑entering bulgaria on the ground that his presence in the country represented a “serious threat to national security”. factual grounds justifying the order were not indicated; it was merely noted that it was based on “proposal no. that proposal, drawn up by the national security service on 27 may 2008 and initially classified, was declassified in 2016 and has been submitted by the government. it stated that the first applicant was a member of a “russian criminal group” implicated in money laundering, extortion, smuggling, illegal arms deals and the financing of “terrorist groups” on the territory of the russian federation. it said further that the first applicant had lowered bulgaria’s international reputation, by “implicating the country in the financing of terrorist organisations, transnational criminality, corruption and drug trafficking”. no evidence was provided to substantiate those claims. on 12 june 2008 the first applicant applied for judicial review of the order of 29 may 2008. he denied the allegations against him and stated that his family resided in bulgaria and that the measures against him breached his convention rights. in addition, he presented a certificate that he had no criminal convictions in bulgaria. in a final judgment of 8 january 2009 the supreme administrative court dismissed the application for judicial review and held that the 29 may 2008 order was lawful. after summarising the allegations made in proposal no. b848, it held merely that they were sufficient to justify a conclusion that the first applicant represented a threat to national security. furthermore, it dismissed his arguments relating to his family life, considering that
“any restriction of the rights under the convention is justified [when based] on national security considerations, in cases where foreign citizens’ behaviour threatens the national security and the public order of the state where they reside.” the first applicant was expelled on 24 april 2009. it is unclear whether the second and third applicants remained in bulgaria after that. in 2012 the first and second applicants had another child.
the applicant was born in 1941 and lives in the small village of yamna, which forms part of yaremche, a resort town located in the carpathian mountains in the ivano-frankivsk region of ukraine. on 16 july 1996 the executive committee of yaremche town council (“the executive committee”) allotted a plot of land next to the applicant’s house to st john’s church to build a new cemetery (“the new cemetery”). the house where she and her family lived was located some ten metres from the cemetery boundary. the applicant’s yard was separated from the cemetery by a wire mesh fence. the part of the cemetery captured on the pictures contained over fifty graves, some freshly decorated with wreaths. according to the applicant’s statements, at the time, when she lodged the present application, her family was routinely disturbed in its daily life by the sight of funeral processions and the sound of people mourning by the graves. in hot weather unpleasant smells sometimes emanated from the cemetery. the applicant contacted various authorities on numerous occasions, complaining that the distance between her house and the new cemetery was less than the 300 metres required by law as a sanitary “health protection” zone. on 25 june 2002 the executive committee overturned its previous decision of 30 august 2001 (see paragraph 13 above) in response to complaints from st john’s congregation members and village residents that no other suitable burial ground was available. she noted, in particular, that the distance between her house and the cemetery was less than twenty-five metres. locating the cemetery so close to the applicant’s home had put her life and health at risk. the applicant also claimed non-pecuniary damages for her sufferings. on 16 january 2003 the yaremche court found the decision of 25 june 2002 unlawful as the applicant’s house had been located within the sanitary health protection zone, which had been illegal. it ordered the executive committee to proscribe the burials. the judgment was not appealed against and became final. he noted, in particular, that the 300‑metre sanitary health protection zone had been established to prevent water and soil pollution and the spread of infectious diseases. allowing burials ten metres from the applicant’s house was not in conformity with sanitary rules. on 24 july 2003 the yaremche court found that the bailiffs’ service had failed to act to enforce the judgment of 16 january 2003, but dismissed the applicant’s claim for non-pecuniary damages arising from the bailiffs’ inaction. on 26 august 2003 the enforcement proceedings concerning the judgment of 16 january 2003 were terminated on the grounds that enforcement was impossible because the executive committee members refused to vote to proscribe the burials. on 18 march 2004 the yaremche court found for the applicant in part. at the same time, the applicant’s claim for damages was rejected. the decision became final and enforcement proceedings were instituted. at many of its meetings the executive committee discussed draft decisions banning burials, however, they were never approved by a vote as no suitable alternative location for the cemetery could be found. on 28 february 2005 the enforcement proceedings were terminated because of the impossibility of enforcement as members of the council refused to vote against the burials. on 26 july 2005 the yaremche council informed the applicant that it had been unable to relocate the cemetery in view of the unavailability of other suitable land. it was further noted that they were continuing to look for alternatives and, in particular, were negotiating to acquire a plot from the yamna forestry authority. on 9 august 2005 the applicant requested that the mayor of yaremche consider resettling her family and proposed that the town council acquire another house for her. she suggested a specific house that was for sale at the material time, which, according to her, was comparable to her present house. on 15 september 2005 the executive committee informed the applicant that the municipal authorities were ready to consider the applicant’s resettlement as an option. however, the town had no funds in its budget to buy the proposed house at that time.
the applicant was born in 1976 and is detained in lublin. on 10 june 2013 the supreme court dismissed the cassation appeal as manifestly ill-founded. on 22 august 2009 the prison authorities discovered 132 pills of psychoactive drugs hidden in the applicant’s clothes. on 26 august 2009 the applicant encouraged other prisoners to start a hunger strike. the applicant then went on a hunger strike which lasted until 7 september 2009. he was punished by being placed in solitary confinement for fourteen days. between 17 november 2009 and 31 march 2010 the applicant was detained in the rzeszów remand centre. on the latter date he was transported back to lublin. the applicant’s behaviour during 2011 varied: he was sometimes rewarded for good behaviour and sometimes faced disciplinary measures. on 6 december 2011 prison officers found that the applicant had 80 polish zlotys in cash from an unknown source. on 17 april 2012 the director of the lublin remand centre examined his complaint and found that the search had been performed in accordance with the law and that the applicant had not been debased or humiliated. on 29 april 2012 the applicant complained about another strip search, which had taken place on 28 april 2012. on 5 june 2012 the applicant underwent a strip search which was accompanied by a search of his cell. the plan included the inspection of all the cells. in his observations before this court, the applicant’s lawyer submitted that the applicant had been ordered to undergo a strip search on 5 june 2012, even though he had had severe back pain and had barely been able to walk. he had also had difficulties getting undressed. the guards did not use offensive language and did not debase you. in 2012 the applicant was seen by a neurologist seventeen times and on two occasions by a neurosurgeon. on 16 october 2012 an operation, apparently for back pain, was scheduled for the applicant for 17 september 2013. the doctors did not advise against body checks of the applicant. the relevant part of the decision read:
“the strip search you were subjected to was carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions and with respect for your personal dignity.” afterwards, he was again ordered to undergo a strip search. he arrived with three other guards and subjected the applicant to a strip search. he submitted, among other things, that he had had severe back pain after the family visit, had barely been able to move and had therefore refused to undress. on 7 november 2012 the applicant also complained about the imposition of the disciplinary penalty on him after the strip search of 3 november 2012. the complaint of 7 november 2012 was dismissed on 20 november 2012. the decision, issued by the deputy director of the lublin remand centre, said that the “applicant refused to undergo a strip search and only agreed to comply when the chief duty officer was called”. the decision does not refer to the applicant’s submissions that the alleged reason for his refusal to undergo the strip search had been severe back pain. it also made no reference to his allegations that he had been left for about fifty minutes in a state of being unable to get dressed and that he had been forced to put his clothes on by someone letting freezing air into the room. the applicant was scheduled to return to prison on 12 january 2014.
the applicant was born in 1942 and lives in tomaszów mazowiecki. to account for his management of public funds. they appointed the applicant to be in charge of further action in that regard. it took me over one week to figure out a solution to this problem. i came to the realisation that the best way to approach [it] would be to file a request with the mayor of the district in order to clarify the issue, even though i had already informed the current local mayor and mayor of the tomaszów mazowiecki commune (wójt) of the allegations. the facts and circumstances are as follows. during his term in office, he never asked the residents or the local council for what purpose the money should be used. there are many rumours going around the village, which out of respect for your office i will not be repeating. i will only add one more thing, namely that the community hall was not accessible to the residents and their children for [ten] years. i consider, therefore, that the petition and the request are both valid. the document was sent to the district mayor before local elections which took place on 21 november 2010 (wybory samorządowe). were candidates in those elections but neither of them became a local councillor. on an unspecified date the tomaszów mazowiecki commune council audit committee analysed the document. for violating his reputation by forwarding to the mayor of tomaszów district a document on [7 october] 2010 entitled “petition”, which contained false allegations that the local mayor, z.m., ’s involvement in matters such as the community hall refurbishment and running of the vfb. this included statements claiming that z.m., the domestic court established that even if z.m. had taken any payments, he had done so as chairman of the vfb. the court also found that the village shop was located in the building owned by the vfb, which also hosted the community hall, and that the rent under the lease was paid to the vfb through an intermediary, its treasurer. as chairman of the vfb, merely set the amount of rent to be paid each year. at the time, there were also building works being carried out in the same building. had received any money in cash for the work. it was also established that the village had not received any funds directly from the commune. on 12 july 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal with the łódź court of appeal, alleging that the court had not considered that the relevant text had been communicated in the public interest. it rejected the applicant’s claim that the petition was merely an expression of doubt concerning the lawfulness of z.m. he had raised his concerns almost three years after the end of z.m. ’s mandate during the electoral campaign which z.m. the applicant received a copy of the judgment on 15 december 2011. on 18 october 2012 the applicant lodged an appeal against the latter judgment. on 21 january 2011 the applicant was elected mayor of jadwigów.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in rostov-on-don, russian federation. in the arm and cheek with the knife, through the half-open door, and managed to shut the door. and a.e, nine more police officers, including a.s., ’s life and that the police officers had simply executed him in retaliation for his having injured one of their colleagues. all along the front of the house there was a porch, which measured 3 by 1.8 metres. on 7 march 2006 an autopsy was conducted. seyran ayvazyan was in the second (rear) room when the six police officers entered the house. they left the house; the last one to leave was h.gev., was holding a table, defending himself against seyran ayvazyan. fired again and seyran ayvazyan dropped the knife. after the six police officers had entered the house, seyran ayvazyan threatened them and told them to leave. seeing this, he tried to move faster towards the door. seyran ayvazyan was screaming loudly, but while the shots were being fired the others dragged him away from seyran ayvazyan and transported him to the hospital. then he heard seyran ayvazyan screaming and saw the others come out of the house and seyran ayvazyan, with a knife in his hand, run towards and reach h.gev. ( seyran ayvazyan did not fall after his shot but stumbled back with a knife in his hand. he did not fire any other shots apart from the above-mentioned two. then seyran ayvazyan took out another knife and wanted to stab h.gev. seyran ayvazyan had also placed an armchair between the two rooms, so that they could not enter the second room. was asked (a) whether it would have been possible to neutralise seyran ayvazyan without the use of firearms (answer: negative) and (b) how many firearms had been used for that purpose (three). were asked whether they had received an order to shoot before they had entered the house (both: negative). were also asked whether they had noticed a grenade in seyran ayvazyan’s hands or whether he had made threats with a grenade (all four: negative). (b)  other police officers present at the scene 29. the wording of the decision first outlined the facts, as established by the investigation (see paragraphs 7-12 above), and concluded that the police officers had employed their service weapons in the light of the exigencies of the situation for the purpose of repelling a life-threatening attack on police officer h.gev. as to the finding of a grenade in seyran ayvazyan’s house, an.a stated that this could not serve as justification for the police officers’ actions, since it had been discovered only after the fatal incident had taken place, and her brother had never threatened the policemen that he would use it. lodged an appeal on points of law against the decision of the court of appeal, raising the same arguments regarding both the admissibility and the merits of her court complaint. on 23 may 2008 the court of cassation examined the appeal. on the other hand, a number of factors suggested that the proceedings instituted had also been based on the fact that he had been killed, and an investigation had been carried out in that connection. thus, the descriptive part of the wording of the decision to institute proceedings had mentioned the fact that seyran ayvazyan had been taken to hospital and had died. furthermore, seyran ayvazyan’s sister, an.a., this suggested that some investigation into his death had nevertheless been carried out.
from 2004 until 16 january 2012 he was minister (landesrat) of the regional government of carinthia (kärntner landesregierung). in 2004 he became a board member of that bank. in february 2008 the first applicant and j.h. ’s claim and expressed doubts as to his contribution to the negotiation process and the amount of the fee. following the media coverage and the discussion at the supervisory board’s meeting, the landesholding management board (the second applicant and the third applicant) commissioned lawyers and legal experts and asked them to confirm the appropriateness and reasonability of the claim for fees. ’s claim for fees was reasonable – was to be answered by another three external experts. on 17 december 2009 the second applicant and the third applicant ordered the payment of the remaining amount to d.b. the share deal was the subject of intense debate within the carinthian regional parliament and the bavarian regional parliament, as b.  bank’s head office was in munich. the carinthian branch of the social democratic party of austria (spӧ kärnten) and r.h., had reduced his claim for fees from eur 12,143,168 to eur 6 million. on 19 january 2009 the klagenfurt public prosecutor closed the preliminary proceedings. could in part be seen as those of an investment bank. on 16 december 2011 landesholding submitted another expert report which its supervisory board had commissioned from a private limited company. on 19 december 2011 the second applicant commented on that expert report. for aiding and abetting in breach of trust. on 18 july 2012 the third applicant asked the court not to include the expert report of f.s. was a professional lawyer and university professor in germany and not registered in austria as an expert for book-keeping, cost accounting or financial auditing in the list of court appointed experts and therefore lacked the necessary expert knowledge for assessing whether the remuneration of d.b. had been biased because in the course of the preliminary investigations he had answered questions of assessment of evidence and questions of law. should the court not appoint another official expert for the trial, the third applicant requested that the privately commissioned expert reports presented to the court be included in the file. as regards the challenge for bias of f.s. had handed over part of the payment to the first applicant. was being questioned, an expert commissioned by the defence sat next to the applicants’ lawyers and advised them but was not allowed to question f.s. had to be considered as a witness for the prosecution and not as an impartial expert assisting the court. in addition, they were ordered to repay eur 4,765,193 plus interest to landesholding for compensation. had been appointed by the public prosecutor and had delivered the basis for a bill of indictment, which showed that he was biased. were reduced to four and a half years and two and a half years of imprisonment respectively. his or her findings had to be based on facts established using scientific methods and principles. furthermore, the findings and conclusions of the official expert could be challenged even before the trial stage by lodging an objection (einspruch) against the bill of indictment, but this had not been done in the case at hand (see paragraph 50 above). or to object to his appointment in the preliminary proceedings. 211; bönisch v.  austria, 6 may 1985, series a no.
the applicants were born in 1932, 1929, 1965 and 1956 respectively and live in sofia. on 15 january 1968 the second applicant, together with the antecedents of the other applicants, bought from the then existing local agricultural co-operative a plot of land situated on the outskirts of sofia measuring 953 square metres. until 2002 the applicants or their antecedents enjoyed undisturbed possession of that land. on 10 may 2002 a group of persons, the heirs of mr t.s., brought against the applicants a rei vindicatio action, stating that the plot of land was theirs. they stated that the plot, once the property of their antecedents, had been collectivised in the years after 1945, but had been returned to them within the context of the process of the restitution of agricultural land by a decision of the relevant body, the local land commission, dated 27 december 1999. they claimed that under section 10(13) of the agricultural land act (see paragraph 13 below), the fact that the second applicant and the remaining applicants’ antecedents had purchased the land in 1968 could not be held against them. initially, the sofia district court (its judgement is undated) dismissed the action against the applicants. on 5 november 2009 the sofia city court overturned that ruling, allowed the rei vindicatio claim and ordered the applicants to surrender possession of the plot. it found in particular that the land commission’s decision of 27 december 1999 was sufficient to render the claimants the owners of the disputed land. it pointed out that of the two rival claims to the same plot the law – namely section 10(13) of the agricultural land act – gave priority to the one based on restitution, and thus had the effect of rendering devoid of any legal force the contract under which the second applicant and the remaining applicants’ predecessors had bought the plot. in a final decision of 18 june 2010 the supreme court of cassation declined to entertain a cassation appeal by the applicants. on an unspecified date soon after that the applicants surrendered possession of the plot.
the applicant was born in 1990 and lives in turkey. they divorced in 1992 and his father was awarded sole custody. in the same year, his grandparents, who had been looking after him while his father had been working, moved to turkey and took the applicant and his sister with them. the applicant lived in turkey from 1992 until 1998, attending school there for three years. in 1998, when he was eight years old, he and his sister moved back to austria to live with their father again. for that purpose, the applicant was granted a residence permit by the austrian authorities. on 30 december 2004, at the age of 14, the applicant, together with four of his friends, assaulted a man. on 20 january 2005 the applicant attempted to shoplift. the applicant was 15 years old at that time. two of the women were seriously injured as a result. the criminal court considered as mitigating factors that the applicant had no previous criminal record, that he had confessed to his crimes and that he had shown willingness to afford redress to the victim. he was sentenced to two and a half years’ imprisonment. the probationary period of his previous criminal conviction of 13 march 2006 was prolonged to five years in total. it argued in its reasoning that the applicant had taken a leading role in the robberies. the applicant and his friends had deliberately targeted elderly women because they had expected they would not resist. moreover, the criminal court found that the applicant had been one of the main perpetrators, which is why there was no leeway to pronounce a more lenient sentence than two and a half years’ imprisonment. because of his young age he would not be able to live in turkey by himself. on 11 december 2007 the administrative court set aside the vienna security authority’s decision of 16 march 2007 for lack of jurisdiction and held that the independent administrative panel (unabhängiger verwaltungssenat – hereinafter, “the iap”) was the competent authority to examine the appeal. on 21 july 2008, following an oral hearing, the vienna iap partly granted and partly dismissed the applicant’s appeal. two of the women had been severely injured. the applicant had been one of the main perpetrators. his probation officer (bewährungshelfer) testified that the applicant had developed a sense of justice after his conviction and that cooperation with him had worked well. after his release, he had participated in several training programmes and was looking for a job. the iap noted furthermore that the applicant had not reoffended in over a year since his release from prison. it came to the conclusion, however, that the relatively short time since his release was not enough to prove that he was not a danger to society anymore. 54273/00, echr 2001‑ix), üner v. the netherlands ([gc] no. economic integration could not be observed as he was unemployed at the time. he spoke turkish and had last visited turkey in 2001. on 8 september and 17 november 2009 and on 4 january 2010 the applicant was informed of the possibility to leave the country voluntarily. as he did not leave, he was expelled to turkey on 10 february 2010.
the applicants were born in 1977 and 1979 respectively and live in tbilisi and tskaltubo. he had furnished him with a psm pistol, which had been loaded and fitted with a silencer. a few days later, the first applicant had learnt from the television that the man he had tried to kill was a member of parliament. according to the record of the questioning of 13 may 2004, the first applicant had been feeling remorse and had wanted to give himself up to the police for some time. at 5.15 p.m. that day, 13 may 2004, the investigator formally charged the first applicant with attempted murder, based on his confession, and, without informing the latter of his right to call in a lawyer of his own choice, assigned a public defence lawyer to him; according to the case materials, that public lawyer was dismissed by the applicant on 4 june 2004 (see paragraph 23 below), and, in general, the latter replaced his defence lawyers several times as the criminal proceedings unfolded. the identification procedure was recorded in writing and was signed by the first applicant’s public defence lawyer. on 13 may 2004 the second applicant was also arrested and charged with attempted murder. 7 on 16 may 2004, the first applicant was examined by the prison doctor, who noted in a report that there were no marks of violence on his body. on 15 june 2004 the first applicant made a submission to the tbilisi city public prosecutor in charge of his case (“the city prosecutor”), asserting his innocence. on 5 august 2004 the investigator and the newly appointed lawyer sh.dz. the applicant, however, refused to be questioned, without providing any explanation. notably, an x-ray of his head, taken only from one side, and an x-ray of his thorax showed that at that time he bore no signs of lesions on those parts of the body. she further alleged that after the member of parliament’s visit, criminal bosses had been allowed to enter the applicant’s cell on 2 august 2004 in order to pressure him to testify as the member of parliament wished. the investigator questioned the first applicant the same day and he repeated all the factual details concerning his allegations of ill-treatment on 13 may 2004, gave the names of the police officers involved and detailed the threats made against him. he complained of having been coerced into accepting sh.dz. in his view, a request by the applicants to be released on bail had to be rejected for the same reasons. he had been given electric shocks and beaten. he had also been beaten on the neck with a square padlock. he had passed out while being given the electric shocks and the police officers had poured water on his head to bring him around. they first noted that the first applicant had repeated the statements he had made in his complaint of 7 september 2004. when questioned by an investigator of the inspectorate general of the cppo on 13 october 2004, the first applicant stood by his allegations that he had been tortured by the police officers on 13 may 2004. on the contrary, it had been the police who had suddenly come to her house, and had searched for and found the psm pistol in the yard. however, the two brothers had abused his trust. they had taken certain items of gold belonging to clients and a large sum of money and had disappeared in october 2003. some months earlier, an internal audit of the branch in question had uncovered considerable losses there. when questioned by the trial court, the two witnesses to the reconstruction of the crime on 13 may 2004 stated that they had been stopped by police officers in the vicinity of the main police station. the applicant had looked exhausted and had had a deep bruise around one eye. he specifically complained that while the trial court judges had confirmed his guilt by reference to the record of the confirmation of the first applicant’s confession during the reconstruction at the scene of the crime on 13 may 2004, that specific item of evidence had clearly been tainted by the ill-treatment the first applicant had suffered at the hands of the police. as far as the alleged ill‑treatment was concerned, the criminal chamber affirmed that it was not in dispute that the first applicant had had marks of violence on his person. the cassette contains a recording of the investigative journalism programme 60 minutes.
the applicants were born in 1970, 1973, 1999, 2001 and 2007 respectively. the court has not been informed of their current place of residence. the first and second applicants, a married couple, arrived in bulgaria in 1997. their three children, the remaining applicants, were born in that country. all members of the family were granted permanent resident permits. in 2005 the first applicant bought a flat in sofia, where the family lived. on 29 may 2008 the head of the national security service issued an order withdrawing the first applicant’s residence permit, ordering his expulsion and imposing a ten-year ban on his re‑entering bulgaria, on the ground that his presence in the country represented a “serious threat to national security”. factual grounds justifying the order were not indicated; it was merely noted that it was based on “proposal no. that proposal, drawn up by the national security service on 27 may 2008 and initially classified, was declassified on 22 february 2016 and has been submitted by the government. it stated that, according to intelligence data, the first applicant was the leader of an international terrorist group, working towards the aiding and financing of chechen extremist and separatist organisations. it also stated that he was being searched on the territory of the russian federation and that his actions lowered the prestige and the interests of the bulgarian state. the document claimed, in addition, that the first applicant had been implicated in extortion, drug trafficking, smuggling, money laundering and other criminal activities. no evidence was provided to substantiate those claims, even though the document referred to some specific facts. on 12 june 2008 the first applicant applied for judicial review of the expulsion order. he disputed the allegation that he represented “a serious threat to national security”. he pointed out that his family was living in bulgaria and that his children had been born in the country, and claimed that the proposed separation of his family was “unjustified”. during the ensuing proceedings the applicant and his representative were shown proposal no. b849 and they presented evidence seeking to disprove some of the allegations it contained. in particular, the first applicant presented certificates issued by the bulgarian and the russian authorities stating that he had no convictions in the two countries and explained that in february 2008 he had travelled to russia, where, as he claimed, he would have been arrested had he indeed been searched by the authorities of that country. in addition, in his written submissions the first applicant’s representative pointed out that the allegations made in the proposal were not substantiated by any evidence, and that they could not justify a conclusion that the applicant represented a threat to national security. in his oral pleadings he pointed out once again that the first applicant had “created his family” in bulgaria. in a final judgment of 20 december 2008 the supreme administrative court dismissed the application for judicial review. after summarizing the claims made in proposal no. b849, it held briefly that it was bound by them. thus, in its view
“it should be concluded that the presence and the activity of the [first applicant] amount to a serious threat to national security and to the international prestige of the republic of bulgaria.” in a decision of 29 may 2008 the head of the ministry of internal affairs’ migration directorate ordered the first applicant’s detention pending expulsion. that decision was quashed in a judgment of the sofia administrative court of 17 july 2008. that decision was quashed as well, in a judgment of the supreme administrative court of 27 november 2009. the first applicant effectively remained in detention from 10 september 2008 to the date of his expulsion, 3 september 2009. the other applicants remained for several more years in bulgaria, but left in november 2015.
the first applicant, franz-olivier giesbert, is the publication director of the magazine le point. the second applicant, hervé gattegno, is a journalist with le point. the third applicant is the company operating le point. mrs liliane bettencourt, principal shareholder of the group l’oréal, is one of the richest individuals in france. from the late 1990s she made numerous gifts to her friend b., a writer and photographer, totalling several hundred million euros in value. in september 2008 b. was taken into police custody. she sought and obtained the inclusion in the case file of material and reports from the preliminary investigation. the case initiated by the private prosecution was first set down for hearing on 3 september 2009, then on 11 december 2009. the developments in the case were widely reported in the press. did he take advantage of liliane bettencourt? [ after verification, this inventory seems to be somewhat overstated: in actual fact it was through a series of cheques from the billionaire and the cancellation of astronomical debts to real estate companies owned by him that b. has managed to build up his assets to the point of acquiring seven apartments in the well-to-do neighbourhood of saint sulpice. but curiously his benefactor did not even mention such a project during her own hearing on 13 may 2008. the first spoke of a “hold” over mrs bettencourt. in late 2006 her attention was drawn to the proposed assignment of a life insurance policy (for an amount in excess of 260 million euros). “ i tried to reason with mrs bettencourt but she was no longer her old self”, recalled the accountant. “ on 4 february 2010 the third applicant published, with the second applicant’s byline, an article indicated on the full front cover of the magazine under the headline “bettencourt affair: how to gain one billion (without any effort)”. has the richest woman in france been conned by the photographer [b.]? for the investigation has revealed the existence of lavish gifts, apparently totalling around 1 billion euros. “[b.] takes advantage of madame’s weakness to benefit from her generosity.” after referring to remarks by b. and by mrs bettencourt in the press, the article added: “a number of statements paint a less idyllic picture: under oath, employees and servants mentioned pressing requests for money going as far as harassment, harsh language, and various schemes bordering on the sordid. ...” he added that those statements all helped the case for the prosecution, as indicated on the magazine’s cover, “the accusations of madame’s employees”, and observed as follows:
“... the publication of long passages emanating from insiders helps to give the reported facts an appearance of authenticity and objectivity (that the article does not seek to nuance but, on the contrary, to reinforce); the reader is thus led to regard those facts as proven, because they are presented through the prism of a journalist’s analysis, which is bound to contain a degree of subjectivity or opinion. the applicants appealed on points of law. in a decision of 2 march 2010, the vice-president of the paris tribunal de grande instance, in addition to endorsing the reasoning already set out in paragraphs 31 and 32 above, took the view that the impugned publication could have the alleged effects, infringing b.’s right to a fair hearing and his right to the presumption of innocence. the judge ordered the publication of a notice inside the magazine together with an indication of it on the cover (to take up one half of the page in bold type, under the heading “judgment against le point in proceedings brought by [b.]”) and on the weekly magazine’s website. it reiterated that the witness statements, “without engaging in any extensive interpretation of [section 38]”, could be characterised as procedural documents, even though the investigation had been discontinued: “the fact that they were transmitted at the request of the private prosecutor and not on the initiative of the public prosecutor is of little relevance in this connection because they support the prosecution case”. on 9 march 2010, b. brought proceedings against the applicants on the merits before the paris tribunal de grande instance seeking redress for the damage sustained on account of the publication of the articles of 10 december 2009 and 4 february 2010, in breach of section 38(1) of the 1881 act. in a judgment of 21 june 2010, that court dismissed all of b.’s claims. it added as follows:
“... the reasoning given by the court below is tantamount to legitimising the practice, which is legally prohibited, of publishing extracts from an investigation file before they are read out in open court, first, on account of the interest of the subject, and secondly, while noting b.’s claim that his right to be presumed innocent was breached. that breach, according to the article, is exclusively based on the publication of extracts from statements which legally speaking are not addressed to journalists when they are not parties to the proceedings. the court reaches the conclusion that the date of publication, the choices of quotation, and the portrayal of [b.] as guilty according to the documents from the judicial investigation, even though it had been discontinued, had the consequence of influencing his exercise, which was legally and conventionally guaranteed, of his defence rights, which meant that before being heard by a court he should not have been portrayed as guilty of the offence of undue influence against mrs bettencourt. [

the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in cheboksary. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. on 31 january 2005 the supreme court of the chuvashiya republic quashed the district court’s judgment and remitted the matter for a new examination. on 17 october 2005 the district court gave judgment in favour of h. it was quashed on appeal by the supreme court on 14 december 2005 in particular on the ground that the parties had not been informed of the date and place of the hearing in which genetics experts had been cross-examined. in march 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of large-scale bribery. he was detained in remand prison iz-21/1 in cheboksary. on 20 march the director interviewed the applicant who declared his wish to take part in the proceedings and to defend himself in person. the applicant also claimed that he possessed new evidence he wished to submit to the court. on 26 march the district court refused the applicant leave to be present at the hearings on the ground that the code of civil procedure made no provision for bringing detainees to courts. it mentioned that the applicant was held in a remand prison, that he did not recognise the paternity and that he had “previously given similar testimony before the court”. on 16 may 2007 the supreme court rejected the applicant’s appeal. it held that the applicant’s absence from the hearing did not entail a violation of his rights because he had been represented and had previously given testimony to the court. on 9 june 2007 the applicant was released on bail. on 27 march 2008 the moskovskiy district court decided that he had breached the terms of the bail by exercising pressure on witnesses, issued a detention order and put the applicant’s name on the list of fugitives from justice. the applicant was not present at the hearing and could not be immediately re-arrested. they had been allegedly tipped off that the applicant was there. as it happened, the applicant received in-patient treatment at the infections centre but his daughter was inside. according to her, the police began banging at the door and threatened her to break in. the police entered the flat, inspected all the rooms, opened closets and boxes, lifted the sofa and bed, and then left. on the following day the applicant was arrested and placed in custody. in its view, the district court had wrongly attached decisive weight to the statements by witnesses who had not mentioned any actual threats emanating from the applicant. the applicant complained to a prosecutor about the unlawful actions of the police on 8 april 2008. on 16 may 2009 the prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings, finding that no criminal offence had been committed. the district court heard a number of witnesses. the applicant’s daughter insisted that the police officers’ presence in the flat had lasted as long as two and a half hours. he had not searched the flat or opened closets. since the russian law only established the right to compensation in case of unlawful actions, the applicant’s claim was dismissed. on 9 december 2009 the supreme court upheld the district court’s judgment on appeal. on 2 july 2009 the supreme court upheld the conviction on appeal. in the latter case, no compensation was payable.

the applicants were born in 1974, 1975 and 2003 respectively and live in ankara. the child was examined and then transferred to the sami ulus paediatric hospital, where she was treated for two years, after which the doctors decided that she should undergo heart surgery. prior to the operation, the patient’s father signed a consent form identical to the first one. after that second operation, the patient suffered an oedema, a brain haemorrhage, liver failure and muscle spasticity while in intensive care. on 6 july 2007 the applicants lodged a complaint against the doctors who had carried out the operations. it concluded that the medical team had not been guilty of negligence during the first operation. in conclusion, the investigator recommended not authorising a criminal prosecution. it is not known in what capacity the author of the report, who is a doctor, was involved or to which hospital he is attached. on 6 september 2007, as recommended by the preliminary investigation report, the governor’s office refused to authorise prosecution. concurrently with the criminal proceedings, the applicants lodged a complaint with the ankara medical association. the expert appointed by the latter submitted his report on 14 july 2008. this one-page document stated that the patient had displayed a congenital anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (alcapa), that open-heart surgery had been carried out in order to irrigate the left coronary artery from the aorta, that six months later a leak had been detected on the membrane which had been applied to the incision during that first operation, that a second operation had been carried out which had resolved that problem, but that the patient had suffered a stroke. the expert took the view that the second operation, geared to treating a foreseeable complication stemming from the first operation, had in fact been even riskier. he considered that open-heart surgery presented risks not only to the organ being operated on but also to other organs. the teams showed great efficiency and a high degree of medical expertise. on 26 march 2009 the ccgj appointed a board of experts comprising two professors and a lecturer in cardiovascular surgery from ankara university. the board of experts submitted its report on 31 july 2009. according to that report the patient had originally been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (an illness which significantly diminishes the “pumping” capacity of the heart) at ankara university hospital, and following more detailed examinations at the sami ulus hospital, alcapa, also known as bland-white-garland syndrome, had been diagnosed. the experts explained that the patient had undergone a takeuchi operation to create an intrapulmonary tunnel and that a leak had been noted on the periphery of the membrane during the check-ups conducted six months later. without treatment the mortality rate was between 80% and 90%, and those affected seldom reached adulthood. there can be no question of the doctors having committed a medical or surgical error.” the applicants contested the report, deeming it inadequate. they considered that the document, which cited scientific studies, was more like a magazine article than an expert report. it contained no concrete and objective facts about the case in hand and would not help in determining the dispute. consequently, they asked the court to commission a second expert assessment, either from a different medical board or from a specialist section of the istanbul institute of forensic sciences. with regard to the expert report of 31 july 2009 and the facts set out in the prosecution investigation file, the court held that the doctors had not been responsible for the sequelae affecting the child after her high-risk operations, to which her parents had given their consent. they also emphasised that the report had been based on the medical file and that their daughter had not been examined by the experts. furthermore, they submitted that it was not the courts’ usual practice in this type of case to confine themselves to a single expert report. their appeal was dismissed by judgment of 20 april 2010. on 7 october 2010 the court of cassation also dismissed the applicants’ application for rectification.

the applicant was born in 1961 and lives in blumau. the applicant and his former partner, s.o., have two children, born out of wedlock in 2002 and 2004 respectively. always had sole custody of the children as the parents never agreed to have joint custody. the children lived with their mother during the week. at weekends, the whole family usually stayed at the applicant’s house. and the applicant separated and the children remained with their mother. on 27 june 2008 the applicant lodged an application with the vienna inner city district court (bezirksgericht innere stadt; hereinafter, “the district court”) to transfer sole custody to him, or to grant him joint custody together with s.o. furthermore he applied for an interim measure concerning his visiting rights, as he had not seen his children since 20 april 2008. on 8 october 2008 the parents agreed that the applicant would be able to see his children every second monday from 2.30 pm or 3 pm until 6 pm and every second saturday from 10 am until 6 pm. on the same day the applicant applied for an extension of his visiting rights to the whole weekend. after five visits from the applicant in october and november 2008, s.o. unilaterally stopped further visits, claiming that these had a negative influence on the children. between november 2008 and easter 2009, on his own initiative, the applicant secretly went to see his children at their school and kindergarten a few times. the vienna juvenile court assistance office (jugendgerichtshilfe) submitted its statement on 10 march 2009 and recommended maintaining sole custody for the mother and visiting rights for the applicant according to the agreement the parents had concluded on 8 october 2008. on 6 april 2009 the district court decided to grant the applicant visiting rights on every second saturday from 8 am until 7 pm. it dismissed the applicant’s application for sole custody. in its reasoning the court held that the children were well cared for by their mother. according to article 176 of the civil code (allgemeines bürgerliches gesetzbuch) as in force at the relevant time, a transfer of custody was only possible if the children’s best interest was at risk. in the present case the court found no such risk and the applicant actually had not claimed such a risk. the court further held that the visiting rights were decided in accordance with the parents’ mutual agreement. the applicant appealed on 14 april 2009 and argued in essence that he was discriminated against, compared to the mother. also, he complained that the court had not decided on the question of whether the parents could be awarded joint custody. according to the applicant’s submissions, his visiting rights were resumed on 24 april 2009 in the amount determined by the district court (see paragraph 13 above). on 28 july 2009 the vienna regional court (landesgericht) dismissed the applicant’s appeal as unfounded. it further held that there was no provision in law ordering a preference for granting one of the parents sole custody. the court also found that the parents had not mutually agreed on joint custody, therefore no further issues arose in this connection. on 1 september 2010 the supreme court rejected the applicant’s extraordinary appeal for lack of an important issue of law. moved with the children to the south of austria, about 400 kilometers from vienna. the applicant’s requests for sole or shared custody were finally dismissed by the supreme court on 7 may 2014.
the relevant details of the application are set out in the appended table. the applicant complained of the inadequate conditions of his detention. he also raised other complaints under the provisions of the convention. the government submitted a declaration with a view to resolving the issues raised by the applicant. in particular, the government acknowledged that the conditions of the applicant’s detention in facility no. iz-42/2 in novokuznetsk had not complied with the requirements of article 3 of the convention. they offered to pay the applicant the sum of 4,480 euros and invited the court to strike the application out of the list of cases in accordance with article 37 § 1 (c) of the convention. the amount would be converted into the currency of the respondent state at the rate applicable on the date of payment, and would be payable within three months from the date of notification of the court’s judgement. in the event of failure to pay this amount within the abovementioned three-month period, the government undertook to pay simple interest on them, from the expiry of that period until settlement, at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage points. the declaration did not mention the applicant’s complaint concerning the inadequate conditions of detention in correctional colonies, no. the applicant informed the court that he agreed to the terms of the declaration.
the applicant was born in 1946 in kazakhstan. he had kazakh nationality until 1997, when he was granted russian nationality and renounced his kazakh nationality. in 2001 he moved to moscow, where he has been living ever since. eleven days later the interior department of the pavlodar region of kazakhstan placed the applicant on the international list of wanted persons. on the same day a deputy prosecutor of the pavlodarskiy region ordered his arrest. the next day the inter-district prosecutor’s office of the presnenskiy district of moscow (“the prosecutor’s office”) – relying on article 61 of the minsk convention, article 16 of the european convention on extradition and articles 97-101, and 108 of the code of criminal procedure of russia (“the ccrp”) – applied to the presnenskiy district court of moscow (“the district court”) for the authorisation of his detention pending extradition. on 25 september 2010 the district court granted the application, having found that the applicant was a national of kazakhstan and that his russian nationality had been annulled in 2006 by a court. the district court took into account the fact that the applicant had been charged with a serious criminal offence in kazakhstan and that he was a fugitive from justice. after an appeal by the applicant, the moscow city court (“the city court”) upheld the decision on 29 october 2010. in the meantime, on 19 november 2010 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 23 march 2011. it furthermore considered that the applicant’s state of health did not prevent his further detention, regard being had to the constant medical supervision and the appropriate quality of care ensured by the custodial authorities. the court refused to release him on bail, stating that if the applicant were released, it might not be possible to detain him again in the future. after an appeal by the applicant, on 22 december 2010 the city court examined the detention order. in february 2011 the applicant asked the kazakh investigative authorities to authorise his release from detention in return for a written undertaking not to leave the place of his residence. on 18 february 2011, the district court, unaware of the decision of the kazakh investigators, extended the applicant’s detention until 23 march 2011. on 14 march 2011 the city court discontinued the appeal proceedings against the detention order of 18 february 2011. at the time of his arrest the applicant was suffering from advanced hypertension, which posed a high risk of cardiovascular complications, advanced atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries, ischaemic heart disease, and other illnesses. on admission to the detention facility he was examined by a resident prison doctor, who recorded his chronic ailments but noted the absence of any acute complaints. several weeks later, on 15 november 2010, an ambulance was called after the applicant began to suffer from acute heart pain. ambulance doctors performed an electrocardiogram examination, recommended that he undergo outpatient treatment, and prescribed medication. the next day the applicant’s lawyer interviewed an anaesthetist who had treated the applicant several years previously and since then had been in contact with him and his family (apparently on an informal basis). four days later the applicant was taken to the medical unit in prison no. on 11 february 2011 the applicant was admitted to a civilian hospital in moscow. no deterioration in his condition was recorded. the applicant was released on 3 march 2011. on 6 april 2011 the interim measure was lifted by the court. several weeks later the applicant underwent successful vascular surgery in a civilian hospital. on 4 october 2011 the district court declared that the authorities had unlawfully restricted the lawyer’s access to the medical file and dismissed the remainder of the claim. the applicant had been provided with the required medical assistance in detention. it appears that the decision was not appealed against and became final.

the applicant was born in 1987 and lived in voronezh prior to her arrest. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. on 14 july 2007 the applicant, together with b., travelled to moscow by car. at about 3.40 a.m. the police stopped the car; two men from the narcotics unit approached the car and asked the passengers to step out and produce their identity documents and luggage for inspection. an officer opened the sports bag which, according to the applicant, her friend had asked her to take to another friend in moscow, and found a black plastic bag. the applicant stated that she was not aware of its contents. the applicant and b. were interviewed in separate rooms. the applicant was told to open the black bag and to show its contents. four plastic bags containing yellow and green herb and cash money were found inside. the expert later determined that the herb was marijuana having a total weight of almost three kilograms. at 6 p.m. a senior investigator of the narcotics unit instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant and b. on suspicion of attempted large‑scale sale of drugs. at 8.15 p.m. the investigator compiled the record of the applicant’s arrest. the time of arrest was given as 7.50 p.m. on 14 july 2007. on 15 july 2007 the applicant was formally charged and the investigator applied to a court for a detention order. the detention hearing before the zyuzinskiy district court in moscow began at 7.15 p.m. on 16 july 2007. however, the court did not heed that argument and ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody because the gravity of charges against her. on 19 july 2007 counsel for the applicant filed an appeal. on 25 july 2007 copies of the appeal were forwarded to the applicant and to the prosecutor for comments. the appeal hearing was initially scheduled for 22 august 2007 but subsequently adjourned for one week because one of the applicant’s representatives did not show up. the case against the applicant was referred for trial to the babushkinskiy district court in moscow. both of those witnesses – ms p. and ms a. – did not appear before the trial court. instead, a court bailiff submitted reports about his unsuccessful attempts to ensure their attendance. the reports contained the same text to the effect that the witnesses could not be reached on the phone, that no one opened the door at their residence and that neighbours had told the bailiff that they had not seen them for a long time. counsel for the applicant requested the court to obtain the visitors journal from the reception of the narcotics unit. since the unit was located within a security perimeter, all civilian visitors were to be recorded in the journal. the trial court refused the motion, without giving any reasons. it further held that there existed “exceptional circumstances” for the absence of the witnesses ms p. and ms a. and allowed their pre-trial statements to be read out, overriding the objections from the defence. by judgment of 8 april 2008, the district court found the applicant and b. guilty as charged and sentenced each of them to eight years’ imprisonment in a high-security correctional colony. it held in particular that the applicant’s claim that she did not know she was carrying marijuana in her friend’s bag was refuted by the seizure report of 14 july 2007 and the statements by the witnesses ms p. and ms a. 19. on 28 july 2008 the moscow city court examined and rejected her appeal against the conviction.
the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. in 1994, the applicant was convicted of theft and given a two-year custodial sentence conditional on one year’s probation. however, the court applied a general amnesty act and the applicant’s conviction, including the probation period, was spent with immediate effect. less than one year later, on 29 may 1995, a different court convicted the applicant of aggravated robbery and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment. considering that the applicant had breached the terms of his probation by committing a new offence, the court ordered the suspended sentence to be activated and increased the total length of the sentence by one year. on 11 december 2001 the presidium of the omsk regional court acknowledged that the 1995 judgment had been unlawful in the part relating to the increase of the final sentence in connection with the prior conviction that had already been spent. the length of the sentence was varied to six years’ imprisonment, calculated from 2 january 1995 which was the date of the applicant’s arrest. given that the applicant had already spent more than six years in detention, the presidium ordered his immediate release. the applicant unsuccessfully tried several avenues for claiming compensation for his unlawful detention during eleven months and fourteen days. he sought first to exercise the “right to rehabilitation” under the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 13 below). on 5 august 2003 the oktyabrskiy district court in omsk rejected his application, pointing out that the “right to rehabilitation” only accrued to those who have been acquitted or exonerated which was not the applicant’s case. the applicant did not appeal against that decision. the applicant also tried to initiate criminal proceedings against judge b. who had given the judgment of 29 may 1995. his criminal-law complaint was rejected on the ground that the limitation period had expired. finally, the applicant filed a civil claim for compensation under the tort provisions of the civil code (see paragraph 14 below). on 20 december 2005 the tsentralniy district court in omsk rejected his claim, finding that paragraph 1 of article 1070 did not apply because the applicant had been found guilty rather than acquitted and that the special condition of applicability of paragraph 2 – the criminal conviction of the judge – was not fulfilled. on 14 june 2006 the omsk regional court rejected an appeal against that decision.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in šiauliai. arrived at a petrol station near the town of skuodas. when the applicant tried to help his friend, the men punched the applicant in the face and head several times, causing him to fall to the ground, where they kicked him in the head. was identified and notified of the same suspicion. he claimed 10,000 lithuanian litai (ltl – approximately 2,896 euros (eur)) in pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages jointly from all the suspects. were notified that they were also suspected of causing negligible health impairment or physical pain to other persons by violent acts, contrary to article 140 § 1 of the criminal code (see paragraph 25 below). on 16 july 2007 the suspects and the victims were informed that the pre-trial investigation had been completed. charging them with the crimes set out in articles 140 § 1 and 284 § 1 of the criminal code. on 18 december 2008 the applicant was examined by a court medical expert. the court considered that the charges had been proven by victim and witness testimony, the confessions of the accused, and the video recording from the petrol station’s camera. were given suspended prison sentences ranging from twelve to eighteen months. the klaipėda regional court held that the district court had not based its judgment on circumstances examined at the hearing but solely on the description of the charges in the indictment. it also held that the district court had not assessed all the testimony and other evidence in detail and had not explained why some evidence had been considered reliable and some not. as a result, the case was remitted to the skuodas district court for re-examination. on an unspecified date the prosecutor amended the indictment and charged e.g., r.b. on 5 may 2011 a different panel of the skuodas district court, after re-examining the case, convicted e.g., r.b. of the charges against them and gave them suspended prison sentences ranging from twelve to eighteen months. the convicted persons and one of the victims, j.j., appealed against the district court’s judgment. had disturbed public order, as submitted in the amended indictment. rather, the district court had examined whether r.b. on 26 march 2012 a different panel of the skuodas district court held that the five-year statute of limitations (see paragraph 26 below) had expired and discontinued the case as time-barred, leaving the victims’ civil claims unexamined. however, on 28 june 2012 the klaipėda regional court dismissed their appeal, finding that the legal classification of charges was the prerogative of the prosecutor and that the code of criminal procedure did not provide for any possibility to continue criminal proceedings after the expiry of the statute of limitations. after the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings, the applicant submitted a civil claim against e.g., r.b. he also claimed ltl 300,000 (approximately eur 86,886) in non-pecuniary damages. on 20 february 2013 the skuodas district court granted the applicant’s civil claim in part. had caused damage to the applicant by their deliberate actions. the applicant appealed against that judgment, and on 4 july 2013 the klaipėda regional court partly upheld his appeal. it found that the district court had erred in refusing to award the applicant pecuniary damages related to the legal costs which he had incurred in the criminal proceedings, and granted him ltl 5,000 (approximately eur 1,448) under that head, thereby increasing the total amount of pecuniary damages to ltl 5,124.45 (approximately eur 1,484). the amount of non-pecuniary damages was left unchanged.
the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. on 25 march 1996 the applicant brought a compensation claim for damages suffered as a consequence of an expropriation of his property against the municipality of bar and one of the local primary schools before the court of first instance (osnovni sud) in bar. on 11 april 1996 the applicant’s representative informed the court of first instance that he had initiated a separate set of proceedings to determine the value of the above-mentioned damages. the court of first instance suspended the above mentioned civil proceedings pending the final resolution of this matter. no document was submitted by the parties as to whether or not the compensation proceedings have ended in the meantime. accordingly, it would appear that the said two sets of proceedings are still pending before the court of first instance. on 2 february 2004 the applicant instituted proceedings before the court of first instance in bar, against his neighbour, seeking a demarcation between their two plots of land. on 25 march 2004 the applicant amended his proposal to this effect. on 14 september 2004 the applicant and the respondent reached a friendly settlement which was approved by the court of first instance on the same day.
the applicants were born in 1966, 1967, 1988 and 2003 respectively and live in blagoevgrad. the first and second applicants are cohabiting partners and the fourth applicant is their daughter. the third applicant is the second applicant’s son. at the relevant time all the applicants were living together. he needs assistance for most daily activities, which is usually provided by the second applicant or his care assistant. according to the applicants, the care assistant, who was specially trained and had taken care of the first applicant for many years, was the only person with whom the latter felt secure when he needed to go out of his home, in particular to go to his office, as this involved the assistant carrying him and installing him in a car. one of his activities was giving short-term loans at high interest rates. in 2010 the prosecution authorities opened criminal proceedings against the first applicant for usury. on 7 april 2011, at about 11 a.m., the first applicant, while travelling in his car which was being driven by his care assistant, was stopped by police officers and ordered to follow them to the police station. upon arrival, his care assistant was arrested. the car remained in the carpark and the first applicant remained in it. unable to move, he stayed in that position for several hours, guarded by two police officers. the operation against him had been planned in advance. the applicant was invited to make a declaration in relation to the charges; he stated that he was not guilty. they gave up, after becoming aware that they could hurt him. after that his care assistant, still in detention, was again brought out under guard. the applicant’s care assistant was released on 8 april 2011 and has not been questioned any further or prosecuted. who stated that she was the first applicant’s sister and a neurologist and gave evidence concerning the applicant’s state of health. according to reports published in the bulgarian media, in november 2016 he was indicted and is standing trial at present. the observance of the first applicant’s house arrest was supervised by the police. between 8 and 14 april 2011 there were no checks on whether he was complying with the measure. when asked to provide an explanation, he stated that he had gone out to buy something. between 16 april and 27 may 2011 police officers visited the applicants’ home to check on the first applicant on twenty-nine occasions, once a day and almost every day. on eight days there were no checks at all, and on another four days officers did not go to the applicants’ flat, but observed for some time the building’s entrance. on 29 april 2011 the applicant was met by officers in front of the building as he arrived in his car. on 3 june they visited the flat five times; on one of the visits nobody answered the doorbell. between 4 and 20 june 2011 officers visited the applicants’ flat usually three or four times a day. one of the visits on 16 june was provoked by the fact that the applicant, having received authorisation to visit a physiotherapist, had not shown up for his appointment. usually she was taken by her mother to another room. the third applicant, then twenty-three years old, was working full time during this period.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in los angeles. after the grandfather’s death the applicant’s uncle lived with his family on the first floor of the house, while the applicant’s family lived on the second floor. the entrance to the house is common to the occupants of the first and second floors, and there is a common plot of land adjacent to it. the notary then issued a certificate of inheritance and the state real estate registry registered his title in respect of the second floor of the house. sold the first floor of the house to e.t., who registered her title in respect of the first floor. and her family carried out construction works in the house and on the plot of land adjacent to it, modifying both the house and the surrounding area. they have built and are running a restaurant there. in her turn lodged a counterclaim against the applicant, seeking to annul the will and the subsequent registration of his title as regards the plot of land adjacent to the house. by a judgment of 1 july 2003 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan (երևան քաղաքի կենտրոն և նորք-մարաշ համայնքների առաջին ատյանի դատարան – “the district court”) partially allowed the applicant’s claim and dismissed e.t. on 22 august 2003 the civil court of appeal (հհ քաղաքացիական գործերով վերաքննիչ դատարան) re-examined the case on the merits. ’s appeal on points of law and upheld the judgment of the court of appeal. thereafter the head of the kentron division of the state real estate registry (անշարժ գույքի կադաստրի պետական կոմիտեի կենտրոն տարածքային ստորաբաժանում) requested the civil court of appeal to clarify the judgment of 22 august 2003. on 22 october 2004 the civil court of appeal issued a clarification of the above-mentioned judgment. it stated, in particular, that the title to the plot of land adjacent to the house was to be registered in the applicant’s name. this decision became final and was also submitted for enforcement. and other persons who were unlawfully occupying his property, and to terminate the activities of the restaurant situated therein. by the judgment of 28 august 2006 the district court allowed the applicant’s claim in its entirety. it stated, in particular, that the applicant’s title was to be registered in respect of the plot of land adjacent to the house and the constructions situated therein, that e.t. this judgment became final and binding on the day of its delivery and on 26 january 2007 enforcement proceedings were instituted in its respect. it appears that she has also failed to pay the fines. it appears that at some point the proceedings were resumed. by a letter of 25 december 2008 the minister of justice informed the applicant’s lawyer that the kentron division of the state real estate registry had justified the non-registration of the applicant’s title in respect of his property by pointing to the fact that the constructions situated therein had not been demolished because the deja did not have the appropriate technical equipment and workforce at its disposal. as a result, criminal proceedings were instituted against the bailiffs and officials of the kentron division of the state real estate registry. had been fined for not complying with the requirements of the judicial acts in question. the prosecutor appealed against the above-mentioned decision of the district court. as a result, the criminal proceedings were resumed on 14 may 2008. thereafter, the criminal proceedings were again terminated three times, namely on 14 june 2008, 17 july 2009 and 23 april 2010. according to the applicant, he did not pursue this last complaint any further. according to the latest information received from the applicant, the enforcement proceedings were closed on 5 september 2016 because the enforcement of the judgments was impossible.
the applicant company is the publisher of an irish daily newspaper, the herald. when he was appointed in mid-2002 to the more senior political post of minister for the environment, heritage and local government, ms l. was then hired as a consultant by that government department, and was still working for it at the time the articles appeared. the evening herald called into question the manner in which the tendering procedure had been conducted, the qualifications of ms l. for the work involved, the high level of remuneration she received, as well as the amount of work that was in fact done by ms l. it referred to eight trips abroad on which ms l. had been part of the ministerial entourage, in particular a trip to new york to attend a united nations conference. one of the front page articles was accompanied by a large photomontage containing the same image of ms l. in evening wear, but modified to suggest that the skirt had a slit that reached almost to her hip. the issue of the contracts awarded to ms l. was taken up by other parts of the irish media, and led to questions in the irish parliament (dáil éireann). ms l. sued the applicant company for defamation. the case was heard before a jury in the high court over seven days in june 2009. the trial judge did not give any specific guideline to the jury regarding the appropriate level of compensation, stressed the limited nature of the guidelines he could provide and indicated, in broad terms, that, when assessing damages the jury must bear in mind reality, the current times, the cost of living and the value of money. he added a cautionary note:
“on one famous occasion i told a jury that the plaintiff, if he won, hadn’t won the [national lottery] and they immediately awarded a million euro. i can’t give you a range of figures, i am not permitted to give you a range of figures. i can give you what help i can, and i will, in coming to an appropriate figure for damages. you must also be fair to the defendant too ...[y]ou must consider the defendant as well because your decision must be a fair decision and must be fair to both parties. ... you must come to a figure that is an appropriate figure and that is, i fully realise, ... not an easy thing to do. he contended that no figure should have been suggested. he observed to counsel:
“i do find myself in difficulties because of the supreme court’s ruling [in the de rossa case] in that i can’t even indicate to a jury upper and lower in the most general terms, which i would like to be able to do because i think it would save a lot of trouble and i can’t do it because of the decision of the supreme court.” in the event that the supreme court set aside the award of damages on appeal, ms l. sought to have the matter remitted to the high court for a fresh assessment by a new jury. nor did she accept that the relevant legal test should be whether a reasonable jury would have thought such an award necessary to compensate the plaintiff and to re-establish her reputation. she agreed that the comparison might provide some assistance in assessing the gravity of the libel. the allegation of adultery must have been a course of real hurt and distress to her. it was a sustained campaign over a number of days. ms l. had gone from being unknown to the public to being notorious. the third factor was the conduct of the defendant. it had run a defence of justification that the jury had rejected. ms l. had received personal abuse in her hometown. overall, the articles had had a profound effect on her in every aspect of her family and professional life, which was a consideration that was also relevant to the jury’s award. a somewhat unusual feature of this case was the sustained campaign in the evening herald in respect of ms. i have no doubt that from her point of view it was a very serious matter. whilst i understand those to be her instructions i am satisfied that in the context of this case it would be desirable for all parties to bring an end to the litigation between the parties and in those circumstances it seems to me that the approach to be taken by the court should be to set aside the verdict of the jury on damages and to substitute a sum in the figure of €1,250,000 for damages.” therefore, an award will not be disturbed easily or second guessed purely to fine tune it.” according to the applicant company, this came to eur 240,448.16.

the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in warsaw. on 11 february 2004 the applicant was charged with domestic violence. on 27 february 2004 a bill of indictment in respect of the applicant was lodged with the warsaw district court. subsequently, on an unknown date the case was returned to the prosecution authorities in order to amend the charges. however, he refused to stay and left the waiting room. on the same day he was ordered to come to the hospital on 18 april 2005, on pain of detention on remand. on 18 april 2005 the applicant came to the hospital. however, he refused to stay for the assessment, explaining that he had many urgent matters to attend to. on 7 june 2005 the warsaw district court ordered the applicant’s detention on remand in accordance with articles 249 § 1 and 258 § 1 (1) and (2) of the code of criminal procedure (“the ccp”) (see paragraphs 25 and 26 below). in addition, there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would obstruct the proceedings or that he would go into hiding. the court noted the applicant’s parents’ submissions that his mental condition was bad, he was not able to function independently and he was in need of urgent medical assistance. the court also attached importance to the fact that the applicant had previously behaved in a similar manner. he had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital on 23 october 2001, however the next day he had left the hospital on his own initiative. an appeal lodged by the applicant was dismissed by the warsaw regional court on 20 september 2005. the court relied on the grounds previously given. the applicant unsuccessfully appealed against all those decisions. the applicant underwent this assessment between 21 november 2005 and 1 february 2006. the applicant was charged with domestic violence and possession of 1.15 grams of marijuana. on 16 february 2006 the warsaw district court again extended the applicant’s detention (until 4 may 2006). the applicant was released from detention on the same day. subsequently, on 5 april 2006, the applicant’s mother also refused to testify. the warsaw district court held further hearings on 27 april, 7 july and 16 october 2006 and on 24 january and 12 march 2007. on 12 march 2007 the warsaw district court gave judgment, acquitting the applicant on charges of domestic violence and convicting him of possession of a small amount of marijuana. the court sentenced the applicant to five months’ imprisonment stayed for three years. following an appeal by the applicant, the judgment was quashed (in its part concerning possession of drugs) by the warsaw regional court on 9 august 2007. he stated that while the main reason for his detention on remand had been a six-week psychiatric assessment, he had been kept in detention for nearly one year. moreover, the assessment had begun only five months after his arrest. it further noted that in the present case there had been no breach of procedural provisions of the ccp since the detention on remand had been applied mainly in view of the applicant’s repeated refusal to comply with the courts’ orders. furthermore, there had been a risk that he could have gone into hiding. lastly, the court noted that as soon as the applicant’s parents and sister had refused to testify, the applicant had been released.
on 9 march 1966 the municipality of ohrid appropriated from several individuals the right of use of nationalised building land (одземање од понатамошно користење на градежно национализирано земјиште) located in an area e. the land in question included a plot owned by the applicant’s legal predecessor, measuring 764 sq. on 10 october 2002 he requested its restitution. an expert had carried out an on-site inspection and had established that the land in question had been undeveloped building land and was part of the ohrid lakeshore strip (крајбрежен појас на охридското езеро). on 4 and 9 june 2003 the state archives and the ohrid court of first instance informed the restitution commission that they had no information as to whether any compensation had been paid to the applicant’s predecessor for the appropriated land. by a letter of 26 august 2003 the municipality of ohrid confirmed that neither the applicant nor his predecessor had sought compensation for the appropriated land. accordingly, it became final on 29 october 2003. on 9 april 2004 the land was restored to the applicant’s possession (предавање во владение). the minutes drawn by the restitution commission stated that, although properly summoned, the solicitor general did not attend the commission’s meeting. as stipulated in the minutes, the plot in question had been given to the association for its use even earlier, on 9 march 1966. the solicitor general argued that the association had submitted documentary evidence that contradicted the facts established by the restitution commission in that the land had been in use by the association and that compensation had been paid to the applicant’s predecessor. he further denied that any compensation had been paid to his predecessor or him. it determined that the land was intended for the construction of “beach service facilities and a leisure centre”, which could not be considered as being of public interest. accordingly, possession of it could be restored (може да биде предмет на реално враќање). the relevant part of the judgment reads as follows:
“in the court’s opinion, in deciding the present case, the [appeal commission] acted correctly when it declared null and void the final restitution order, in accordance with section 267(1)(3) of the administrative proceedings act, under which a decision whose enforcement is not possible shall be declared null and void. the supreme court held that the impugned judgment had predated 25 september 2009, the day when it had become competent to decide administrative actions in the second instance. that decision was confirmed on appeal by the supreme court in a decision of 23 june 2010. on 19 july 2010 the applicant applied to the public prosecutor (јавен обвинител на република македонија) seeking that protection of legality proceedings (барање за заштита на законитост) be instituted regarding the judgment of the administrative court of 4 september 2009, as well as regarding the rejection of his request for the reopening of the proceedings. on 16 june 2011, the applicant lodged an administrative action with the administrative court, challenging that decision. on 25 may 2012 the restitution commission, after having made a fresh on-site inspection, upheld the applicant’s restitution request. on 25 july 2013 the solicitor general lodged an appeal against the latter judgment with the higher administrative court (виш управен суд). on 26 june 2014 the higher administrative court quashed the judgment and remitted the proceedings. the applicant’s daughter, asked the restitution commission to stay the proceedings. on 22 september 2014 the restitution commission decided to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the civil and the inheritance proceedings. it appears that the civil and the inheritance proceedings are still pending. in a separate set of proceedings concerning the same plot of land on 17 september 2009 the bitola court of appeal overturned the lower court’s decision and finally upheld the applicant’s action for protection from disturbance of possession (смеќавање на владение) against the association which ran the camp regarding the same plot of land. it ordered the association to refrain from further disturbances. according to a document from the land registry dated 3 september 2010, the historical records of the plot of land show that the association was granted use of the plot as of 9 march 1966. on 30 august and 4 november 2010, and 30 march and 10 august 2011 the applicant made additional submissions to the court, including evidence, which were added to the case file. according to him, it had never been argued by the state that these neighbouring plots had been of public interest. it cannot be ascertained whether any of those proceedings ended finally in the respective plaintiffs’ favour.
in 1995 dr marija arsovska, a psychiatrist whose name at the time was marija karanfilova (“the psychiatrist”), established a private practice called dr marija karanfilova’s independent psychiatric practice (самостојна специјалистичка ординација по невропсихијатрија „д-р марија каранфилова„ – “the practice”) where she treated people using carl jung’s analytical psychotherapy methods. the practice was assigned an individual tax number beginning with the numbers 503. on 15 february 2006 the ministry of health’s state sanitation and health inspectorate (“the inspectorate”) conducted an on-site inspection (инспекциски надзор). it ordered the practice to re-register as a private health institution in order to comply with amendments to the health protection act of 2004 (закон за изменување и дополнување на законот за здравствена заштита, official gazette no. in compliance with the inspectorate’s orders, the psychiatrist applied to the ministry of health to have the practice re-registered and to change its name, as required by the new statutory provisions. the decision was delivered to several institutions, including the fund. the inspectorate conducted a fresh on-site inspection on 6 march 2006. it concluded that the practice had fully complied with its decision of 15 february 2006, including the instructions for re-registration. on 17 april 2006 the central registry recorded the registration of the new practice as of 29 march 2006. it was given a new individual tax number, beginning with the numbers 403. on 6 june 2006 the new practice notified the fund about the changes in its registration, including the change of its name. on 29 november 2006 the fund notified the new practice that it did not intend to sign a new contract after the expiry of the previous one. on 2 august 2007, on the basis of a request by the new practice, the central registry allowed the new practice to change from being a private health institution to one that was a limited liability company established by a single person (дооел) and entered that transformation in its records. the applicant company was known officially as the centre for the development of analytical psychology ltd. ( центар за развој на аналитичка психологија – дооел). it kept the same tax number as the new practice. the link between the new practice and the applicant company was not disputed in the impugned proceedings (see below). on 25 january 2006 the practice initiated compensation proceedings against the fund in the skopje court of first instance (основен суд скопје) for non-adherence to the terms of the contract. both the new practice and the applicant company continued the proceedings as the claimant. on 10 june 2008 the first-instance court granted the claim in part. it argued that the claimant was a different legal entity than the one which had signed the contract with the fund in 2004, as evident in the two entities’ different individual tax numbers. it also argued that the fund had implicitly recognised the legal continuity of the two entities as it had accepted reports submitted by the new practice under the contract of 2004 and had given notice of the termination of the contract to the new practice. the skopje court of appeal (апелационен суд скопје) on 28 january 2009 granted the fund’s appeal and remitted the case for fresh consideration. it established that the contract had been signed by the fund and dr marija karanfilova’s independent psychiatric practice and that the applicant company could not be considered as the practice’s legal successor as they had different individual tax numbers. the applicant company appealed, complaining that the first-instance court had disregarded the evidence that had shown the existence of a legal relationship between the parties and had based its assessment solely on the different tax numbers. the applicant company alleged that the formalistic approach of the first-instance court had meant its claim had remained undecided on the merits. on 2 december 2009 the skopje court of appeal dismissed the applicant company’s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment. at a hearing held on 27 june 2008 the fund raised an objection that the applicant company lacked standing in the proceedings. on 11 december 2009 the skopje court of appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant company and upheld the first-instance judgment. it stressed that a tax number was a unique attribute of a particular entity and would remain unchanged, regardless of any structural or other changes to the entity.
the applicants were born in 1974, 1984, and 1977 respectively. the first and the third applicants live in moscow, and the second applicant lives in gryazy, lipetsk region. they were each found guilty of the administrative offence of “public activities aimed at the promotion of homosexuality among minors” (публичные действия, направленные на пропаганду гомосексуализма среди несовершеннолетних). on 4 december 2008 the ryazan regional duma adopted the law on administrative offences, which introduced administrative liability for public activities aimed at the promotion of homosexuality among minors. on 30 march 2009 the first applicant held a static demonstration (“picket”, пикетирование) in front of a secondary school in ryazan, holding two banners which stated “homosexuality is normal” and “i am proud of my homosexuality”. he was charged with an administrative offence for doing so. on 6 april 2009 the justice of the peace of circuit no. he was ordered to pay a fine of 1,500 russian roubles (rub, equivalent to about 34 euros (eur)). on 14 may 2009 the oktyabrskiy district court dismissed the first applicant’s appeal. the amended law prohibited public activities aimed at the promotion of homosexuality among minors. on 21 november 2011 the arkhangelsk regional assembly of deputies passed amendments to the regional law on administrative offences. the amendments introduced administrative liability for public activities aimed at the promotion of homosexuality among minors. the second applicant was holding a banner stating “russia has the world’s highest rate of teenage suicide. this number includes a large proportion of homosexuals. they take this step because of the lack of information about their nature. great people are also sometimes gay; gay people also become great. both applicants were arrested and escorted to the police station, where administrative offence reports were drawn up. on 3 february 2012 the justice of the peace of circuit no. 6 of the oktyabrskiy district of arkhangelsk found the second and the third applicants guilty of a breach of section 2.13 § 1 of the arkhangelsk law on administrative offences. the second applicant was ordered to pay a fine of rub 1,800 (about eur 45), and the third applicant was fined rub 2,000 (about eur 50). on 22 march 2012 the oktyabrskiy district court of arkhangelsk dismissed both applicants’ appeals. on 12 april 2012 the third applicant held a demonstration in front of the st petersburg city administration, holding up a banner with a popular quote from a famous soviet-era actress faina ranevskaya: “homosexuality is not a perversion. he was arrested by the police and escorted to the police station, where an administrative offence report was drawn up. he had to pay a fine of rub 5,000 (about eur 130). on an unspecified date the first and the third applicants brought proceedings before the constitutional court of the russian federation. he challenged the compatibility of section 7 of the law on administrative offences in st petersburg with the constitution. ...
however, this does not rule out a need to define – on the basis of a balancing exercise with regard to the competing constitutional values – the limits of the given individuals’ effective practice of their rights and freedoms, in order not to infringe the rights and freedoms of others. on 23 september 2014 the constitutional court examined the complaint on the merits and dismissed it, for the following reasons:
“... citizens’ enjoyment of the right to disseminate information concerning the question of an individual’s sexual self-determination ought not to infringe the rights and freedoms of others; in regulating of this right by means of legislation, it is necessary to ensure that a balance is struck between the values protected by the constitution. ...
the aim pursued by the federal legislature in establishing the given norm was to protect children from the impact of information that could lead them into non-traditional sexual relations, a predilection for which would prevent them from building family relationships as these are traditionally understood in russia and expressed in the constitution of the russian federation. the prohibition on public activities in relation to minors is intended to prevent their attention being increasingly focused on issues concerning sexual relations, which are capable, in unfavourable circumstances, of deforming significantly the child’s understanding of such constitutional values as the family, motherhood, fatherhood and childhood, and adversely affecting not only his or her psychological state and development, but also his or her social adaptation.
the applicant is an eritrean national and was born in 1990. he grew up in eritrea and currently lives in switzerland. the applicant entered switzerland illegally on 23 june 2014 and applied for asylum the next day. during all three hearings an interpreter was present and the record was translated for the applicant prior to his signing it. he had managed to escape from prison one night when the guards were asleep. he had been picked up by ethiopian soldiers the next day. the applicant further stated that he was married and had a son born in october 2012. when confronted with the discrepancy in comparison with his previous account in that regard, he stated that he might have made a mistake in the first interview. he did not recall any rules other than fixed meal times and being brought outside in the mornings and evenings to relieve himself. they had walked towards mereb, but had lost their way as it was night-time. the applicant claimed that he had always been in good health. the applicant was heard for a third time by the state secretariat for migration on 29 january 2016. again, a member of a non-governmental organisation was present as a neutral witness, who did not note down any observations relating to irregularities. the interviewer explicitly advised the applicant that the interview was taking place to give him another opportunity to describe his departure from eritrea, and that the account he had so far provided in this regard would probably be dismissed as not credible, which would result in the conclusion that he had left the country legally. the applicant responded that he had spent two days at his parents’ home in a. after escaping from prison. his family had contacted a people smuggler from the mereb area. on 8 march 2016 the state secretariat for migration rejected the applicant’s asylum request and ordered his departure from switzerland. the state secretariat for migration pointed out that the applicant had stated in the first hearing that he had been detained for a period of one year and three months, from june 2012 to september 2013, whereas in the second hearing he had said that he had been detained for seven months, from march to october 2013. nor had he provided a consistent account in that regard. shortly after reporting for duty, he had attempted to escape. he had been caught and, as a result, detained in march 2013. they had been apprehended by ethiopian soldiers early in the morning of 4 october 2013 and taken to endabaguna. furthermore, it was comprehensible that he could not give a detailed account about things which he had learned during that training, given that he had attempted to escape almost immediately after reporting for duty. he emphasised that the interviewer had not questioned him about his scars, which he alleged were the result of that incident, or about specific events surrounding his escape from prison, pointing out that the latter issue had been raised by the representative of the non-governmental organisation who had been present as a neutral witness at the second hearing. it was only logical that he could not make detailed statements about the area, as he had no knowledge of that area and had fled during the night. he could also recall the exact words in amharic used by the ethiopian soldiers when they had been apprehended. referring to a letter from unhcr – the original of which he presented – stating that he was registered in the hitsas refugee camp in ethiopia on 8 november 2013, and to the fact that crossing the border to enter ethiopia by land was always unlawful (see paragraph 49 below), he argued that he had proved his illegal exit from eritrea. in conclusion, the applicant argued that he was a refugee as defined in section 3 of the asylum act, on account of his fear of ill-treatment for having deserted from military service. they were issued to a few people who were considered loyal, in exchange for payment of significant sums. the eritrean government viewed illegal exits as an indication of political opposition, and tried to get both the reduction in defence readiness and the mass exodus under control through draconian measures.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in berezniki, perm region, together with her son, born in 2001. at the material time the applicant was teaching physical education in a secondary school in berenzniki. the booklet consisted of six pages, including the cover page. at the bottom of the cover page, just under the photograph were the words: “centre for psychological, medical and social support, town of usoliye”. they explained what kind of support and advice families could seek in the centre and how they could help orphans. on the last page the following was written:
“if you wish to save a child from loneliness and give him a hearth and home, come to us!” in total, 200 copies of the booklet had been published. it was impossible to establish from which website the photograph of the child had been taken. in march 2008 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against the centre before the usolskiy district court, perm region (“the district court”) on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor son. in her statement of claim the applicant complained that her and her son’s honour, dignity and reputation had been damaged by the unlawful publication of her son’s photograph in a booklet calling for adoption. in particular, the photograph had been published without her authorisation and knowledge. had not informed the applicant of his intentions or the ways in which the photograph might be further used. mr p. submitted to the court that in 2004 he had gone travelling together with his friend sh., had sent him electronic copies of those photographs and since that time they had been saved in his computer. the text and some photographs had been provided by the centre. the representative of the centre, acting as a third party, submitted that the use of the photograph of the applicant’s son had not been agreed with the centre. he also submitted that the booklet did not call for adoption; it was intended to provide information about the centre. it appears from the record of the court hearings that the applicant’s representative, g., submitted to the court that it had been established that the photograph of the applicant’s son had been used on the booklet without his parent’s consent, contrary to the requirements of article 152.1 of the civil code. on 20 june 2008 the district court examined and dismissed the applicant’s claims. in the subjective view of the witnesses, the booklet in itself had a positive scope. the court takes into account that on several occasions in 2004 the plaintiff authorised mr sh., a photographer familiar to her, to take photographs of her son. mrs bogomolova did not place any restrictions or conditions on the use of those photographs, did not seek to find out what had happened to those photographs. in addition, it follows from witness statements that after publication of the booklet, the plaintiff showed it to persons around her and at her workplace and annotated it in an emotionally skewed way, and thus disseminated false information about herself and her son with reference to the photograph [on the booklet]. ...
taking into account that it has not been established in the court hearing that there was any information discrediting the honour, dignity and reputation of the plaintiff and her minor son, her claims of compensation for non-pecuniary damage should be dismissed. on 25 june 2008 the applicant resigned from her job. the booklet had been distributed in several towns in the perm region, including usoliye, where her parents lived, and berezniki, where she and her son lived. she had worked for a long time in those towns and a lot of people knew her and her family. she had had to explain to her neighbours, friends and colleagues that her family was doing well and that her son was living with her. she had not raised any claims on the grounds contained in article 152.1 of the civil code.
the applicant was born in zimbabwe and lives in london. in or around 2003 he began suffering from a mental illness which led to his hearing voices in his head and at least two suicide attempts. he was also convicted of resisting or obstructing a police officer and failing to surrender to custody. on 18 april 2005 the applicant made an application for asylum. notice of this decision was served on the applicant on 27 june 2005. on the same day, he was served with notice of liability to removal as an overstayer. the applicant did not appeal against this decision. when he subsequently failed to comply with his reporting conditions he was treated as an absconder. he did not appeal against conviction or sentence. this was the first time he had received any treatment for his mental illness as he had previously declined to engage with psychiatrists and other health care professionals. in doing so, he described two violent incidents he had experienced in zimbabwe: first, he claimed that in 2000 he had been attacked by zanu-pf supporters with knives, sticks and sandbags while protesting about gay rights; and secondly, he claimed that later that same year he had been arrested for demonstrating and beaten on his back and the soles of his feet while detained at a police station. on 20 february 2009 the applicant was admitted to hospital for a psychiatric assessment and was sectioned for six days after his mental health deteriorated significantly. on 26 may 2009, a further asylum interview took place following which the applicant submitted further evidence in support of his claim. on 3 november 2009 the applicant’s representatives asked the government to allow them more time to submit medical evidence supporting the applicant’s second asylum claim. the government did not indicate whether they responded to this request. on 10 june 2010 the secretary of state telephoned the applicant’s representatives again to ask what their intentions were regarding the medical report. the letter stated that his detention was unlawful and that he should be released. the representatives sent a second letter to the secretary of state on 8 july 2010, in which they again requested that the applicant be released due to his medical conditions and pursuant to the secretary of state’s policy on not detaining mentally ill persons. on 28 august 2010 the applicant was examined by dr s. and her expert report, dated 3 october 2010, was sent to the secretary of state on 22 november 2010. he was being treated but still experienced some symptoms, including auditory hallucinations and ideas of reference. the applicant also claimed damages for unlawful detention. the applicant’s appeal was dismissed on 7 april 2011. on 4 may he was refused permission to appeal against that decision. b.  the 2nd and 3rd principles are not infringed. the dangers of absconscion and reoffending are and have always been real in view of the claimant’s behaviour between july 2005 and his arrest in respect of the drugs matter. the applicant was released from detention on 15 september 2011 after being granted bail by the upper tribunal. on 22 february 2012 the court of appeal, civil division refused the applicant permission to appeal the decision of 31 october 2011, finding that the high court had been correct on every point. on 28 april 2012 the secretary of state agreed that the decision of 8 february 2011 refusing the applicant’s asylum claim was flawed and that the case should be remitted to the upper tribunal. on 30 january 2013 the deportation order was revoked and the applicant was subsequently granted discretionary leave until 25 september 2013. according to the observations submitted, a decision on that application remains outstanding.
on 11 december 2002 the applicant instituted proceedings for restitution of a hotel in skopje which had been confiscated from his predecessor in 1948. on 7 june 2004 a commission responsible for such matters within the ministry of finance dismissed the applicant’s claim. on 16 november 2004 a second-instance commission set up within the government dismissed his appeal. subsequently, the case went back and forth several times between the administrative bodies and courts at two levels of jurisdiction. the proceedings are currently pending before the higher administrative court, awaiting a decision on an appeal by the applicant of 26 january 2016 against a judgment of the administrative court. on 3 july 2014 the applicant applied to the supreme court for a ruling that the length of the restitution proceedings had been excessive, to award him compensation and set a three-month time-limit for the court dealing with his case to decide on his restitution claim. by letters dispatched between 8 july 2014 (received on 3 september 2014) and 20 january 2015, the supreme court requested the case file from the administrative court. the case file, which was with the administrative bodies, was forwarded to the supreme court on 13 february 2015. on 28 april 2015 the first-instance panel of the supreme court found that the relevant period to be taken into consideration had started to run on 16 november 2004 (see paragraph 6 above). it further established that the case had not been complex and that there had been no delays attributable to the applicant. it concluded that there had been a violation of the applicant’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time and awarded him the equivalent of 810 euros (eur) in compensation. by a letter of 3 june 2015 (received on 10 august 2015), the supreme court asked the ministry of justice to provide assistance in delivering its decision because the applicant lived in serbia. between 25 august and 21 december 2015, the ministry of justice of the respondent state asked, on three occasions, that the relevant ministry in serbia serve the supreme court’s decision on the applicant. by a letter of 28 december 2015 (received on 10 march 2016), the ministry of justice of serbia informed the relevant ministry of the respondent state about the date of service of the supreme court’s decision to the applicant. in an appeal against the supreme court’s decision of 28 april 2015, the applicant complained that it had taken too long for that court to decide on his application. he referred to section 36(4) of the courts act, which required the supreme court to decide on a length of proceedings remedy within six months (see paragraph 14 below). he also complained that the amount of compensation awarded to him had been too low. on 21 march 2016 the second-instance panel of the supreme court ruled partly in favour of the applicant. it endorsed the findings of the first-instance panel regarding the complexity of the case and that no delays were attributable to the applicant, found that the proceedings had lasted for ten years, five months and twelve days and set compensation at the equivalent of eur 1,050.
the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in ossès. on 17 january 2008 he attended a rally organised by a basque agricultural trade union and by the gfam (a mutual-benefit land alliance), the “lurra”, on the occasion of a meeting of the technical committee of the land use and rural settlement corporation (safer) in the pyrénées-atlantiques département. that meeting had been aimed at producing an opinion on the use of the land comprising a farm which mr f.l. the rally was held in a political and trade-union situation where tensions had been heightened by the fact that the majority agricultural union in the département was backing candidates other than mr f.l. at the end of the meeting scuffles broke out between the demonstrators and the gendarmerie. the applicant was placed in police custody and brought before the bayonne criminal court under “immediate summary trial” procedure, and charged with intentional violence not entailing total unfitness for work, against gendarmes whose identity has not been established, and against a person exercising public authority, using or threatening to use a weapon, in this instance an umbrella. by judgment of 13 march 2008, the applicant was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment, suspended, for having struck gendarmes with an umbrella, which incident had not entailed unfitness for work on the latter’s part. in its judgment, the court noted that the applicant had refused to answer questions during the investigation or to admit to any wrongdoing, and had denied that he had been carrying an umbrella. the judges noted that witnesses had nevertheless stated that he had attempted to cross the barrier by clambering over demonstrators and trying to hit the gendarmes with his umbrella. the applicant pointed out that he had refrained from appealing in order to calm the situation and in the framework of a friendly settlement of the dispute that had been the cause of the rally. on 24 december 2008, following a request from the bayonne public prosecutor’s office, the applicant was ordered by the police to give a dna sample, on the basis of articles 706-55 and 706-56 of the code of criminal procedure (cpp). he was brought before the criminal court on 19 may 2009 for refusing to give the sample. by judgment of 27 october 2009, the bayonne regional court imposed on the applicant a fine of five hundred euros. on 3 february 2011 the pau court of appeal upheld that judgment. as regards the legal aspect of the offence, it stated, in particular, that unlike the applicants in the case of s. and marper v. the united kingdom ([gc], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, echr 2008), the applicant had been convicted, rather than suspected, of an offence, which precluded him from arguing that the impugned judgment had entailed a disproportionate interference with his private life. relying, in particular, on the 16 september 2010 decision of the constitutional council (see paragraph 16 below), it held that “the provisions of national law applied [to the applicant] were such as to reconcile respect for private life and the protection of public order in a manner that was neither manifestly unbalanced nor in breach of the requirements of article 8 of the convention”. in connection with the substantive aspect of the offence, the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s plea that a sample had already been taken from his headgear during his police custody and that he was entitled to refuse further sampling, given that there had been no dna profiling the first time. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. his first plea was that the sample geared to identifying his dna and storing the corresponding data amounted to a disproportionate interference with his private life, having regard to the duration of the data storage and his personal situation (an easily identifiable person who was socially well-established, with a job, a family and a fixed abode). in his second plea, he argued that the court of appeal had provided no reasons for its decision in connection with the substantive aspect of the offence. by judgment of 28 september 2011, the court of cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as follows:
“... the court of appeal responded adequately and cogently to the main points of the pleadings submitted to it, and characterised all the substantive and purposive aspects of the offence of refusing to undergo a biological test, of which it found the defendant guilty, in full compliance with the provisions of article 8 of the convention.”
the facts, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. they all obtained final court decisions in their favour, which remain unenforced to the present day. on 26 may 2004 the applicant was dismissed by his employer, dp udarnik, a transport and transshipment company based in belgrade (currently registered as socially-owned company udarnik (in liquidation)). on 9 june 2004 the applicant brought a civil action challenging that decision. he withdrew the request he had made for his outstanding salary on 20 december 2006. the belgrade district court upheld the judgment on 10 july 2008. it became enforceable on 26 december 2008. on the latter date the insolvency proceedings were stayed (obustavljen) and the debtor continued its business activities. on 21 january 2009 the applicant filed a request for enforcement of the judgment of 20 december 2006 and the payment of the outstanding salaries till his reinstatement, submitting amendments on 6 march 2009. on 13 october 2009 the enforcement court rejected the applicant’s request, incorrectly stating that the debtor was subject to pending insolvency proceedings (see paragraph 9 above). the applicant unsuccessfully appealed and wrote to the enforcement court again on numerous occasions. in the meantime, between july 2009 and november 2011, attempts at liquidation of the debtor failed, as there were not enough assets to settle all the creditors’ claims. the applicant registered his claim for costs within the insolvency proceedings. after a division of property, he received 2.89% of his claim for costs. in february 2007 many employees on compulsory leave were made redundant and took part in the government’s “social programme”. after enquiring about her entitlements, on 14 march 2007 the applicant was served with a decision dated 18 march 1991 concerning her dismissal. the judgment became final on 5 september 2007 and the municipal court ordered its enforcement on 3 december 2007. in the meantime, on 22 october 2007 the applicant was made redundant. the judgment became final on 22 january 2009. the enforcement courts rejected a request by the applicant for enforcement. after a re-trial, on 18 october 2013 the municipal court ordered the applicant’s employer to also pay her outstanding salary for 16 march to 22 october 2007 (the period during which she was on paid leave) and rsd 13,000 for her legal costs. these proceedings are pending at domestic level. on 5 january 2004 the privatisation agency ordered the restructuring of the debtor. raška holding kompanija and its subsidiary companies, including the debtor, have been in the process of being restructured since 26 may 2006. the insolvency proceedings are still ongoing. on 18 april 2011 the court opened and terminated the insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor. it said that any property of the debtor had become state assets. the date of its publication in the official gazette of the republic of serbia is not available on these registers. by a registered letter dated 17 march 2016, he was notified that the periods allowed for appointment of a lawyer and for submission of his observations and claim for just satisfaction had both expired and that the court had extended the deadline for submissions until 28 april 2016. the court also sent copies of the previous letters of 17 april and 14 august 2015 and enclosures.
on an unknown date in may 2003 the applicants wrote a letter to the highest authorities of the bd, namely the international supervisor for bd, the president of the assembly of bd and the governor of bd, while the procedure for the appointment of a director of the bd’s multi-ethnic public radio station was still pending. in the letter, they voiced their concerns regarding the procedure for the appointment of a director of the bd’s multi-ethnic public radio station. it is composed of three serb[4] members, one croat[5] and one bosniac. soon afterwards, still in may 2003, the letter was published in three different daily newspapers. brought civil defamation proceedings claiming that in the above letter the applicants had made defamatory statements which had damaged her reputation and discredited her as a person and a professional journalist. the members and statutory representatives of two of the applicants. as described in the judgment of 29 september 2004 (see paragraph 18 below), m.s. there had been no intention to publish the letter. for that reason, it had been sent to the authorities personally. he did not know how the letter had reached the media. the letter had been sent to the authorities personally. that was why they had indicated in the letter that it concerned allegations and not established facts. their aim had been to draw the attention of the authorities to errors of m.s., the relevant part of the judgment reads as follows:
“it is clear that the defendants’ letter was addressed personally (upućeno na ruke) to the governor, to the president of the assembly and to the supervisor for brčko district ... and it was not sent to the media ... the court established that the aim of the letter was to bring the attention of the authorities to (these) issues and to enable them to draw certain conclusions on verification of that information, and not to publish unverified information. the bd court of appeal quashed that judgment on 16 may 2005 and decided to hold a new hearing. for these reasons, the court dismisses the respondents’ arguments that one can be held responsible for defamation only if there was a public announcement or dissemination or publication of (such) statements in the media.” had been a public servant and that by having taken part in the competition for the position of radio director she had become a public figure. and the witnesses who had already given oral evidence before the first-instance court (see paragraph 14 above). was the author of the statement published in the newspaper was untrue, the court stated:
“... on the basis of s.c. they were further ordered to give the judgment to the bd radio and television and to two newspapers for publication at the applicants’ own expense. as regards the calculation of the amount of non-pecuniary damages, the court stated:
“when assessing the amount of damages, namely, just satisfaction to be awarded to the appellant, [the court] took into consideration that the impugned facts had been mentioned in the article published in the media ...” 30. on 12 december 2007 the applicants paid the equivalent of eur 1,445 (inclusive of interest and enforcement costs) in enforcement of the judgment of 11 july 2007. on 27 march 2009 the court of first instance closed the enforcement proceedings. made a point of removing from the wall (and tore to pieces) the calendar with the schedule of religious services during the month of ramadan and as the editor of the entertainment programme banned the broadcasting of sevdalinka arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value’), the court of appeal established that there was an evident inconsistency between what had been said to the appellants and what they had reported in the letter. furthermore, the statement in the impugned letter that m.s. had not been the author of the said interview. the appellants ... failed to verify the impugned statements beforehand as was their duty. it entered into force on the latter date and contains twelve annexes. annex 2 of the agreement concerns the agreement on inter-entity boundary line and related issues. the arbitrators shall issue their decision no later than one year from the entry into force of this agreement.
the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in constanţa. at the time of the relevant events, she was an investigative journalist working in constanţa. during the night of 12 to 13 august 2006 a group of approximately fifty to eighty armed persons were involved in a violent incident that took place in mamaia, a seaside resort on the outskirts of constanţa. accepted to participate in a television show hosted by a.g. or v. is personally involved in this war. the latter is a business partner of the president of the regional council and during the night anything can happen because the police have made a pact ... and do not want to sanction anyone. i do not even know him, i have never seen him in my life and i have never spoken to him .... i have listened for fifteen minutes to her [the applicant’s] lucubrations, in which she tries to create about constanţa the image of a demonic city, in which the mayor runs everything, is a smuggler, has clans with kalashnikovs and bodyguards ...
[a.g.]: she had not submitted anything because it is all false. i personally asked the police to intervene and arrest the perpetrators. ... this is what the mayor says, that everything is false ...
[the applicant]: what i have said, i said as an observer of the daily events; these things have been observed, discussed, noted for years. and they must be proved ... just like other journalists, you have learned to drag others in the mud, with no evidence to support what you state. [the applicant]: if i understand correctly, he does not know the v. brothers, he knows them well, but that is not the point, the point is that their men ...(interrupted)
[r.m.]: or i am stronger because i have the backing of the v. brothers ... mr r.m., but this is indeed what has been going on for several years in the city of constanţa. m.p, a sociologist, a specialist in violent incidents. if he is still live ... it is necessary to know that mayors elsewhere in the world, such as giuliani or chirac, have had what are called urban policies of prevention and that they were directly involved. and his business partners appears again directly linked to a strange business. lodged a civil complaint against the applicant. further claimed that the defamatory statements the applicant had made against him in prime time on national television had seriously damaged his image as a public person and a locally elected official. the applicant submitted that her statements during the television show had reflected her opinion in an honest and ethical manner. ’s conflicts with the v. brothers that had been presented more than once in the local press. ’s supporters in connection with his public image. was connected to several ongoing criminal investigations. on 29 may 2008 the constanţa county court allowed the appeal and awarded r.m. was based essentially on the applicant’s statements, namely that the city was “torn between the underworld clans, in which the offenders retaliate against the mayor” (see paragraph 8 above), and that the same conclusion would have been drawn by anyone else who had watched the show. by claiming in bad faith that he was involved in illegal activities. had participated in the television show in his capacity as a public person or as a private one, so as to attract specific consequences in the balancing-of-rights exercise carried out by the court. the appellate court firstly noted that r.m. the court considered the amount of damages to be paid by the applicant to be fully justified, in view of the fact that the defamatory statements had been broadcast in prime time on a national television channel, and that the amount had been reduced by the appeal court to one quarter of the full amount claimed by r.m. it appears that in february 2009 the applicant fully complied with the terms of the final judgment.
the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. on 27 november 1987 a claim was lodged with košice-okolie district court against some of the applicants or their predecessors. with this claim, the plaintiffs were seeking a judicial ruling declaring them to be the owners of an area of grassland. the other applicants entered the proceedings as defendants on different dates and on the basis of different legal entitlements as outlined in the annexed table. between 1988 and 2009 the first-instance court held a number of hearings, ordered expert opinions, dealt with other relevant evidence, and heard witnesses. it also took some time to determine the parties who were actually to be sued in the proceedings in view of multiple deaths among the original defendants and various transactions made in respect of the property in question. on 27 april 2010 the constitutional court delivered a judgment, finding that the applicants’ (or their predecessors’) right to a hearing within a reasonable time had been violated by the district court. it ordered the district court to proceed without undue delay and to reimburse the complainants’ legal costs. it also awarded just satisfaction in respect of non‑pecuniary damage in the amount of eur 300 to the applicants listed under points 1 to 17 and eur 500 to those listed under points 18 to 28 and to the deceased predecessor of the applicants listed under points 29 to 32 of the appendix. the constitutional court noted inter alia that the district court had failed to proceed with the matter between 1995 and 2009. it also observed some of the applicants’ lack of interest in those proceedings. that judgment became final on 19 july 2010. on 22 november 2011 the district court delivered a judgment on the merits of the case, which was not served on the parties to the proceedings until seven months after its delivery. on 19 march 2013 the constitutional court rejected a fresh constitutional complaint that had been lodged by the applicants (except those listed under points 30 to 32). it found no further undue delays in the proceedings before the district court after the constitutional judgment of 27 april 2010. it noted the delay of seven months which the district court had taken to serve its judgment on the parties. however, it did not consider it unconstitutional. on 15 may 2013 the district court transferred the case file to košice regional court following an appeal lodged by the applicants listed under points 9 and 18 and some other defendants in the proceedings. on 12 march 2014 the regional court had to identify and deal with successors of some of the deceased parties to the proceedings. it partly upheld the district court’s judgment and partly dismissed the claim concerning some of the contested property. it also rejected the remainder of the appeal. the judgment became final on 10 july 2014. on 8 august 2014 the applicants listed under points 4 and 30 to 32, together with several other defendants in the proceedings, lodged an appeal on points of law. on 21 january 2015 the proceedings in respect of that appeal were discontinued without examination of its merits due to the appellants’ failure to pay the court fees. that decision became final on 13 february 2015.
in disputes between the applicants and the domestic pension authorities, the first‑instance courts ruled in their favour, ordering increases of their pensions based on the rise in the average wages in the country since their retirement. the defendant authorities appealed to the dnipropetrovsk administrative court of appeal (“the court of appeal”). under domestic law (see paragraph 18 below), when an appeal arrived at the court of appeal, a judge rapporteur of that court, if he or she believed that it complied with the necessary formal requirements, had to issue a ruling opening appeal proceedings (“the ruling”) and send it to the applicants together with a copy of the appeal. the government and the applicants disagree as to whether those documents were actually sent to the applicants (see paragraphs 11 to 13 below). on various dates set out in the appendix, the court of appeal quashed the judgments in the applicants’ favour, dismissing their claims for pension increases holding that the domestic law did not require the pensions to be increased in case of rise in the average wages in the country following retirement. in the fifth applicant’s case the court of appeal held a hearing in his presence (see paragraph 14 below). in the other applicants’ cases the court sat in camera without summoning the parties. in the second to sixth applicants’ cases the court of appeal’s decisions became effective immediately since no further appeal lay against them (see the related legislative provisions in paragraph 16 below). the first applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the higher administrative court. on 26 october 2012 it upheld the court of appeal’s decision, without commenting on the complaint she had presented that she had not been informed of the appeal proceedings. according to the applicants, the domestic courts did not send them either (i) a copy of the defendants’ appeals or (ii) a copy of the rulings opening appeal proceedings in their cases. they therefore had no knowledge of the appeal proceedings prior to the court of appeal’s decisions in their cases. they learned of those decisions later, notably after their pensions had been reduced based on the court of appeal’s decisions. according to the government, the applicants were duly informed of the appeal proceedings. on 23 june 2012 the court of appeal sent the fifth applicant a summons to attend a hearing on 1 november 2012. the delivery slip is in his domestic case file. at the hearing, which he attended, the court examined the pension authority’s appeal in its absence and quashed the first-instance court’s judgment.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in sinj. brought a civil action against the applicant before the sinj municipal court (općinski sud u sinju), seeking that a will be declared null and void. on 8 december 2006 the sinj municipal court adopted a judgment in the applicant’s favour. the plaintiff lodged an appeal with the split county court (županijski sud u splitu). the civil division of that court has over forty judges. on 27 august 2009 a panel of three judges presided over by judge d.p., sitting in a closed meeting, reversed the first-instance judgment and upheld the appeal. it held that the first-instance court had correctly established the facts but had wrongly applied the relevant law. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske) alleging, inter alia, that she had not had a fair hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal because judge d.p. was the father of a trainee lawyer working at the law office of v.lj. who had both represented the plaintiff in the proceedings. on 14 september 2011 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as unfounded and upheld the second-instance judgment. it held in particular:
“the case file shows that n.p., ’s son, did not participate in any manner in the proceedings at issue. this court therefore considers that there are no circumstances which put the impartiality of judge d.p. in such doubt as to exclude his participation in the adoption of the appeal judgment.” in a constitutional complaint of 29 june 2012 the applicant argued that even though n.p. had not participated at the hearings held in the proceedings at issue, there were no indications that he had not been otherwise involved in the case. he had been in a relationship of subordination (employer-employee) to the opposing party’s legal representative and the law office concerned had employed only a very small number of people. the applicant noted that the first-instance judgment in her favour had also later been reversed on appeal. the constitutional complaint was declared inadmissible on 3 october 2012 by the constitutional court.
the applicant was born in 1942 and lives in vilnius. on 27 september 1996 the applicant was admitted to the bar. a couple of months later the applicant registered a law office in her name, and started practising law. at the applicant’s request her name was taken of the list of practising advocates on 19 december 2003. on 13 august 2004 the applicant was found guilty of forgery of documents (article 300 § 1 of the criminal code) and fraud (article 182 § 1 of the criminal code). the court established that while pursuing her professional practice, the applicant had on more than thirty occasions falsely claimed in writing that she had provided legal services within the framework of the state-paid legal-aid scheme. her conviction expired three years after she had paid the fine, that is to say on 24 august 2007. on 12 september 2007 the applicant asked the bar association to readmit her to the bar. the applicant challenged this decision before the vilnius regional court. on 25 april 2008 the court heard the applicant’s case. six witnesses were questioned in court as to the applicant’s reputation; most of them testified to having known the applicant before 1996, when she had been working at the ministry of justice. the court noted that the applicant had been convicted of a minor intentional crime. on the day when the applicant had submitted the request to be readmitted to the bar, her conviction had expired. consequently, and relying on article 8 (1) of the law on the bar (see paragraph 21 below), the vilnius regional court found that the bar association had erred in finding that the applicant had not met the high-moral-character criterion. the reference stated that the applicant performed her duties well; and that she was responsible and had a sense of initiative. as to the question of high moral character, the court of appeal underlined that higher standards were applicable to advocates, as only persons of untainted reputation could participate in the justice system without discrediting it. in this connection the lithuanian code of professional ethics for advocates underlined that an advocate should observe legal and moral duties (point 1.2.), the court of appeal concurred with the first-instance court’s finding that the term of the applicant’s conviction had expired and that therefore she could not be reproached under article 8 (1) of the law on the bar. nonetheless, taking into account the fact that she had committed the criminal offence in the course of her professional practice and that her professional practice had been aimed at committing crimes, of which there were more than thirty counts, it was reasonable to conclude that the applicant’s behaviour did not meet the criteria set out in article 8 (4) of the law on the bar. the appellate court also noted that a person could submit a request to be admitted to the bar and to prove that he or she had regained high moral character. however, it was then for the court to establish, of its own motion, whether sufficient time had passed for a person’s rehabilitation to be objectively validated. a person who claimed to have regained high moral character should bring clear and persuasive evidence that he or she had been following the ethical and disciplinary rules. it was then for the court to examine what the nature of the infringements of law was, what personal situation had led to the infringements being committed, and whether those factors still applied. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. she raised a number of arguments about the bar qualification exam and professional reputation, without maintaining that the criminal conviction had placed her in a worse situation than representatives of other law-related professions. by a ruling of 23 february 2009 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law, and left the court of appeal decision unchanged. on the question of reputation, the supreme court noted its practice to the effect that no breach of law (joks nusižengimas) was too serious to unconditionally preclude an individual from ever asking to be reinstated to the bar (the supreme court referred to its earlier ruling in case no. 3k-7-168/2001 of 9 january 2001, see paragraph 30 below). under point 1 of the code of professional ethics for advocates, advocates were involved in the implementation of justice. on the facts of the applicant’s case, the court of appeal therefore had been correct in finding that the applicant had not proven that she had regained high moral character, in particular given the nature of the criminal acts she had committed.
the applicant was born in 1968 and is serving a prison sentence in astrakhan. in july 2004 the applicant was charged with murder of v. counsel sh. was appointed to represent him during investigation and trial. on 10 december 2004 the astrakhan regional court held a preliminary trial hearing. stated as follows:
“[the applicant] has committed a particularly serious offence which might entail a lengthy custodial sentence. ... on 18 february 2005 the court completed the examination of evidence. both prosecution and defence made their closing arguments. called the applicant “a robber and a drunkard”. on 18 february 2005 the jury delivered a guilty verdict. on 21 february 2005 the applicant asked the court to replace counsel sh. alleging that the defence carried out by him had not been effective. the court dismissed the applicant’s request. on the same date the regional court found the applicant guilty of murder and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment. on 8 march 2005 the court refused to appoint a lawyer referring to the relevant legal provisions that did not provide for a right to have a state-appointed lawyer before the appeal court. on 21 july 2005 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the judgment of 21 february 2005 on appeal. according to the official documents, the applicant was not provided with legal assistance. on 6 june 2007 the presidium of the supreme court quashed the appeal judgment of 21 july 2005 by way of supervisory review. the court noted that the applicant had not been provided with legal assistance in the appeal proceedings and remitted the matter for fresh consideration to the appeal court. the applicant did not attend the hearing. on an unspecified date the applicant was transferred to moscow. counsel r. was appointed to represent him. from 1 to 3 august 2007 r. studied the case-file. on 7 and 14 august 2004 he met with the applicant at the remand prison. on an unspecified date the applicant submitted a revised statement of appeal. according to the applicant, he participated in the hearing by means of a video link. he did not submit a statement of appeal and made oral submissions to the court. the court also dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant’s complaint about the alleged ineffectiveness of the legal assistance provided by counsel sh. had supported the applicant’s non-guilty plea and argued that the applicant had not been proved guilty. lastly, the court took into account that, prior to the jury verdict, the applicant had not complained about the quality of the defence provided by sh. on 18 august 2008 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s supervisory review complaint against the judgment of 16 august 2007.
the applicant was born in 1972 and lives in pakruojis. he worked as an investigator at šiauliai city police headquarters. on 3 october 2000 the šiauliai regional court established that from 1995 to 1996, when he had been working as an investigator, the applicant had several times solicited and sometimes succeeded in getting bribes for discontinuing criminal proceedings. the applicant’s conviction was upheld by the court of appeal on 29 june 2001 and by the supreme court on 18 december 2001. the applicant was released from prison on 8 september 2003 after serving his sentence. by a ruling of 17 june 2005 the šiauliai regional court expunged the applicant’s conviction from his criminal record. he had been convicted of crimes of medium severity. the ruling was not appealed against and became enforceable. on 12 january 2007 the applicant wrote to the lithuanian bar association, which regulates advocates (lawyers admitted to the bar, advokatas), requesting to be admitted as a trainee advocate. there was no explanation about the period between 1999 and 2004. on 10 july 2007 the disciplinary committee of the bar association held that the applicant had committed a disciplinary violation by withholding information about his conviction by šiauliai regional court on 3 october 2000 (see paragraph 7 above). the committee emphasised the fact that the applicant had not mentioned the conviction or his “long prison sentence” in his application to be admitted as a trainee advocate, his curriculum vitae or in the other documents submitted in support. information about the conviction had been relevant for assessing his reputation. even though the applicant had served his sentence, communication with those investigators, prosecutors and judges caused some strains at work in šiauliai. they postponed the hearing to a later date on each occasion. the court of honour also held on the same day that the applicant had breached the code of ethics and imposed the disciplinary measure of ordering his removal from the list of trainee advocates, on the basis of articles 13 § 1 and 54 § 2 of the law on the bar (see paragraph 34 below). moreover, he had committed those crimes while working in the legal field. in the light of such considerations, the court of honour was convinced that the applicant, who had a university degree and had previously had a law-related job, had deliberately withheld information about his prior conviction, because he had been aware that, if information not only about his crimes but also about the manner in which he had committed them had come to light, then the bar association would have rejected his application to become a trainee advocate. a member said by the applicant to have been favourable to him (see paragraph 20 above), had not been a decisive factor because the court had been unanimous in its finding against the applicant. on the basis of the written evidence, the first-instance court established that a.p. the manner in which those crimes had been committed and their scale did not allow for the assertion that the applicant had automatically regained the status of being of high moral character immediately after the conviction had been expunged. in other words, the applicant’s actions had to be looked at to see not only if they had been in accordance with applicable laws, but also whether they had adhered to the requirements of professional ethics. the bar association asked that the applicant’s appeal be dismissed. the rules regulating disciplinary proceedings did not prohibit postponing examination of a case. ’s participation in the disciplinary proceedings. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. lastly, he was also dissatisfied by how his case had been handled by the court of honour, relying on article 6 § 1 of the convention. the notion of the implementation of justice would be discredited if any and every person was allowed to take part in that process, irrespective of his or her behaviour. the applicant’s case therefore did not give grounds for cassation appeal because it followed established case-law and was not relevant for developing it. on 10 july 2009 the supreme court found the appeal to be essentially identical to the earlier one and refused to admit it for examination.
since 1994 the first applicant company, satakunnan markkinapörssi oy collected data from the finnish tax authorities for the purpose of publishing information about natural persons’ taxable income and assets in the veropörssi newspaper. several other publishing and media companies also publish such data which, pursuant to finnish law, are accessible to the public (see paragraph 39 below for an explanation of the finnish access to information regime). the first applicant company worked in cooperation with the second applicant company, satamedia oy, and both were owned by the same shareholders. from 2006 the second applicant company also published veropörssi. no information is contained in the file as to the outcome of this request or of any subsequent investigation. the applicant companies subsequently cancelled their data request and paid people to collect taxation data manually at the local tax offices. however, in order to achieve a balance between those two fundamental rights, the protection of the fundamental right to privacy required that the derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of data had to apply only in so far as were strictly necessary (see paragraphs 54 and 56 of the judgment). furthermore, when interpreting the journalistic purposes derogation, account must be taken of the evolution and proliferation of methods of communication and the dissemination of information. whether or not that was the case, was for the national court to determine (see paragraphs 60-62 of the judgment). the reconciliation of protection of privacy with freedom of expression is part of the legal assessment of personal data processing in the matter. on the other hand, the court also held in the above-mentioned judgment that increased vigilance as regards the protection of private life was necessary in order to contend with the new communications technologies which make it possible to store and reproduce personal data. restricting the processing of personal data at this stage, that is to say before publication, could in practice mean that a prior decision is taken on what can be published. the issue at stake in the present case concerns publicly accessible personal data received from the tax authorities. satakunnan markkinapörssi oy has published the personal data collected from the tax offices as wide-ranging municipality-based catalogues in the veropörssi newspaper. by contrast, the processing of personal data collected in the company’s background file by publishing it and by rendering it available to the general public to the extent that has been done in the present case, and beyond the scope of the minimum requirements set out in section 2(5) of the act, cannot be regarded as compatible with the purpose of the personal data act. ...
having regard to sections 2(5) and 32 of the personal data act and article 9 of the data protection directive, as interpreted by the court of justice of the european communities in its preliminary ruling, the collection of personal data prior to its publication in the veropörssi newspaper and its processing in the background file of satakunnan markkinapörssi oy cannot as such be regarded as contrary to the regulations concerning the protection of personal data, provided that, inter alia, the data have been protected properly. nor can the processing of personal data in such a manner be regarded as having been effected for journalistic purposes within the meaning of article 9 of the data protection directive. in addition, it follows from the preliminary ruling of the court of justice of the european communities that the exception provided for in the data protection directive, which concerns the processing of personal data for journalistic purposes, requires the disclosure of data to the public. it therefore does not concern disclosure of data to the general public, as explained above, but replying to a request by an individual concerning the personal data of another individual. open public-interest debate, the monitoring of the exercise of power in society and the freedom to criticise, which are necessary in a democratic society, do not require the possibility of processing the personal data of specific individuals as has been done in this case. the second applicant company was prohibited from collecting, storing or forwarding to an sms service any data received from the first applicant company’s database and published in veropörssi. in his reply the data protection ombudsman stated, with reference to the decision of the data protection board of 26 november 2009, that “when data on taxable income were collected in a database and published in large catalogues almost as it stood, the personal data act was applicable...”. by letter dated 9 february 2010 the applicant companies appealed against the decision of the data protection board to the helsinki administrative court, which transferred the case to the turku administrative court. by letter dated 29 november 2010 the applicant companies further appealed to the supreme administrative court. the newspaper continued publishing taxation data in autumn 2009 when its content was only one fifth of the previous content. since then the newspaper has not appeared. moreover, an internet service continued to operate allowing anyone to request a natural person’s tax data concerning the year 2014 by filling in a form on the website in question. the requested tax information would then be delivered to the customer by phone call, text message or e-mail. the editor-in-chief of veropörssi lodged an application with the court in 2010, complaining that the impugned decision of the supreme administrative court violated his right to freedom of expression. the first applicant company was declared bankrupt on 15 march 2016.
the applicant was born in 1960 and lives in martin. on 20 october 2011 the applicant lodged a claim with the martin district court (“the district court”) (file no. 10 c 60/2012), seeking payment of his wages plus interest in connection with the termination of his employment. on 17 february 2012 the district court issued a payment order in summary proceedings. as the defendant challenged the order, the matter fell to be determined by the court in ordinary proceedings. it took the district court more than eight months to deal with an application by the applicant to change the particulars of claim. in october 2014 the applicant lodged a complaint with the constitutional court under article 127 of the constitution, contesting the length of the proceedings before the district court. on 28 april 2015 the constitutional court rejected his complaint (file no. ús 172/20150), on the grounds that, prior to lodging his constitutional complaint, the applicant had failed to exhaust ordinary remedies, in particular lodging a complaint with the president of the district court under the courts act (law no. the constitutional court referred to the court’s previous case-law in ištván and ištvánová v. slovakia (no. 30189/07, 12 june 2012), and tried to distinguish that case from the applicant’s case. it observed that the case of ištván and ištvánová concerned proceedings lasting more than six years, which was substantially longer than the duration of the proceedings in the applicant’s case (three years). the constitutional court further stated that only in cases where the length of proceedings was prima facie excessive at the time of lodging a constitutional complaint was it not necessary to lodge a complaint with the president of a court, and therefore the applicant should have lodged a complaint with the president of the district court. in the meantime, the district court had appointed an expert in economics, accountancy and tax, and had ordered the applicant to pay fees in advance for the expert evidence. that order was challenged by the applicant before the žilina regional court, but to no avail. the appointed expert then prepared her opinion between june and september 2015. subsequently, the district court scheduled a hearing for 16 march 2016. on that date the district court delivered a judgment by which it granted the applicant’s claim in part and dismissed the remainder of the claim. a written judgment was delivered to the applicant two months later. however, in their submissions to the court the parties failed to specify the exact date when the judgment was served on the applicant, and they did not provide appropriate evidence to confirm this. they also did not inform the court about any possible further development in the proceedings.
the applicant was born in 1968 and is currently detained in vratsa prison. followed him, grabbed him by the collar through the bars separating the barbershop from the corridor, and hit him on the head and nose. after that, the social worker had a talk with the applicant, who was in a highly emotional state. which would also be bad for his emotional well-being and security. in the meantime, the applicant was provisionally held in a cell on another floor. the social worker carried out an enquiry over the following days at the request of the prison governor and obtained statements from eight other inmates, confirming the events. be given a disciplinary warning and that the applicant be kept in his new group to avoid further altercations between the two. the applicant expressed no wish to be given a medical examination after the incident which allegedly took place on 15 february 2012. after the incident on 21 february 2012 he was brought to varna prison’s medical centre, where he was seen by the feldsher as the prison’s only doctor was on long-term sick leave at the time (see paragraph 40 below). the applicant told the feldsher that he had been punched next to his right ear and had pain in the ear and the lower jaw. she wrote a note to the prison administration, detailing her findings. on 22 february 2012 the applicant went to the medical centre again and was given vitamins, an anti-inflammatory drug, a muscle relaxant and antibiotics. according to a statement which he made in the course of the criminal proceedings against mr k.i. ( the consultation and the x-ray were paid for by the prison administration. on 21 may 2012 the prison feldsher offered to send the applicant to sofia prison hospital for physiotherapy. between june and october 2012 the applicant visited the prison medical centre on several occasions. he was generally given pain medication and further on request external medical consultations were discussed. on an unknown date in 2012 the applicant complained to the varna district prosecutor’s office about the incidents on 15 and 21 february 2012. ’s actions had amounted to causing moderate bodily harm. the court noted that the fracture had impaired the applicant’s chewing and speech functions for at least four months and had caused him considerable pain and suffering (see прис. in march 2016, following an appeal by mr k.i., relevant reports of the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 39. the visit included a visit to varna prison. it transpired from the examination of documentation on disciplinary punishments that there was at least one violent altercation between prisoners every week, leading to placements in a disciplinary cell and occasionally to a medical intervention or hospitalisation. ... despite the goodwill and commitment of health-care staff at the prisons visited, the provision of health care to prisoners remained problematic, due to the serious shortage of staff and resources. at varna prison, the health-care staff team comprised a psychiatrist and a feldsher. the delegation was submerged by complaints about difficulties in having access to prison medical staff, inadequate quality of care (including dental care), problematic access to outside specialists/hospitals (in particular for insurance reasons) and delays in transfer to outside hospitals. the doctor from the nearby prison hostel ‘razdelna’ had been ensuring medical cover when the feldsher was absent. a part-time dentist was present for two hours, five days a week. no specific screening for injuries was performed upon arrival or after a violent episode in prison, and very limited medical information could be found at varna prison ... in this respect.
the applicants’ dates of birth and places of residence are given in the appendix. on 12 january, 26 january and 10 march 2013 demonstrations were planned to be held in baku. it appears that the organisers of the demonstrations gave no proper prior notice to the relevant authority, the baku city executive authority (“the bcea”). information about the demonstrations was disseminated through facebook or the press. according to the applicants, the demonstrations were intended to be peaceful and were conducted in a peaceful manner. all three applicants were arrested during the dispersal operations and were taken to police stations. the applicants were questioned at the police stations they had been taken to. on the day of each applicant’s arrest administrative-offence reports (inzibati xəta haqqında protokol) were issued, which stated that the applicants had committed an administrative offence under article 298.2 of the code of administrative offences (“the cao”) (participation in a public assembly that was not organised in accordance with the law). according to a statement (ərizə) written by the second applicant at the police station on the day of her arrest, she refused the services of a lawyer. the third applicant was taken to a trial court directly from the police station on the day following his arrest. the second applicant was brought before a court on the day of her arrest; however, the hearing was postponed for two days to allow her to hire a lawyer of her own choosing. a state-funded lawyer was appointed to assist the first applicant. the second and third applicants were not represented by a lawyer. none of the material submitted to the court contains any records showing that the state-funded lawyer, mr v.m., made any oral or written submissions on behalf of the first applicant. the police officers testified that the applicant had staged an unauthorised demonstration. the first-instance courts found that the applicants had participated in unauthorised demonstrations. the applicants also complained that their arrests had been unlawful and that the hearings before the first-instance courts had not been fair. they asked the baku court of appeal to quash the first-instance courts’ decisions in their cases. the applicants were not represented before the baku court of appeal by a lawyer. the appellate court refused to grant the applicants’ requests to hear evidence from particular witnesses in their favour, without giving any reasons for the refusal. on various dates the baku court of appeal dismissed the applicants’ appeals and upheld the decisions of the first-instance courts (see appendix). on the same day he was detained pending trial. the circumstances relating to mr aliyev’s arrest and detention are the subject of a separate application brought by him before the court (application no. the files relating to the present cases, which, it appears, included copies of all the documents and correspondence between the court and the parties, were also seized in their entirety. no adequate inventory of the seized document files relating to the court proceedings was made in the search and seizure records of 8 and 9 august 2014. on an unspecified date mr aliyev lodged a complaint with the nasimi district court, claiming that the search had been unlawful. it held that the searches had been conducted in accordance with the relevant law. as to the seizure of the documents relating to the cases pending before the court and the domestic courts, it found that they could not be returned to the applicants at that stage of the proceedings. on 25 october 2014 the investigating authorities returned a number of the case files concerning the applications lodged with the court, including the files relating to the present cases, to mr aliyev’s lawyer.
the first applicant was born in 1983 and lives in ludbreg. the second applicant was born in 1959 and lives in slunj. at the beginning of august 1995 the croatian authorities announced their intention to take military action with the aim of regaining control over krajina. before the military action, the vast majority of the population of krajina fled croatia. most of them went to bosnia and herzegovina, and also to serbia. on 5 november 1997 croatia ratified the convention. on 8 august 1995 the applicants’ close relatives, g.o. the police were alerted to the killings on the same day. on 7 august 1995 the croatian army had entered veljun. had been killed the day before but had not seen who had done it. on 25 february 2002 the police interviewed the second applicant. on 8 august 1995 when his son, who had lived with his mother and grandmother, had been brought to him. on 30 march 2006 the karlovac state attorney’s office asked the slunj police whether the veljun area had been occupied on 7 august 1995; whether the perpetrator of the killing of g.o. and she had not been registered as a member of any army. after that they had taken him to his father in slunj. on 17 january 2007 the police interviewed i.b., on the same day another police officer, z.g., on 9 november 2012 the karlovac police asked the ministry of defence about the croatian army units which had been in veljun between 7 and 12 august 1995, the identity of their commanders and all their members. that request was repeated on 11 december 2012. as well as the second infantry battalion of the first guards brigade (2. had been in command of the first company (prva satnija), m.b. who had died later on) of the third company (treća satnija). respectively, but he could not remember the commander of the third company. he had no knowledge about the killing of civilians in veljun. his first battalion and the second battalion, which had been under the command of n.n, had had about 970 soldiers. the third battalion had been under the command of t.l. the commander of the medical squad of the second battalion of the 143rd domobran regiment, said that his battalion had entered veljun at about noon on 7 august 1995 and had stayed there for two days. there had been no military action and he had not given any medical assistance to anyone in veljun. who had all heard about the killing of g.o. but had no relevant information about possible perpetrators.
the applicant company, service benz com s.r.l., is a commerciale company founded in 1993 under romanian law and based in adunaţii copăceni. on 11 may 2010 the applicant company, whose main activity is the retail distribution of fuel in specialised outlets, entered into a contract with company “n.” sarl for the carriage of “automobile lubricants and other goods”. the contract stipulated that it was incumbent on the company n. to “complete the transport documents with the requisite, correct and accurate information”. on the same day, two fuel tankers belonging to the company s.c. were loaded in bulgaria, in the presence of a tax office representative. after the tankers had been loaded the representative sealed them. before the two fuel tankers could reach their destination, they were stopped for inspection by representatives of the romanian fraud squad. after laboratory analyses, the romanian authorities found that the liquid transported did not have the same specifications as those indicated in the transport documents. by official report of offence of 7 june 2010, the fraud squad representatives decided to:
– impose on the company “n”, the owner of the goods carried, a fine of ron 100,000 (approximately eur 23,000) for non-compliance with the regulations on goods subject to excise duty pursuant to article 220 § 1 (k) of the code of tax procedure (“cpf”); and
– confiscate the goods (the liquid carried) and the two fuel tankers belonging to the applicant company, pursuant to article 220 § 2 (a) and (b) cpf. the applicant company challenged the part of that official report relating to the confiscation of its two fuel tankers. before the slobozia court of first instance it argued that:
– it had only carried its customer’s goods and accordingly held no responsibility for their compliance with the law;
– article 220 § 1 (k) cpf had not been applicable to it since, according to the transport documents in its possession, it had not been transporting goods subject to excise duty. by judgment of 15 november 2010 the slobozia court of first instance allowed the applicant company’s challenge and annulled the part of the official report relating to the confiscation of the fuel tankers. the trial court held as follows:
– the transport company’s responsibility could not be incurred because it had not been in a position to verify the legal conformity of the goods and a tax office representative had sealed the two fuel tankers after loading; and
– in the instant case the confiscation had therefore been unacceptable and unlawful. the tax authorities appealed against that judgment. on 28 february 2011 the ialomiţa county court allowed the tax authorities’ appeal: it quashed the judgment and, ruling on the merits, dismissed the applicant company’s challenge as being ill-founded. the court reasoned as follows:
– the administrative offence laid down in article 220 § 2 (b) cpf authorised the ancillary penalty of confiscation, without specifying whether the property to be confiscated belonged to the administrative offender or to a third party;
– furthermore, articles 24 and 25 of government ordinance no. 2/2001 of 12 july 2001 governing administrative offences provided for the eventuality of the confiscated property belonging to someone other than the administrative offender. the court gave the following reasons for its judgment:
“... the owner of the confiscated property, the company service benz com sarl, is not an administrative offender, such that there is no need to [discuss] any fault on its part; the confiscation is conducted exclusively in pursuance of the law as an ancillary penalty; it can only be annulled in the event of breach of the relevant legal provisions. the ground of appeal based on negligence on the part of the transporter, who was directly responsible for the safety and lawfulness of the goods transported, is also well-founded.”
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in poznań. a member of the political party self‑defence of the republic of poland (“samoobrona”) sent gazeta wyborcza, a daily newspaper, an electronic mail containing information about an alleged “sex scandal” in the party. the following day the applicant, who is a journalist, contacted a.r. after their conversation he informed her that he had recorded the call and that he intended to use the transcript for an article. on 6 december 2006 the applicant published an interview with a.r. public figures, including samoobrona activists, had offered and accepted sexual favours in the course of exercising public functions. initially, she had been unpaid and when she had demanded payment, one of the activists, k.z., had told her:
“i will pay if you go to bed with me”
she also said that in july 2004 during a party organised by a.k. had offered to find a post for her in a parliamentary deputy’s office – specifically r.c. on the same page, to the right of the article, the newspaper quoted three prominent samoobrona activists referred to in the interview, namely k.z., they all, denied that there had been any sexual propositions made to a.r. also on the same page the newspaper published a short interview with a.k. but had never recommended her for any work. a member of the european parliament, lodged a private bill of indictment against the applicant. he demanded that the applicant be charged with defamation. according to the indictment the defamation consisted of the publication of the interview with a.r. this suggested to readers that he had been involved in the “sex scandal”. he also claimed that he had been defamed in the published interview at the point where a.r. had accused him of nepotism by saying that he had employed his own daughter. on 16 march 2010 the warsaw district court ruled the indictment partially accurate: it then discontinued the proceedings for a probationary term of one year and ordered the applicant to pay 1,000 polish zlotys (pln – 232 euros (eur)) to charity and to pay the costs of the proceedings. the district court found the applicant guilty of the defamation of m.c. with respect to his publication of the statements made by a.r. concerning nepotism (see paragraph 23 below). according to the court the applicant neglected his professional obligations because he did not verify that the job had been offered to m.c. who had accepted its contents and returned it to the applicant without making any objection or comment (autoryzacja). for the above reasons, in the district court’s view, the average reader should not have had the impression that m.c. ’s lawyer appealed against the first‑instance judgment. on 18 june 2010 the warsaw regional court upheld the challenged judgment, repeating in essence the same reasoning as the district court. regarding the applicant’s arguments concerning his right to freedom of expression under article 10 of the convention, it noted that “in the light of the journalist’s right to publish critical comments (prawo do krytyki dziennikarskiej), an individual’s right to legal protection of good name and reputation should also be taken into account”. on 6 may 2011 the ombudsman informed the applicant that she had found no grounds to lodge a cassation appeal.
the applicants were born in 1981, 1982, 1986, 1974 and 1971 respectively. mr žanas aleksandravičius, mr andrej gailiun and mr artem novikov are currently detained in pravieniškės correctional facility. the first applicant was detained in lukiškės remand prison from 23 june 2011 to 30 september 2011. in 2012 the applicant instituted proceedings for damages. he argued that the conditions in which he had been held in lukiškės remand prison had been degrading: the cells had been overcrowded and the conditions unsanitary. it noted that the applicant’s complaints had been expressed in abstract terms and that he had not provided accurate information about the conditions in question. the applicant appealed but on 4 december 2012 the supreme administrative court upheld the first-instance decision. from 22 october 2008 to 10 november 2010 the second applicant was detained in lukiškės remand prison, except for the following periods when he was moved to švenčionys police station:

[the applicant] has stated that the news item is based on sources, both verbal and written, that he finds trustworthy. [ the court does not agree with [a] that he is accused of actions punishable by law in the news item. as previously noted, the court must consider the circumstances under which the statements are made, that they are necessary for a social debate on the causes and repercussions of the bank failure and also that some discrepancies can occur when dealing with complicated loan facilities and business deals. the two words were declared null and void. the judgment contained the following reasoning:
“... in assessing where the line should be drawn between freedom of expression, as protected by article 73 of the constitution, and the right to privacy, as protected by article 71 of the constitution, it is important to determine whether the content published can be considered a part of the social debate and therefore of public interest, see the supreme court judgments of 1 june 2006 in case no. the media play an important role in disseminating information and opinions on social issues. when the content of the news item debated in this case is assessed as a whole, and the disputed remarks are evaluated in context with other statements in the news report and in consideration of the visual presentation, the comments clearly implied that [a] had committed an act which was punishable in accordance with the penal code no. the applicant] has also not demonstrated that he sought information from [a] on the content while preparing the news report.

the applicant was born in 1945 and lives in jonava. in 1994 the applicant bought an apartment in jonava. in 1998 he lost his regular job and was no longer able to pay for utilities. in 2000 the utility provider instituted civil proceedings against the applicant concerning his debt of 2,861 lithuanian litai (ltl – approximately 828.60 euros (eur)). in 2003 the judgment was transferred to a bailiff for enforcement. the bailiff decided to direct enforcement against the applicant’s apartment. on 6 october 2004 he organised a public auction at which the apartment was sold to a third party for ltl 3,390 (approximately eur 982). on 18 november 2004 a district court confirmed the transfer of the apartment to the third party. since that date, the applicant has not had a permanent home. he submitted that he had been living in temporary accommodation, at times in unsuitable conditions, and often in exchange for manual work. between 2006 and 2008 the apartment was resold and gifted to different individuals on several occasions. in november 2007 the applicant instituted civil proceedings before the jonava district court, arguing that the sale of his apartment at the public auction had been unlawful. the applicant also submitted that he had owned 0.05 hectares of land near jonava, so the enforcement should have begun in respect of that property and not his only home (vienintelė gyvenamoji vieta). in view of the alleged unlawfulness of the sale, the applicant claimed damages jointly from the bailiff and the bailiff’s professional liability insurer. they also argued that the applicant’s debt (ltl 2,861) and the enforcement expenses (ltl 540), taken together, had exceeded ltl 3,000, and thus the sale of his apartment had been in accordance with the domestic law. the defendants further argued that the applicant had acted in bad faith – he had not appealed against the execution writ or the results of the public auction, and he had submitted his claim at the very end of the time-limit because he had been waiting for the market price of the apartment to increase. however, the court considered that this breach had not been such as to warrant the annulment of the sale. accordingly, it dismissed the applicant’s claim for damages. the applicant appealed against the jonava district court’s judgment. he and the defendants presented essentially the same arguments as in their pleadings before the first-instance court (see paragraphs 10-11 above). on 1 october 2009 the kaunas regional court quashed the first‑instance judgment and allowed the applicant’s claim in its entirety. the court held that the bailiff had acted in violation of domestic law, firstly by failing to direct the enforcement against the applicant’s land, but also by selling his apartment at a public auction even though his debt had been less than ltl 3,000. accordingly, the kaunas regional court decided to award the applicant damages from the bailiff’s professional liability insurer. the bailiff’s professional liability insurer appealed against the kaunas regional court’s judgment. it submitted, inter alia, that the amount of damages awarded to the applicant had no basis, and the court should have either ordered restitution in integrum or awarded the applicant the amount for which his apartment had been sold at the auction (see paragraph 7 above), but not its market price in 2007, which had increased significantly since 2004. the applicant contested the appeal, arguing that there was no legal obligation for him to ask for restitution rather than for damages, and that the amount of damages was a question of fact which the supreme court could not examine. on 8 february 2010 the supreme court amended the judgment of the kaunas regional court in part. the supreme court then reiterated its own case-law that, where the sale of property at a public auction is unlawful because of a bailiff’s actions, restitution in integrum should not be applied; accordingly, it considered that the most appropriate way of protecting the applicant’s rights was by awarding him damages. however, the court considered that, in line with “the nature of the obligation and the principles of equity, reasonableness and good faith” (pagal prievolės esmę, atsižvelgiant į teisingumo, protingumo ir sąžiningumo kriterijus), the amount of damages in the applicant’s case had to be assessed at the moment of the unlawful act, that is, the sale of the apartment. according to the state enterprise centre of registers, the market price of the applicant’s apartment at the time of its sale had been ltl 12,100 (approximately eur 3,504).
the applicant was born in 1986 and lives in sumy. the applicant had relations with v., a female student born in 1989. on 24 march 2008 v. gave birth to their daughter. on 29 august 2008 the applicant and v. registered their marriage. during their absence the applicant’s parents took care of the child. in october 2010 the child was admitted to a child-minding centre in sumy. while working abroad, v. transferred funds to the applicant to support the family. the applicant was not informed of the place to where v. and the child moved to live. on 28 september 2011 the applicant asked the police to establish the whereabouts of the child. he and his parents also conducted their own enquiries. on 2 december 2011 a forensic medical expert examined the child and reported a red spot on the chin, measuring 1.5 cm by 0.8 , which – in the expert’s opinion – was “a sign of an earlier abrasion”. v. was given access to the child only in the presence of the applicant or other persons that he trusted. on 8 november 2012 the sumy district police once again refused to open criminal proceedings against v. and f. on the grounds that there had been no corpus delicti. f. could not be interviewed as he had moved abroad. in sum, the sumy district police concluded that the available material had been insufficient to suggest that any crime had been committed. on 21 november 2013 a panel of experts carried out a forensic psychiatric examination of the applicant’s daughter. the child stated that she had seen v. and f. naked and kissing each other; she then described the movements that she had observed v. and f. engaging in while in bed. on 9 april 2014 the deputy head of the investigation division of the sumy regional police department ordered the investigator in charge of the case to immediately speed up the investigation, which, in his opinion, was being conducted too slowly. on 27 december 2014 the sumy district police decided once again to close the criminal proceedings. in examining the statements of the applicant’s daughter, the investigator considered that these statements could not convincingly prove the alleged events since the child had made those statements belatedly; furthermore, the child had only been three years old at the time of the events in question. other people, such as the child’s teacher at the child-minding centre and village inhabitants, had not provided any more precise information. as of 20 january 2016, the investigation was ongoing. the child had been accompanied to and from the centre by her mother. on 1 december 2011 the child had been taken from the centre by her father. the court dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant’s allegation that the mother was negligent with the child and that she might have exercised physical violence against the child: in contrast to the results of the medical examination of 2 december 2011 documenting the injuries on the child’s body (see paragraph 15 above), the staff of the bezdryk child-minding centre had signed a certificate stating that on 1 december 2011 the child had had no injuries; furthermore, the police had refused to institute criminal investigation in respect of the child’s injuries (see paragraph 19 above). consequently, it determined that the child should reside with her mother. the court had failed to properly examine the allegations that v. had behaved violently towards the child and the possibility that the child had been the target of sexual abuse during the period when she had lived apart from her father with her mother. in his opinion, the court had paid no attention to the fact that the child had been attached to the paternal grandparents and that her separation from them would be detrimental to her interests. furthermore, the respective financial capacity of the applicant and v., as well as the residential conditions, had not been properly assessed. important pieces of evidence had not been included in the case file and part of the evidence had been assessed wrongly – namely, the certificate issued by the bezdryk child-minding centre regarding the child’s good state of health was a fabricated document that had been discredited by the forensic medical expert report of 2 december 2011.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in osijek. on 27 april 2011 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of trafficking illegal substances. the decision also stated that the detention could not exceed forty-eight hours. on charges of trafficking illegal substances. the applicant’s detention was ordered because g.d. had said that he had been buying illegal drugs from him. furthermore, he was unemployed and another set of criminal proceedings on similar charges was pending against him. following an appeal lodged by the applicant, on 3 may 2011 the decision on his detention was upheld by a three-judge panel of the osijek county court. on 24 may 2011 the investigating judge ordered the applicant’s immediate release because g.d. had retracted his previous statement that he had been buying illegal drugs from him. furthermore, the applicant had submitted documents showing that he had his own candle-making business. the applicant was released that same day. on 31 may 2011 the investigating judge confirmed his previous decision. it was argued that the risk of the applicant reoffending continued to exist for several reasons. had given a detailed statement describing how he and i.d. ’s retraction of his previous statement had been unconvincing. secondly, the applicant had already been convicted of a similar offence, and another set of criminal proceedings concerning charges of trafficking illegal substances were pending against him. fourthly, he was unemployed and had no lawful means of subsistence. on 10 june 2011 a three-judge panel of the osijek county court, composed of judges d.k., held a closed session in the parties’ absence. on 14 june 2011 the applicant was again placed in pre-trial detention. acting as a single judge of the osijek county court, declared it inadmissible on 27 june 2011 on the grounds that it was not amenable to further appeal. this decision was upheld on 1 july 2011 by a three-judge panel of the same court, composed of judges r.š., on 18 october 2012 the osijek county court dismissed the indictment against the applicant because the prosecutor had withdrawn the charges against him. on 14 june 2012 the supreme court ordered his release. on 18 february 2014 the court allowed the applicant’s claim and awarded him 137,550 croatian kunas (hrk – about 18,560 euros) in non-pecuniary damages. the relevant part of the judgment reads:
“the claimant’s claim is well founded in its entirety. kv-138/2011-3 of 26 may 2011 (pages 16 and 17 of the case file) shows that the claimant had already been finally convicted by the donji miholjac municipal court of the criminal offence of abuse of illegal drugs under article 173 § 1 of the criminal code, that is to say for an offence of the same type but in its basic form. it is true that the claimant was previously convicted of the above-mentioned criminal offence. therefore, since the defendant has not proved that the claimant caused his arrest by some unlawful act such as absconding or concealing evidence, this court considers that there was no contribution on his part to the ordering of his detention.”
the applicant was born in 1961 and lives in matosinhos. following an altercation with other persons, the applicant was prosecuted by the public prosecutor at the matosinhos district court for threatening conduct. on 13 april 2007 the applicant appealed to the oporto court of appeal (“the court of appeal”) against the judgment. she repeated that she had been unaware of the unlawfulness of her acts and sought an acknowledgment of her lack of criminal responsibility owing to the psychiatric disorders from which she claimed to suffer. consequently, she asked for a fresh assessment of the facts and the opportunity to state her case at a hearing. on 12 december 2007 the court of appeal held a hearing attended by the public prosecutor and counsel for the applicant. however, no examination of the applicant herself took place. it held that there was no need for a fresh assessment of the facts because the applicant had not succeeded in challenging the validity of the assessment conducted by the court of first instance. the applicant paid the fine in several instalments. during the hearing before the court it was pointed out that in january 2016, five years after the fine had been paid in full, the entry concerning the applicant’s conviction had been deleted from her criminal record. as before the court of first instance, the applicant raised, in particular, the question whether her criminal responsibility should have been deemed diminished, which might have had a major impact on the determination of the sentence. those factors are sufficient for the court to conclude that in the instant case a public hearing should have been held before the appellate court. as regards the claims in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage under article 41 of the convention, the court stated the following:
“41. 46221/99, § 210, echr 2005-iv, and panasenko v. portugal, no. in the present case, the only point at issue is the fact that the applicant was not given a hearing by the court of appeal. in that regard, it does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged, and rejects this claim. the court cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings before the court of appeal would have been if it had examined the applicant at a public hearing (see igual coll v. spain, no. on 5 july 2012 the portuguese government submitted an action plan to the committee of ministers concerning the execution of the court’s judgment of 5 july 2011. they confirmed that the amount awarded to the applicant had been paid to her on 14 december 2011. as regards the general measures, the government pointed out that the prime minister’s office had proposed amending the code of criminal procedure to allow hearings to be held in any court of appeal determining the issue of guilt or the sentence in respect of an accused person. at the time of adoption of the present judgment no plans to reform the code of criminal procedure were on the domestic authorities’ agenda. concurrently, on 18 october 2011, relying on article 449 § 1 (g) of the code of criminal procedure, the applicant lodged an application for review with the supreme court. in a judgment of 21 march 2012 the supreme court refused to grant a review. it held that there was no cause for a review because the judgment delivered by the court of appeal was not incompatible with the court’s judgment. it considered that the lack of a hearing for the applicant in the court of appeal had constituted a procedural irregularity that was not amenable to review, and held as follows:
“... under domestic law, an application for review can be submitted solely in respect of judgments (in particular, convictions), and not in respect of orders concerning the conduct of proceedings, it being understood that ... ‘judgment’ denotes any judicial decision on a case or on a procedural application (see article 156 § 2 of the code of civil procedure). in the light of domestic law, however, a review of the judgment in the present case cannot be allowed on the basis invoked by the applicant, because the conviction is not incompatible with the european court’s judgment (article 449 § 1 (g) of the code of criminal procedure). under domestic law, where the accused is legally required to appear in court, his or her absence entails an irremediable nullity (article 119 (c) of the code of criminal procedure). however, even where a nullity is irremediable, it cannot give rise to an extraordinary application for review of the judgment ...
furthermore, as noted by the european court, it is impossible to speculate about the decision which the court of appeal might have taken if the convicted person had been examined at the hearing which led to the decision on her appeal, and, in particular, about whether or not the sentence would have been the same. in short, the conviction is not incompatible with the european court’s binding decision, and no serious doubts arise as to its validity. consequently, the judges of the criminal division of the supreme court decide not to grant a review.”
in february 2011, after holding a firearms licence and a hunting permit for about ten years, the applicant asked the s. police department (hereinafter: “the police”) to renew his firearms licence for hunting purposes. he did not live in croatia but went hunting when he spent holidays there. when submitting his request the applicant relied on a certificate of the ministry of health (ministartsvo zdravstva republike hrvatske) attesting that he was healthy and thus capable of carrying firearms. following the applicant’s request the police carried out a background check. a report of 22 february 2011, available in the file, contains a finding of the police that the applicant had often been under the influence of alcohol when visiting croatia. on 18 august 2011 the applicant was summoned by the police to give a statement concerning the intention of a weapons commission not to renew his firearms licence. the applicant denied any alcohol abuse and stated that he had been a hunter for several years and that, if necessary, he could undergo any test concerning his health and the alleged drinking problem. in a further written statement dated 19 august 2011 the applicant contended that hunting was his hobby and that his membership of a hunting association was related to his social status. he denied any allegations of alcohol abuse and argued that there were no justified reasons for a refusal to renew his firearms licence. on 23 august 2011 the applicant made the same objections through a lawyer. he stressed that his request for renewal of the firearms licence could not be refused merely because somebody had allegedly said that he was a drinker. on the same day the police dismissed the applicant’s request for renewal of his firearms licence and ordered him to hand over his weapons on the grounds that a police inquiry had shown that he had a problem of alcohol abuse. the applicant challenged this decision before the ministry of the interior (ministarstvo unutarnjih poslova republike hrvatske, hereinafter “the ministry”), arguing that he had been falsely accused by some neighbours and that there was no evidence of any drinking problem. he also stressed that hunting allowed him to see his friends, and that those who had made the allegations against him did not really know him. on 9 november 2011 the police produced a new report on the background check on the applicant. the report, which was available in the file, provided further details on the applicant’s alleged alcohol abuse, which had been confirmed by his neighbours in croatia. on 12 december 2011 the ministry dismissed the applicant’s complaints, on the grounds that the documents from the case file suggested that he had a problem of alcohol abuse. on 6 february 2012 the applicant lodged an administrative action in the administrative court challenging the ministry’s decision. on 26 april 2012 the administrative court held a hearing at which it heard the parties’ arguments. he also considered that it was not clear on which grounds the police had dismissed the applicant’s request. it explained that the file at issue would be inspected by the judges and would not become part of the administrative court’s case file. afterwards, in the resumed hearing in the parties’ presence, the applicant’s representative reiterated his arguments that the applicant did not have a drinking problem. he did not seek examination of further evidence. on 23 may 2012 the administrative court dismissed the applicant’s administrative action and upheld the decisions of the administrative bodies refusing to renew the applicant’s firearms licence. in this connection he explained that he had been a hunter for over ten years, and that hunting was his way of maintaining contact with his friends. in support of his constitutional complaint the applicant submitted a list of signatures of his neighbours attesting that he did not have a problem of alcohol abuse. he also submitted a medical certificate indicating that he had no problem of alcohol abuse. on 6 february 2014 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as unfounded. the constitutional court held that since the applicant had had access to the police reports on his background check, which contained details for dismissing his request (see bakırcı the reports referred to in paragraphs 9 and 16 above), the fact that further details on which those report had been based, including personal details about individuals who had provided information to the police, had not been disclosed to him did not infringe any of his rights. the decision of the constitutional court was served on the applicant’s representative on 18 february 2014.
the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in dison. the applicant stated that she was a muslim and had decided, on her own initiative, to wear the niqab – a veil covering the face except for the eyes – in accordance with her religious beliefs. she said that she had taken the decision to wear the full-face veil when she was sixteen years old. she explained that her choice had been accepted by her family and friends and by her husband. she also stated that she had always agreed to remove her veil for identification purposes as required by the authorities, such as when issuing her identity card. on 18 february 2008 the vesdre district administrative authorities proposed an amendment to the district regulations regarding the wearing of the burqa in public thoroughfares and in public places ... . the president of the police district invited the verviers public prosecutor to express an opinion on that proposal. on 18 march 2008 the public prosecutor replied that he did not have any observations to make. the municipal councils of the three municipalities belonging to the police district – the municipal council of pepinster on 23 june 2008, dison on 26 june 2008 and verviers on 30 june 2008 – enacted the following provisions of the consolidated by-laws of the vesdre police district, which differed, moreover, from the original proposal. save where authorised by the mayor (bourgmestre) of the municipality, wearing a mask or using any strategem whatsoever for the purposes of concealing personal identity shall be forbidden at all times, at any public meeting and in all public places and in public thoroughfares. the wearing of clothing concealing the face shall be forbidden at all times and in all public places. however, a helmet, balaclava or other headgear may be worn where authorised by the legislation on the safety of workers or other legislation. on 29 august 2008 the applicant lodged an application with the conseil d’état for annulment of article 113bis. she argued that the provision in question expressly targeted the islamic veil, which she wore, and that the resulting ban constituted an interference with her rights guaranteed by articles 8, 9 and 10 of the convention and discrimination in breach of article 14 of the convention. she contended that the interference did not pursue a legitimate aim as the principle of secularism was not a constitutional principle and there could therefore be no blanket ban on wearing the veil. in any event, even supposing that the aim could be regarded as legitimate, the applicant maintained that the means were disproportionate in the absence of public disorder or threat of public disorder and thus of a pressing social need. in their memorial in reply of 18 april 2011, the three municipalities submitted that the impugned provision sought to guarantee public safety and not to regulate or restrict the exercise of any form of worship. the auditeur at the conseil d’état delivered a detailed 26-page report in which he concluded that in his opinion the applicant’s above-mentioned submission was well founded because public safety could not serve as a basis for a ban on wearing the full-face veil in all places generally open to the public, as no specific public disorder was associated with it as such. 213.849 of 15 june 2011, the conseil d’état, refusing to follow the opinion of the auditeur, dismissed the application for annulment of the provision ... . that judgment was served on the applicant on 23 june 2011.
on 3 may 2007 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the police alleging that in the past two years she had been a victim of multiple acts of domestic violence by her husband, b.b. a preliminary police investigation showed that there was a suspicion that the applicant had been the victim of psychological and physical violence by b.b. on the basis of those findings, the police forwarded the applicant’s criminal complaint to the relevant state attorney’s office. the police also forwarded the applicant’s medical records showing that in april 2007 she had sustained a contusion on her back after being pushed from a chair by b.b. on 3 july 2007 the p. municipal state attorney’s office (općinsko državno odvjetništvo u p.) asked an investigating judge of the s. county court (županijski sud u s.) to open an investigation into the matter. in the course of the investigation, the investigating judge heard the applicant and b.b. the latter denied the allegations of domestic violence. the judge also heard another witness, v.k., who confirmed that the applicant had often complained of emotional and physical harassment by her husband and had twice sustained injuries as a result of the alleged harassment. on the basis of the results of the investigation, on 29 january 2008 the state attorney’s office indicted b.b. in the p. municipal court (općinski sud u p.) on charges of domestic violence punishable under article 215a of the criminal code (see paragraph 20 below). the relevant part of the indictment reads:
“in the period between 1 january 2004 and 26 april 2007 in p., ... [b.b.] several times, telling her to ‘go back to her scumbags in the dump from which she had come’ and that she was worthless. he raised his hand [threatening] to hit her, punched her in the face and body, and ordered her to go to the corner of the room. in december 2004 he grabbed her head and banged it against the bathroom wall and on 27 april 2007 he pushed her from a chair, as a result of which she fell to the ground. to a position of helplessness and debasement ...” 11. during the proceedings, the trial court heard the applicant, b.b., guilty as charged and sentenced him to seven months’ imprisonment, suspended for two years. on 2 march 2010, following an appeal lodged by b.b., the s. county court quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the municipal court on the grounds that all the relevant facts of the case had not been established. in the resumed proceedings, the municipal court again heard the applicant, b.b. it also examined further documents from other relevant state bodies concerning conflicts within the applicant’s family. on 2 december 2010 the municipal court found b.b. guilty as charged and sentenced him to seven months’ imprisonment, suspended for two years. challenged that judgment before the s. county court. on 14 october 2011 the s. county court quashed the judgment and remitted the case for further examination on the grounds that some relevant facts still needed to be established. in the resumed proceedings, on 16 january 2013 the municipal court discontinued the proceedings on the grounds that the 2011 criminal code (see paragraph 21-22 below) had abolished the criminal offence of domestic violence under article 215a of the 1997 criminal code, and that further proceedings against b.b. the state attorney’s office did not challenge that decision but the applicant lodged an appeal with the s. county court. on 28 february 2013 the s. county court declared the applicant’s appeal inadmissible on the grounds that she did not have legal standing to challenge the decision on the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings.
the first and second applicants were born in 1981 and 1971 respectively and live in jurbarkas. the doctors noticed that the heartbeat of the foetus was weak and decided to perform a caesarean section. following the surgery, the first applicant gave birth to a daughter. the newborn baby was in a serious condition, so she was taken to a hospital in kaunas for intensive care. the government contested this and submitted that the applicants had been informed that an autopsy had been necessary but refused it nonetheless. had not been properly qualified to provide obstetric services. the report issued a series of recommendations to the hospital, and also suggested that the state inspectorate for medical inquiries conduct a more in-depth inspection of the medical services at jurbarkas hospital. in july and august 2009 the applicants were interviewed and granted victim status in the investigation. however, the prosecutor denied their request, relying on an opinion from medical experts that performing an autopsy more than three months after the baby’s death would not give any results because of the significant post-mortem changes to the body during that time. the applicants also submitted questions and their questions were forwarded to the specialists. on 10 february 2011 three other court-appointed doctors provided answers to the applicants’ questions. their overall conclusions were the same as those of the previous specialists. on 4 march 2011 the prosecutor discontinued the pre‑trial investigation on the grounds that no causal link between the actions of the doctors at jurbarkas hospital and the baby’s death had been established. the applicants submitted a list of additional questions to be forwarded to the forensic expert. however, the court’s order was only forwarded to the forensic expert on 5 february 2013. on 29 january 2013 a court-appointed forensic expert delivered the answers to the prosecutor’s questions (see paragraph 19 above). on 13 february 2013 the applicants submitted a complaint to the prosecutor general, stating that the pre-trial investigation was being conducted inefficiently and with undue delays. on 25 june 2013 a court-appointed forensic expert delivered the answers to the applicants’ questions (see paragraph 20 above). was again not present, and the court received a medical certificate confirming her hospitalisation until 14 may 2014. would not be well enough by 13 may, and that on the later dates he would be unable to represent her. the court adjourned the case until 25 june 2014. on 14 july 2014 the jurbarkas district court terminated the case on the basis that it was time-barred. had been charged with a crime of negligence, and the five-year statutory limitation period had ended on 21 may 2014 (see paragraphs 8 above and 39 below). the applicants appealed against that judgment. they submitted that, in line with the criminal code, the statutory limitation period must have been suspended while the examination of the case had been adjourned owing to v.k. ’s hospitalisation – so there were no grounds for suspending the statutory limitation period. they revised their claim in december 2011 and august 2013. on 26 november 2014 the kaunas regional court granted the applicants’ claim in part. relying on the available inquiry reports, as well as the specialist opinions and results of the forensic examinations delivered in the criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 9, 10, 11, 17, 21 and 23 above), the court held that the doctors at jurbarkas hospital had breached their duty of care and that their actions “had contributed” (turėjo įtakos) to the death of the applicants’ daughter, so there were grounds for the hospital incurring civil liability. the applicants and the hospital appealed against that judgment, but on 17 september 2015 the court of appeal upheld the lower court’s findings.

the applicants’ dates of birth and places of residence are given in the appendix. the applicants were opposition-oriented activists. at the material time the first applicant was a member of one of the opposition parties, the popular front party of azerbaijan. he participated in a number of peaceful demonstrations organised by the opposition and on several occasions was arrested and convicted for that. on 12 october 2013 an opposition group i̇ctimai palata held a demonstration, authorised by the relevant authority, the baku city executive authority (“the bcea”). the demonstration was held in the mahsul stadium, a place proposed by the bcea. it was intended to be peaceful and was conducted in a peaceful manner. the participants were protesting against alleged irregularities and fraud during the presidential elections of 9 october 2013. all three applicants participated in that demonstration. after the end of the demonstration of 12 october 2013 the applicants were arrested at the entrance to a nearby metro station, inshaatchilar. the circumstances of the applicants’ arrests, their custody and subsequent administrative proceedings against them are similar to those in huseynli and others v. azerbaijan (nos. 67360/11 and 2 others, 11 february 2016) and huseynov and others v. azerbaijan ([committee] nos. 34262/14 and 5 others, 24 november 2016) (see also appendix).
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in sofia. in 1993 the applicant, acting as a sole trader, concluded a contract with a municipally-owned company under which she undertook to set up a shop in the city shopping centre. this contract was extended numerous times. on 1 july 1996 the applicant asked the kardzhali municipal council (“the municipal council”) to sell to her the first floor of the shopping centre under the preferential privatisation procedure for tenants of state- and municipally-owned property as provided for in section 35 (1) of the transformation and privatisation of state and municipally-owned enterprises act (закон за преобразуване и приватизация на държавни и общински предприятия) (“the privatisation act”). in february 1997 the applicant was informed that the municipal council had refused her request on 29 january 1997. the applicant brought judicial review proceedings challenging the refusal to sell the property to her. on 20 february 2004 the kardzhali regional court quashed the council’s refusal and instructed it to open a privatisation procedure under which it would offer the applicant the option to buy the first floor of the shopping centre under preferential conditions, in accordance with the privatisation act. that finding was upheld by the supreme administrative court in a final decision of 18 february 2005. in the meantime, on 8 may 2001 the mayor of kardzhali sent a notice to the applicant announcing the termination of the contract concluded in 1993 (see paragraph 6 above). on 4 june 2001 the mayor ordered the applicant’s eviction from the shop. this ruling was confirmed by the burgas regional court. before it entered into force, representatives of the municipal council broke into the shop and took possession of it. on 9 november 2001 the district prosecutor refused to intervene or to open criminal proceedings. subsequently the regional and appellate prosecutors upheld that refusal. on 11 april 2005 the applicant requested the municipal council to open a privatisation procedure so that she could buy the first floor of the shopping centre, in accordance with the final decision of the supreme administrative court of 18 february 2005 (see paragraph 8 above). the municipal council did not reply to her request, so the applicant complained to the district prosecutor about that failure to respond and asked him to open criminal proceedings. on 3 july 2006 the district prosecutor refused to open criminal proceedings, observing in particular that, given that the decision had been taken by a collective body, no individual criminal responsibility could be attached to any of its members. in the same decision the council also prohibited any and all transactions aimed at disposing of the property. during the proceedings the relevant authorities considered that the shopping centre had not been divided into separate property units and that such a division would have to be carried out before some of those could be sold to the applicant. on 24 july 2008 the municipal council authorised the mayor to open a privatisation procedure in favour of the applicant in respect of part of the shopping centre’s first floor. the court found that the municipality’s failure to sell to her the entirety of the property, as decided in the final judgment of 18 february 2005 in the applicant’s favour (see paragraph 8 above), did not constitute a new refusal to initiate a privatisation procedure; rather, it represented a failure on the part of the authorities in question to comply with the said final judgment ordering the start of that privatisation procedure. this ruling was upheld by the supreme administrative court on 22 january 2010. in the meantime, the applicant lodged a claim for damages against the municipal council under the state and municipalities responsibility for damage act 1988 (“the smrda”). her claim concerned the period between the date of the final judgment of 18 february 2005 and the date of her lodging the claim for damages – 18 december 2007. the sofia administrative court rejected her claim on 10 november 2008. as regards her claim for non-pecuniary damages, the court found that the applicant’s great emotional suffering was established during the trial. the applicant appealed before the supreme administrative court which upheld the lower court’s findings in a final decision of 31 may 2010. that part was identified as consisting of two separate units, which she claimed were due to her on the basis of the final judgment of 18 february 2005. on 12 september 2014, the applicant leased one of her recently acquired property units to a third party, a company. the terms of the lease were for the period of twenty years and for the price of 50,000 euros (eur).

the applicant was born in 1983 and lives in portoheli. on 12 september 2007 the applicant was convicted of forming a criminal organisation, of – together with others − kidnapping an adult, of robbery committed together with others, and of the theft and illegal possession of a gun, and was sentenced to twenty-two years’ imprisonment by the nafplio three-member court of appeal for felonies (τριμελές εφετείο κακουργημάτων) acting as a first-instance court (decision no. the applicant, who had been in pre-trial detention since 7 april 2006, was represented by a lawyer in the proceedings. following the delivery of the judgment, the applicant expressed his wish to lodge an appeal against the decision of the first-instance court and was escorted, handcuffed, by policemen to the registry of the court in order to do so. in the registry there were pre-printed forms for lodging an appeal, which included the following wording:
“in nafplio, in the nafplio court of appeal today on ... day... and time ... came to me, the registrar of nafplio court of appeal .... (name), the ... (name) of ... (father’s name) and of ... (mother’s name) who was born on ... in ..., whose profession is ... and resides in ..., street ... no. ... identity card issued on ... by.... and requested that this report be drafted declaring that: (he) appeals before the nafplio five-member appeal court against decision no. .... of the nafplio three‑member court of appeal by which he was convicted of ... to a total sentence of ... requesting that the decision under appeal be set aside and that he be acquitted from the charge for the reasons he will cite before the appeal court.” under the above paragraph there was an empty space and then followed the phrases:
“he appoints as his representative the lawyer practising in nafplio ...(name). this report was read and confirmed and is signed by the person lodging the appeal and the registrar”. the registrar completed the pre-printed form with the applicant’s personal data, the number of the decision against which he wished to lodge the appeal, the sentence that was imposed to him and the name of the applicant’s representative. he then signed the report and the applicant was momentarily released from handcuffs in order to sign it as well. on 7 may 2009 the applicant’s appeal was heard by the nafplio five‑member court of appeal (“the appeal court”). the appeal court by a majority dismissed the legal remedy as inadmissible on the grounds that no reasons had been included in the report, as required by law (decision no. the president of the appeal court did not agree with the majority of the panel, expressing the view that from the phrase “...for the reasons he will cite before the appeal court”, one could easily infer that the applicant was complaining about erroneous assessment of the evidence by the court of first instance. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the decision of the appeal court, arguing that his appeal should not have been dismissed as inadmissible. the applicant submitted that it was standard practice in all appeal courts for the defendants to be given a pre-printed form which included the phrase: “because the court of first instance did not assess correctly the facts of the case and declared the defendant guilty of an act he did not commit and for the reasons he will cite before the appeal court”. in the instant case, the nafplio court of appeal had printed a form in which the first part of the phrase was omitted and the applicant was not to blame for this omission. he was only given the form to sign and was handcuffed at the time, making it even more difficult for him to read the report thoroughly. the court of cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as unfounded on the grounds that the content of the appeal was the applicant’s responsibility, as distinct from the formalities which were the responsibility of the registrar (decision no. the decision was finalised on 28 april 2010. the applicant served his sentence in patras prison until 23 july 2015 when he was given a conditional release.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in pazardzhik. on 10 january 2007 the police searched the applicant’s home, where they found five one hundred dollar (usd) bills, which turned out subsequently to be counterfeit. in may 2007 the applicant was charged by an investigator with having acquired those bills and with their possession, offences under article 244 §§ 1 and 2 of the criminal code (see paragraph 16 below). however, the second charge was subsequently dropped and in july 2007 a prosecutor indicted the applicant for acquiring the notes “in the period between 2002 and 10 january 2007”, in the knowledge that they were counterfeit. it was noted in the description of the facts in the bill of indictment that in 2002 the applicant had sold a flat and that with part of the money had bought several one hundred dollar bills from a person on the street. he testified to pazardzhik regional court (hereinafter “the regional court”), which examined the case at first instance, that it had been his brother who had given him money in 2002 after selling a flat. the applicant had bought dollars with that money, usd 1,000, of which he had been keeping usd 500 “for hard times”. he stated that he did not know that the notes were counterfeit. the applicant’s brother testified as well. he confirmed that in 2002 he had sold his flat and had given the applicant money to buy dollars. he added that in the following years he and the applicant had regularly exchanged the bulgarian levs they had had for dollars. he admitted that he was uncertain whether the counterfeit notes found in the applicant’s home by the police had been the ones the applicant had acquired in 2002. in a judgment of 25 january 2008 the regional court convicted the applicant. however, the conviction was for having acquired counterfeit notes “in the period between 26 march 2005 and 10 january 2007”, as it had been only on the former date that the act of acquiring such notes had been criminalised (see paragraph 16 below). the regional court acquitted the applicant for having acquired the notes between 2002 and 26 march 2005. when summarising the facts of the case as it had established them, the regional court repeated what the applicant had said, namely that in 2002 his brother had given him money to buy dollars. it also referred to the applicant’s brother’s explanation that after 2002 the two men had regularly exchanged their bulgarian levs for dollars. it did not comment any further on the question of when the applicant had acquired the counterfeit notes. finding in addition that he had been aware at the time of obtaining those notes that they had been counterfeit (the key evidence in that regard had been a statement by the applicant made in a telephone conversation with another person on 9 january 2007), the regional court found him guilty of that charge. in addition, it found him guilty of another offence and gave him a suspended sentence of two years’ imprisonment. the applicant lodged an appeal, arguing that there was no evidence substantiating the conclusion that, when he had bought the five hundred dollar bills in 2002, he had been aware that they were counterfeit. in a judgment of 24 april 2008 the plovdiv court of appeal (hereinafter “the court of appeal”) upheld the regional court’s judgment, endorsing its reasoning. once again, when summarising the facts, it restated what the applicant had said, namely that in 2002 his brother had given him money to buy dollars, which he had done, and had kept usd 500 hidden in his house. it did not comment any further on the question as to when the applicant had acquired the counterfeit notes found on him. in an appeal on points of law lodged with the supreme court of cassation, the applicant stated in particular the following:
“the two lower instances established unconditionally that [the applicant] had bought the five counterfeit dollar bank notes in the spring of 2002 with money given to him by his brother. ... at the time that did not amount to a criminal offence, which is why [the applicant] was acquitted of having acquired the notes in the period before 26 march 2005. but where is the proof that those notes in particular were acquired after that date? there can only be guesses ... and a conviction cannot be based on guesses.” in a final judgment of 24 november 2008 the supreme court of cassation upheld the court of appeal’s judgment, failing to comment on the applicant’s argument that it had not been shown that he had acquired the counterfeit bank notes after 26 march 2005.
the applicants, all georgian nationals, were born in 1946, 1947 and 1957 respectively. at the material time they lived in different flats in a residential block (“the building”) constructed in 1952 and situated at 4 uznadze street in tbilisi. the plant was constructed in 1911 and reconstructed at a later date. for several decades it burned coal to generate power, before replacing it with natural gas. the plant provided the adjacent residential areas with electricity and heat. on 2 november 1999 presidential decree no. 613 was issued, stating that the plant was to be privatised and sold directly to a private company. the privatisation agreement between the government and the company was concluded on 6 april 2000. on 2 february 2001 the plant partially ceased generating power owing to financial problems. however, it continued to use some of the generators. (b)  action for damages and the friendly settlement 16. on an unspecified date in the summer of 2000 the applicants and other residents of the building brought an action for damages against the plant concerning the environmental nuisances emanating from the plant. they relied on privately commissioned independent expert opinions in support of their complaints. (ii)  expert examinations commissioned by the court 18. on 7 march and 23 september 2002 the tbilisi regional court granted a request by the claimants and ordered the ministry of justice, the ministry of labour, health and social affairs and the ministry of the environment to arrange a number of expert examinations. the latter were intended to measure the environmental pollution caused by the plant, clarify how the associated harmful effects had affected the claimants’ health and might have endangered human life, and identify appropriate remedies. an expert examination dated 28 october 2002 and carried out by the expertise and special research centre at the ministry of justice concluded as follows:
“as the “tboelectrocentrali” plant does not have a [buffer] zone and is immediately adjacent to a residential building, the plant’s chimneys must be equipped with appropriate filters and other equipment to protect the population from the hazardous gases.” with regard to the air pollution and the possible impact upon the residents of the building, the expert opinion concluded as follows:
“considering the fact that the plant does not have a [buffer] zone and is immediately adjacent to a residential building ..., taking into account the direction of the wind, a whole bouquet of emissions is reaching into the homes ... negatively affecting the population living in the adjacent area.” it continued to note in this connection that the concentrated toxicity of the gases emitted by the plant was twice the norm and the residents of the building concerned had to live in conditions where the concentration of toxic substances surpassed the acceptable limits twenty-four hours a day. on 6 february 2004 the iep expert carried out an additional investigation aimed at determining the noise levels in the individual flats of the claimants. the expert opinion produced by the ministry of labour, health and social affairs on 17 january 2003 disclosed that, in some instances, the intensity of the electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of the building exceeded the permissible levels. the third applicant and another claimant were not included, without any reasons being given for their exclusion. the first and second applicants were found to be suffering from largely similar health conditions such as neurasthenia and asthenic syndrome. that is to say, despite the claimants’ numerous requests and complaints, [the authorities concerned] failed to take specific measures to ensure an environment safe enough for the claimants’ health.” they further disagreed with the lower court’s findings with respect to the alleged noise pollution emanating from the plant. on 21 april 2005 the supreme court delivered a final judgment in the case. the supreme court rejected the complaint concerning the electromagnetic pollution as unsubstantiated. as regards the submissions concerning the air pollution, the supreme court dismissed them as unsubstantiated. consequently, the appellants were no longer being affected by the pollution. moreover, they had failed, in the court’s opinion, to show what specific pecuniary damage, if any, had been sustained as a result of the air pollution in the previous years.

the applicants are all russian nationals living in different regions of russia. their personal details are set out in the appendix below. on various dates the applicants obtained binding judicial decisions ordering the state authorities to provide them with housing or perform other obligations in kind. according to the latest information available to the court, judgments became final as specified in the table below and either were enforced with a delay or have remained unenforced. the relevant details in respect of the judgments are listed in the appendix. the applicants on several occasions applied to different russian authorities seeking to accelerate the enforcement of the judicial awards in their favour. 73303/11 challenged lawfulness of his dismissal from military service alleging, in particular, that the judicial award in his favour of 28 may 2007 had not been complied with. by the final judgment of 12 may 2011 the moscow garrison military court rejected his action and established, inter alia, that the judgment of 28 may 2007 had been enforced in full on 25 march 2010.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in sesto fiorentino, italy. the applicant’s daughter and youngest son continue to live with their mother in russia. on 19 december 2009 the florence district court held that, while the divorce proceedings were ongoing, the four children should be placed in the care of social services, the children should reside with their mother, and the applicant should pay her child maintenance. in the expert’s opinion, in order to prevent further psychological trauma being inflicted on the children by the mother’s behaviour, it was necessary not only to put a distance between her and the children, but also to have recourse to psychotherapy and improve the quality of the children’s psychological environment at their father’s home. on 29 june 2011 the florence district court found that m.g. as he had refused to see his father, she had been the only parent who had had effective access to him. after the children’s return to italy, m.g. appealed against the judgment of 18 september 2012. of her parental authority in respect of the children. the applicant applied to the st petersburg city court (“the city court”) for recognition and enforcement of the florence district court’s decision of 6 december 2010. it could be modified by the judge who had made it at any time, as indeed it had been modified on 29 june 2011, and could not be appealed against. however, the applicant never availed himself of that remedy. on 25 january 2013 the city court rejected the applicant’s application. these circumstances are not disputed by the parties. besides, the relationship between parents and children is an ongoing process, objectively it can and does change over time. however, the judgment [of 18 september 2012] indicates that the [italian court] did not take these circumstances into consideration, thereby violating the children’s fundamental rights under article 12 of the united nations convention on the rights of the child ...
the court also takes into account that the enforcement of the florence court judgment might be incompatible with russian law. the applicant’s argument to the effect that he did not intend to bring the children back to italy immediately and that he first wished to restore his relationship with them cannot serve as grounds for granting [his] application [for recognition and enforcement of the judgment of 18 september 2012]. on 7 february 2013 the applicant lodged a private complaint. further, referring to decisions by the supreme court (see paragraphs 74-75 below), the applicant argued that the city court had not indicated what basic principles of the economic, social and legal organisation of russian society had been infringed by the judgment of 18 september 2012. on the same day the court upheld the decision of 25 january 2013, finding that it was lawful, well reasoned and justified. on 9 december 2013 the deputy president of the supreme court of russia informed the applicant that there were no grounds to disagree with the decision of 30 september 2013, refusing to refer the case for consideration by the civil chamber of the supreme court. lodged an application with the dzerzhinskiy district court of st petersburg. was detrimental to their psychological health. on the same date the applicant asked the court to determine a temporary contact arrangement for him and the children. the court also took into consideration the fact that the school principal firmly objected to having the meetings between the applicant and the children take place on the school premises. the parties had not produced any new evidence which could warrant changing the residence arrangements determined by the florence district court. it was based on an examination of the applicant and an analysis of the case file material, since m.g. on 13 may 2014 the city court quashed the decision of 23 july 2013. for the relevant provisions of the hague convention see x v. latvia [gc], no. as of 28 december 2013 article 333 § 3 of the code of civil procedure explicitly provides that the examination of a private complaint against a first-instance court decision concerning the recognition and enforcement of a foreign court judgment is carried out with the participants in the proceedings being notified about the time and place of the appeal hearing.

the applicant was born in 1949 and lives in vyshneve, the kyiv region. ’s subsequent death (see paragraph 36 below), the domestic authorities tried to establish what had happened to him between the two above-mentioned events. at about 6 a.m. on 23 august 2003, after the other detainees had been taken out for various procedural acts, v.k. the two officers who apprehended him and subsequently participated in his ill-treatment have never been identified. as subsequently stated by numerous doctors in the context of the criminal proceedings against their colleague p.v. ( recovered consciousness, but hardly responded to any attempts of contact. as stated by numerous patients, including those sharing the ward with v.k., he died at 6.20 p.m. on 3 september 2003. on 4 september 2003 a forensic medical expert, g.s., on 5 september 2003 the chief doctor at fastiv hospital wrote a letter to the fastiv town police informing them that an unidentified man with head injuries had been brought to the hospital on 25 august 2003 and that he had died on 3 september 2003. on 9 september 2003 the applicant found out about her son’s death from unspecified sources and immediately went to the fastiv police. according to her, his body bore signs of torture. it appears that she complained to the prosecution authorities about the above matters. that case was subsequently joined to and eventually severed from numerous other related criminal proceedings (see the sections below). issued a forensic examination report with similar conclusions as before. given that removing the shoelaces of detainees was a well-known police practice, the applicant suspected that her son had been detained and asked the authorities to investigate that possibility. he documented the following injuries: a fracture of the nose, three wounds on the right side of the head, an unspecified number of haematomas in the soft tissues under the scalp and on the face, and three haematomas under the pericranium. it was stated in that connection that he had sustained at least eight blows to the head from blunt objects (possibly a rubber truncheon, fists and/or feet). ’s head given the omissions and deficiencies of the post-mortem examination. on 6 december 2012 an investigator at bila tserkva city prosecutor’s office (it is not known when and in what circumstances the investigation had been handed over to that authority) made an entry in the unified register of pre-trial investigations regarding an investigation into abuse of office by two unidentified police officers on account of v.k. he was also exempted from punishment for forgery and a false expert conclusion as those charges had become time-barred. according to the applicant, she has never received any money from the kyiv regional bureau of forensic medical examinations. the decision became final as there were no appeals on points of law. (c) how had the failure to carry out the computerised brain tomography influenced the quality of the medical care provided to v.k. ’s inability to eat and drink on his own it was probable his sugar level had dropped. was transferred to the regional hospital for a computer brain tomography, which had seriously undermined the effectiveness of his treatment. it sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment and a prohibition on holding positions related to public duties for three years. later, in the presence of the police, he had hit her again and she had fallen to the ground. had not absconded or committed other criminal offences. was absolved from the penalty as the charges had become time‑barred.

the applicant was born in 1961 and lives in surgut, khanty‑mansiyskiy region, russia. the applicant was the leader of a trade union in a private company. his co-workers expressed a wish to hold a public assembly on constitution day on 12 december 2009 and the applicant, in his capacity as trade union leader, decided to help them. according to him, such help was “an indirect expression of his own opinion”. the applicant distributed banners and explained that it would be more practicable to stage solo demonstrations. to avoid prosecution for holding a public assembly without notifying the authorities in advance, the applicant suggested that his co-workers position themselves at some distance from each other, for instance on different streets. at the time, there was no federal or regional statutory requirement concerning the minimum distance between simultaneous solo demonstrations (see “relevant domestic law”). the applicant was then arrested and taken to the police station, where he was held for three hours. on 18 december 2009 a justice of the peace found him guilty under article 20.2 § 1 of the code of administrative offences (“the cao”) and fined him 1,500 russian roubles (rub) (35 euros at the time). the court considered that the applicant and his co-workers had met in one place; the applicant had given instructions to the others and had distributed banners; he had taken them to the place of the demonstration. in the court’s view, the above circumstances disclosed the presence of a group event in the form of a static demonstration (a “picket”), and confirmed the applicant’s role as its organiser. thus, it was incumbent on the applicant to lodge a prior notification about this event to the competent authority as required by section 7 of the public events act (“the pea”). the applicant appealed noting that the pea defined a “picket” as a form of public expression of opinion where one or more citizens with placards, banners and other means of visual expression stationed themselves near the target object of the “picket”. however, there had been a separate “target object” for each solo demonstrator; the demonstrators had been positioned at a considerable distance from each other (for instance, thirty metres for two of them); thus, he could not be lawfully considered as an organiser of a group event. on 22 january 2010 the surgut town court upheld the judgment.
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in budapest. at 4.07 p.m. on 7 october 2009 the applicant notified the police that he planned to organise a demonstration from 2 to 7 p.m. on 10 october 2009 in front of the venyige street prison in budapest, to protest against the “political persecution of national radicalism”. venyige street is a broad cul-de-sac with a service lane. a police officer from the police station that had received the notification repeatedly attempted to contact the applicant by phone, in line with the relevant decree issued by the minister of the interior on police tasks related to securing public order at major events, in order to arrange for a meeting. despite making several attempts and leaving messages, however, he could not reach him. on 9 october 2009 the head of the budapest police department banned the demonstration on the grounds that traffic could not be diverted to alternative routes (section 8(1) of the assembly act). in the decision, he referred to article 21 of the international covenant on civil and political rights, article 11 of the convention and decision no. the applicant sought a judicial review of the decision within the statutory three-day time-limit. on 15 october 2009 the budapest regional court dismissed the applicant’s case. it noted that in assessing whether or not traffic could be diverted to other routes, the authority had reckoned on the participation of some 200 demonstrators, as per the applicant’s notification, and that it had established that lawful parking and traffic circulation in the neighbourhood would become impossible should the event take place. the court agreed with the police’s decision in that although the right to assembly was a constitutional fundamental right, it was not absolute and must not give rise to a violation of the fundamental rights of others, and could therefore be restricted. the court was satisfied that the decision had been lawful as the police had adequately established the facts, complied with the procedural rules and applied clear assessment criteria, and the assessment of the evidence had been logical.

the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in podgorica. on an unspecified date, the applicant lodged a claim for damages with the court of first instance (osnovni sud) in nikšić. on 23 june 2008 the aforementioned court ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the debtors to pay him, jointly, 45,000 euros (eur) plus statutory interest on account of the non-pecuniary damage suffered. on 27 july 2009 the applicant lodged with the court of first instance in podgorica a request for enforcement of the judgment dated 23 june 2008. following an order, the applicant amended his request for enforcement on 25 february 2010. the enforcement order itself was then adopted on 31 march 2010. on 24 april 2010 the debtors objected to the enforcement order, but their objections were rejected. on 21 june 2010, 5 july 2010 and 7 july 2010 the enforcement court ordered the debtors to disclose their immovable property. it appeared that no immovable assets had been registered in the debtors’ names. the record showed that the first debtor had had two motor vehicles. however, on 16 february 2011, when a bailiff came to make an inventory, the vehicles had already been sold to a third person. on 7 september 2011 the enforcement court ordered an inventory of the debtors’ movable assets. between april 2012 and january 2013 the enforcement court dealt with the objections to the inventories raised by the debtors and third parties. however, on 27 february 2013 the second debtor informed the enforcement court that he had donated his movables to a charity. on 12 april 2013 a new inventory of his moveable assets was carried out. on 15 april 2013 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against the bailiff. on an unspecified date in april the second debtor offered to pay the applicant eur 15,000, but the applicant rejected this offer. on 6 august 2013 the applicant informed the enforcement court that the second debtor had paid him eur 31,000 and that he considered the enforcement proceedings in respect of this debtor as final. on 18 october 2013 the enforcement proceedings in respect of the second debtor were formally terminated. as regards the first debtor, the enforcement proceedings continued. in september 2013 the first debtor’s specified movable assets were estimated at eur 1,285.99 and the enforcement court invited the applicant to take possession of them on 16 september 2013. he was again invited to take possession of the assets in november 2013 and, once more, in july 2015. however, the applicant again declined to do so on both occasions. on 20 october 2015 the first debtor’s father informed the enforcement court that he would pay his son’s debt. this time, the applicant explicitly rejected the court’s offer stating that he did not need those “worthless” assets and that they could have instead been given to a charity. on an unspecified date in december 2015 the applicant notified the enforcement court that he had entered into an agreement with the first debtor and that the first debtor would honor the judgement debt in instalments. however, it appears from the applicant’s later submissions to this court that the first debtor had in fact not paid him anything since he did not have any “valuable assets”. the court of first instance rejected the applicant’s requests for review on 30 june 2011 and 15 february 2012, respectively. the applicant unsuccessfully appealed to the high court, which upheld the first instance court’s decisions. the high court in podgorica also ruled against the applicant’s actions for fair redress on 11 may 2011, 24 november 2011 and 10 may 2012, respectively.
the applicant, who was born in 1963, is a member of the turkish parliament and lives in ankara. at the time of the events giving rise to the present application he was the president of the diyarbakır bar association. on 2 june 2005 the daily newspaper hürriyet reported statements by a senior intelligence officer, who claimed that the national intelligence agency of turkey (“mi̇t”) had been intercepting the telephone conversations and email correspondence of a number of people on the basis of approximately ninety court decisions over the previous ten years. the intelligence officer stated that the surveillance had been continuous until march 2005, when the mi̇t had stopped it in order to wait for the entry into force of the new criminal code. however, when a bomb attack had occurred in march in kuşadası, killing a police superintendent, the mi̇t had gone to the sixth division of the diyarbakır assize court (“the diyarbakır assize court”) to seek permission for the interception of communications. in a decision dated 6 may 2005, relying on article 22 of the constitution and sections 2, 4, 11 and 16 of law no. 4422, the diyarbakır assize court had granted the mi̇t permission to monitor and examine all electronic communications in order to identify and arrest terrorist suspects with international connections as well as to collect evidence and to prevent crime by having early intelligence of it. the mi̇t had obtained permission to intercept all domestic or international telephone calls and communications provided between 8 april and 30 may 2005 by national telecommunications company türk telekom, private mobile network operators and internet providers and to obtain information contained in sms, mms, gprs and fax communications, as well as caller ids, correspondents’ ip addresses and all other communication-related information. on 6 june 2005, after reading the article, the applicant filed a criminal complaint with the diyarbakır principal public prosecutor’s office against the judge, s.t., who had delivered the assize court decision in question, the public prosecutor, the mi̇t agents who had sought permission to monitor and examine communications, and the mi̇t agents who had implemented the decision. relying on a number of newspaper and online articles, the applicant alleged that s.t. had decided that the records of all domestic and international electronic communications between 8 april and 30 may 2005 should be given to the mi̇t by the telecommunications companies. the judge had made that decision in complete disregard of the legislation then in force and without carrying out any research or requiring proof. the impugned decision had been of a very general nature since it had not included the names of any suspects or indicated the date, location or address of people whose communications would be intercepted. as a consequence, any person, including himself, who had used a landline or mobile telephone to communicate between the above-mentioned dates, had been a victim of the impugned decision. the applicant maintained that the decision had violated his rights protected by article 8 of the convention and had also contravened articles 20 and 23 of the constitution, which protected private life and the freedom of communication respectively, since the accused had obtained records of his communications and restricted his freedom of communication without any justification. lastly, the applicant contended that the implementation of the decision, which had been in contravention of section 2 of law no. 4422, required the punishment of those responsible. on 30 september 2005 the diyarbakır principal public prosecutor decided not to prosecute the mi̇t officials who had implemented the diyarbakır assize court’s decision. he decided that the mi̇t officials had merely implemented the court’s decision when intercepting and examining communications and that the implementation of court decisions was required by law and did not constitute a crime. in any event, there was no evidence that the telecommunications companies had given any records to the mi̇t officials or that they had monitored communications over the internet. the public prosecutor also referred to a decision by the ankara principal public prosecutor not to prosecute over the same issue (decision no. 2005/35575, 17 june 2005) in relation to a number of other complaints brought against the diyarbakır assize court’s decision. on 25 october 2005 the applicant filed an objection with the siverek assize court against the above decision, alleging that the diyarbakır public prosecutor had failed to carry out an investigation into his complaints concerning an alleged violation of his rights guaranteed by articles 8 and 13 of the convention. on 30 november 2005 the siverek assize court dismissed the applicant’s objection, holding that the principal public prosecutor’s decision against prosecution had complied with the legislation since the mi̇t officials had implemented a court decision and had not committed any offence. on 6 april 2006 the ministry of justice decided not to take an action against the public prosecutor and the judge as it found that their acts fell within judicial discretion. the ministry considered that although the impugned interception decision had been in breach of the national and international legal norms, the aim was to locate the terrorists before they acted and to take the necessary security measures against them. for the ministry, the decision did not display ‘ill-will’ towards any individual or institution and the complainants had failed to demonstrate that they had been affected by the impugned decision in any way. on an unspecified date the applicant filed an objection against this decision. on 31 october 2007 the third division of ankara administrative court dismissed the objection.
the applicant was born in 1960 and lives in budapest. the applicant was placed in retirement on grounds of disability and received a disability pension as of 1 november 2006, the amount of which was 91,363 hungarian forints (huf) (approximately 305 euros (eur)) per month. the entitlement was based on a final decision of the supreme court. at the material time the medical board rated her state of health at 46 per cent. the methodology for disability assessment changed as of 1 january 2008. cxci of 2011 on the benefits granted to persons with reduced work capacity was enacted on 29 december 2011 and entered into force as of 1 january 2012. it introduced a new system of allowances and beneficiaries of the old scheme were invited to re-apply under the new rules. the applicant lodged a fresh application for disability allowance under the new law. pending approval of her new application, she continued to receive a monthly disability allowance in the amount of huf 89,925 (approximately eur 300) on the strength of the fact that on the day the new law entered into force, she had been in receipt of a disability benefit. on 29 june 2012 the national rehabilitation and social authority assessed the applicant’s state of health at 59 per cent. she was categorised as a person suitable for rehabilitation on the basis of that assessment. however, owing to the applicant’s other circumstances, her rehabilitation was not recommended. in application of the relevant rules, the applicant’s rehabilitation allowance was established at 45 per cent of the minimum wage, that is, in the amount of huf 41,850 (approximately eur 140), by a decision of the budapest governmental office (directorate of pension insurance) given on 19 september 2012 and effective as of 1 december 2012. a medical assessment carried out in the course of the second-instance administrative proceedings resulted in the finding that the applicant’s state of health was at 58 per cent. it was reaffirmed that her rehabilitation was not recommended. since the minor difference in the scores did not alter the calculation of the allowance, the national rehabilitation and social authority upheld the first-instance decision on 17 january 2013. on 23 february 2016 the budapest administrative and labour court dismissed her action. having obtained fresh medical assessments and the opinion of the national forensic body, the court was satisfied that the applicant’s state of health was at 54 per cent (her locomotor, digestive and endocrinological conditions were calculated cumulatively as per the method prescribed in annex 1 to decree no. again, the minor difference in the scores had no bearing on the calculation of the allowance. the court upheld the administrative decisions. on 12 september 2016 the kúria dismissed the applicant’s petition for review. it observed in particular that the lower courts had found that the applicant’s state of health (for the purposes of the application of rules of disability benefits) had improved and that the applicant had challenged that finding. it pointed out that such an improvement did not necessarily correspond to actual healing from a condition, but could also result from a change in, or stricter application of, the relevant rules of medical assessment. the applicant submitted that, as of august 2015, she no longer received any benefits. the legal or factual circumstances underlying this state of affairs are not known.
the applicant, who was born in 1992, was detained at the gaziantep prison at the time when the application was lodged. on 26 december 2011 the mersin magistrates’ court decided to restrict access to the file regarding an ongoing investigation against a terrorist organisation. on 29 december 2011 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist organisation and making its propaganda. on the same day the applicant’s police statement was taken at the anti-terror branch of the mersin security directorate, in the presence of his lawyer. he was mainly questioned about several records of telephone conversations as well as allegations about the burning of vehicles and throwing molotov cocktails. he was questioned at length about the telephone conversations that had been intercepted. the police read out the transcripts of the telephone conversations and asked the applicant to comment on them. he was further asked questions about the incriminating statements of one of his co-accused. the applicant used his right to remain silent. on 30 december 2011 the mersin magistrates’ court ordered the applicant’s detention on remand. on 16 march 2012 the applicant’s representative lodged an objection against the decision on the applicant’s detention, and requested his release. she also asked the court to lift the restriction of access to the investigation file. on 19 march 2012 the mersin magistrates’ court dismissed the objection, without holding a hearing. the applicant’s representative filed a further objection against that decision. on 26 march 2012 the mersin assize court dismissed the objection on the basis of the case file, without holding a hearing. on 20 april 2012 the mersin magistrates’ court ex officio examined the applicant’s detention on remand on the basis of the case-file and decided to extend it. on 10 september 2012 the adana public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, accusing him mainly of being a member of a terrorist organisation, making propaganda in its favour, illegal possession of explosives, causing damage to property and having participated in an illegal armed demonstration. on 1 october 2012 the adana assize court accepted the indictment. on the same date the restriction on the investigation file was lifted. according to the latest information in the case file, the proceedings against the applicant are still pending before assize court.
the applicant was born in 1964 and is detained in krems. on 9 february 1983 the applicant shot his cousin, p.d., using the same gun as he had used for the previous murder. the applicant was arrested on 26 february 1983 and remanded in custody. he was found to be criminally responsible for his acts and was sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment. his potential for aggression was increased and he was emotionally unstable and could easily become aggressive. moreover, there were clear signs of an identity disorder. the above judgment was upheld by the supreme court (oberster gerichtshof) on 27 september 1984. the applicant has been detained in institutions for mentally ill offenders since 27 september 1984. two psychiatric experts had attested that the danger emanating from him had abated or was significantly reduced. the applicant claimed that his lawyer had offered him a job and a small apartment if he were released. it referred to an expert opinion of 25 january 2009 by dr l., who had stated that the applicant’s condition had stabilised and that the danger emanating from him had considerably abated in respect of the closed and protected living environment of the prison. however, the same could not be said with certainty for a life outside prison. the applicant waived his right to appeal against that decision. he was actively seeking a dialogue with them. the regional court also referred to the expert opinion of dr h. of 31 october 2006 and the forensic expert opinion by the vienna-mittersteig prison of january 2007, as well as the most recent expert opinion by dr b. (the resident psychologist of stein prison, where the applicant was held at that time) of 3 march 2010. moreover, at that time, dr b. did not recommend further therapy for the applicant, who was not prepared for any self-reflection and was not ready to process the experiences and challenges of normal social interaction, and thus was still likely to present a danger to others. only the vienna-mittersteig prison was capable of preparing the applicant for his release. the applicant in any event refused to undergo any more therapy. therefore, the application for conditional release had to be dismissed. the applicant lodged an application for release with the regional court on 20 august 2010 and submitted additional observations on 16 november and 3 december 2010. on 7 december 2010 the regional court, ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention in an institution for mentally ill offenders, referring to the most recent expert opinion by dr b. of 3 march 2010 (see paragraph 17 above). however, the latter had not yet responded to a request for the applicant’s transfer. on 8 september 2011 the applicant applied for conditional release from the institution. on 23 january 2012 the regional court held an oral hearing and subsequently ordered an expert opinion in the framework of the yearly judicial review proceedings. on that occasion, the presiding judge reproached the applicant with the fact that he could not expect to be granted privileges if he did not collaborate with the experts and the authorities. he explained that he had refused to be examined by a psychiatrist because he was not suffering from a mental illness. it appears that the regional court did not hold an oral hearing prior to that decision. it referred to the “current” expert opinion of dr b. of 2010 (see paragraph 17 above) and statements by the prison administration and the social service of the prison (maßnahmenteam) that the applicant should not be released, as he refused to undergo therapy and still posed a threat. the court of appeal again referred to the reasoning it had given in its three previous decisions relating to the applicant.
the applicant was born in 1972 and lives in yerevan. the applicant is a former deputy head of vardashen prison in armenia. according to the applicant, his father is an opposition activist. on 4 september 2007 the yerevan prosecutor’s office decided to institute criminal proceedings on the basis of an application made by r.k., the decision also mentioned that a forensic medical examination of r.k., conducted after he had lodged the application, had revealed bodily injuries of a minor degree. on 18 september 2007 the preventive measure in respect of the applicant was lifted. it appears that, during the investigation of the case, the head of vardashen prison gave a statement confirming that r.k. and made a corresponding entry in the medical register. on 7 february 2008 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of abuse of power accompanied with violence. on 10 february 2008 the applicant was charged with abuse of power accompanied with violence, as provided for by article 309 § 2 of the criminal code of armenia. on the same day the investigator, m., applied to the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan seeking to detain the applicant on remand. in substantiating this preventive measure, the investigator indicated that, if the applicant remained at large, he could abscond and obstruct the conduct of an objective and thorough examination by influencing witnesses. he referred to the nature and the gravity of the imputed offence, the punishment for which was imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. it thus authorised the applicant’s detention for two months, starting from the date of his arrest. on 14 february 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of the district court. in particular, he sought to be released on bail, taking into account his good character, the fact that he had no previous convictions and had a child who was a minor. on 28 february 2008 the court of appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that it was not competent to decide on the question of replacing detention with bail, since that question had not been raised before the district court. in substantiating the application, the investigator referred to the nature and gravity of the imputed offence and said that there were sufficient grounds to assume that, if released, the applicant could abscond or obstruct the examination of the case. on 4 april 2008 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan granted the application and extended the applicant’s detention to 7 july 2008. in doing so, the district court indicated the same reasons as those given in the application. on 9 april 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of the district court, seeking to be released on bail. on 17 april 2008 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. according to the applicant, on 26 may 2008 the same charge as the one against him was also brought against a.g. and, as a preventive measure, they made an undertaking not to leave their places of residence. on 30 may 2008 the investigation was officially concluded and the case was sent to the criminal court of yerevan. on 12 june 2008 the criminal court of yerevan decided to set the case down for trial. the decision stated that there was no necessity to change the preventive measure imposed on the applicant. the applicant further argued that he was of good character, and had a family with a child who was a minor and a permanent residence. on 12 january 2009 the criminal court of yerevan found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in metsamor. on 23 july 2011 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of threatening to use violence against the investigator in charge of the criminal case against his ex-wife. on 25 july 2011 the applicant was charged with the same crime. on the same date the investigator filed a motion with the armavir regional court seeking to have the applicant detained for a period of two months. on the same date the regional court examined and granted the investigator’s application, ordering the applicant’s detention for a period of two months, namely until 23 september 2011. it found that the motion was substantiated, since the applicant partially admitted his guilt and the case materials provided sufficient grounds for believing that he might abscond and obstruct the investigation, having regard to the nature and degree of dangerousness of the offence in question. on an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal seeking to cancel the detention order and claiming that the investigating authority had not obtained any materials or evidence to substantiate the reasons for which it had sought to detain him and that they failed to take into account the applicant’s personality. on 11 august 2011 the court of appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that the applicant’s detention was based on a reasonable suspicion, and found the grounds invoked by the regional court in justification of detention to be sufficient. it also noted that less severe measures were insufficient to safeguard the applicant’s proper conduct. on 19 august 2011 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the decision of 11 august 2011 of the court of appeal. on 9 september 2011 the investigation into the applicant’s case was concluded and the case was transferred to the regional court for trial. on 13 september 2011 the applicant’s criminal case was set down for trial. by the same decision the trial court decided that the applicant’s detention on remand was “to remain unchanged”. on 17 september 2011 the cassation court returned the applicant’s cassation appeal as it was unsubstantiated and did not met the formal requirements imposed by law. on an unspecified date the applicant filed a motion with the regional court seeking to be released. he argued, inter alia, that there were not sufficient reasons to keep him in detention. on 13 december 2011 the regional court examined and dismissed this motion. the regional court found that the applicant’s detention was ordered by its decision of 13 september 2011. it also noted that the existing materials of the case were sufficient to conclude that the applicant’s detention was justified. on 19 december 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision. on 28 december 2011 the criminal court of appeal left the appeal unexamined. the criminal court of appeal found that there was no possibility under domestic law to appeal against the decision of the district court “to leave the applicant’s detention unchanged”. the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision. on 20 march 2012 the court of cassation declared the applicant’s appeal inadmissible for lack of merit. on 11 may 2012 the applicant filed a new motion with the regional court seeking to be released. he argued, inter alia, that the collection of evidence against him had been finalised and that there were not sufficient reasons to keep him under detention. on 4 june 2012 the regional court dismissed the applicant’s motion having regard to the dangerousness and nature of the alleged offence and the fact that the applicant might abscond and obstruct the investigation. on 19 june 2012 the criminal court of appeal left the applicant’s appeal unexamined on the same grounds as indicated in its decision of 28 december 2011. on 17 august 2012 the court of cassation declared the applicant’s appeal inadmissible for lack of merit. on 6 august 2012 the regional court found the applicant guilty as charged, imposing a sentence of one and a half years’ imprisonment.
the applicants’ dates of birth and places of residence are given in the appendix. both applicants participated in a number of unauthorised peaceful demonstrations organised by the opposition. in the course of many of those demonstrations, they were arrested and convicted. in particular, the first applicant was arrested during the demonstrations on 15 may, 19 june and 31 july 2010. that tendency continued into the following years. demonstrations were held, inter alia, on 11 march 2011 and 20 october and 17 november 2012. the second applicant attended the demonstrations of 11 march 2011 and 20 october 2012. moreover, he was actively promoting public participation in that assembly on online social networks. it appears that the organisers of the demonstration of 11 march 2011 gave no proper prior notice to the relevant authority, the baku city executive authority (“the bcea”). prior to the demonstrations of 20 october and 17 november 2012, on 15 october and 12 november 2012 respectively the organisers had given notice to the bcea. on 4 march 2011 the first applicant was arrested and brought to police station no. the applicant contested the official version of his arrest. they had taken his belongings from the internet café, including his mobile phone. the other two had presented themselves as agents of the ministry of national security, without showing any supporting document. he was also not given access to a lawyer after his arrest or while he was in police custody. according to the applicant, he was not given an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of his own choosing. did not make any oral or written submissions. the court disregarded that statement as non-reliable. only the police officers who, according to the official records, had arrested the applicant and the police officer who issued the administrative‑offence report in respect of him were questioned as witnesses. the court found that the applicant had committed the administrative offence attributed to him (see paragraph 17 above). it convicted the applicant under article 310.1 of the cao and sentenced him to ten days’ administrative detention. according to the applicant, until 6 march 2011 his whereabouts were unknown to his family and friends. on an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal with the baku court of appeal, presenting his version of the events surrounding his arrest, and arguing that he had been arrested in connection with the demonstration scheduled for 11 march 2011. the applicant also complained that the hearing before the first-instance court had not been fair. the applicant was represented before the baku court of appeal by a lawyer of his own choosing. all three demonstrations were dispersed as soon as the protesters began to gather. following their arrest on 20 october 2012 the applicants were additionally charged under article 298 (violation of rules on holding public assemblies) of the cao. according to the applicants, they were never served with a copy of the administrative-offence reports or with other documents from their case files. during the hearings of 20 october 2012 and 17 november 2012 the court did not question any witnesses. in each case the sabail district court found that the applicants had failed to stop participating in an unauthorised demonstration.
the applicant was born in 1955 and lives in pula. in 1985 the applicant was employed by the t. company of pula. on 22 august 1992 he sustained a work-related injury. he continued working for the t. company in another post. on 6 february 2004 the applicant was made redundant following organisational changes within the company. the following day he concluded an agreement with the t. company shortening the notice period for the termination of his employment. on 19 february 2004 the applicant was given his redundancy notice and his employment was terminated on 23 february 2004. on 9 april 2004 the applicant was granted a disability pension with effect from 24 february 2004 on the grounds of his inability to work. on 28 june 2004 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against the t. company in the pula municipal court (općinski sud u puli). he alleged that he would have received more income if he had not sustained the work-related injury in 1992. he claimed damages relating to the difference between his disability pension and the salary he had received until the termination of his employment. on 20 february 2008 the pula municipal court dismissed his claim as unfounded. the applicant appealed against the first-instance judgment, challenging all the factual and legal aspects of the case. on 12 september 2011 the pula county court (županijski sud u puli), relying on section 373a of the civil procedure act, dismissed the applicant’s appeal as unfounded. it agreed with the outcome of the case but held that the first-instance court had failed to take into account all the facts from the proceedings that had supported the dismissal of the claim. the relevant part of the judgment reads as follows:
“... this appellate court finds that although the first-instance court failed to take into account all the facts emerging from the first-instance proceedings which meant [the plaintiff’s] claim had to be dismissed, the decision on dismissing the claim as unfounded is in any event correct, therefore the first-instance judgment is upheld by application of section 373a of the civil procedure act. ...
this appellate court therefore holds that the plaintiff’s claim was certainly to be dismissed, but for the reasons set out in this appellate decision; that is, that the reasons the first-instance court stated in the reasoning of its decision would not suffice for the claim to be dismissed. therefore the first-instance decision is upheld on the basis of section 373a of the civil procedure act ...” 14. on 5 december 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske), challenging the lower courts’ judgments. he stated that the appellate court had relied expressly on section 373a of the civil procedure act, and that therefore he was lodging his appeal on points of law on the basis of section 382(1)(3) of that act. on 14 may 2013 the supreme court declared the applicant’s appeal on points of law inadmissible on the grounds that the appellate court in fact had not applied section 373a of the civil procedure act, and that therefore his appeal on points of law could not be allowed. the relevant part of the decision reads as follows:
“the first-instance court and the appellate court found that the plaintiff had not been dismissed because of his inability to work caused by the work-related injury, but that his employment had been terminated by dismissal due to redundancy and that therefore there was no causal link between his dismissal and the granting of the disability pension, so his claim for damages ... was dismissed as unfounded. therefore, in this court’s assessment, the requirements for the application of section 373a of the civil procedure act were not met, given that the appellate court did not establish, in the manner prescribed by section 373a of the civil procedure act, a different set of facts to the one established by the first-instance court, but based its decision on the same facts.” the applicant subsequently complained to the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) about the supreme court’s decision on his appeal on points of law. he made no allegations of any violation of his rights in respect of the proceedings before the first-instance court or the appellate court. on 16 october 2013 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as manifestly ill-founded. the decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 25 october 2013.
the applicants’ dates of birth and places of residence are given in the appendix. at the material time the second applicant was a member of an opposition group nida. the third applicant was a member of an opposition group i̇ctimai palata; he was also one of the organisers of several demonstrations held in baku. the first and the second applicants participated in a demonstration organised by the opposition on 20 october 2012. prior to that assembly, on 15 october 2012, the organisers gave notice to the relevant authority, the baku city executive authority (“the bcea”). the bcea refused to authorise the holding of the demonstration at the place indicated by the organisers and proposed a different location on the outskirts of baku – the grounds of a driving school situated in the 20th residential area of the sabail district. nevertheless, the organisers decided to hold the demonstration as planned. the second applicant also participated in demonstrations held on 12 january and 26 january 2013. the third applicant participated in a demonstration held on 30 april 2013. the organisers of those demonstrations gave no proper prior notice to the bcea. information about the demonstrations was disseminated on the internet or in the press. according to the applicants, the demonstrations were intended to be peaceful and were conducted in a peaceful manner. the participants of the demonstration of 20 october 2012 were demanding democratic reforms in the country and free and fair elections, and protesting against impediments on freedom of assembly. the demonstration of 12 january was aimed at protesting about the deaths of soldiers in the army, while the demonstration of 26 january 2013 condemned the use of force by the police against the participants of previous demonstrations. the participants of the demonstration of 30 april 2013 were commemorating the victims of a terrorist attack which had been committed in 2009 at the azerbaijan state oil academy. the police began to disperse the demonstrations of 20 october 2012, 12 january, 26 january and 30 april 2013 as soon as the protesters began to gather. the circumstances related to the dispersal of the demonstration of 20 october 2012, the first and second applicants’ arrests and custody, and subsequent administrative proceedings against them are similar to those in gafgaz mammadov v. azerbaijan (no. 60259/11, 15 october 2015) (see also appendix). the circumstances related to the dispersal of the demonstrations of 12 january, 26 january and 30 april 2013, the second and third applicants’ arrests and custody, and the subsequent administrative proceedings against them are similar to those in bayramov v. azerbaijan ([committee] nos. 19150/13 and 52022/13, 6 april 2017) (see also appendix).
the applicant was born in 1966 and lived before his arrest in the arkhangelsk region. he is currently detained in the town of severodvinsk. on an unspecified date the applicant, while being on the wanted list after having breached his undertaking not to leave the place of his residence, was arrested on the charges of violent acts against a public official (article 318 § 1 of the criminal code of the russian federation). on 18 may 2010 the severodvinsk town court of the arkhangelsk region authorised his detention. on 2 september 2010 the applicant asked the town court to apply a non-custodial restraint measure to him. the applicant and his lawyer attended the hearing and made oral submissions. the town court dismissed the motion for release, having referred, in particular, to the applicant’s criminal record, which included two convictions for having mounted threats of violence against a judge, an offence under article 296 of the criminal code, and for contempt of court, punishable under article 297 of the criminal code. in the meantime, on 20 september 2010 the applicant was convicted as charged. on 12 october 2010 the arkhangelsk regional court upheld the decision of the town court of 2 september 2010. with reference to its discretional powers under article 379 of the code of criminal procedure of the russian federation the appeal court rejected the applicant’s leave to appear, and held the hearing in his absence.
the three applicants were born in 1980, 1981 and 1983 respectively and are in detention in moscow. the facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. the applicant was arrested on 8 march 2015 on suspicion of murder. on 8 march 2015 a court ordered his pre-trial detention, which was further extended on several occasions, in particular on 24 august and 25 november 2015. the applicant appealed against the extension orders on 26 august and 26 november 2015 respectively. the appeals were dismissed on 16 december 2015 and on 8 february 2016. the applicant has been detained in remand prison no. 77/6 in moscow since 17 march 2015, except for twenty-one days in may 2015 when he was detained in remand prison no. 77/1 in moscow (hereinafter “iz-77/6” and “iz-77/1”). in iz-77/6 the applicant has around 3 square metres (sq.m) of personal space, the cell is extremely hot in the summer and extremely damp in the winter, it lacks natural light and fresh air, while access to potable water and hot water is restricted. the applicant has not been provided with bedding and can have no more than one ten-minute shower a week. daily physical exercise in the fresh air is limited to one hour. the applicant has not described the conditions of his detention in iz-77/1. on 25 november 2015 the applicant was transported between iz‑77/6 and the basmanny district court of moscow in a prison van. personal space in the van was limited and there was not enough fresh air; the applicant had no access to a toilet and no food or drinking water was provided. upon his arrival to the court building and before returning to the remand prison he was detained for about 15 hours in a convoy cell where he disposed of around 0.5 sq. m of personal space and had no access to natural light, fresh air, the toilet or drinking water. appeals filed by the applicants were dismissed on 8 april, 21 april and 28 june 2016 respectively. on 12 may 2015 the applicants were transported from remand prison no. 77/2 in moscow (“iz-77/2”) to the moscow city court and back in a prison van. the conditions of the applicants’ transfer to and from the court building were identical to those described by the applicant in case no. by a letter of 26 october 2016 the government asked the court to strike application no. 18496/16 out of its list and enclosed the text of a unilateral declaration with a view to resolving the issues it raised. on 13 december 2016 the applicant’s lawyer disclosed the terms of the government’s declaration to the media stating that the russian government and the court had “entered into an agreement under which russia [would] pay a compensation” of six thousand euro to the applicant, that “russia ha[d] acknowledged” the violations and that the applicant was “thinking over the offer but [would] most likely accept it”. the lawyer’s statements were published, in particular, on the websites of the vedomosti and kommersant newspapers and on the website of the ria novosti news agency. on 14 december 2016 the applicant accepted the government’s declaration. by letters of 12 december 2016 the applicants in applications nos. 61249/16 and 61253/16 were informed of the court’s decision to communicate their applications to the government. the information note in the russian language attached to the letters included, inter alia, information on the strictly confidential nature of all friendly-settlement negotiations. the court also provided the parties with declarations prepared by the registry, aimed at securing a friendly settlement of the cases.
the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in houten. on 30 september 2004 the applicant was arrested. consequently it would be constitutive of a further criminal offence if he were to discuss matters covered by his duty of secrecy with anyone including his counsel. to that end i have granted the suspect conditional release from his duty of secrecy. ...
... two additional conditions apply: 1. shall take place within the confines of the offices of the investigating judge or in the presence of the trial court in a closed hearing. ...
fourthly, you have asked me to react to the witnesses requested by counsel. i presume that you mean the aivd members. i am of the opinion that this is above all a matter of criminal procedure, the public prosecutor indicating in her letter that the questions counsel would like to ask relate primarily to the working methods of the aivd, the spreading of the leaked information and the internal investigation into this. this acceleration of the proceedings, in my opinion, benefits all parties to the proceedings. the regional court ordered the investigating judge to hear thirteen witnesses referred to by name and seven witnesses referred to by a code name or number. it appears that he refused to answer certain questions because of his duty of secrecy. in so far as they were unnamed aivd staff members, they were identified by a number; they were heavily disguised and they were placed in a box that left only their upper body visible; and their voices were distorted. the applicant states that it was impossible to discern their body language and facial expressions. finding no indication that the aivd information had been leaked by someone else, the regional court yet again refused to hear the named witness and the fifteen unnamed witnesses. the trial hearing was resumed on 6 and 7 october 2005. the regional court gave judgment on 14 december 2005. the applicant lodged an appeal with the court of appeal (gerechtshof) of the hague. the appeal hearing opened on 28 september 2006. the defence protested that this expert lacked independence precisely for that reason. the appeal hearing was resumed on 12 february 2007. the advocate general protested against the mentioning of these names in so far as they were not already to be found in the case file, which in his view was not justified by article 6 of the convention, and announced his intention to prosecute if the applicant should “transgress those limits” (mocht hij die grenzen overschrijden). these questions concerned aivd working methods and procedures and aivd members. ...
the above leads the court of appeal to conclude as follows. it is obvious that the said duty of secrecy constitutes, to some extent, a restriction on – normally entirely – unimpeded free and confidential discussion between the suspect and his counsel and that – had it been in force unmitigated – it would prevent a fair trial. and
“the advocate general has given the undertaking, at the court of appeal’s hearing of 2 september 2006, that [the applicant] shall not be prosecuted if a violation of the duty of secrecy by [the applicant] is justified by reliance on article 6 of the convention, with due regard to the demands of proportionality and subsidiarity inherent pertaining to a legal defence (strafuitsluitingsgrond). it held, however, that the appeal was unfounded. if, however, the trial judge takes the view, whether or not it be in response to a request or a legal argument (verweer) put forward by the defence, that the interest of the defence requires that information falling under the duty of secrecy is disclosed by the suspect, the court will have to weigh the conflicting interests in the case. the guiding principle (richtsnoer) in so doing is whether, if this information cannot be disclosed after all, there can still be a fair trial within the meaning of article 6 of the convention. if that is the case, the conclusion will have to be that there cannot be any fair trial and the prosecution will have to be declared inadmissible (zal de officier van justitie niet-ontvankelijk moeten worden verklaard in de vervolging).
the applicant was born in 1945 and lives in bobadela. on 9 december 1993 the applicant was diagnosed with bartholinitis, a gynaecological disease, on the left side of her vagina (bartholinite à esquerda). she started treatment, which included drainages (drenagens). after each drainage the bartholin gland would swell, causing the applicant considerable pain. she would thus require a second drainage and painkillers. she was offered surgery for the condition during a consultation at the beginning of 1995. on 21 may 1995 the applicant was admitted to the chlc for a surgical procedure to remove the left bartholin gland. on 22 may 1995 the applicant had both glands, on the left and right sides of the vagina, removed. she also suffered from urinary incontinence, had difficulty sitting and walking, and could not have sexual relations. on an unknown date the applicant was informed after being examined at a private clinic that the left pudendal nerve (nervo pudenda do lado esquerdo) had been injured during the operation. on 4 october 2013 the lisbon administrative court ruled partly in favour of the applicant. the lisbon administrative court also established that it was that injury which caused her, among other problems, the pain and loss of sensation in the vagina and urinary incontinence. as a consequence, she had difficulty walking, sitting and having sexual relations, which, all together, made her feel diminished as a woman. consequently, the applicant was also depressed, had suicidal thoughts and avoided contact with members of her family and friends. the applicant lodged a counter-appeal (recurso subordinado), arguing that she should have received eur 249,399 in compensation and that the chlc’s appeal should be declared inadmissible. as a consequence, the various requirements of the obligation to pay compensation had been verified and the first-instance court had decided on compensation in an equitable and proper way. the relevant part of the judgment on those points reads as follows:
“... with respect to damages related to the charges for the maid ... [the plaintiff] could not show the amount paid under that head. also ... we consider that the award of eur 16,000 under that head is manifestly excessive. in addition, there is no medical solution to her condition. all this has caused her severe depression, expressing itself in anxiety and somatic symptoms manifested in the difficulty she has sleeping, deep disgust and frustration with the situation in which she finds herself, which has turned her into a very unhappy person and which inhibits her from establishing relationships with others and has caused her to stop visiting family and friends, from going to the beach and theatre and which has given her suicidal thoughts. it should be noted, however, that the plaintiff has been suffering from the gynaecological condition for a long time (at least since 1993) and that she had already undergone various kinds of treatment without any acceptable result and that it was that lack of results and the impossibility of curing the condition otherwise that was the motivation for surgery. she had already had unbearable pain and symptoms of depression before [surgery]. this means that the plaintiff’s complaints are not new and that the surgical procedure only aggravated an already difficult situation, a fact which cannot be ignored when setting the amount of compensation. on 29 october 2014 the attorney general’s office attached to the supreme administrative court applied to the supreme administrative court to have the judgment of 9 october 2014 declared null and void (nulidade do acórdão) in the part concerning the amount awarded for non-pecuniary damage. it further submitted that the compensation award should not have taken account of the applicant’s symptoms before the medical intervention, as if only a worsening of those symptoms had been at stake. ...
during that surgical procedure the left pudendal nerve was partly damaged. that is because, according to the judgment, they would have disappeared once the bartholin glands had been removed and the plaintiff’s condition cured by surgery. v – the reasoning in the judgment leads logically to a different decision. it considered that the causal link between the injury to the pudendal nerve and the alleged damage had been established. in the opinion of the judges of the supreme administrative court, the applicant’s health problems prior to the operation, and her gynaecological and psychological symptoms in particular, could not be ignored and had been aggravated by the procedure.
the applicant was born in 1979 and is currently detained in the trenčín hospital for charged and convicted persons. on 4 january 2012 the košice i district court remanded the applicant in custody pending trial to prevent him from continuing his criminal activity. the district court took into account, inter alia, the nature of the criminal charge and the fact that the applicant had been having long-term psychiatric treatment. an interlocutory appeal by the applicant was unsuccessful. between 28 march 2012 and 21 may 2012 courts at two levels dismissed applications by the applicant for release. in that connection, they referred to evidence that the applicant had been planning his attacks for a long time and in a systematic way. on 11 june 2012 the district court prolonged the applicant’s detention by five months (until 1 january 2013) on the grounds that the investigation was not finished, that further charges had been brought against him since may 2012, and that the criminal charges had been reclassified as a crime of terrorism and the acquisition and possession of firearms. the court also ordered a report by an expert on extremism and terrorism. it examined oral and documentary evidence, including evidence from several experts. it delivered its judgment on 19 june 2013, finding the applicant guilty of the charges and sentencing him to twenty-five years in prison. the regional court therefore instructed the district court to obtain a third opinion from an expert institute. in the meantime, on 4 september 2013, while the criminal proceedings were pending on appeal, the regional court decided to keep the applicant in detention on the same grounds as before (see paragraph 14 above). he referred to his mental disorder as established in the second expert report of 24 october 2013. he added that he had been seeing a psychiatrist since the age of 14 and needed medicine on a daily basis to prevent suicidal thoughts. he could not live without that medicine, even in detention, as he required treatment and sessions with a psychiatrist. they also supported his request that his detention be replaced by supervision by a parole officer. according to the transcript of the hearing, the applicant and his counsel reiterated and further developed their arguments made in the application and submitted that his mental condition meant that his absconding was not realistic. it enquired whether the applicant was being provided with the drugs he had been prescribed and whether the detention centre was able to provide the applicant with his treatment. on 13 january 2014 the district court dismissed the applicant’s application to be released and his supplementary requests, a decision that was upheld by the regional court on 29 january 2014 after an interlocutory appeal by the applicant. they observed that he had created explosives and contemplated where to plant them over a long time and in a systematic way. in addition, they observed that the relevant authorities had proceeded with the case expeditiously and with due diligence. moreover, the courts found that the requirements for alternative measures, such as a parental guarantee, a pledge by the applicant or replacing his detention with supervision had not been met. there was no separate consideration of the applicant’s mental condition as such. as to the substance, he raised arguments that were similar to those in his application to be released. it gave no answer to his argument concerning the specific nature of his situation. on 10 july 2014 the district court again found the applicant guilty. no ordinary appeal being available, the judgment became final and binding. subsequently, the case returned to the district court and the applicant remained detained pending trial as of 14 april 2016. it also ordered protective supervision lasting thirty-six months. the applicant appealed and those proceedings are still pending.
the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in staryy oskol. the applicant took part in the cleaning up operation at the chernobyl nuclear disaster site. on 5 july 2002 the staryy oskol town court of the belgorod region granted the applicant’s action against the belgorod regional administration and awarded him and his family, comprising two members, a flat in the town of staryy oskol and 3,000 russian roubles (approximately 100 euros) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. the representative of the regional administration did not attend the hearing: in writing he had requested the town court to adjudicate the case in his absence. the judgment was not appealed against and became final on 15 july 2002. on 19 august 2002 the staryy oskol town court issued a writ of execution and enforcement proceedings were instituted. on 9 october 2002 the belgorod regional administration lodged a statement of appeal against the judgment of 5 july 2002. the administration also asked the town court to restore the ten-day time-limit for lodging the appeal. the administration claimed that it had received a copy of the judgment of 5 july 2002 by fax on 8 october 2002. the administration asked to stop the enforcement proceedings. the applicant insisted that there had been no reason to restore the time-limit. he noted that a copy of the judgment had been forwarded to the regional administration at the end of july 2002. on 14 october 2002 the staryy oskol town court restored the time-limit for lodging the appeal, accepted the administration’s statement of appeal and stopped the enforcement proceedings. on 19 november 2002 the belgorod regional court examined the administration’s appeal, quashed the judgment of 5 july 2002 and remitted the case for a fresh examination to the town court. on 20 january 2003 the staryy oskol town court, in the new examination of the case, accepted the applicant’s action in part. the relevant part of the judgment read as follows:
“order that the belgorod regional administration should provide ... mr babynin g.a. and his family with housing premises, which satisfy sanitary and technical requirements, in their turn according to the housing waiting list of families having persons with disabilities and individuals who had taken part in the cleaning operation at the site of the chernobyl nuclear plant. dismiss [the claim] for compensation for non-pecuniary damage.” the judgment was not appealed against and became final on 31 january 2003. on 13 february 2003 a writ of execution was issued and enforcement proceedings were instituted. according to the applicant, from 5 to 12 march 2004 a group of five people, including the applicant, began a hunger strike to protest against the poor level of welfare protection provided for the chernobyl victims. on 16 april 2004 the mayor of staryy oskol decided to provide the applicant with a flat measuring 55,05 m². on 21 april 2004 the applicant received from the mayor an occupancy voucher in respect of the flat assigned to him.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in barnaul. he has been disabled since childhood and has lacked legal capacity since 1999. the application was brought on his behalf by his mother. she arrived at the police station shortly afterwards. the applicant was diagnosed as having facial and chest contusions. on the same day the district court granted an application from the investigator to place the applicant in a psychiatric hospital for a psychiatric forensic examination. on 4 october 2007 the report on the forensic psychiatric examination of the applicant was concluded. the possibility of the injury being caused by a fall or that the applicant had inflicted it on himself was excluded. in particular, they submitted that when the applicant had seen them he had started to run in the opposite direction. he had stumbled and fallen forward onto the pavement. the applicant had then been escorted to the police car and taken to the police station. they submitted that they had not witnessed any clashes between the applicant and the police and had not seen the police use physical force against him;
-  statements by the investigator, n., who had questioned the applicant on 28 august 2007 and to whom he had explained that his injuries (a scratch on the face and a swollen nose) had been sustained while he was drunk, either by falling down or in some other way, the applicant had not remembered exactly. after she had arrived, the applicant had started complaining that he felt unwell and that he had been beaten by the police, after which an ambulance had been called for him;
-  statements by the investigator d., who said that she had questioned the applicant on 31 august 2007 at the temporary detention facility. the supervising authority set aside all those decisions, except for the most recent one, as unfounded and ordered additional pre-investigation inquiries. it was not possible to completely exclude the possibility that the above injury had originated as the result of the impact of a slightly protruding object. on 11 april 2008 the proceedings were suspended for the second time. he also wanted to give the applicant’s mother the status of the applicant’s legal representative and question her, to carry out a comprehensive psychological and psychiatric examination of the applicant, to question a number of witnesses on the circumstances of the alleged ill-treatment (among them officer s.), and to join references from work on officers k., s. and ch. however, on 21 may 2008 the deputy head of the investigations department set that decision aside and held that it was necessary to question the witnesses to establish all the relevant circumstances of the alleged ill-treatment. a similar statement was made by the witness b. 42. he relied on the results of the applicant’s forensic psychiatric examination of 28 october 2008 and therefore the impossibility for the investigation to rely on his statements, as well as the absence of eyewitnesses of the circumstances in which the applicant had received his injuries. the witnesses b., d. and z., who had seen the applicant’s arrest, had stated that they had not seen the police officers use any physical force against him. the applicant had complained that those officers had beaten him after his arrest. the mother’s statements had derived from those of the applicant and therefore could not be relied on either. on 27 april 2010 the district court found the decision of 15 february 2010 unlawful and unsubstantiated and on 1 june 2010 the proceedings were again resumed. proceedings were resumed on 12 july 2010. however, on 31 august 2010 the district court found that decision unlawful and unjustified and the proceedings resumed again on 19 october 2010. in addition, the experts had arrived at the conclusion that the injury could have been caused anytime between 26 august and 28 august 2007. according to the applicant, while the investigator was questioning him as a suspect on 28 august 2007, a trainee police officer, i., had taken the keys to his flat and had gone there and searched his room. according to the applicant, officers a. and b. had allegedly threatened him on the same day, warning him not to reveal that he had been beaten at the police station and to say instead that he had injured himself several days before in a fight. the most recent refusal to institute criminal proceedings against a. and b. is dated 31 may 2010.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in pyatigorsk. the applicant took part in the cleaning-up operation at the chernobyl nuclear disaster site. he was subsequently registered disabled by ukrainian authorities, becoming entitled to various social benefits. in september 1999 the applicant settled in russia. the welfare authorities rejected re-establishing the applicant’s disability status. the applicant challenged the rejection before the courts. on 30 august 2005 the pyatigorsk town court granted the applicant’s claim and ordered the administration of labour and social security of the population of pyatigorsk to issue a certificate of benefits. on 20 september 2009 the judgment became final. on 18 october 2005 the applicant was issued with the certificate of benefits. on 1 november 2006 the presidium of stavropol regional court allowed the defendant authority’s application for supervisory review and quashed the judgment of 30 august 2005, considering that the lower courts misapplied the material law. the case was remitted for fresh consideration. on 13 december 2006 the the pyatigorsk town court discontinued the proceedings since the parties failed to appear.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in st petersburg. with reference to the medical report of 15 july 2010 (see paragraph 41 below) the court noted that the state of health of the accused was compatible with further detention on remand. the defence did not appeal against the extension order. on 27 august 2010 the district court ruled that the applicant should remain in detention until 30 november 2010. the same judge as at the hearing of 12 august 2010 presided. on 30 november 2010 the applicant appealed against both the extension order and the court’s decision regarding the impartiality of the judge. the next day the applicant’s lawyer was informed that the appeal hearing had been listed for 23 december 2010. the court allowed the request and set the hearing for 20 january 2011. on 10 march 2011 the city court upheld the extension order and rejected the applicant’s challenge to the district court’s judge as unfounded. the applicant and his lawyer were absent. the city court extended the applicant’s detention until 30 may 2011. on 7 april 2011 the defence appealed against the extension. the court reiterated that he had been charged with multiple counts of very serious crimes and that the case was very complex. on 1 and 8 june 2011 his lawyer submitted supplements to the statement of appeal. on the latter date the supreme court upheld the detention order. it found that he was living in st petersburg at a known address, and that he was employed, and had two minor children. it appears that on the same day the applicant was released. during the first months of detention his treatment was overseen by a prison endocrinologist. the applicant needed a specific diet and insulin injections. at the investigator’s request, on 15 july 2010 a medical panel issued a report concluding that the applicant was fit to stay in the remand prison if he received specific medical care comprising: monitoring of blood sugar levels throughout the day; administration of the requisite medicines and adherence to a specific diet; insulin injections; and “active supervision by an endocrinologist” in order to ensure the correct insulin therapy. medical documents show that he developed face and feet oedemas. on that account he was sent to gaaza prison hospital in st petersburg on 13 october 2010. three days later the applicant was transferred from gaaza prison hospital back to the medical unit in the remand prison. on 23 november 2010 and 21 february 2011 a medical board carried out an additional expert examination and repeated its earlier conclusion made in the report on 15 july 2010. as a result his blood sugar level increased significantly. he was diagnosed with type-one severe diabetes; diabetic ketoacidosis; non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy; cataracts in both eyes; diabetic angiopathy of both feet; encephalopathy of mixed origin; diabetic sensory polyneuropathy; and diabetic nephropathy. a special medical board stated that those illnesses were not on the list of medical conditions precluding detention; accordingly, the applicant was not eligible for release on medical grounds. the board also called for “dynamic supervision” of the applicant’s treatment by an endocrinologist. on 5 april 2012 at the request of the applicant’s lawyer three medical experts prepared a report on the quality of his treatment in detention. developed vascular disease (vascular angiopathy of the lower extremities) and encephalopathy, an irreversible brain damage ... were signs of his worsening health.
the first applicant was born in 1959 and the second applicant was born in 1981. on 10 april 2007 mr and mrs g. initiated civil proceedings against the applicants before the monção court (domestic proceedings no. 165/07.0tbmnc), with a view to obtaining recognition of their ownership of a property and a declaration that the applicants had no right of way (servidão de passagem) over that property. on 14 may 2007 the applicants were summonsed. on the same day the court was informed of the death of mr g. and the proceedings were consequently suspended. on an unknown date mr g.’s eight heirs were admitted as parties to the proceedings (habilitação de herdeiros). the proceedings restarted on 19 june 2007. on an unknown date in september 2007 the applicants lodged their submissions in reply (contestação) and a counterclaim (pedido reconvencional). after having realised that the applicants had not communicated their submissions in reply to the claimants, on 26 october 2007 the court ordered the applicants to do so. later, the court realised that the claimants had not complied with the legal requirement to register the proceedings with the land registry office (conservatória do registo predial). on 18 december 2007 the proceedings were suspended until an unknown date on which the claimants complied with that requirement. on 24 april 2008 the court realised that the applicants had also not complied with the legal requirement to register the counterclaim with the land registry office. the court ordered them to do so within forty days. the applicants requested that the deadline be extended by thirty days. on an unknown date the applicants lodged an application for evidence to be immediately obtained from a witness who was residing in the united kingdom. considering that the applicants had not supplemented the application by complying with the necessary legal requirements for such a procedural act, the court dismissed the application on 26 january 2009. on 8 may 2009 the court gave a preliminary decision (despacho saneador) setting out the facts that had already been established and those that had yet to be decided. on an unknown day of january 2010 a videoconference to obtain witness evidence took place. on an unknown date a hearing was scheduled for an unknown day in april 2010. on the scheduled day the hearing was adjourned due to the absence of the claimants. twelve other hearings took place, the last of which was on 12 december 2011. on 3 march 2012 the monção court ruled against the applicants. on an unknown date the applicants appealed against that decision to the guimarães court of appeal. on 20 november 2012 the guimarães court of appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the first-instance decision. on 5 december 2012 the applicants appealed against that judgment to the supreme court of justice. on 24 april 2013 the supreme court of justice dismissed the appeal and upheld the previous judgment. the applicants’ lawyer was notified of the supreme court of justice judgment on 7 may 2013.
on 10 october 2003 a deputy prosecutor in tashkent, uzbekistan, added the applicant’s name to the list of fugitives from justice and issued an arrest warrant on suspicion of human trafficking with the purpose of sexual exploitation. on 26 february 2009 the applicant was arrested in russia. on 28 february 2009 the pechorskiy district court in the pskov region ordered the applicant’s detention pending extradition, referring to articles 108 and 466 of the code of criminal procedure but without setting a time-limit. on 16 march 2009 the russian prosecutor general’s office received a request for the applicant’s extradition from his counterpart in uzbekistan. on 15 may 2009 the deputy russian prosecutor general ordered the applicant’s extradition to uzbekistan. the applicant challenged the extradition order before the pskov regional court. on 26 june 2009 the regional court found that the extradition order was lawful. on 17 august 2009 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the decision on appeal. on 17 october 2009 the applicant was extradited to uzbekistan.
the applicants were born in 1973 and 1996 respectively and live in blagoveshchensk, amurskaya region. at the material time the applicants lived in blagoveshchensk. in the beginning of 2002 they moved to moscow and decided to purchase a flat there. a certain b. proposed to help them in finding a flat. on 16 october 2002 the housing department of the city of moscow signed a social tenancy agreement with a certain k. in respect of a two-room flat at 32-70-69, prospekt vernadskogo, moscow. in october 2002 the first applicant bought a flat in kaluga region with the intention of exchanging it for a flat in moscow. on 29 october 2002 the committee for exchange of housing authorised the exchange of flats between k. and the first applicant. on 6 november 2002 the first applicant received an exchange voucher authorising her to move into the flat in moscow. later in november 2002 the applicants were registered as living in that flat. the applicants paid a sum of money to b. 13. in 2004 criminal proceedings were instituted against b. on suspicion of fraud. the first applicant had been informed of those proceedings. however, she had not submitted any civil claims against b. 14. on 12 december 2005 the nikulinskiy district court, moscow, (“the district court”) found b. guilty of fraud. the court established that b. had falsified a court judgment authorising the assignment of the flat at 32‑70-69, prospekt vernadskogo, moscow to k. under the social tenancy agreement and then fraudulently arranged for the exchange of flats between k. and the first applicant against the payment by the latter of 1,177,773.40 russian roubles (rub). in particular, the city court held that as a result of b.’s actions the first applicant had been registered as occupying the flat in question and had acquired the right to become its owner by way of privatisation. therefore, b.’s actions had to be reclassified as attempted fraud. in april 2009 the first applicant brought a counterclaim against the housing department on her own behalf and also on behalf of the second applicant, who was a minor at that time. the first applicant also claimed that the court action of the city of moscow had been time-barred. on 6 october 2009 the district court invalidated the social tenancy agreement concluded with k., the exchange of the flats between k. and the first applicant and the exchange voucher of 6 november 2002, and ordered the applicants’ eviction. the court declares the transactions null and void in accordance with article 168 of the [civil code] since they are incompatible with the requirements of articles 50, 51, 53, 54, 67-74 of the housing code. the court, pursuant to article 167 of the civil code returns the parties to their previous positions. in her appeal she submitted that the city of moscow had not lost its property rights to the flat and, having regard to her status as a bona fide user, the district court had found no grounds for granting the eviction claims. the first applicant also submitted that she had been living in the flat for seven years together with her minor daughter, had been paying charges for it and had carried out maintenance therein. lastly, she pointed out that the district court had not invited the custody agency to give its opinion as regards the eviction of her minor daughter from the flat. on 6 may 2010 the city court upheld the judgment of 6 october 2009 on appeal. in 2014 the applicants returned to blagoveshchensk. on 9 february 2015 the applicants applied to the nikulinskiy district court of moscow, requesting that a duplicate of the writ of execution in respect of the judgment of 6 october 2009 be issued. on 21 april 2015 the applicants received the writ of execution. on 26 june 2015 the bailiff’s office instituted enforcement proceedings in order to recover from k. the amounts awarded in the judgment of 6 october 2009 in favour of the first applicant.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in nizhyn in the chernihiv region. on 1 may 2010 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody pending the outcome of the investigation and trial. it ordered that the applicant remain in detention pending appeal. on 14 may 2013 the applicant’s sister, acting in the capacity of his lay defender, appealed against the judgment to the luhansk regional court of appeal (“the court of appeal”). in response, on 14 april 2014 the ukrainian government, who consider those armed groups to be terrorist organisations, authorised the use of force against them in the legal form of an “anti-terrorist operation”. a ceasefire was agreed upon within the framework of the tripartite contact group composed of representatives of ukraine, russia and the organisation for security and co-operation in europe (hereinafter, “the osce”). however, numerous violations of the ceasefire have continued to occur ever since. at the time the events of spring and summer 2014 were unfolding, the applicant was detained in starobilsk remand prison, located in the part of the luhansk region that has remained under the control of the ukrainian government. he remained in that prison until his release (see paragraph 30 below). at some point around that time, the judges of the court moved to the government-controlled territory. on 3 march 2015 the applicant lodged a similar complaint with the office of the parliamentary commissioner for human rights. on 27 march 2015 the court of appeal informed the applicant that his criminal case file was in luhansk, which was not under the government’s control, and that this prevented the court from examining his case. in order to resolve the problem, amendments would have to be made to the relevant legislation. in response to another complaint from the applicant, on 19 may 2015 the court of appeal informed him that it was unable to apprise him of the state of proceedings in his case because his criminal case file was in the court archives in luhansk, to which there was no access. the russian federation’s ongoing armed aggression against ukraine, together with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed both by the regular armed forces of the russian federation and by illegal armed groups guided, controlled and financed by the russian federation, constitutes ‘a public emergency threatening the life of the nation’ in the sense of ... article 15 § 1 of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. in order to safeguard the vital interests of society and the state in response to the armed aggression of the russian federation, the parliament of ukraine, the cabinet of ministers of ukraine and other authorities have to adopt decisions which constitute a derogation from certain obligations on the part of ukraine under the international covenant on civil and political rights and the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. however, the courts and pre-trial investigation bodies are not currently functioning in certain areas of the donetsk and luhansk regions because of the armed aggression of the russian federation and the actions of terrorist groups backed by the russian federation. that is why ukraine has had to change the territorial jurisdiction of the courts and investigative jurisdiction in respect of criminal offences in conditions where the life of the nation is threatened. on 5 june 2015 the permanent representation of ukraine to the council of europe transmitted to the secretary general of the council of europe a note verbale containing the text of the above declaration and its translation. on 15 june 2015 the applicant applied to the lysychansk court for restoration of the lost case file (відновлення матеріалів втраченого провадження). the court found that there was insufficient material available to restore the file. on 22 october 2015 the court of appeal again informed the applicant that examination of his case required amendments to the legislation. in this context, it referred to draft law no. on five occasions between may 2015 and february 2016 the applicant applied for release, arguing that his detention was unlawful because his conviction was not final and “would never become final”. the most recent of those decisions was taken on 25 february 2016. on 18 march 2016 the lysychansk court released the applicant. the regional prosecutor’s office appealed, arguing that the applicant’s conviction had not become final because his domestic case file had remained inaccessible in a non-government-controlled area and appeals against his conviction were still pending before the court of appeal. by contrast, those whose convictions were not final could be released only once the period for which they had been detained had exceeded half of the maximum sentence for the offence of which they stood accused. since the applicant was accused of offences, in particular

on 22 december 1998 the first applicant lodged a compensation claim with the sarajevo municipal court, seeking damages against the federation of bosnia and herzegovina (“the federation”) for goods seized during the 1992-95 war. it ordered that the interest should be calculated from february 1996. the rest of the first-instance judgment was upheld and it became final on the same day. on 10 june 2010 the supreme court dismissed the appeal. on 4 march 2009 the sarajevo municipal court issued an enforcement order. the enforcement was to be carried out at the debtor’s expense. on 16 march 2010 the debtor’s bank informed the enforcement court that the applicant had received bam 24,244.78 in respect of legal costs. on 28 january 2013 the sarajevo municipal court requested information from the bank about the status of the enforcement. on 14 february 2013 the bank informed the sarajevo municipal court that it did not consider that the enforcement order of 4 march 2009 had been fully implemented (because the interest due had not been paid). on 17 august 2010 the first applicant lodged an appeal with the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina (“the constitutional court”), complaining about the non-enforcement of the final judgment of 10 may 2007. on 7 november and 13 december 2012 the first applicant informed the constitutional court that the principal debt had been paid on 9 december 2011 but that the default interest remained unsettled. invited to submit their comments on the first applicant’s appeal, the federal ministry of finance argued that the war damage act of 2001 had declared that war damage constituted a part of public debt to which default interest did not apply. thus, there was no legal basis for the payment of default interest to the first applicant. on 12 june 2013 the constitutional court held that there had been a violation of article 1 of protocol no. 1 to the convention on account of the excessive length of the enforcement proceedings. it ordered the municipal court to conclude the enforcement proceedings without delay. however, the constitutional court did not examine the issue of the amount of default interest. in so far as relevant to the case before the court, its reasoning was as follows:
“39. therefore, the failure of the municipal court to ... terminate the enforcement proceedings in one of the ways prescribed by [the enforcement procedure act of 2003] ... without any justification based on the relevant law has led to an unlawful interference with the appellant’s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions under article ii/3.k) of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina and article 1 of protocol no. on 28 may 2007 the orašje municipal court ordered the federation to pay the second applicant bam 70,000 (approximately eur 35,260) in respect of pecuniary damage, together with default interest at the statutory rate from april 2003 and legal costs, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the civil obligations act of 1978. on 14 november 2007 the second applicant lodged a request for the enforcement of the judgment of 28 may 2007 with the orašje municipal court. on 13 february 2008 the court dismissed the debtor’s objection and upheld the enforcement order of 14 december 2007. on 5 december 2011 the second applicant received bam 66,499.98 in respect of the principal debt. the second applicant acknowledged that that payment had fully settled the principal debt. on 12 june 2012 the ministry of finance informed the orašje municipal court that the judgment of 28 may 2007 had been fully enforced as regards the principal debt and legal costs, and that there was no legal basis for the payment of default interest. on 2 april 2014 the orašje municipal court amended the execution order of 14 december 2007 in respect of the means of enforcement in that it ordered that the enforcement be executed with funds in accounts held by the debtor in two different banks. it also held that the enforcement schedule under the domestic debt act of 2004, which at the time stipulated that final judgments should be enforced by the payment of war damages in governments bonds in lieu of cash, had placed a disproportionate burden on the appellants. in its reasoning the constitutional court referred to its earlier decisions concerning the same matter. it ordered the federation to enforce the final judgments in question without further delay. on 16 january 2013 the constitutional court concluded that its decision of 8 june 2011 had been enforced.
the applicants either owned businesses at voronezh municipal market and rented the market pitches for their businesses, or worked as vendors for these businesses. on 6 august 2009 the police told the entrepreneurs who had gathered at the market to leave the premises. some refused to comply in the absence of any court order, and argued that, under their rent contracts, they had a right to remain at the market. suddenly, police officers arrived and started to grab people and take them to the police station.

on 18 january 2007 the moscow city authorities, the ministry of the defence of the russian federation and a private construction company signed an investment contract for the construction of a number of residential buildings in moscow. pursuant to the contract, a title to 3,823 flats was to be transferred to the ministry of the defence. the rest of the flats were to remain the city’s property. in 2008 the city authorities commissioned, as part of the said investment contract, several residential buildings. it appears that a number of flats in those buildings were transferred to the ministry of the defence. in 2009 the city authorities had their title to a number of flats, including those in residential buildings nos. 8 and 26-1 at ulitsa marshala savitskogo, moscow, registered by the state authorities. in 2010 the ministry of the defence assigned five of those flats to private individuals and entered into social housing agreements with them. subsequently those people successfully applied to the zyuzinskiy district court of moscow seeking recognition of their title to the flats by way of privatisation. once the court’s judgments became final, they had their ownership in respect of the flats registered in the state register and then sold the flats to other persons, including the applicants. the relevant transactions and transfer of the title to the property were duly registered by the authorities. the applicants moved into the flats and resided there. according to the government, in 2012 and 2013 the police opened criminal investigation in respect of the fraudulent transactions with the flats. the government did not inform of its outcome. on an unspecified date city authorities asked the district court to re‑open the cases concerning the flats privatised by the tenants who sold them to the applicants in 2011. the authorities claimed that the flats owned by the applicants were the city’s property. the district court granted the request, quashed the earlier judgments allowing the privatisation of the flats and re-examined the cases. the court established, inter alia, that the ministry of the defence had never owned the flats and, accordingly, had not had a right to assign them to private individuals. it granted the city’s claims in full invalidating the decisions of the ministry of the defence in respect of the flats and ordering the applicants’ eviction. the court also found that the applicants had acquired the flats in good faith. however, it ruled that the cases fell under one of the two exceptions to the protection of a bona fide purchaser’s title, which required that precedence be given to the city of moscow given that the flats had left the city’s possession against the latter’s will. the applicants’ appeals were to no avail. the moscow city court and the supreme court of the russian federation rejected them as unsubstantiated. according to the government, the judgments ordering the applicants’ eviction were not enforced. the applicants continue to reside in the flats. the details pertaining to each case are summed up in appendix ii below.
ms fatma nuray uncuoğlu (“the first applicant”) was born in 1945 and lives in istanbul. ms nurcihan uncuoğlu (“the second applicant”) was born in 1940 and also lives in istanbul. the applicants each owned a share in respective plots of land in the area of firuzköy, in the district of avcılar, istanbul. on 24 december 1987, a new zoning plan was put into force in the area of firuzköy, which encompassed the applicants’ plots of land. under the new plan, the plots of land were designated as “university area”. subsequently, in 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991, annotations (şerhler) were made in the land registry records indicating that the applicants’ land would be expropriated by istanbul university (hereinafter “the university”). on 26 march 1998 the applicants both asked the university to either expropriate the disputed land or to remove the annotations from the land registry records. the university informed the applicants, on 27 april 1998 and 28 april 1998 respectively, that the expropriation proceedings would commence when the necessary funding was provided. on 20 july 2001 the applicants initiated respective proceedings before the küçükçekmece civil court of first instance, claiming compensation for de facto expropriation. on 12 december 2003, relying on expert reports which had indicated that the applicants’ land had been fenced off by the university, the küçükçekmece civil court of first instance awarded the first applicant 97,125,000,000 turkish liras (trl) and the second applicant 37,837,500,000 trl by way of compensation for de facto expropriation. in its respective judgments, the first-instance court held in particular that the land at issue had been under the effective control of the university and that access to the land was restricted due to the fences that had been built around the land. on 22 june 2004 the fifth civil division of the court of cassation quashed the judgments of the küçükçekmece civil court of first instance, holding that the land in question had not been controlled or used effectively by the university. on 24 september 2004 both applicants requested the rectification of the respective decisions dated 22 june 2004. in their petitions, they drew the attention of the fifth civil division of the court of cassation to its previous decisions, dated 28 september 1999 and 31 march 2003, in which it had held that neighbouring plots of land in the same area had been de facto expropriated by the university because the latter had built fences around the land and because of the annotations made in the land registry records. on 12 april 2005 the fifth civil division of the court of cassation rejected the applicants’ requests for rectification of the decisions of 22 june 2004. however, it did not express any reason as to why it had reached a different conclusion from its previous decisions dated 28 september 1999 and 31 march 2003. on 6 october 2005 the küçükçekmece civil court of first instance complied with the decisions of the court of cassation and dismissed the cases. on 28 november 2005 both applicants filed an appeal, reiterating their argument concerning the contradictory decisions (see paragraph 12 above) delivered by the fifth civil division of the court of cassation. on 27 march 2006 and 4 april 2006 respectively, the fifth civil division of the court of cassation dismissed the appeals. in its decisions, it gave no reply to the applicants’ arguments regarding the fact that it had given contradictory judgments in respect of similar cases. the applicants’ requests for the rectification of the decisions were furthermore rejected and the judgments became final on 28 september 2006 and 3 october 2006 respectively. on an unknown date the university paid compensation to the second applicant for her plot of land.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in bucharest. from 1 august 2004 to 6 august 2007 he was employed in the bucharest office of s., a romanian private company (“the employer”), as a sales engineer. at his employer’s request, for the purpose of responding to customers’ enquiries, he created an instant messaging account using yahoo messenger, an online chat service offering real-time text transmission over the internet. he already had another personal yahoo messenger account. it appears from documents submitted by the government that the applicant had been informed of the employer’s internal regulations and had signed a copy of them on 20 december 2006 after acquainting himself with their contents. on 3 july 2007 the bucharest office received and circulated among all its employees an information notice that had been drawn up and sent by the cluj head office on 26 june 2007. the employer asked employees to acquaint themselves with the notice and to sign a copy of it. ... time spent in the company must be quality time for everyone! come to work to deal with company and professional matters, and not your own personal problems! your misconduct will be carefully monitored and punished! have a careful read of the collective labour agreement, the company’s internal regulations, your job description and the employment contract you have signed! these are the basis of our collaboration! it also appears from the documents submitted by the government, including the employer’s attendance register, that the applicant acquainted himself with the notice and signed it between 3 and 13 july 2007. charts were attached indicating that his internet activity was greater than that of his colleagues. at that stage, he was not informed whether the monitoring of his communications had also concerned their content. the forty-five pages mentioned in the notice consisted of a transcript of the messages which the applicant had exchanged with his brother and his fiancée during the period when he had been monitored; the messages related to personal matters and some were of an intimate nature. 62617/00, §§ 43-44, echr 2007‑i), he argued that an employee’s telephone and email communications from the workplace were covered by the notions of “private life” and “correspondence” and were therefore protected by article 8 of the convention. in a judgment of 7 december 2007 the county court rejected the applicant’s application and confirmed that his dismissal had been lawful. the fact that the provisions containing the requirement to interview the suspect (învinuitul) in a case of alleged misconduct and to examine the arguments submitted in that person’s defence prior to the decision on a sanction are couched in imperative terms highlights the legislature’s intention to make respect for the rights of the defence a prerequisite for the validity of the decision on the sanction. the aforementioned acts are deemed by the internal regulations to constitute serious misconduct, the penalty for which, in accordance with article 73 of the same internal regulations, [is] termination of the contract of employment on disciplinary grounds. the applicant appealed to the bucharest court of appeal (“the court of appeal”). this conflict has been settled at european union level through the adoption of directive no. 95/46/ec, which has laid down a number of principles governing the monitoring of internet and email use in the workplace, including the following in particular. - principle of necessity: monitoring must be necessary to achieve a certain aim. - principle of purpose specification: data must be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes. - principle of transparency: the employer must provide employees with full information about monitoring operations. - principle of legitimacy: data-processing operations may only take place for a legitimate purpose. - principle of proportionality: personal data being monitored must be relevant and adequate in relation to the specified purpose. - principle of security: the employer is required to take all possible security measures to ensure that the data collected are not accessible to third parties. in the meantime, on 18 september 2007 the applicant had lodged a criminal complaint against the statutory representatives of s., alleging a breach of the secrecy of correspondence.
the applicant is a privately owned company which was established in 1989 and registered in belgrade. to secure the payment of obligations under this agreement, the applicant and beranka ad concluded annex no. 1 on the fiduciary transfer of the latter’s property to the applicant (anex br. 1 ugovora o fiducijarnom prenosu prava svojine). in this annex, the property offered as collateral was: (a) property no. 6 – storehouse (magacin); (b) property no. 29 – power plant (energana); (c) property no. 9 – laboratory (laboratorija); and (e) property pm2 – paper machines (papir mašine). on 5 june 2004 the applicant reported its claim in these proceedings. on 17 september 2004 the commercial court refused to recognise this claim. following the decision of 17 september 2004, on 11 october 2004 the insolvency administrator for beranka ad (stečajni upravnik) lodged a request with the real estate office in berane seeking that the registration of the fiduciary transfer of property to the applicant be erased. on the same day the real estate office registry accepted this request. on 26 november 2004 the real estate department amended the said decision. on 13 april 2005 the real estate department in podgorica (uprava za nekrentine u podgorici) quashed both decisions on appeal and remitted the case for reconsideration. on 1 june 2005 the real estate department in berane re-registered the fiduciary transfer on properties nos. on 22 november 2005 the real estate department in podgorica upheld this decision. the applicant appealed to the administrative court. it would appear that the case is still pending before that body. the hearings concerning the objection were held on 11 august 2004, 31 may 2005 and 17 april 2006. on 24 august 2006 the commercial court dismissed the applicant’s objection. on 24 february 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision. on 8 april 2010 the real estate department in berane stayed the proceedings, because it needed some documents which were in the file of a case pending before the commercial court. this decision was quashed by decision of the ministry of finance and the matter was remitted to the first instance. on 26 october 2011 the real estate department adopted a decision allowing the deletion of the applicant’s rights from the public register. the same authority confirmed that decision on 2 november 2011. on 16 november 2011 the applicant filed an objection with the ministry of finance. on 9 july 2012 the applicant also lodged an appeal with the administrative court. on 30 november 2012 the administrative court rendered a decision in the applicant’s favour and ordered the ministry of finance to reconsider on the applicant’s prior objection. on 14 june 2013 the ministry of finance remitted the case to the first instance. the proceedings are still pending before the real estate department in berane.
the applicants were born in 1961 and 1960 respectively and live in charleroi and antwerp. on both occasions he benefited from discharges on probation. on his arrival at the police station later the same day, he was examined by a general practitioner before being transferred in the evening to jamioulx prison, where he was examined by dr s., who prescribed a sedative and a sleeping tablet. the applicants’ son was then placed in an individual cell in an ordinary section of jamioulx prison. after the interview, the deputy director decided to implement special security measures for a week. prison officer r., who had accompanied michael tekin since his return to prison, was instructed to inform him of those special security measures in his capacity as head of section acting as a prison assistant. he was accompanied by two other officers, l. and d. 16. r. read out the special security measures ordered by the director. in view of michael tekin’s reaction and his previous history, r. decided to place him in an isolation cell. a total of about ten officers were now present. some of them helped with keeping michael tekin under control while others remained passive. michael tekin was handcuffed and shackles were placed on his ankles. once they were inside the isolation cell they turned him over, only to note that his face was cyanotic. when the nurse and the duty doctor arrived at the inner security gate of the prison, an officer, who had been a witness to the events, informed them that the “service 100” (the medical emergency service) and the smur (emergency ambulance service) had been called at about 11.54 a.m. a transcription of the call is included in the case file. michael tekin’s death was recorded at 12.50 p.m. 28. at his first hearing on 8 august 2009, r. stated the following, as regards the prison officers’ intervention:
“michael tekin arrived in prison yesterday in a state of high nervous tension. on arrival michael tekin was very worked up against the police. i was present during this interview in the office used for that purpose. where special measures are ordered, they must be entered in writing and signed by the detainee. i immediately told him to calm down and to spit somewhere else. i told him that if he did not calm down he would be moved to the isolation cell. michael tekin was gesticulating with his arms and legs. in the end i was no longer holding him around the neck but exerting pressure on his head. from what i heard it was already too late. ...
we have not been trained in restraining detainees in critical situations. i didn’t hear michael tekin speaking, but i think he was trying to talk but nothing came out. ... the applicants applied to join the proceedings as civil parties. the reconstruction of the events led dr b., who had carried out the autopsy, to the conclusion that the cervical manoeuvres had been caused by the armlock applied by r., while the weight applied by l. on michael tekin’s thorax had had a negative effect on the latter’s respiratory mechanism and been conducive to asphyxia, his respiration being further hindered by the manner in which he had been transported to the isolation cell. subsequently, the continuation of the armlock had been equally justified and proportional in view of the fact that michael tekin had continued to struggle. on 1 august 2014 the applicants further filed an action for damages before the brussels court of first instance seeking a finding that the belgian state had been responsible for michael tekin’s death and for the suffering which he had sustained owing to his placement in an ordinary cell instead of in the psychiatric wing of the jamioulx prison.
on 25 april 2008 the applicant arrived in turkey legally on a visa valid for one month. on 24 april 2010 the applicant, who had been living in turkey since april 2008, was taken into police custody while he was at istanbul atatürk airport. he made a statement to the airport police on the same day. according to the document containing his statement, the applicant was informed that he was suspected of lacking a valid identity document and of illegal entry into turkey. he was kept in detention at the airport police station for the following three days. on 27 april 2010 the applicant was sent to istanbul kumkapı removal centre. according to the applicant’s account, the centre was severely overcrowded at the time of his detention, which resulted in hygiene problems. the building was infested with insects and the quality and quantity of the food was also fairly poor. moreover, there was no provision for outdoor exercise. on 2 june 2010 the applicant applied for release to the istanbul magistrates’ court. the court decided on the same day that it did not have jurisdiction as the applicant had not been detained within the scope of a criminal investigation. the court therefore ruled that any request had to be brought before the administrative courts. on an unspecified date the applicant made an asylum claim to the ministry of the interior and lodged an application for refugee status with the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr). on 25 june 2010 the applicant was granted a temporary residence permit in the province of bilecik as an asylum-seeker and was released from kumkapı removal centre on the same day. according to information provided by his representative on 4 january 2017, a deportation order was issued in respect of the applicant on an unspecified date in 2016. he has been detained at i̇zmir işıkkent removal centre since 20 september 2016 with a view to his expulsion. the domestic proceedings brought by the applicant against the deportation order and the applicant’s application to the unhcr for refugee status are still ongoing.

the applicant was born in 1975 and is detained in kahramanmaraş. on 19 november 2003 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the pkk/kadek (workers’ party of kurdistan/kurdistan freedom and democracy congress). it appears that at some point the applicant confessed to committing an armed attack on a prison vehicle in adana and, as a result, on 21 november 2003 at 3 p.m. was required to participate in a reconstruction of the events (yer gösterme). on the same day, he was taken to the dörtyol police station for questioning. the questioning took place between 8.10 p.m. and 11.50 p.m. the same day and 10 a.m. and 3.45 p.m. the following day. on the first page of the forms there was a pre-printed message stating, inter alia, that the person being questioned had the right to remain silent and the right to choose a lawyer. he was thus questioned in the absence of a lawyer. in particular, he gave detailed information about, inter alia, an armed attack on a prison vehicle in adana. he also stated that his code name was “hüseyin”. on 23 november 2003 he was brought before the dörtyol public prosecutor, where he partly confirmed and partly denied the content of his statements to the police made in the absence of a lawyer. prior to this he had been told his rights, including the right to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer. he further stated that he was a member of the pkk/kadek and had been involved in some of its activities in northern iraq but had not taken part in any political or armed activities in turkey. on the same day, an investigating judge of the adana state security court took statements from the applicant. he maintained, in particular, that his statements made to the police in respect of the armed attack in adana had been entirely correct. the court ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention. during the applicant’s period in custody, specifically from 19 to 23 november 2003, he was examined six times by doctors. later, at the first court hearing, he retracted his statements to the police, alleging that they had been extracted under duress. when asked about the reports of the reconstruction of events, the applicant submitted that he had not accepted the evidence against him. the case was therefore transferred to the adana assize court. had stated in his witness statements dated 16 october 2003 that he had seen the perpetrators of the attack. he also asked the court to enquire of the banks as to whether there had been any money transferred between the applicant’s father and h.k. it further dismissed the other request concerning the transfer of money, considering it not to be essential for the purposes of the case. the applicant’s lawyer gave detailed accounts of such treatment and asked the court of cassation not to rely on these statements which had been obtained by impairing the applicant’s will. on 12 october 2006 the court of cassation quashed the conviction for procedural shortcomings. he asked the trial court not to rely on those statements. made during questioning, which were later repeated before the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, and the record of the reconstruction of events. it also took into account the weapons, bullets and explosives seized by the judicial authorities and the organisational documents as well as the incident report, hotel records, an autopsy and expert reports, photographs, witness statements and investigation reports. on the same day, the applicant’s lawyer appealed against that judgment and alleged, inter alia, that the applicant’s statements had been taken without notifying him of his rights and as a result of coercion and death threats by the police. on 12 february 2009 the court of cassation upheld the conviction. on 18 february 2009 the judgment was pronounced in the absence of the applicant and his lawyer.
at the time of lodging his application, he was detained in berlin tegel prison. on 1 october 1998 the berlin regional court convicted the applicant of dangerous assault. he had stopped short of stabbing his victim to death. on 9 july 2007 the berlin regional court ordered the execution of the applicant’s preventive detention in accordance with article 67c § 1 of the criminal code as it was not reasonable to expect that the applicant would commit no further unlawful acts if released. the applicant appealed against the decision. he remained at liberty while the appeal was pending. while he was at liberty, he found a flat and a job and voluntarily started psychotherapy treatment with a female psychologist, so. he regularly attended weekly therapy sessions with so. and did not commit any criminal offences while at liberty. just like the regional court, it based its decision on a medical expert opinion drawn up previously by psychotherapy expert b. and psychologist s. expert b. had examined the applicant on four occasions between february and september 2005. both experts had issued their common written medical report on 15 september 2005 and had supplemented it with a further medical statement answering the questions of counsel representing the applicant on 20 april 2006. the original report was moreover based on the examination of the applicant’s prison files and a large number of investigation files, as well as on an interview with one of his fellow prison inmates. the court heard the prison authorities which, in their written statement of 6 march 2009, submitted that the applicant was not willing to work on his problems and refused any therapeutic treatment in the detention centre. 2 bvr 1512/02) and of the constitutional court of berlin (see decision of 4 march 2009, file no. which he had not been authorised to pursue since his renewed preventive detention. having regard also to the personality disorders leading to his dangerousness, the period of one year at liberty was therefore too short to prove that the applicant was no longer dangerous. in this regard, the court referred to the reasoning in its decision of 27 may 2008 and the expert opinion of b. and s. on which that decision was based (see paragraphs 13-15 above). moreover the court found that, although the prison authorities had, without giving proper reasons, refused to grant the applicant escorted short‑term leave from prison, especially short-term leave for the purpose of meeting his external therapist so., as explained above, a new psychiatric expert would not be confronted with a significantly different situation to the one b. and s. had found when they prepared their expert report. had not significantly changed his character and behaviour. on 24 march 2010, upon the applicant’s appeal, the berlin court of appeal, in a separate decision, quashed the prison authorities’ and the regional court’s decision refusing the applicant short-term leave to continue his psychotherapy treatment with so. resembled the situation arising in the applicant’s past relationships with women prior to his committing serious offences against them. the applicant’s subsequent requests to be granted access to treatment with the external psychiatric expert dr p. in a berlin clinic were turned down by the prison authorities, confirmed by the regional court. the applicant resumed external psychotherapy in september 2012. and her family, as he had started to stalk her and threaten her with e-mails and telephone calls. the court, endorsing the findings in a new external psychiatric expert opinion issued by p., held that although the probability that the applicant would reoffend at liberty was still high, it would be possible to release the applicant on probation after a preliminary period of about one year if the pre-operational phase was mastered by the applicant without further problems. on 12 october 2012 the court of appeal upheld that decision on appeal. it found that the applicant’s immediate release was not to be ordered owing to the danger he represented. however, he had not had such a relationship during the time he was at liberty. the applicant was released on parole on 20 november 2013.
the applicant, born in 1987, is the mother of two children, who are half-brothers. her younger son, x, was born in february 2012. on 29 june 2012, that decision was upheld by the county social welfare board (fylkesnemnda for barnevern og sosiale saker). the emergency placement was followed up by the child welfare authorities with a petition of 6 july 2012 to the board for a public care order. concerning the question of where he should be placed, the authorities essentially stated that the applicant’s mother and stepfather had previously been approved as foster parents for the applicant’s older son (see paragraph 5 above). in these circumstances, it would not be in x’s best interest to be placed with his maternal grandmother and her husband – the applicant’s mother and stepfather. her mother’s alleged inability to cooperate had in fact merely been a question of disagreement. their age was not in itself of importance, given that other circumstances were in favour of their acting as his foster parents. on 26 october 2012, after hearing the parties and ten witnesses, the county social welfare board granted the request for an order of public care. it decided that x should remain in the home in which he had already been placed as an emergency measure. placing [x] with his maternal grandmother and her husband would mean that [the two sons] would grow up together. as the board has previously mentioned, [x] may be inherently vulnerable. this is reinforced by the fact that the board finds that it cannot be ruled out that the boy may have attention-related difficulties. this means that there is a risk of the boy having the same type of difficulties. the child welfare service in [the municipality] has also reported difficulties regarding cooperation. on the basis of the statements of the child welfare service and the [younger son’s] health visitor, the board finds that there have been challenges as regards their cooperation with the grandmother. the board nonetheless finds reason to conclude that there have been some difficulties regarding cooperation. in her statement to the board, she still seemed to be uncertain about [the applicant]’s ability to care for the boy. the board has noted that the grandmother has not attended the contact sessions and thus not seen [x] since he was placed in care. the grandmother and her husband are relatively old to be foster parents to such young children. [ the board considers it likely that [x]’s placement in care will be long-term. although age alone is not decisive in relation to the choice of foster home, it is a factor in the assessment. the applicant appealed to the local city court (tingrett), which held an oral hearing from 4 until 6 june 2013. it heard fourteen witnesses in addition to the parties. the applicant was present, was represented by counsel, and gave testimony. it had moreover been documented that the applicant’s mother and stepfather might well be suitable foster parents for him. furthermore, it would be an advantage that the two sons would be allowed to grow up together. the city court shared the expert’s concerns. although the older brother, according to the information received, was happy in his foster home with the applicant’s mother and stepfather, x, despite his young age, had experienced two broken relationships – firstly with his biological mother and then with his emergency foster mother. he had now formed an attachment with his new foster mother after he had moved into his latest foster home in january 2013.
the applicant was born in 1945 and lives in sofia. for several years, until 2005 or 2006, he served as district prosecutor for sofia, heading what has been described as the largest prosecution office in bulgaria. after the applicant left his post, a commission was appointed with the task of looking into the prosecution office’s work under his management. the revision carried out by the commission led subsequently to the opening of criminal proceedings against the applicant, as it was alleged that he had exerted pressure on one of his subordinates in relation to the outcome of a case. on 12 october 2006 the national daily trud published an interview with the applicant, where he stated:
“all my life i have fought against crime. what is more, i have tried to defeat the mafia present in the prosecution services. and now i am bearing the consequences of that. and a third person], who staged a revolt at the time against the working methods i introduced. the aim of those methods was to eliminate any grounds for corrupt arrangements related to the cases. the applicant then explained that the prosecutor at issue was known as “prosecutor rushvetchiyski” (прокурора рушветчийски), meaning someone who takes bribes, derived from the colloquial word for bribe, rushvet (рушвет). i am knowledgeable about corruption patterns. questioned about a finding by the commission that a “bad psychological atmosphere” existed at the sofia district public prosecutor’s office while it was headed by him, the applicant stated further:
“the inspection might be right, if by ‘bad psychological atmosphere’ they mean my intolerance towards those prosecutors ..., who performed their duties in a sloppy manner, or attended meetings with the lawyers of criminals to decide on the outcome of cases. as are known from media publications [n.n. ’s] palaces, the companies owned by his wife in association with criminals. ... me being checked by prosecutor rushvetchiyski! during the previous year the prosecutors in it had drawn up 782 acts of indictment. now pay attention to the statistics for 2004, after i introduced my working methods. only 8% of the cases remitted by the courts. on the contrary, i thought we could have improved even further. ...” in response to a question by the journalist as to why he had not discussed the matter with the chief prosecutor, the applicant said:
“i don’t know if there is any point. i managed, to a certain extent, but at the end of the day many pieces of trash came to the surface. that article has not been submitted by the parties. they found the following statements particularly offensive: “i have tried to defeat the mafia present in the prosecution services”; “the unhealthiest elements in the prosecution service”; “many pieces of trash came to the surface ...crushing me now”; as well as his allegedly calling one of them “prosecutor rushvetchiyski”. in the context of the criminal proceedings, b.k. in a judgment of 5 december 2007, the plovdiv district court acquitted the applicant and dismissed the civil claims against him. it set aside his criminal liability but imposed an administrative penalty on him – a fine of bgn 1,000 (the equivalent of 510 euros (eur)). it is also a fact that the expressions were uttered in an interview, which was published and disseminated through the mass media – the trud newspaper ..., in its issue of 12 october 2006. it is a fact that the complainants ... were named in their capacity as public officials – being prosecutors at the sofia district public prosecutor’s office – and in relation to their official duties.” ... the applicant paid in the amounts indicated in paragraph 19 above on 7 august 2008. the total amount paid, including interest and the fees charged by the enforcement official, was bgn 14,826 (the equivalent of about eur 7,565).
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in aachen. the following day, the aachen district court issued a warrant for the arrest of the applicant on the ground that he was strongly suspected (dringend verdächtig) of commercial trafficking of a substantial amount of drugs and that there was a risk of his absconding. it considered that the applicant could face a considerable prison sentence for the offences in question, that he did not have strong ties to germany, that he was unemployed and living on social security, and that he could easily abscond to turkey. at a detention review hearing on 5 may 2010, the applicant’s counsel applied for the applicant’s release on bail, stating that the applicant’s family were able and willing to furnish the amount of bail to be determined by the court. the following day, the applicant’s counsel withdrew the application after the court indicated that bail would not be granted. on 6 august 2010 the aachen district court decided to open the trial against the applicant. it sentenced him to two years and six months’ imprisonment and ordered the continuation of his detention. on 30 september 2010 both the applicant and the public prosecutor lodged appeals against the district court’s judgment. that same day, the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision ordering his continued detention and asked for the detention order to be set aside or its execution to be stayed. he argued that there was no incentive for him to abscond. the strength of his ties to germany rendered his absconding to turkey unlikely. he had lived in germany for twenty years, had been married for the past thirteen years, and had two children, aged eight and one. his parents and his brother also lived in germany. his only tie to turkey, by contrast, was his parents’ holiday home. it considered that it was possible that the applicant would be sentenced to a significant prison sentence on appeal. there was, hence, an incentive for him to abscond which was not counterbalanced by his existing social ties to germany. this risk could not be adequately remedied by reporting requirements or payment of security. on 7 october 2010 the aachen regional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. it limited the basis of the detention order to the count on which he had been convicted and annulled it for the two counts on which he had been acquitted by the district court. yet, referring to the reasoning of the district court and underlining that the applicant had no legal employment whereas he had family ties to turkey, it considered that there continued to be a risk of the applicant’s absconding. on 26 october 2010 the applicant lodged a further appeal against that decision. in that regard, he proposed that his family furnish security of eur 10,000. after the regional court decided not to grant the applicant’s further appeal and to refer the matter to the cologne court of appeal, that court informed the applicant’s counsel, in a letter dated 22 november 2010, that it was considering staying the execution of the detention order. it asked the applicant to clarify the offer made and requested that the necessary means be given to him by his family in a manner that allowed him to dispose freely of those means and to furnish the security himself. the lawful origin of those means had to be credibly demonstrated. he added that, if the applicant had to assume that the security would be forfeited in any event, that is to say, even if he did not abscond, because the repayment claim would be attached for payment against other claims, the security could not effectively remedy a risk of his absconding. it stated that it would nonetheless consider staying the execution of the detention order if security were furnished. as long as the applicant’s family was not willing to put the necessary means at his own disposal it was, however, not ready to do so, arguing that this unwillingness indicated that his family lacked confidence in him and concluding that the family ties appeared not to be strong enough to prevent him from risking forfeiture of the security by absconding. the decision was served on the applicant on 9 december 2010. on 14 april 2011 the federal constitutional court declined to accept the applicant’s constitutional complaint against the court of appeal’s decision not to stay the execution of the detention order against him, lodged on 10 january 2011, for adjudication, without providing reasons (file no.
the applicant was born in 1953 and lives in graz. he was the managing director and 80% shareholder of ritz baugesellschaft m.b.h. on 12 october 1998 the graz civil regional court (landesgericht für zivilrechtssachen) opened insolvency proceedings (konkursverfahren) in respect of ritz baugesellschaft m.b.h. ( these proceedings were discontinued on 14 june 2013 for lack of funds to cover the cost (beschluss auf aufhebung des konkurses mangels kostendeckung). on 15 april 2002 the applicant initiated official liability proceedings in the name of the company (case no. 20 cg 79/02y) with the klagenfurt regional court (hereinafter “the regional court”) against the republic of austria, represented by the financial procurator’s office (finanzprokuratur). on 5 june 2002 he filed a further claim in his own name (case no. in both claims the applicant sued the republic of austria for pecuniary compensation for allegedly unlawful acts and shortcomings of the regional court in the course of the insolvency proceedings, which had resulted in pecuniary losses. in addition to that, the applicant and the company requested a declaratory judgment (feststellungsurteil) concerning the future liability of the republic of austria for any further damages arising from the insolvency proceedings. on 13 november 2002 the regional court rejected the applicant’s claim filed in the name of the company, holding that the applicant had no locus standi because he could not dispose of the company’s assets as long as the insolvency proceedings were still pending. on 28 january 2003 the graz court of appeal (oberlandesgericht) granted the applicant’s appeal and referred the case back to the regional court. on 25 march 2003 the supreme court rejected the extraordinary appeal lodged by the financial procurator’s office. on 17 september 2003 the regional court held a new hearing regarding the company’s claim, in which the parties agreed to suspend the proceedings, pending the outcome of other proceedings, apparently including the claim lodged in the applicant’s name. on 20 january 2004 the applicant asked for the proceedings lodged in the company’s name to be resumed and submitted a list of witnesses to be questioned by the regional court. on 7 april 2004 the regional court held a further hearing during which a building expert and a bookkeeping expert as sub-expert were appointed, the sub-expert to be consulted for any further advice. the proceedings filed in the applicant’s name remained suspended, awaiting the outcome of the resumed proceedings. on 2 march and 19 july 2005 the applicant filed requests to accelerate the proceedings (fristsetzungsantrag) under section 91 of the court act (gerichtsorganisationsgesetz). in the latter request the applicant asked the court of appeal to set a time-limit for the delivery of the expert reports by the end of july 2005 and for the regional court to hold a hearing for the purpose of questioning further witnesses and discussing the expert reports by 12 october 2005. on 11 august 2005 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s request under section 91, finding that the regional court had not been dilatory; it also stated that the requested time-limits were unrealistic and that the applicant’s request itself had caused further delays. on 15 march and 19 may 2006 the experts submitted their reports. on 29 june 2006 the regional court held another hearing to discuss the expert reports; eventually the court decided to submit the file to the public prosecutor to examine whether criminal investigations should be instituted against unknown offenders ex-officio and the proceedings stayed until such proceedings were terminated. on 21 february 2007 the applicant requested that the proceedings be resumed after the graz public prosecutor’s office (staatsanwaltschaft graz) had discontinued the criminal investigations. on 28 june 2007 the regional court held another hearing and on 12 july 2007 gave its judgment: it partly dismissed and partly granted the claim. on 14 april 2008 the court of appeal quashed parts of the judgment upon both parties’ appeals and, to this extent, remitted the case back to the regional court. on 16 december 2008 the supreme court rejected the applicant’s appeal. on 31 may 2010 the regional court partly dismissed and partly rejected the applicant’s extended claim as inadmissible after holding hearings on 7 july and on 18 november 2009. on 15 february 2011 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and on 28 april 2011 the supreme court rejected the applicant’s extraordinary appeal on points of law.
the applicant was born in 1939 and lives in vienna. they have two children, born in 1968 and 1977. had a relationship with another woman and in october 1990 t.g. on 28 november 1996 the couple was divorced due to the sole fault of t.g. to pay the applicant provisional maintenance. on 23 february 1992 the district court appointed an expert to assess t.g. on 9 november 1992 and on 18 january 1993 hearings were held. on 13 june and 15 september 1994, 23 october 1995, 5 and 26 february 1996 further hearings took place. on 26 march 1997 the district court issued a judgment partly granting and partly dismissing the maintenance claim. the district court held further hearings on 23 february and 27 april 1998. requested that the enforcement proceedings be stopped, which was granted by the district court. on 7 may 1999 the applicant requested a fresh interim order for provisional maintenance and an interim order to prohibit the pay-out of money from t.g. ’s pension fund and the redundancy money (abfertigung) he had received after retiring in april 1999. on 9 june 1999 the district court ordered t.g. to pay the applicant 20,000 austrian schillings per month. on 19 october 2000 the district court held a hearing. in the main maintenance proceedings the district court held further hearings in may 1999, september 2001 and january 2002 and heard further witnesses. the expert submitted his report on 1 april 2003. the liquidator refused to acknowledge that claim. ’s pension fund and his redundancy money, but dismissed the liquidator’s request to lift the order of provisional maintenance payments. ’s request, and on 13 september 2005 the regional court confirmed the decision. on 7 november 2005 the regional court partly granted the request and ordered the district court to hold a hearing within four weeks. the applicant did not appear because she was in hospital. on 21 march 2007 the applicant filed a second request for the acceleration of the proceedings. on 15 september 2007 the zürich district court submitted a large number of documents containing t.g. on 29 june 2011 the supreme court rejected the applicant’s extraordinary appeal on points of law (außerordentlicher revisionsrekurs), thus the partial judgment entered into force. after several hearings were postponed, another one took place on 27 november 2015. as no information to the contrary has been given by the parties, the proceedings are apparently still pending. on 25 april 2012 the salzburg regional court quashed the district court’s decision. however, the applicant appealed, therefore these proceedings are apparently still pending.
the applicant, mr piotr budnik, is a polish national who was born in 1980 and lives in leszno. the facts of the case were not in dispute and may be summarised as follows. the applicant was detained in łowicz prison from 27 january 2007 to 19 april 2009 (2 years, 2 months and 22 days). the applicant submitted that throughout his detention in łowicz prison he had been held in overcrowded cells in which the space per person had been below the polish statutory minimum standard of 3 sq. the domestic courts established, without giving any further details, that the applicant had been detained in overcrowded cells during various unspecified periods from 27 january 2007 to 19 april 2009. the overcrowding led to many quarrels between the prisoners as the tables did not have enough space for everybody. the applicant was placed in a solitary confinement cell for fourteen days as part of a disciplinary measure, where the toilet was not separated from the living space. in reply, the government submitted that the applicant had been held in solitary confinement owing to a need to monitor his behaviour. the number of stools and beds in all cells matched the number of inmates. all the cells were equipped with ventilation and heating systems. the applicant was entitled to one hot shower per week and one hour of outdoor exercise per day. on 12 may 2009 the applicant, represented by a legal aid lawyer, brought a civil action over an infringement of his personal rights on account of the inadequate living conditions in łowicz prison from 27 january 2007 to 19 april 2009. the applicant argued that he had been detained in overcrowded cells with space that was below the statutory minimum. he claimed 100,000 polish zlotys (pln) (approximately 25,000 euros (eur)) in compensation. on 20 july 2012 the łódź regional court (sąd okregowy) granted the applicant pln 3,000 (eur 750) in compensation and dismissed the remainder of his claim. the domestic court found that the applicant had been detained in overcrowded cells from 27 january 2007 to 19 april 2009. moreover, he had been detained in a solitary confinement cell as a disciplinary punishment for fourteen days. on 1 march 2013 the łódź court of appeal (sąd apelacyjny) amended the above judgment, increased the compensation to pln 7,000 (approximately eur 1,750) and dismissed the remainder of the action.
the applicant was born in 1967 and lives in düren. on 27 august 2010 the krefeld district court issued a warrant for his arrest as there was a strong suspicion that he had been trafficking drugs. earlier that day he had been stopped with 15.8 grams of heroin, which he had allegedly intended to sell. on two previous occasions he had been stopped at the german border with 11 and 12.5 grams of heroin on him. the arrest warrant was based on the risk of him absconding as he could expect a considerable sentence for the offences in question, had no social ties, being unemployed and a drug addict, and had an unstable character. between 30 august 2010 and 11 november 2010 the lawfulness of the applicant’s detention on remand was examined eight times by the district court or regional court. in a judgment of 6 december 2010 the district court convicted the applicant of three counts of large-scale drug trafficking – two counts of smuggling drugs into germany and trafficking (dealt with as a single offence instead of two separate offences) and a third count of trafficking only and sentenced him to two years and six months’ imprisonment. on the same day, in a separate decision, the district court ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention. on 8 december 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision. in substance he mainly referred to his previous submissions. on 13 december 2010 he lodged an appeal against the judgment. the district court did not allow the appeal of 8 december 2010 relating to the applicant’s detention and referred it to the regional court, which dismissed it on 15 december 2010, finding that there continued to be a risk of the applicant absconding. on 5 january 2011 the applicant lodged a further appeal against that decision. in substance, again, he referred to his previous submissions. he explicitly asked that the observations of the chief public prosecutor’s office be sent to him so as to be able to comment on them. on 28 january 2011 the düsseldorf chief public prosecutor’s office (generalstaatsanwaltschaft – “the prosecution authorities”) submitted written observations to the court of appeal, requesting the dismissal of the applicant’s appeal of 5 january 2011. the applicant’s counsel received the observations from the prosecution authorities on 3 february 2011 and submitted a reply to the court of appeal on 10 february 2011. following a telephone enquiry to the court of appeal, the applicant’s counsel learned on 10 february 2011 that on 3 february 2011 it had already decided the applicant’s appeal of 5 january 2011 and dismissed it. the applicant had therefore not been able to reply to the observations of the prosecution authorities of 28 january 2011 prior to the court taking its decision. that same day the applicant’s counsel requested a subsequent hearing (nachholung des rechtlichen gehörs) under article 33a of the code of criminal procedure. on 14 february 2011 the court of appeal’s decision of 3 february 2011 was served on the applicant. on an unspecified date the prosecution authorities submitted written observations in relation to the applicant’s request for a subsequent hearing. on 25 february 2011 the court of appeal dismissed the request for a subsequent hearing as inadmissible, finding that the applicant’s right to be heard had not been violated, that the prosecution authorities’ observations of 28 january 2011 had not contained any facts unknown to him and there had therefore been no need to serve them on him. in so far as his submission of 10 february 2011 was to be classified as an objection (gegenvorstellung), the court rejected it because its decision of 3 february 2011 had not been based on incorrect factual or procedural considerations. prior to the decision of 25 february 2011, the observations of the prosecution authorities relating to the request for a subsequent hearing had not been served on the applicant, who had thus had no opportunity to reply to them. the court of appeal nevertheless quoted and endorsed those observations in its decision. on 7 april 2011 the applicant lodged a complaint with the federal constitutional court. he alleged, in particular, that his right to be heard, as guaranteed by article 103 § 1 of the basic law (grundgesetz), had been violated, because the court of appeal had taken its decisions of 3 and 25 february 2011 without giving him the opportunity to reply to the observations of the prosecution authorities. on 28 july 2011 the federal constitutional court declined to accept the applicant’s constitutional complaint without providing reasons (2 bvr 805/11). its decision was served on him on 10 august 2011.
the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in novigrad. by a contract concluded in 1971 between a company, g.p. ( these plots of land were registered in the land register as being publicly owned. in accordance with the contract, the claimant built residential buildings and sold all of them. during and after the construction of the residential buildings, the claimant instituted several sets of land register correction proceedings with regard to the land at issue in order to harmonise the record in the land register with the new situation. in one of the land register correction proceedings the novigrad municipality objected to the claimant’s application for a correction and therefore on 2 october 2000 the land registry department of the buje municipal court instructed the parties to initiate civil proceedings. on 6 october 2000 the claimant brought a civil action before the buje municipal court (općinski sud u bujama) against the novigrad municipality (hereinafter “the defendant”), seeking that the data concerning the size of certain plots of land be corrected in the land register of that court. in its civil action the claimant indicated the value of the claim as 5,000 croatian kunas (hrk). meanwhile, on 27 december 1999, the applicant and the claimant had concluded a purchase agreement in respect of the plots of land that surrounded the residential buildings the claimant had built and that were the subject of the proceedings instituted on 6 october 2000. the defendant did not object to that valuation. after that, the defendant gave its reply to the claim on the record. furthermore, the first-instance court adopted a decision allowing the applicant to join the claimant in the proceedings as an intervener because it held that she had a legal interest. on 25 february 2005 the buje municipal court allowed the claim. upon an appeal by the defendant lodged on 5 february 2007 the pula county court (županijski sud u puli) quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case for a fresh examination. on 26 may 2009 the first-instance court dismissed the claim as ill-founded. in its reasoning it stated, inter alia, that at the moment of the delineation of the disputed parcels the claimant had not had any right to the property at issue and therefore by its correction the claimant would have become an owner of the property which he had never been given for permanent use. further to this, the court had assessed the costs of the proceedings according to the value of the claim set at hrk 105,000 at the hearing on 14 june 2001. it ordered the claimant to bear these costs. at the bottom of the last page of that judgment was a note stating that the case had been conducted and the judgment had been drafted by j.g., the court administrator (sudski savjetnik). the applicant lodged an appeal complaining, inter alia, that her case had been heard and decided by a court administrator who had not been authorised to conduct the impugned proceedings under the relevant procedural rules. she proposed that evidence be heard from j.g., as well as the parties to the proceedings and their legal counsel. the applicant further complained of the assessment of the amount of the litigation costs. she was of the opinion that the value of the claim was the one indicated in the civil action, namely hrk 5,000, which should have been taken into account by the first-instance court when calculating the costs. on 18 october 2010 the pula county court upheld the first-instance judgment. the applicant then lodged simultaneously an appeal on points of law and a constitutional complaint. she stated that the judge had not been present at the hearings and that the judge had signed the records of the hearings afterwards. she argued that the supreme court had applied the relevant procedural provisions concerning the value of the claim in an arbitrary manner. on 29 march 2012 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as manifestly ill-founded.
the applicant was born in 1971 and was at the material time serving a prison sentence in rustavi prison no. he was placed under investigation that day and questioned twice. maintaining his innocence, he refused to sign the record of the identification procedure. the applicant appealed to the tbilisi court of appeal. he subsequently had chemotherapy on a sporadic basis. as the illness then returned, he had another operation in 2003. after confirming the diagnosis of chronic hcv and that he had been recently treated for cancer of the right testicle, doctors recommended he have a consultation with an oncologist and a special medical examination. he noted that the applicant was ready to bear all the costs himself. he stayed at the prison hospital until 4 february 2006 and, according to his medical records, he was provided with treatment for his symptoms, which consisted of pain medication. after several prison transfers and given that his health was still unsatisfactory, the applicant returned to the prison hospital on 25 february 2006. he had lost weight and the chronic hcv had worsened. on 2 september 2006 the applicant was sent back to tbilisi prison no. on 5 december 2006, before being discharged, the oncologist recommended that the applicant return after three weeks for a check-up and more chemotherapy. at the same time, in view of the further progress of the disease, he recommended that the applicant be placed under permanent medical supervision in the prison hospital. on 21 april 2007 the applicant was placed in the prison hospital. the doctor subsequently reiterated his recommendation, however, it was in vain as no transfer followed. the doctor in charge noted on a regular basis in the medical record that the applicant needed to be transferred to the nco urgently. at the same time a report concerning his medical condition was issued, which confirmed the diagnosis of cancer of the right testicle at stage 1 b in clinical group ii. the experts held that the results of the chemotherapy meant that the applicant’s state of ill health could not be described as serious. he was then returned to the prison hospital on 13 july 2007, with a recommendation for another course of chemotherapy after three weeks. on 22 september 2007 he was sent to rustavi prison no. 2 and given a recommendation for an examination after three months. the applicant was transferred to the prison hospital the next day. doctors recommended a cancer marker blood test and an examination by an oncologist. they concluded that chemotherapy was the priority and that the antiviral treatment should be postponed. the applicant noted in a letter of 23 may 2008 that the prison hospital, inter alia, did not employ a chemotherapy specialist who was present on a daily basis and that he would therefore be left without full‑time medical supervision there. in a letter of 4 june 2008 the head of social services stated that the prison hospital was adequately equipped to provide the applicant with chemotherapy under the supervision of relevant specialists. in support, he noted that two of the six prisoners who had had chemotherapy at the prison hospital had passed away. the results showed no replication of the hepatitis and accordingly no need for antiviral treatment. the sanitary and hygiene conditions in the cell were bad and he was not allowed to have daily outdoor exercise.
the applicants were born in 1984, 2002, 2005, 1935, 1948, 1973, 1983, 1973, 1969 and 1976 respectively and live in tunceli. on their arrival at the scene at 3 p.m. they were asked to assist two injured persons, whom they loaded onto the trailer of the tractor and took to a place from which a helicopter picked them up and took them to the military hospital in elazığ. he was formally identified by a relative who also told the authorities that he had gone to that place to collect wood. the doctors observed that all the bullets had entered the body through clothed areas but noted that there was no clothing such as a vest or a shirt in the bag which could be examined with a view to establishing the distance from which he had been shot. who had been in charge of the five other soldiers questioned by the prosecutor the same day. at midday they had heard a horse and a number of people but had been unable to see them. the soldiers had fired in the air and repeated their warnings and at that moment fire which sounded as though it was from a kalashnikov-type rifle had been opened in the direction of the soldiers from the river bed. after a short while the first lieutenant had asked his soldiers to stop firing and they had walked towards the river bed where they had found an injured person whom they later identified as the tenth applicant rıza çiçek. the other five military personnel gave similar statements to the prosecutor. told the prosecutor how he, together with thirty-nine other soldiers and their commander, first lieutenant i̇.y., on 15 october 2007 the hozat public prosecutor took a formal decision to secure as evidence the objects found by the gendarmes during their search at the scene of the incident. the prosecutor’s decision was endorsed by the hozat magistrates’ court the same day. on 6 november 2007 the tenth applicant was questioned by the tunceli prosecutor as a “suspect”. his deceased cousin bülent karataş, who had been a bee-keeper, had told him that he had seen a bee colony in a field and asked him to accompany him there to collect it. bülent had told the soldiers that they would finish their job and then leave. within minutes the soldiers had encircled him and he had started begging the soldiers not to kill him. as he was a nature-lover, he had taken his camera with him. the malatya assize court declined to institute criminal proceedings against the tenth applicant and returned the indictment to the malatya public prosecutor on 11 april 2008. the prosecutor also stated that a list of the items which the tenth applicant had been supplying to the terrorist organisation had been included in the indictment. the remaining two military personnel were also questioned, on 26 may and 10 june 2008. the fifth person stated that he remembered that he had made a statement to the hozat public prosecutor soon after the incident but added that he could not now remember the events in question. on 23 june 2008 the hozat public prosecutor ruled that he did not have jurisdiction to carry out the investigation and forwarded the investigation file to the elazığ military prosecutor’s office. in the hozat public prosecutor’s decision the six military personnel were referred to as “suspects” of the offences of “attempted murder” and “murder”. in this connection they pointed out, in particular, that the prosecutor’s examination of the scene of the incident (see paragraphs 9-11 above) had not been conducted in an impartial manner because the prosecutor had been accompanied by a number of soldiers and that the family’s requests to visit and examine the place with the attendance of all the parties had been unreasonably rejected. the military prosecutor’s decision recorded that another statement had apparently been taken from the tenth applicant in his capacity as a “suspect”, by the prosecutor on 9 november 2007 before he was brought before the hozat magistrates’ court (see paragraphs 26-27 above) in which he had apparently told the prosecutor that he and bülent karataş had gone to the area on the evening of 26 september 2007 and not on the morning of 27 september 2007. after they had come back their identity cards had been checked once again and they had been ordered to take their clothes off. when he refused to do so the soldiers had hit him with the butts of their rifles and he had therefore rolled down the hill. the bullet had entered on a downward trajectory. it was therefore normal that some of his statements might appear contradictory. the military court stated in its decision that a jumper and a cardigan belonging to the tenth applicant and bülent karataş had been placed in the sidecar of the motorbike and at the time of the events they had been wearing only their vests, which despite all efforts had never been found.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in tallinn. in 2006 the applicant’s son o., who was born in 1983, was diagnosed with malignant melanoma. he was operated on in 2006, and underwent regular check-ups. in april 2009 a metastasis was removed from his brain, and he received radiation therapy. in september 2009 o.’s state of health deteriorated. on 19 september 2009 the applicant called an ambulance and o. was taken to the north estonia medical centre (“the nemc”) (põhja-eesti regionaalhaigla) for examination. on 24 september 2009 the applicant again called an ambulance for o., who had been complaining of feeling generally unwell, of a numbness of one side of his face, a rash around his nose and dizziness. the applicant pointed out that the medical council’s decision had not been signed by o. 11. on 6 october 2009 o. was transferred to an intensive care unit because he was suffering from progressive respiratory failure and a disturbed state of mind. he was also diagnosed with pneumonia and, in the light of that finding, was given additional antibacterial treatment. on 9 october 2009 a tracheotomy was performed on o. 14. on 12 october 2009 o. stopped breathing and mechanical ventilation was applied. on 13 october 2009 characteristics corresponding to brain death were ascertained. according to information in a report drawn up by the estonian forensic science institute based on an analysis of o.’s medical records, an electroencephalogram performed the same day revealed serious diffuse brain damage and only minimal electrical activity. o.’s active treatment and feeding were discontinued, but the infusion therapy was continued. the applicant disagreed with this finding and rather considered that o. had fallen into a coma following an overdose of medicine. according to the applicant, the protocol for verifying brain death was never fully and properly carried out. the administration of food and medicines was not resumed, despite the applicant’s requests. on 15 october 2009 the applicant called the police on the general emergency number, complained about o.’s treatment and asked that an expert examination be commissioned. on 16 october 2009 an autopsy was performed at the nemc. the expert committee also heard the applicant. in addition, the expert committee’s decision contained written answers to the applicant, stating that o. had not suffered from a stroke; that the deterioration in his health had not been caused by the administration of specific medication or the withdrawal thereof, but rather by the metastatic developments in his brain; and that based on the medical records, o. had not been starved, nor had his mechanical ventilation been stopped before his death. criminal proceedings under article 123 of the penal code (placing or leaving another person in a situation which is life-threatening or likely to cause serious damage to the person’s health) were initiated on 1 april 2010. in the course of the criminal investigation, several individuals (doctors, nurses, the applicant, and o.’s friends who had visited him in the hospital) were interviewed. the prosecutor posed ten questions to the forensic medical experts addressing, inter alia, o.’s diagnoses; the adequacy of the treatment with respect to his state of health (including the tracheotomy); the restraining of o. to the bed; the administration of medicine on 12 october 2009 and whether this could have caused o.’s breathing to stop; the decision to cease the administration of medicine and food on 13 october 2009; the assertion that o. was brain-dead; and the decision to stop mechanical ventilation. according to the forensic medical report dated 30 august 2012, o. had received treatment appropriate for his condition. they considered that the restraining of o. to the bed could have been justified in the instant case. on 25 october 2012 the criminal proceedings were terminated as the commission of an offence had not been proven based on the evidence gathered. an appeal lodged by the applicant with the office of the prosecutor general was dismissed on 10 december 2012. on 28 january 2013 the tallinn court of appeal dismissed a further appeal lodged by the applicant.
the applicant was born in 1949 and lives in torre del greco. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, can be summarised as follows. in january 1990, a few years after she had applied to the interior ministry for a disability pension, ms t.g., the applicant’s mother, was granted an entitlement to the monthly payment of the pension together with a special allowance on account of her partial blindness. filed an application with torre annunziata district court (pretore), sitting as an employment tribunal, to obtain acknowledgment of a re-evaluation of her pension and interest on the arrears. on 27 march 1998, after the hearing had been adjourned three times, the district court dismissed the application as out of time. on 10 march 1999, the applicant, lodged an appeal against that decision, on her own behalf and in her capacity as heir, in naples district court. on 10 december 2002 that court acknowledged the applicant’s right to the recalculated sum and interest for a total of eur 12,240.26. the decision became final on 25 january 2004. as the decision was not enforced by the relevant authorities, on 14 june 2004 the applicant served a payment order (atto di precetto) on the national social security agency (istituto nazionale della previdenza sociale – inps) for eur 30,364.38, representing the sum claimed, with interest and taking account of the re-evaluation. on 25 january 2005 she obtained a garnishee order (pignoramento presso terzi) from the naples enforcement judge in respect of her whole claim. on 25 may 2005 the applicant lodged an appeal with the “pinto” division of the rome court of appeal, complaining about the excessive length of the proceedings. with regard to the admissibility of her appeal, she argued that, under section 4 of law no. 89/2001 (the “pinto act”), the “final domestic decision” to be taken into account was that of the enforcement judge of 25 january 2005. in consequence, she argued, the six-month deadline for lodging the claim for just satisfaction ought to run from that date. on 18 may 2006 the court of appeal declared the appeal inadmissible as out of time, taking the view that the final domestic decision to be taken into consideration was that delivered by the naples district court in the proceedings on the merits, a decision which had become final on 25 january 2004. the court of cassation upheld that decision on 25 september 2008 and dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law.
the applicant was born in 1987 and was serving a prison sentence in nubarashen penal facility (see paragraph 27 below) at the time when he lodged his application with the court. on 29 april 2006 the dead body of a fellow serviceman, a.h., he was hanging from a tree with his arms tied behind his back with wire. on an unspecified date the head of the disciplinary isolation facility of the military police department addressed the following letter to investigator a.k.: 20440 of the ministry of defence ... upon his admission, during his stay and upon his discharge he had no bodily injuries, and no complaints with regard to his state of health had been received.” on the same day the applicant was taken to the arabkir and kanaker-zeytun district court of yerevan. no legal representative was allocated to him at that time. on 21 june 2006, while in the nubarashen detention facility, the applicant lodged a complaint with, inter alia, the general prosecutor’s office, stating as follows:
“... on 1 may this year military police officers came to the military outpost and took me [and two other soldiers] to the [military police] department. they took statements from us there and started to beat us. they were forcing me to give false incriminatory statements. i was held for 10 days for violation of the internal disciplinary code. every day they would take me to a room and try, by beatings and threats, to force me to give evidence in the way they wanted. when i was not able to eat because my teeth were aching from many punches and slaps, they threatened me and used indecent swearwords. he started begging me to forgive him and said that he had been unable to withstand the beatings, pain and fear and that he had given false testimony against me as otherwise bad things would have happened to his family. i was kept in [the military police headquarters] and isolation cell not for 10 days but for 18 days. i am asking and requesting again that the investigative authorities conduct an impartial and thorough investigation by observing the ... requirements of the criminal process, to find the real murderers and to release me and other innocent persons involved in the investigation from this inhuman nightmare.” on 23 september 2006 the investigator decided not to institute criminal proceedings. similar statements were made by the deputy head of the operational intelligence department [a.mar.] on an unspecified date the investigation was closed. alleged that they had been ill-treated during the investigation. ’s allegations of beatings had not been confirmed. was also found guilty and sentenced to a prison term. on 7 september 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment of the syunik regional court, stating that he did not agree with the judgment. on 12 november 2008 the criminal court of appeal examined the case anew and changed the applicant’s offence in connection with a.h. he claimed, inter alia, that the applicant had been beaten and tortured by military police officers and that when he and r.h. had been forced to make confession statements. ’s decision of 23 september 2006 not to institute criminal proceedings against the military police officers. on 30 april 2009 the court of cassation declared the applicant’s appeal inadmissible for lack of merit. on 22 december 2009 the constitutional court held that if the court of appeal quashed a judgment of the first-instance court and adopted a new legal act, an appeal on points of law should be available to the parties to the proceedings in question. ... as it appears from the decision of 23 september 2006 ..., no criminal proceedings were instituted ... on account of the ill-treatment of [the applicant] and [r.h.]
the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. following the expiry of their leave they remained in the united kingdom as overstayers. the applicant’s father entered the united kingdom in 1991. on 5 june 1995 the applicant’s mother claimed asylum on undisclosed grounds. the applicant and his two siblings were named dependents on that claim. following a reconsideration of the case in august 1999, the secretary of state again refused the asylum claim but granted the family four years’ exceptional leave to remain in the united kingdom. his mother and siblings have since become british citizens. on 16 december 2003 the applicant was convicted of disorderly behaviour or using threatening/abusive/insulting words likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. he was sentenced to a community punishment order of two hundred hours. in or around this time the secretary of state considered instigating deportation proceedings against the applicant. on 30 june 2006 he decided not to pursue such proceedings owing to the length of his residence in the united kingdom. on 11 july 2008 the applicant pleaded guilty to the supply of class a drugs. you told the jury, with some satisfaction, that this policy was successful ... i regard you as close to the source of supply and wholesaling to retailers in swindon on a persistent and regular basis.” he was released on licence on 3 march 2011. on 6 april 2010 the secretary of state notified the applicant of his liability to automatic deportation and asked him to submit reasons why he should not be deported. she did accept that he enjoyed private life in the united kingdom but did not consider that his removal would be disproportionate to the legitimate interest of preventing disorder and crime. furthermore, as english was one of the official languages of nigeria, he would not face a language barrier on return. in addition, it found that he had also established a private life in the united kingdom; that he had no experience of living in nigeria, save for a short period as a baby and a two week holiday in 2004; that he had no close relatives in, and no ties to, nigeria; that he had indicated his remorse and given assurances that he would not offend again; and that his working and studying whilst in detention supported those assurances. the tribunal considered the principles established by this court in boultif v. switzerland, no. 54273/00, echr 2001‑ix, üner v. the netherlands [gc], no. although it did not accept that there was any additional element of dependency which would enable it to find the existence of family life for the purposes of article 8 of the convention, it nevertheless accepted that the applicant’s parents and siblings were an important part of his private life. on 19 february 2013 the secretary of state agreed to withdraw the certification decision and to issue a new decision taking account of the applicant’s further representations of november 2012 and those lodged with the judicial review application in january 2013. in a decision dated 11 april 2013, she refused to revoke the deportation order since there were no “exceptional factors” which outweighed the public interest. it had considered them in the context of the exceptionality requirements set out in maslov (the requirement of “very serious reasons” to justify the expulsion of a settled migrant: see maslov, cited above, § 75) and concluded that his deportation was justified. the first-tier tribunal refused permission to appeal on 4 october 2013. in addition, he also submitted that the application raised an important point of principle: namely, whether the decision of the tribunal was contrary to the principle of double jeopardy, or constituted discriminatory punishment, since a british national could not be excluded from the united kingdom. on 23 october 2013 the upper tribunal refused the application for permission to appeal. in refusing permission the judge expressly stated that while it was “apparent that different views might reasonably be taken about whether the claimant should be permitted to remain in the uk in the light of his family ties and length of residence”, that was “not the test for the grant of permission”. following the refusal of the application for permission to apply for judicial review, the applicant had no right to renew the application at an oral hearing in the administrative court. removal directions scheduled for 20 january 2015 were cancelled owing to the absence of a valid travel document.
the applicants are the next-of-kin of several roma who died or disappeared in the circumstances described below. a few hours later the boat sank owing to the large number of passengers. in their opinion, however, the cause of death was drowning. they had not called her from podgorica or mentioned that they had intended to go to italy. on 6 december 1999 the high court (viši sud) in podgorica declared that the court in bar was territorially competent to process the case and the case was returned. the remaining five defendants appeared before the court. by 14 april 2004 ten hearings had been scheduled, six of which took place. during the hearings that did take place, the court read out the indictment again, questioned four defendants and sixteen witnesses, including the eleventh applicant, and read out the earlier statements made by the witnesses; the fifth defendant chose to remain silent. the eleventh applicant was heard on 8 october 2003. she also confirmed that she was illiterate. it also ordered that the remaining three defendants be brought before the court. on 11 november 2004 an investigating judge of the high court decided to initiate a formal judicial investigation against the eight individuals, a decision which was upheld by the high court on 25 november 2004. on 25 february 2006 the high state prosecutor urged the investigating judge to finish the investigation. between 24 and 28 november 2006 the indictment was served on four of the defendants. on 15 january 2007 the president of the chamber informed the president of the high court that a trial hearing could not be scheduled yet as the indictment had not yet been served on all the defendants. the other two were based in serbia and bosnia and herzegovina respectively. by 31 october 2009 the translation of the indictment into romani had become available. in the course of 2010 seven hearings were scheduled. the fifth defendant chose to remain silent. in the course of 2012 seven hearings were scheduled, two of which were adjourned because one defendant, a defence lawyer, some of the witnesses, including the seventh applicant, and/or the interpreter did not attend court. the lawyers were fined 500 euros (eur) for their unjustified absence. on 4 june 2014 the trial hearing was recommenced due to the passage of time. on 7 december 2009 the ombudsman issued a report in this regard noting, in substance, that the investigation had lasted for more than seven years and that ten years after the impugned event the criminal proceedings had not yet been terminated, which was unjustified. he recommended that the high court undertake all necessary steps to terminate the proceedings as soon as possible. the judge in charge informed him of the hearings scheduled between october and december 2010. on 19 august 1999 the only surviving passenger was found guilty of boarding the boat on 16 august 1999 with the intention of illegally crossing the border to italy and was fined by the misdemeanour court (sud za prekršaje) in kotor. in the course of 2002 a number of family members of those who had disappeared, two of them applicants in the present case, urged that the proceedings at issue be expedited. some of them claimed that their next-of-kins were alive but had been trafficked. it appears that some others also hoped that their family members might still be alive. on 15 june 2011 the president of the high court requested the ministry of justice to appoint a permanent court interpreter for romani as soon as possible, stressing that one of the reasons for the criminal proceedings in question having “lasted too long” had been the absence of an adequate interpreter for romani.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in prague. on 1 january 2005 the applicant took up his duties as director of the department of administration of the ministry’s property (sekce správy majetku ministerstva obrany). on 19 july 2005 the authority issued the applicant with security clearance, valid until 18 july 2010, confirming that he had access to state classified information in the “secret” category. it started an investigation in order to verify the information received. in the course of that investigation the intelligence service provided the authority with other information, dated 21 march 2006, classified “restricted” and annexed to the security file (bezpečnostní spis) under number 77. on the basis of that information the authority revoked the security clearance on 5 september 2006. with regard to that risk, the decision did not however indicate which confidential information it was based on, as this was classified “restricted” and could not therefore legally be disclosed to the applicant. the decision indicated that the facts established in respect of his conduct, as documented in the information received by the authority on 7 october 2005, cast doubt on his suitability for security clearance and his ability not to be influenced and to keep sensitive information secret, and thus indicated that he was no longer trustworthy. he dismissed as unfounded the complaint that the applicant had failed to disclose certain information prior to being issued with security clearance. in the meantime, on 4 october 2006, the applicant had asked to be discharged, for health reasons, from his duties as deputy to the first vice-minister of defence, and from those of director of the department of administration of the ministry’s property. he was removed from office on the same day under article 65 § 2 of the labour code (see paragraph 26 below). on 20 october 2006 he signed an agreement, under article 43 of the labour code, terminating his contract by mutual consent with effect from 31 january 2007. he and his lawyer were permitted to consult the file, but the parts classified as confidential were excluded. at the public hearing the applicant was given the opportunity to make his submissions and to state what he thought were the reasons for revoking his security clearance. he stated that he believed the information in question had been provided by a military intelligence service which had sought to take revenge on him for his refusal to accept a proposal to co-operate in a manner exceeding his statutory obligations. in a judgment of 1 september 2009 the court dismissed the application for judicial review. it observed that in a procedure revoking security clearance the relevant authority could only disclose reasons for revoking clearance that were based on non-classified documents and that as regards grounds based on classified documents it had to confine itself to referring to the relevant documents and their level of confidentiality. it found that the approach taken by the authority, which had not disclosed to the applicant the contents of the information on the basis of which the security clearance had been revoked, had not been illegal as disclosure of such information was prohibited by law. it added that the applicant’s rights had been sufficiently respected because the court had power to obtain knowledge of the classified information and assess whether it justified the decision taken by the authority. it observed that the risk in his regard concerned his conduct, which affected his credibility and his ability to keep information secret. the supreme administrative court added that disclosure of the classified information could have entailed the disclosure of the intelligence service’s working methods, the revelation of its information sources or the risk of influencing possible witnesses. accordingly, the reasons for the decision had to be limited to a reference to the documents on which it was based and the level of confidentiality of the information used. it went on to observe that, owing to the special nature of proceedings where classified information was concerned, not all the applicant’s procedural rights could be guaranteed but that the non-disclosure of the exact reasons underlying the decision to revoke security clearance was counterbalanced by the guarantee that the administrative courts had unlimited access to the classified documents. 77, contained specific, comprehensive and detailed information concerning the conduct and lifestyle of the applicant on the basis of which the court was satisfied in the present case as to its relevance for determining whether the applicant posed a national security risk. it observed, further, that the information did not in any way concern the applicant’s refusal to co-operate with the military intelligence service. on 25 october 2010 the applicant lodged a complaint with the constitutional court (ústavní soud), complaining of the unfairness of the proceedings. in a judgment of 18 november 2010 the court dismissed his complaint as manifestly ill-founded. it considered that in the present case the courts’ conduct had been duly justified and the reasoning in their decisions comprehensible and in conformity with the constitution; that they had not departed from procedural standards and constitutional rules to an inordinate degree; and that the constitutional court was not therefore required to intervene in their decision-making procedure. the applicant was indicted for participation in organised crime (účast na zločinném spolčení); aiding and abetting abuse of public power (pomoc k trestnému činu zneužívání pravomoci veřejného činitele); complicity in illegally influencing public tendering and public procurement procedures (pomoc k trestnému činu pletich při veřejné soutěži a veřejné dražbě); and aiding and abetting breaches of binding rules governing economic relations (pomoc k trestnému činu porušování závazných pravidel hospodářského styku). in a judgment of 25 march 2014 the české budějovice regional court (krajský soud) found the applicant guilty and sentenced him, inter alia, to three

the first applicant company, axel springer se, is a publishing house operated in the legal form of a societas europea registered in berlin. the second applicant company, rtl television gmbh, is a broadcasting company set up as a private limited company registered in cologne. on 14 june 2010 the defendant, s., then aged 28, was arrested. several german newspapers reported on the case. some published pictures of s., which mostly showed him at a much younger age. the public prosecutor’s office obtained a psychiatric expert opinion in october 2010. the expert concluded that s. was suffering from a schizoid personality disorder at the time when he had committed the offence. the trial against s. began on 11 january 2011 at the potsdam regional court. photographers working for the applicant companies attended the hearings to take still photographs and make video‑recordings of the defendant. the applicant companies submitted a copy of an email of a journalist who attended the hearing confirming the alleged statement of the presiding judge. the government contested the applicant companies’ assertions that the presiding judge had threatened not only to bar journalists from taking photographs during the proceedings against the defendant, but also from future proceedings before the potsdam regional court. the government submitted that according to the presiding judge no such statement had been made. s. repeated his confession on the first day of the hearing. by a letter of 12 january 2011 the second applicant company asked the president of the regional court to change the presiding judge’s oral order. it pointed out, inter alia, that several unpixelated pictures of s. had been published in different newspapers before. by a letter of the same date the president replied that he had forwarded the letter to the presiding judge for lack of competence. on 17 january 2011 the presiding judge supplemented his order and provided his reasons in writing. the only media representatives who were permitted to take photographs and make video-recordings of s. were those who had previously registered with the court and given an assurance that prior to the publication or forwarding of the material, the face of s. would be disguised by a technical process, for example by pixelisation, so that it would only be possible to use the images in such a form. journalists were barred from further reporting on the case if they failed to comply with the order. the presiding judge stated in his reasons that he had to balance the public interest in being informed and the personality rights of s. he acknowledged that the crime at issue was very different from “usual crimes” and that permitting only pictures that disguised s. impaired the public’s ability to be informed. however, he held that the order was justified in view of the need to protect the personality rights of s. he reasoned that it was unlikely that the case had caused a sensation throughout germany. no nationwide television channel besides the second applicant had shown any interest in reporting on it. he stressed the importance of the presumption of innocence, finding that reporting on s. in a way which identified him could have a “pillory effect”. furthermore, the order had already proved to be necessary as there had been individual violations of the judge’s instructions following the first day of the hearing. on 18 january 2011 the presiding judge sent the supplemented written order to a number of journalists, including some who worked for the applicant companies. on 4 february 2011 the presiding judge upheld the order. he held that the implications of the confession and its credibility could only be assessed at the end of the hearing. further hearings took place on 20 and 27 january 2011 and on 8 february 2011. on 10 february 2011 the regional court delivered its verdict, sentencing the defendant to prison on two counts of murder. on 1 february 2012 the federal constitutional court declined to consider a constitutional complaint by the applicant companies, without providing reasons (no.
the applicant was born in 1992 and lives in tbilisi. was stabbed several times in a secondary school playground. there were no eyewitnesses to the incident. one witness (“the witness”) stated that at the material time she had seen two young men fitting the description given by the applicant climb into the school playground swearing and leave after a while. later he was transported to a hospital where, after emergency surgery, his life was saved. on 14 november 2006 the applicant was arrested in view of t.t. she was subsequently remanded in custody on charges of attempted aggravated murder. a forensic chemical examination report no. on an unspecified date an initial forensic medical expert report no. ’s wounds had been inflicted with a sharp object and that taken together, they had been life-threatening. between 16 and 20 february 2007 the same forensic expert carried out an additional examination and issued report no. 998/31 (“the second nfb report”) at the applicant’s request. the expert confirmed that the second nfb report was therefore more accurate and six, rather than two, wounds had perforated t.t. during the trial at the tbilisi court of appeal, in accordance with article 364 § 1 of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 40 below), the defence adduced in evidence two alternative forensic reports, both issued on 2 november 2007, and argued that their results supported the applicant’s version of the events, including the use of two knives, and conclusively excluded the applicant’s guilt. the first report, of a comprehensive alternative forensic expert examination, was prepared by a panel of experts at a private forensic science centre. based on the [existing evidence and the victim’s statements] ... was the victim capable of showing resistance to g. kuparadze or otherwise defending himself ...? this was followed by a more detailed account and an assessment of the matter. would have experienced a sharp, strong pain at the moment of their infliction which would have triggered adequate self-defensive or other movements. the location of the wounds ... and the anatomical-physiological differences between the sexes ... it is hard to imagine how g. kuparadze could have inflicted the wounds on t.t. considering the nature and location of t.t. the statements of the applicant, the first mi report, the second nfb report, t.t. ’s statement, by holding his shoulder with one hand while he was initially kneeling and then crawling on the ground face-down, in view of the mechanism used to inflict the wounds [described in the forensic and forensic medical reports]? ’s body and [through his] clothes not with one but with two sharp objects, possibly knives, of different sizes, 2 and 4 centimetres wide [respectively]. it is possible ... that the ... wounds were inflicted by two different individuals (and accordingly with two different knives), as described in g. kuparadze’s statement.” concerning the applicant’s argument that the witness statement confirmed her version of the events, the court reasoned that although the witness had stated that she had seen two men climb in and out of the school playground, she had also said that that was a common sight at that school. in the subsequent part of the judgment the court of appeal referred to the first and the second mi reports and the second nfb report, among other evidence, while upholding the judgment of the first-instance court. 5, and instructed the relevant authority to separate the inmates accordingly. on 21 february 2009 the public defender of georgia visited the applicant in prison. in letters dated 6 march and 24 april 2009 addressed to the minister of corrections and legal assistance, the public defender expressed his concerns about the conditions of the applicant’s detention in prison no. on 16 june 2009 the tbilisi city court rejected the deferral request as manifestly ill-founded.
the applicant was born in 1967 and lives in rochefort, france. leaving their home with the two children. she claimed that she would return two days later. on 16 march 2010 the rochefort investigating judge issued an arrest warrant against c.b. on 5 july 2011 the poitiers court of appeal upheld the interim injunction issued by the rochefort tribunal de grande instance on 7 january 2009 on the above-mentioned points (see paragraph 12 above). on 23 december 2008 the vienna district court (“the district court) granted a request by c.b. according to which the applicant had threatened to kill her and had tried to abduct one of the children. on 6 april 2009 the district court, after hearing the applicant and c.b. on 18 november 2009 the applicant filed a request with the district court for enforcement of the return order. nor the children were present at the addresses known to the authorities’ representatives. was currently hiding in france with her children but would have to come back to vienna for work. ’s appeal against the district court’s enforcement order of 6 december 2009. contrary to the outcome of the main proceedings under the brussels iia regulation and the hague convention, the regional court therefore considered the obligation under article 11 (4) of the brussels iia regulation to be applicable in that the district court would have to ask the french authorities to use safeguards to ensure that the return of the children was in their best interests, such as not to return them to the applicant in person while the suspicion of abuse against him remained. on 20 october 2010 the supreme court rejected an extraordinary appeal on points of law by c.b. inform her of all the proceedings then pending in france. however, in her examination of the case r. did not hold a meeting between the children and the applicant as such an interaction would have very likely resulted in the children being further traumatised. referring to the case of neulinger and shuruk v. switzerland ([gc], no. on 1 october 2012 the district court dismissed the challenge for bias. on 7 may 2013 the regional court dismissed an appeal by the applicant against the district court’s decision of 13 august 2012 (see  paragraph 53 and 54 above), upholding its reasoning and adding that, due to the arrest warrant against c.b., the children would likely be put into foster care without their mother. however, the supreme court conceded that, given that the children had meanwhile adapted well to living in austria and their mental health had become stable, their well-being would be gravely put at risk if the return order was enforced without any safeguards. ’s mother was unwilling to stay temporarily with the children in france after their return and that, in any event, c.b. given that the children would probably be placed in a child protection institution in a (for them) foreign country and without any familiar caregivers around, there would be a severe risk of harm for them within the meaning of article 13 (b) of the hague convention if they were returned to france. ’s behaviour concerning the removal of the children from france in itself, but also with regard to her delaying tactics in the present proceedings, was unacceptable. would be granted safe conduct in order to be able to participate in the custody proceedings in france. in a letter of 6 february 2017 the district court stated that, to date, the applicant had not applied to the austrian courts for contact rights. regarding the aca’s requests for safeguards to secure the protection of the children, the fca pointed out at the beginning of the enforcement proceedings that there were no obstacles impeding the children’s return to their father as the competent french judge had already determined that their main residence was at his home; thus, the french youth welfare office would not be notified of the children’s return to france. would not risk immediate arrest if she entered france. the public prosecutor however noted that in any event c.b. during that time they would be cared for by their father or by the youth welfare office.

the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in murmansk. on 24 september 2004 the applicant was arrested on charges of robbery. two days later the polyarniy town court of the murmansk region imposed on the applicant an undertaking not to leave the place of his residence. on 21 february 2005 the town court, presided by judge d., convicted the applicant of robbery and forgery, sentenced him to seven years and four months of imprisonment and ordered his detention pending the appeal proceedings. on 3 may 2005 the murmansk regional court, under the presidency of judge k., quashed the judgment on appeal and remitted the case to the town court for a fresh examination, ordering that the applicant should remain in custody. on 3 june 2005 the town court, in its turn, further extended the applicant’s detention and remitted the case to the murmansk prosecutor’s office for the elimination of certain procedural deficiencies preventing the examination of the case on the merits. the applicant’s detention was once again extended by the town court, presided by judge d., on 16 august 2005. the applicant challenged the presiding judge on the ground that he had convicted him on 21 february 2005. the applicant also raised that point in his statement of appeal against the detention order. on 6 september 2005 the regional court, presided by judge k., found no grounds for judge d. to step down. the regional court reasoned that by virtue of articles 61 and 63 of the russian code of criminal procedure judge d., who had already presided over the applicant’s trial once, could not take part in the new trial proceedings, however, he was not prevented from deciding on detention matters. on 18 november 2005 the town court further extended the applicant’s detention. the parties disagreed as to whether the applicant had been served with a copy of that detention order. while the applicant argued that he had never received it, the government stated that the detention order had been served on him on 5 december 2005. they supported their claim with a copy of the town court’s letter of 29 november 2005 by which the detention order had been forwarded to the applicant and a copy of the detention order from his personal file kept in a remand prison, bearing the applicant’s signature and the date of receipt. on several occasions the trial court adjourned hearings in the applicant’s case. in particular, on 30 november 2005 the hearing was re-scheduled for 15 december 2005 because the applicant and his co-defendant asked to summon several defence witnesses. the hearing on 15 december 2005 was also adjourned owing to the applicant’s and his co-defendants’ counsel failure to appear. in the same decision the court, of its own motion, extended the applicant’s detention. the applicant appealed, complaining, in particular, that the detention order of 15 december 2005 was delivered in his counsel’s absence. on 17 january 2006 the regional court, presided by judge k., dismissed the appeal, having noted that the counsel had failed to appear without providing any explanation for his absence. the appeal hearing was attended by a prosecutor and the applicant’s counsel, but not by the applicant himself, despite his request to that effect. on 10 april 2006 the town court convicted the applicant of extortion and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment and a fine of 3,000 russian roubles (rub). the regional court upheld the conviction on 5 september 2006, but reduced the sentence.
the first applicant was born in 1971 and lives in leverkusen, germany. she is the daughter of the second and third applicants who were born in 1943 and 1942 respectively and lived in tambov, russia. the second applicant ms galina zabelina died in 2013. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. the brother of the first applicant and the son of the second and third applicants, was charged with large-scale fraud; his name was placed on the list of fugitives from justice. he was accused of embezzling the assets of the companies under his management. the wronged companies filed a claim for compensation in respect of pecuniary damage. on 12 may 2007 a senior operational officer from the federal security service sent a letter to the investigator in charge of p.z. ’s case to inform him that “according to the available information, the real estate property owned by [the first applicant] (four flats) and by [the second applicant] (one flat) had been purchased at the expense of their close relative p.z.” on 22 may 2007 the investigator asked the basmannyy district court in moscow to authorise attachment of the applicants’ property, including three flats owned by the first applicant, a flat owned by the second applicant, and a car owned by the third applicant. he referred to undisclosed sources allegedly confirming that all that property had been purchased by p.z. on 24 may 2007 the district court issued the requested writs of attachment. it observed that, “according to the information from the investigation”, p.z. had used the stolen money to purchase the property which he had registered in the name of his family members. it considered therefore necessary to attach the property which the district court described as being owned by p.z. the district court explained that the application for writs was to be granted because “it [had been] lodged in the framework of a criminal case by the competent official and with the prosecutor’s approval, it [was] well-reasoned and [complied] with the requirements of the code of criminal procedure”. they produced evidence showing that they had paid for the impugned property out of their pocket and that the link to p.z. was the investigator’s conjecture without basis in fact. they were not defendants in any criminal proceedings or respondents in any civil claim and there were no legal grounds for attaching their property. on 13 august 2007 the moscow city court rejected their appeals, stating that the district court had “carefully reviewed the materials enclosed with the investigator’s request and reached the justified conclusion that there were sufficient grounds for seizing” the listed property. the attachment of the applicants’ property has remained in place to date.
the applicant company, an editorial and publishing house registered in moscow, edits and publishes a national newspaper with a circulation of 500,000, the novaya gazeta (“the newspaper”). most of the crew died within minutes of the explosions. the chief military prosecutor’s office launched an official investigation into the accident under article 263 § 3 of the russian criminal code (a provision on “a breach of safety procedures while using a means of transportation which causes the death of two or more persons by negligence”) in case no. on 21 april 2004 the military court of the moscow garrison confirmed the decision of 22 july 2002. as the person who had written the note stating that twenty-three men had survived the explosions and had been waiting for rescue in the stern compartment. the note had been discovered in october 2000. the first article stated that after the kursk had sunk a series of knocks making an sos signal in morse code had been audible from the stern part of the submarine. his complaints had been rejected by the moscow garrison military court and the moscow circuit military court. the reports by those two military officials (v.k. is the chief forensic expert of the ministry of defence, s.k. is the chief navigating officer of the russian navy) were relied upon by the investigators, headed by a.e. who terminated the criminal case in relation to the kursk catastrophe and delivered a decision refusing to prosecute eleven officers of the northern fleet.” перспективы европейского суда по ‘делу “курска”‘ взволновали прокуратуру. the second article described state officials’ reaction to r.k. that his counsel had lodged the application exclusively for the purposes of self-promotion. there was no other prospect of success for the kursk case in russia, owing to the position adopted by v.u., apparently, those two officials took a decision to help the officers in command of the northern fleet escape criminal responsibility and to terminate the investigation. ( after the publication of the two articles, v.k., on 7 december 2005 the district court decided the case. the allegations that investigators and experts had tried to help the navy officers escape criminal responsibility had suggested that these officials had lacked the requisite impartiality when performing their duties. the applicants had failed to provide evidence that the claimants had committed a crime. to reimburse court fees, the applicant company was ordered to pay rub 85 and the second applicant was ordered to pay rub 15 to each claimant. in so far as relevant, the district court’s judgment read as follows:
“... assessing the impugned statements, the court considers that they contain affirmations that v.k., and investigators of the chief military prosecutor’s office broke the russian law which was in force and committed an abuse of public office, and that such statements tarnish the honour, dignity and business reputation of v.k., under article 17 of the constitution, freedom of thought and expression, as well as the right to protect one’s honour and good name, are recognised and guaranteed ... at the same time, the realisation of the rights and freedoms of an individual and citizen should not breach the rights and freedoms of other citizens. the applicants appealed, arguing in particular that the information contained in the impugned articles amounted to value judgments, and that the articles had reflected the opinions of r.k. opinions expressed in the former’s application to the court and the latter’s book. the applicants also unsuccessfully applied for supervisory review. on 3 may 2006 the bailiffs’ service received the writs and commenced enforcement proceedings. on 27 june 2006 the bailiffs’ service terminated the enforcement proceedings against the applicant company in respect of the retraction.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in nizhniy novgorod. the newspaper was published and distributed mainly in the nizhniy novgorod region. in early 2004 the applicant obtained two articles from the website chechenpress. it is still not too late for us to resolve all the questions at issue. but for this, the people of russia should get rid of those for whom peace represents the loss of power or perhaps even a trial. this address was made on the eve of the presidential elections in russia. the second article, which had the headline “address by maskhadov, president of the chechen republic ichkeria, to the european parliament” («обращение президента чеченской республики ичкерия масхадова к европарламенту» – “the second article”), was published by the applicant in issue no. the last tsarist deportation was the expulsion of many chechen families to cold and faraway siberia in 1913. what is the aim of this historical overview? its inexorable millstones are grinding the gene pool of the unique and original chechen people, one of the indigenous nations of the ancient caucasus, and this in the end may lead to [the chechens’] total physical disappearance from the face of the earth. an example of this is the treacherous and cowardly terrorist attack by russia’s special services in the state of qatar, which prematurely took the life of my predecessor, zelimkhan yandarbiyev, and was carried out with the use of diplomatic channels. i sincerely believe in the triumph of reason and justice on earth, and in the final victory of the chechen people. the chechen resistance will inevitably accomplish it! he added that he had intended to convey to the readers the position of the leaders of one of the parties to the military conflict in the chechen republic as he had considered that, in the light of the continuing tragedy in the northern caucasus and terrorist threat, citizens should be entitled to have an idea of that position first hand rather than having the situation presented to them by russia’s mass media, which only reflected the point of view of the authorities of russia. the applicant was questioned on several occasions as a witness. in a witness interview on 25 april 2005 the applicant stated, inter alia, that he had published the two articles as he had considered the material to be of great public significance and had intended to apprise readers in the nizhniy novgorod region of them. he also stated that he had taken the decision to publish the articles, without being asked by anyone. lastly, he denied that he had obtained any payment for publishing the articles. during subsequent interviews the applicant consistently maintained his position. the decision referred to the statements the applicant had made during witness interviews to the effect that he had obtained the impugned documents from a website and published them with a view to apprising readers in the nizhniy novgorod region of them. by a decision of 26 september 2005 the investigator in charge refused a request by the applicant for a comprehensive expert examination of the articles involving linguistic experts and historians including the history, culture and traditions of the chechen people. in a report on the linguistic expert examination of the first article, she pointed out that the text contained statements in the affirmative to the effect that “the tragedy in the dubrovka [theatre] and the war in chechnya [were] beneficial for vladimir putin”, that “the cessation of war and a peace agreement with the leaders of the [chechen republic of ichkeria meant] the loss of power for v. putin”, and that “until v. putin [guided] the state, blood [would] continue to flow in chechnya and russia”. according to the report, that statement, analysed in the context of the whole article, contained a demand by the author to the people of russia not to vote for vladimir putin in march 2004. the report provided no further details in respect of that conclusion. the report stated that in all those statements the author of the article was directly pointing out that it was russia and its invaders, military and political authorities, special services and state party who were carrying out “genocide”, “unmotivated mass murders, extrajudicial executions, groundless detentions, severe ‘clear-up’ operations, tortures, kidnappings, disappearances and ‘residential’ checks”, and that it was they who were “committing excesses”. at a hearing, the applicant denied the charges. the applicant also insisted that ms t. had exceeded her competence as she had given a legal qualification to his actions. the district court found that the applicant’s guilt had been proven “by witness statements and the case material, [in particular] by the conclusions of the forensic expert examinations, according to which the texts [of the impugned articles contained] no appeals to extremist activity, but [contained] statements aimed at inciting racial, ethnic or social discord, associated with violence”. on 9 february 2006 the applicant applied to the district court to have the trial record amended. by a letter of 21 february 2006, judge b. returned the applicant’s supplementary pleadings, stating that, in substance, they reflected his remarks in respect of the trial record, which had already been examined and rejected on 13 february 2006.
the applicant was born in 1980 and lived in st petersburg until her arrest. she remained in detention throughout the ensuing investigation and trial. on 28 march 2013 the krasnogvardeiyskiy district court of st petersburg found her guilty and sentenced her to one year in prison. regard being had to her previous convictions for similar offences, the applicant was ordered to spend four years and one month in a correctional colony. at the time of her arrest the applicant suffered from hiv and chronic hepatitis c. 11. she underwent a routine medical examination by a general practitioner on admission to her remand prison. she had the necessary treatment for hiv and other illnesses in the correctional colony. she was examined by various doctors, including a gynaecologist. she consulted the latter on 6 and 22 may 2013 on account of a vaginal infection. a gynaecologist tested her for sexually transmitted diseases and prescribed treatment with hormones and painkillers. six days later the doctor examined her again and suggested that she might have developed cervical cancer and needed to go to hospital for an in‑depth examination. the doctor talked to her, insisting that she urgently needed to be admitted to hospital, but she refused. a cervical smear test was carried out next day. it appears that it was not licensed to provide healthcare services, although certain services for cancer patients were provided by st petersburg city cancer hospital under a special agreement (see paragraph 42 below). the applicant had a histological examination two days later, which confirmed cervical cancer. on 22 september 2015 the custodial authorities asked a gynaecological cancer specialist to examine the applicant. the doctor noted that her cancer had progressed to such an advanced stage that it could not be cured by surgery. the applicant suffered from “unbearable pain” which ordinary painkillers could not alleviate. in november 2015 the head of the prison hospital applied for the applicant’s early release on medical grounds. at a hearing on 25 november 2015 before the smolninskiy district court of st petersburg, the applicant’s doctor supported the application, stating that she was very ill, was in constant, severe pain, and that the prison hospital had no drugs to treat her. the drugs accessible in detention were unable to relieve the pain. the court dismissed the application, finding that the treatment she would receive in the prison hospital was similar to what she would get in a civilian one. she complained of a lack of medical care in detention, including an absence of effective painkillers. following the court’s decision on interim measures the authorities continued treating the applicant in the prison hospital, which mostly consisted of treating her symptoms. the applicant’s condition deteriorated rapidly. she complained of constant pain and asked to consult a psychiatrist. on 16 march 2016 the prison psychiatrist prescribed her sedatives. on 25 march 2016 the applicant was examined by a cancer specialist. he recorded that “additional prescriptions” were necessary to address the applicant’s severe and increasing pain. it does not appear that any changes in the pain relief therapy were made.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in bor. the applicant was employed by the bank called borska banka ad, (“the debtor”). it would appear that at the relevant time the debtor was predominantly comprised of socially-owned capital. on 13 february 2004 the zaječar commercial court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor. on 8 february 2005, upon a submission to that effect, the zaječar commercial court recognised the applicant’s claims concerning salary arrears. on an unspecified date the applicant was paid 8,533 serbian dinars (rsd) on account of the debt in question. the remainder of the debt has not been paid until the present day. the insolvency proceedings are still pending. on 14 december 2006 the applicant applied to the zaječar commercial court for enforcement of the court’s decision of 8 february 2005, by which the applicant’s claims were recognised. the zaječar commercial court, however, declined its jurisdiction ratione materiae and transferred the case file to the bor municipal court. on 7 may 2007 the bor municipal court dismissed the applicant’s enforcement request. in its reasoning, the court stated that the commercial court’s decision of 8 february 2005 was not suitable for execution. on 23 november 2007 the zaječar district court upheld the first instance court’s decision, stating that the debtor had been subject to the pending insolvency proceedings. on 18 march 2008 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal against the zaječar district court’s decision. on 4 november 2010 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s constitutional appeal. it found that the applicant had failed to properly seize the constitutional court, having lodged her appeal against “the wrong” decision.

“in so far as the prosecutor’s office and the injured party argued that the [county court] should have examined the award of damages on its own initiative because the injured party was a minor, it is to be observed from the content of the decision under review that both the prosecutor’s office and the injured party had expressly limited their appeals to the criminal aspects of the case. the court of appeal rendered its final decision on 1 november 2012 and rectified the text of the operative part on 22 november 2012.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in minneapolis, minnesota, usa. on 28 august 2009 their son, m., was born there. on 10 may 2010 s. obtained permanent resident status in the usa. in june 2011 the family arrived in ukraine for a holiday and to visit s.’s relatives. on 13 july 2011 the applicant returned alone to the usa. in may 2012 s.’s us permanent resident card expired. in july 2012 the applicant spent a holiday in ukraine with s. and m. 14. the applicant submitted that he had expected s. and m. to return from ukraine to the usa on 16 august 2011; however, s. changed her plans and decided to stay on with m. in ukraine after that date. during the hearings the applicant stated that he was prepared to cover travel expenses for both the child and the mother if the latter were to be ordered to accompany the child to the usa. s. objected and submitted that it was the applicant who had asked her to stay in ukraine with the child beyond 16 august 2011. in july 2012, despite the divorce action initiated by the applicant in the usa, s. agreed to spend a holiday with him and their son in ukraine, trying to restore good relations. she further submitted that the applicant had arrived in ukraine in 2013 and stayed for a considerable period of time but had not attempted to meet up with the child. s. therefore alleged that there was no factual child abduction or unlawful retention which would necessitate a return order under the hague convention. no exceptions under the hague convention applied. in the operative part of the decision, the court ordered that m. should be returned to the usa ‒ to the father’s home address in minneapolis ‒ specifying that the child should be accompanied on the journey by both parents. on 2 july 2013 the desnyansky district court issued an additional decision stating that if the child were not returned voluntarily, s. would be ordered to transfer the child to the applicant at his home address in minneapolis. on 14 august 2013 the chernihiv regional court of appeal (“the court of appeal”) quashed the decisions of 19 june and 2 july 2013 (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above) and dismissed the applicant’s claim as unsubstantiated. m. had always lived with the mother and there were close ties between them. on the same date s.’s lawyer contacted the usa embassy in kyiv and enquired about applying for a usa visa in the specific circumstances. in february 2014 s. submitted a request to the supreme court for review of the case on the grounds that the hague convention had been applied divergently in the cassation proceedings, resulting in inconsistent judicial practice. on 28 april 2014 the cassation court declared the request admissible and referred the case to the supreme court. on 18 june 2014 the supreme court considered s.’s request for review of the cassation court’s decision of 20 november 2013 (see paragraph 25 above) on the grounds of divergent application of the law by the cassation courts. having examined the domestic judicial practice, the supreme court found that articles 3, 12 and 13 of the hague convention (see paragraph 37 below) had been applied divergently. it set out the principles which had to be followed when interpreting and applying those provisions. the case was remitted to the court of appeal. as regards the period commencing on 20 june 2012, the court of appeal considered that the applicant had continued to consent to the child’s retention in ukraine as there was no express objection on that point before the request was made under the hague convention. the court of appeal found that on 20 june 2012 the applicant’s divorce claim was delivered to s.’s representative. in that claim the applicant also sought to establish sole custody of the child; however, that claim did not mean that the applicant disagreed with the child’s ongoing stay in ukraine. moreover, in july 2012, the applicant had spent a holiday with s. and m. in ukraine and in august 2012, after his return to the usa, he had sent m.’s vaccination certificate in order to facilitate m.’s admission to a child-care centre in ukraine. based on the evidence presented and having regard to the overall period during which the child had lived in ukraine, the court of appeal found that m. was entirely settled in his current environment.

in a dispute between the applicant and the domestic pension authorities, on 18 february 2011 the kryviy rih dovgyntsivskyy district court ruled in his favour, ordering an increase of his pension based on the rise in the average wages in the country since his retirement. on 3 november 2011 the first-instance court amended the judgment at the applicant’s request, indicating that it was enforceable immediately. in doing so, the court referred to the provision of the code of administrative justice governing abridged procedure (see paragraph 11 below). the defendant pension authority appealed to the dnipropetrovsk administrative court of appeal (“the court of appeal”). on 23 november 2011 the first-instance court informed the applicant that an appeal had been lodged in his case. on 29 february 2012 he wrote to the court of appeal, requesting to be informed about the date of the hearing of his case. according to him, he received no response and no further information about the proceedings until 22 february 2013 when he received the court of appeal’s final decision, dated 26 june 2012, quashing the first-instance court’s judgment. it can be seen from the material before the court that the applicant’s domestic case file contains copies of the ruling of the court of appeal’s judge (date illegible) opening appeal proceedings in his case and a notification letter dated february 2012 from the court clerk informing him of the upcoming examination of his case in camera on 26 june 2012 and stating that the judge’s ruling and a copy of the appeal were enclosed with the letter. the government alleged that the above documents had been sent to the applicant, while the applicant alleged that they had not. the file does not contain any postal documents or registers of sent correspondence showing that the above documents had been sent or delivered to the applicant. on 26 june 2012 the court of appeal, in a final decision not amenable to appeal, quashed the first-instance court’s judgment, dismissing the applicant’s claim for a pension increase and holding that the domestic law did not require the pensions to be increased in case of rise in the average wages in the country following retirement.

the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in budapest. on 14 april 2010 the applicant notified the police that he planned to organise a demonstration from 2 to 7 p.m. on 17 april 2010 in front of the venyige street prison in budapest, in order to draw attention to the “situation of political prisoners”. venyige street is a broad cul-de-sac with a service lane. on 16 april 2010 the head of the budapest police department banned the demonstration on the grounds that traffic could not be diverted to alternative routes (section 8(1) of the assembly act). in the decision, he referred to article 21 of the international covenant on civil and political rights, article 11 of the convention and decision no. on 19 april 2010, within the statutory time-limit, the applicant sought a judicial review of the decision. on 22 april 2010 the budapest regional court dismissed the applicant’s case. it noted that in assessing whether or not traffic could be diverted to other routes, the authority had reckoned on the participation of some 200 demonstrators, as per the applicant’s notification, and that – after having obtained the opinion of a traffic expert – it had established that lawful parking and traffic circulation in the neighbourhood would become impossible should the event take place. the court agreed with the police’s decision in that although the right to assembly was a constitutional fundamental right, it was not absolute and must not give rise to a violation of the fundamental rights of others, and could therefore be restricted. the court was satisfied that the decision had been lawful as the police had adequately established the facts, complied with the procedural rules and applied clear assessment criteria, and the assessment of the evidence had been logical.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in donji kraljevec. on 15 october 2001 the applicant brought a civil action against a private person in the čakovec municipal court (općinski sud u čakovcu) seeking that a contract for lifelong maintenance (ugovor o doživotnom uzdržavanju) be declared null and void, that certain entries in the land register be altered, and that certain property be included in his deceased father’s estate. at the first hearing of the trial, the applicant indicated the value of the claim at 101,000 croatian kunas (hrk). on 4 february 2005 the čakovec municipal court declared the applicant’s action inadmissible. the applicant lodged an appeal against the first-instance decision. on 12 may 2005 the čakovec county court (županijski sud u čakovcu) dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance decision. the applicant then lodged an appeal on points of law (revizija) with the supreme court. on 19 april 2006 the supreme court accepted the applicant’s appeal on points of law, examined it on the merits and quashed the decisions of the lower courts and ordered a fresh consideration of the case. on 17 february 2009, in the fresh proceedings, the first-instance court gave judgment in the applicant’s favour. lodged an appeal and on 10 june 2010 the čakovec county court reversed the first-instance judgment. the applicant then lodged an appeal on points of law. on 21 september 2011 the supreme court declared the applicant’s appeal on points of law inadmissible ratione valoris because it fell below the threshold of 100,000 croatian kunas, given that the applicant’s civil action had included three separate claims lodged on different factual and legal bases – therefore, the amount of the claim had to be divided into three. the supreme court did not provide any reasoning as to why it had accepted as admissible the applicant’s previous appeal on points of law and decided on the merits. a constitutional complaint subsequently lodged by the applicant was declared inadmissible by the constitutional court on 12 january 2012.
the applicant company was a ukrainian joint-stock company registered in kyiv. at the relevant time it operated a commercial air carrier business (see east west alliance limited v. ukraine, no. on 12 march 2003 the applicant company brought a claim for damages, in particular loss of profit, against the state aviation safety department. the claim was based on a delay on the defendant’s part in issuing a safety certificate, which the department had been required to issue in 2001 by a court judgment. on 16 august 2005 the kyiv city commercial court allowed the claim in part. on 18 october 2005 the kyiv commercial court of appeal quashed the first-instance court’s judgment and rejected the claim, mainly on the grounds that the applicant company had failed to prove the loss of profit it had claimed. it considered the estimates of the loss profit speculative. on 21 february 2006 the higher commercial court reversed the ruling of the court of appeal and upheld the judgment of the first instance court. the higher court held that because the defendant’s inaction prevented the applicant company from operating its business as from 2001, the first instance court was correct in accepting the information about the applicant company’s gross income for 1999 and 2000. on 6 june 2006 the supreme court quashed the ruling of the higher commercial court and upheld the ruling of the court of appeal. the supreme court considered that no causal connection has been proven between the defendant’s culpable inaction and the alleged loss of profit. it held, in particular, that the applicant company had failed to prove that it had realised a profit, rather than gross income, prior to 2001, or that its income for the preceding years came from operations which required a safety certificate. following communication of the case and unsuccessful friendly settlement negotiations, on 2 september 2014 the government informed the court of their intention to resolve the issue raised by the application. they produced a unilateral declaration, in which they acknowledged a breach of article 6 § 1 of the convention and offered to pay the applicant company a sum to cover any pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage together with any costs and expenses. the government requested that the court strike out the application in accordance with article 37 § 1 of the convention. on 7 november 2014 the applicant company objected to the striking out of its application, wishing to have its merits determined with a view to obtaining appropriate redress. it argued, in particular, that under domestic law the unilateral declaration, unlike a court’s judgment finding a violation, would not provide grounds for reexamination of its case by the supreme court. the government’s unilateral declaration would therefore not lead to actual restoration of the applicant company’s rights. the government were invited to comment and on 10 july 2015 informed the court of the relevant domestic legislation (see paragraphs 15 and 16 below). they submitted a letter from the supreme court informing the government agent there was no relevant domestic case‑law on the matter. on 3 november 2015 the applicant company’s only shareholder, east/west, informed the court that on 2 october 2014 the kyiv city commercial court had declared the applicant company bankrupt and opened liquidation procedure and on 8 october 2015 had declared it liquidated. accordingly, east/west requested that any just satisfaction award due to the applicant company be paid to east/west. asked to comment, the government responded on 18 january 2016 that they “do not object against the applicant’s request as to the payment to its sole shareholder the awarded compensation and, thus, leave this question on the court’s discretion”.
