the applicant is a journalist for dn.no, a norwegian internet-based version of the newspaper dagens næringsliv (“dn”), published by the company dn nye medier as. on 23 june 2010 mr x was indicted for market manipulation and insider trading under the 1997 act on the trade of financial assets (verdipapirhandelloven). on the same day, a new article on the topic was published in dn. the applicant was questioned by the police on 19 june 2008. they informed her that mr x had told the police that he had given her the letter. the prosecutor requested that the court impose on the applicant an order to testify. the prosecutor further justified the obligation of the witness to make a statement and argued that undoubtedly in this case it was desirable to hear her explanation, even if the prosecuting authority found the case adequately disclosed (fullgodt opplyst) without her statement. the press was sometimes abused by investors to take actions liable to affect the share price. as to the scope of that duty, the city court held:
“the obligation to make a statement is, however, limited to the contact with the defendant as a source and not her communication with possible other unknown sources with whom she has been in contact and who may be protected by the protection of sources.” the court held that the witness had an obligation to explain about her contact with the accused since he, as the source of the dn.no article, was known and the court ruled accordingly. no motion for extension was made (pending a final decision) as according to the prosecutor the case was sufficiently disclosed (tilstrekkelig opplyst) even without the statement by [the applicant] and this was used as a basis by the court.” on 28 march 2011 mr x appealed to the borgarting high court (lagmannsrett) against the city court’s assessment of the evidence and application of the law in relation to the issue of guilt, its procedure and the sentence (see paragraphs 34-36 below). it rejected the appeal by a decision of 28 april 2011, finding it generally decisive whether the source was known. however, the wording could not be given decisive weight. it emerged from the preparatory work that the legislature had not, with the chosen formulation, taken a stance on the issue at stake in the present case. should the recipient of the information then refuse to give evidence, this would normally appear futile. 1995 page 1166 and 2003 page 28), the majority held that this provision did not apply when the source had come forward and had confirmed his or her role. however, these considerations did not apply where the source had confirmed his or her participation. against this background, one could safely assume that no violation of the convention would arise where a source had come forward and the obligation of the witness to give evidence had been expressly limited so as not to include questions that might lead to other sources being revealed. the minority observed that, should the applicant be ordered to testify concerning her possible contact with mr x about attorney y’s letter of 24 august 2007 to the trustee company, she would have to confirm or deny that mr x was the source for her article on dn.no on 25 august 2007. the legal question at hand was whether a journalist might rely on source protection if the source, without the journalist having revealed it, could be identified with more or less certainty by other evidence. if journalists were allowed to protect their sources, they would obtain information enabling them to uncover matters in society that were worthy of criticism more easily than they would otherwise. if the journalist was willing to reveal the source, the source could not prevent it. a situation where someone claimed to be the source ought to be considered in the same way as where the source consented to disclosure of his or her identity. as mentioned above, it was not the source, but society’s interest in free communication of news and opinions, which was to be protected. other persons who have acquired knowledge of the author or the source through their work for the publishers, editors, press agency or printers in question have the same right as the editor. in 2011 the un human rights committee adopted general comment no. on 8 september 2015 the special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression submitted a report to the un general assembly (a/70/361), which stated, inter alia (footnotes omitted):
“c. nature and scope of protection 21. such situations should be limited to investigations of the most serious crimes or the protection of the life of other individuals. r (2000) 7 on the right of journalists not to disclose their sources of information, adopted by the committee of ministers of the council of europe on 8 march 2000.
the applicant was born in 1940 and lives in odesa. in march 2001 the owner of company y. changed. under that contract, company v. could use the office space in question from 12 january 1999 to 12 january 2020 without any payment, but in exchange for certain services for company y. 8. in june 2001 company v. brought commercial proceedings against company y. seeking compliance with the lease contract. company y., in turn, lodged a counter-claim seeking invalidation of that contract. it was concluded that “there [was] no subject matter of the dispute”, given that the impugned contract failed to stipulate basic terms inherent in a lease contract and could not therefore be regarded as a lease contract. on 3 october 2001 a criminal case was opened in respect of suspected forgery of the lease contract of 12 january 1999, without being targeted against any particular persons. on 8 october 2001 the odesa prymorskyy district prosecutor’s office (“the prymorskyy prosecutor’s office”) issued a warrant for seizure of fifteen documents relevant for the investigation, such as the original of the lease contract itself, related correspondence and several statements of acceptance of the services indicated in the contract (see paragraph 7 above). the seizure was to be carried out in company v.’s office. on 11 october 2001 the seizure took place in the applicant’s flat, in the presence of his wife. it appears that the applicant was not present. eleven of the fifteen documents listed in the warrant were seized. the seizure report did not contain any information as to whether it had been handed to any person occupying the premises. the applicant did not specify in the domestic proceedings, or in the present proceedings, how the seizure of the documents had taken place. on 15 october 2001 the seizure warrant of 8 october 2001 was served on the applicant. on 22 october 2001 the investigator decided that a forensic expert examination of the signatures on the contract of 12 january 1999 was required in order to establish their real date. that decision was not amenable to appeal. on the following day the search took place in the applicant’s flat in his presence and resulted in a seizure of eleven documents. on 9 january 2002 the above seizure warrant was served on the applicant. although a forensic expert examination had established that the signatures on the impugned contract had been antedated (namely, it was established that they had been made no earlier than in february 2001), the official approval of the technical methods used by the expert was previewed only for the autumn of 2002. on 1 september 2002 the applicant resumed his duties in company v. 22. on 28 august 2002 the applicant brought proceedings against the prymorskyy prosecutor’s office claiming compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage allegedly caused by its unlawful actions. the applicant based his lawsuit on the fact that the criminal proceedings had been terminated, without raising any specific complaints about the search and seizures. on 9 december 2002 the prymorskyy court rejected the applicant’s claim as unfounded. the case file does not contain a copy of that decision. he further submitted that, in ordering the seizure of documents, no differentiation had been made between the company’s premises and his home. the applicant maintained that the first-instance court had left those matters without consideration. on 11 september 2003 the odesa regional court of appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal. as regards his complaint about the court’s failure to assess all the circumstances of the case, the appellate court dismissed it as ungrounded. on 3 february 2006 the supreme court upheld the lower courts’ decisions.
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in smědčice. on 9 november 2006 the applicant requested a building permit for temporary stables for horses. on 6 january 2011 the rokycany planning office (stavební úřad) dismissed his request and on 26 may 2011 the plzeň regional office (krajský úřad) upheld that decision. on 29 march 2013 the plzeň regional court (krajský soud) dismissed a complaint lodged by the applicant against the decision of the plzeň regional office. on 31 july 2013 the supreme administrative court (nejvyšší správní soud) dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant. the decision was served on the applicant on 28 august 2013. on 29 october 2013 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint (ústavní stížnost). on 31 march 2014 the constitutional court (ústavní soud) rejected the applicant’s appeal as being lodged out of time. it held that as the supreme administrative court’s decision had been served on him on 28 august 2013, the last day of the two-month time-limit for lodging a constitutional appeal was 28 october 2013. on 8 april 2014 the applicant wrote to the constitutional court urging it to set aside its decision. he argued that as 28 october 2013 had been a national holiday, domestic procedural rules provided that the last day for lodging his appeal had been the following day, namely 29 october 2013. by a letter of 11 april 2014 the registrar (generální sekretář) of the constitutional court acknowledged that the judge-rapporteur had undoubtedly overlooked the fact that the time-limit had been complied with. however, as the constitutional court did not have the power to set aside its own decision, he advised the applicant to lodge an application with the european court of human rights.
the applicant was born in 1967 and lives in kyiv. at the time of the events he was the director of a private company. in august 2002 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion of tax evasion and forgery in office. subsequently, the tax-evasion charge was dropped. on 7 december 2004 the kyiv dniprovskyy district court (“the dniprovskyy court”) found the applicant guilty of forgery in office. it held that he had entered knowingly false data in the company’s tax returns. more specifically, instead of applying a straight-line depreciation method in respect of the company’s intangible assets, the applicant calculated their depreciation costs as the difference between the company’s gross revenues and expenses. as a result, the documents showed the absence of any profit or loss in the company’s activity, whereas in the reality it had had losses. the applicant was sentenced to one year’s restriction of liberty (namely detention in a semi-open penal institution by the place of his residence) with a ban on holding administrative posts for one year. the sentence was suspended on probation for one year. the applicant was under an undertaking not to leave the town until the judgment became final. he submitted that the activity of the company had been subject to numerous tax inspections, which had not found any violations of the tax legislation. he therefore contended that he had not done anything criminal and that that fact had not received due attention of the first-instance court. furthermore, the applicant considered that the expert questioned in the trial did not have adequate qualification. lastly, he argued that the tax police investigator, who had also been questioned, was not impartial and that his statements should not have been relied on. accordingly, the applicant requested the appellate court to quash the first‑instance court’s judgment and to pronounce a new one, acquitting him for the lack of the constituent elements of a crime in his actions. on 10 february 2005 the dniprovskyy court sent a letter to the kyiv city court of appeal (“the court of appeal”) stating as follows:
“the [dniprovskyy court] is sending you the criminal case regarding [the applicant] convicted under article 366 § 1 of the criminal code of ukraine [forgery in office], for the appellate examination at 10.35 a.m. on 17 march 2005.” in addition to the president of the court of appeal, the above letter was also addressed to the prosecutor, the applicant and his lawyer. there is no evidence in the case file as to whether the applicant and/or his lawyer received it. according to the applicant, they were unaware of its existence. on 17 march 2005, following a hearing held with the prosecutor’s participation, but in the absence of both the applicant and his lawyer, the appellate court rejected the applicant’s appeal. it delivered its ruling “having heard the report of the judge-rapporteur of the appellate court and the explanations of the prosecutor, the latter considering the judgment lawful and [the applicant’s] appeal groundless, having checked the case-file materials and having discussed the arguments advanced in the appeal”. the issue of the applicant’s and his lawyer’s absence from the hearing was not mentioned in the appellate court’s ruling. the applicant appealed on points of law, challenging, among other things, the examination of his case on appeal in his and his lawyer’s absence as being in breach of his defence rights. on 23 january 2007 the supreme court, in written proceedings, upheld the decisions of the lower courts. referring to the case-file materials, it noted that the first-instance court had informed the applicant and his lawyer about the scheduled appellate hearing, without further details.
the applicant was born in 1967 and lives in staro oryahovo. the applicant was driving his car along a road in the region of varna on the evening of 10 march 2014. they signalled for him to pull over, but instead of complying he sped away. he only stopped when his car reached a field and could not go further. the parties have presented differing accounts of the circumstances in which the applicant was arrested. the applicant fell on his back and then three officers continued to kick him. according to the police officers, the applicant had jumped out of his car after it had come to a halt and had started running through the field in an attempt to escape. according to written statements made during the criminal proceedings by several police officers present at the police station when the applicant was taken there, he told everyone present at the time that his clothes were muddy because he had tripped and fallen, which was also why he had a limp. the records indicate that the officers released the applicant immediately after checking his papers. according to a written statement made on 11 march 2014 by the applicant’s brother to the police in the context of an official follow-up conducted into the events, on leaving the station, he asked him what had happened but the applicant stated that he did not wish to speak about it and preferred to be left alone in his home. the certificate stated that no other traumatic injuries were present. a different police officer was sent to the local medical centre. the report indicated that in a conversation with the applicant conducted during that visit, the latter had told the officer that he could not remember the events in detail, but that he was certain that after the car chase two police officers had beaten and then handcuffed him before taking him to the police station. on the same day the applicant’s brother also gave a written statement to the police (see paragraph 11 above). the two police officers involved in the car chase and the arrest also gave written statements on 11 march 2014. in addition to the description above (see paragraph 9), the officers stated that once the applicant had been handcuffed and put inside the police car, he had leaned on one of them and moaned. when asked if he had a problem and wished to be taken to a medical centre, he had refused and said, “it’s nothing”. at the police station the applicant had refused to be tested for alcohol or to sign the arrest report. a number of investigative steps were carried out. the brother and his friend stated that the applicant had not told them anything about the circumstances of his arrest and that the brother had learned that the applicant had been beaten by the police from the doctors at the hospital. a forensic medical expert was appointed on 30 may 2014 to establish the nature of the injuries sustained by the applicant and the type of instrument used. the expert was given a list of specific questions that needed to be answered. in a decree of 31 october 2014 for terminating the criminal proceedings, the prosecution established that the version of events given by the applicant at different stages of his questioning were not consistent. in particular, he had stated initially that he had sprained his ankle after tripping and falling, but had later changed his story and said that the injury had been the result of an intentional and prolonged beating by police officers. when interviewed again on 28 may 2014, he had asserted that the officers had brutally pulled him out of the car and had thereafter only kicked him rather than hit him. in addition, when on 6 october 2014 the investigator had handed the investigation file over to the applicant, he had signed the related acknowledgement, indicating that he did not wish to acquaint himself with the evidence, read the documents in the file, which was voluminous, and that he had no requests, comments or objections to the investigation. the prosecutor concluded in the decree for termination of the proceedings that the applicant’s complaints were not supported by the evidence. the officers had worn police uniforms that had been clearly visible and identifiable and had been driving a police car with flashing police lights and a siren while chasing the applicant. he had not only refused to stop but had actively avoided being caught. the second-instance court, the varna regional court, upheld those findings in a final decision on 9 january 2015.
the applicant was born in 1983 and is currently in detention in rzeszów. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. he was later held in several other detention facilities. on 4 august 2010 the lublin regional court convicted the applicant of murder, rape, assault, robbery, fraud and handling stolen goods. on 14 september 2009 the chełm prison penitentiary commission (“the commission”) classified the applicant as a “dangerous detainee”. the commission made its decision after a request from the governor of chełm prison, which stated that the applicant had beaten another prisoner at the lublin detention centre in 2002 (this event was not a subject matter of the above criminal proceedings). additionally, the applicant had apparently behaved in an aggressive and unpredictable manner by, in particular, threatening prison guards, refusing to accept meals and trying to self-harm. the reasoning of all these decisions was similar and read as follows:
“the commission, having noted the proposals made by the head of the protection division (kierownik działu ochrony) and the head of the penitentiary division (kierownik działu penitencjarnego) and having heard the applicant held, in his presence, that the reasons justifying his classification as a dangerous detainee have not ceased to exist. it also made reference to the request for an extension of the regime made by the director of the remand centre, according to which the applicant had destroyed some objects in the penitentiary unit and had behaved in an aggressive and unpredictable manner. the dangerous detainee regime was further extended on 22 may 2013. on 2 september 2013 the lublin regional court upheld the commission’s decision, holding that it had been given in accordance with the law. the applicant appealed, but the latter decision was upheld by the lublin regional court on 30 december 2013. he had also broken a support of his bed and used vulgar language. he had committed a further unspecified disciplinary offence on 21 june 2013. the regime was applied to the applicant for four years and almost five months. the applicant was detained in several detention facilities - chełm prison, radom remand centre, lublin remand centre and potulice prison. the cells, in which the applicant was kept, including the sanitary facilities, were constantly monitored via closed-circuit television. he was subjected to a strip search every time he left or entered his cell, which in practice meant that he had to strip naked in front of prison officers and bend over in order to enable the examination of his anus. the applicant had to wear handcuffs whenever he was outside his cell, including for appearances in court. the windows were covered by a plastic blind which limited access to daylight and fresh air in the cells. in chełm and potulice prisons the cells were equipped with a sanitary facility which was partially separated from the rest of the cell. in the cell he had no access to hot running water. the applicant submitted that he had had the boiler for six months and that it had then been taken away. he was allowed to have a shower once a week. he lodged a complaint about this with the lublin regional inspectorate of the prison service. he had access to press publications and could use the library. after the dangerous detainee regime was lifted, the applicant refused to participate in any sports and cultural activities because his cell was equipped with a television and a computer game console. on 20 march 2013 the applicant was transferred to potulice prison. the shackles consisted of handcuffs and fetters joined by chains. the government submitted that outside his cell and within the prison the applicant only had to wear handcuffs.
the applicant was born in 1961 and lives in rīga. internal and external audits were carried out and it was discovered that certain data in the company’s cash registers had been manipulated. it was later established that the data had been manipulated in order to conceal illicit cash withdrawals. further internal and external audits were carried out in 1999 and 2001. as concerns the remainder of the missing cash, she stated that she had not taken it. by annulling records of cash transactions”. the applicant was not informed of this decision at that time. instead, she was issued a summons to talks (pārrunas) and she was interviewed on 16 january 1998. a witness statement record (liecinieka nopratināšanas protokols) was drawn up. the applicant repeated that she had annulled only three cash transactions and had made only three cash withdrawals. she had handed the cash over to the deputy head. her request to be represented by the lawyer was refused – she was told that her status was that of a witness and that witnesses were not entitled to legal assistance. in 2000, 2001 and 2002 the police considered the case material to be sufficient for bringing charges against the applicant and referred the case to the prosecutor’s office. however, several prosecutors identified various shortcomings in the investigation and transferred the case back to the police for additional investigation. the identified shortcomings included the following aspects. another audit had to be commissioned and more witnesses had to be questioned. a conclusion was made that the pre-trial investigation had been deficient, chaotic and had been carried out aimlessly. a preventive measure – a prohibition on her changing her place of residence, which she had to acknowledge by giving her signature (paraksts par dzīves vietas nemainīšanu) – was imposed on her. on 26 may 2005 the charges were slightly amended in respect of the total amount of misappropriated funds. on 27 january, 3 february, 26 may and 5 september 2005 the applicant was questioned as an accused person. on another occasion (on 3 february 2005) she stated that she would continue giving testimony without the presence of a lawyer. she subsequently requested that further investigative measures be taken. some requests for further investigative measures were granted and some were refused. on 5 september 2005 the final bill of indictment was served on the applicant (uzrādīta galīgā apsūdzība) in the presence of a lawyer. on 23 october 2006 the first hearing was held. she agreed that she had annulled three cash transactions and made three cash withdrawals in the amount of lvl 1,228 (approximately eur 1,747), but stated that she had done so at the request of the chief accountant and the deputy head of the company with a view to paying out salaries. the applicant was given a three-year suspended prison sentence, with three years’ probation (a more lenient sentence than the minimum provided by law). the applicant lodged an appeal on 2 december 2006. the first appellate hearing was scheduled for 15 august 2007. the senate indicated that the former criminal procedure code (which had been in force in january 2005, when the charges had been brought against the applicant) had not excluded that a person could have the procedural status of a witness while a pre-trial investigation was in progress and could only be officially charged once there was sufficient evidence concerning that person’s guilt.
the applicant was born in 1968 and is currently detained in jēkabpils prison. at least as of 2 march 2001, when his disability was certified as permanent, the applicant has been recognised as being category 3 disabled (the least severe level of disability). on an unspecified date his disability was re-categorised as category 2 (medium level of disability). that judgment became final on 24 february 2009. on 23 december 2011 the applicant was transferred to brasa prison. 303 (from 26 february to 30 october 2013). it appears that as of that date he was held in three different multi-occupancy cells. the number of his cellmates varied from two to fourteen. 301, 303 and 203 together with other inmates, all of whom were in good health except for the applicant. he had been neither able to communicate with other inmates, nor with the prison management due to his disability. he had been in social isolation and had not received any special assistance. period of detention
total number of inmates
overall surface area in sq. as regards out-of-cell activities, the government indicated that while being held in the medium regime – in cells nos. 301 and 303 – the applicant had been able to freely leave those cells in daytime and to use the common area. overall, inmates in brasa prison had had access to a psychologist, but the applicant had never availed himself of this possibility. in 2013 and 2014 the prison medical staff had organised an outpatient medical examination (in relation to tuberculosis) and a consultation by an ophthalmologist to obtain glasses. it had been satisfactory, he had not had any complaints and he had gained weight while in prison. the following conclusions were made:
(1)  there had been no real threat to the applicant’s life or health in brasa prison. (2)  the applicant did not have a subjective right to choose his cell or cellmates. m. natural and artificial lighting as well as heating had been sufficient. 301 – lighting and heating had been adequate. besides the applicant, it had accommodated five other inmates. the temperature in the cell had been 18˚c. as the applicant did not provide further information, the latter complaint was considered as not submitted (uzskatīt par neiesniegtu). on 2 april 2014 the applicant complained to the administrative courts that the prisons administration had extended the time-limit for its last reply. the applicant and a sign-language interpreter were present. he had completed secondary education but had not pursued his education further owing to being deaf and mute and needing a specialised learning programme. he had been working with an officer and a social worker for rehabilitation purposes. on 7 september 2016 the applicant was transferred to a partly closed prison in jēkabpils, where he was held in a cell with two other inmates. one of them had a similar hearing impairment.
the applicants were born in 1971, 1953 and 1976 respectively and live in bergama, i̇zmir. on 16 august 1989 the public limited company e.m. eurogold madencilik (“the company”), subsequently renamed normandy madencilik a.ş., received an authorisation to begin prospecting for gold. subsequently, the company was authorised to use cyanide leaching in the gold extraction process by the ministry of energy and natural resources. on 19 october 1994 the ministry of the environment decided to issue an operating permit to the company for the ovacık gold mine. on 2 july 1996 the i̇zmir administrative court dismissed a case brought before it for the annulment of the permit of 19 october 1994. on 13 may 1997 the supreme administrative court quashed the first-instance judgment and decided that the permit should be annulled. it held that those reports demonstrated the risk posed to the local ecosystem and to human health and safety by sodium cyanide use. it concluded that the operating permit in issue did not serve the public interest and that the safety measures which the company had undertaken to implement did not suffice to eliminate the risks involved in such an activity. on 15 october 1997, in compliance with the supreme administrative court’s judgment, the administrative court annulled the ministry of the environment’s decision to issue a permit for the mine. on 1 april 1998 the supreme administrative court upheld the judgment of 15 october 1997. on 5 april 2000 the prime minister’s office drew up a report on the mine. it concluded that operations at the mine could be authorised, having regard to the additional measures taken by the company, the conclusions of a report by the turkish institute of scientific and technical research (“tübi̇tak”), the ministry of the environment’s favourable opinion and an opinion of the president’s administration, which had emphasised the economic importance of an investment of that type. on 1 june 2001 the i̇zmir administrative court delivered a judgment on an application for judicial review of the report of the prime minister’s office, brought by twenty-five residents of bergama, including the second and third applicants, mr mustafa demirgan (demircan) and mr yılmaz acar. the administrative court decided to set aside the report, which, in its opinion, constituted an enforceable administrative decision giving rise to the issuing of permits. equally, it had been established that the risk connected with the accumulation of heavy elements or cyanide could persist for twenty to fifty years and was likely to infringe the right of the area’s inhabitants to a healthy environment. on 29 march 2006 the supreme administrative court upheld the judgment of 1 june 2001 in so far as it had been brought by nineteen of the plaintiffs, including the second and third applicants and dismissed a rectification application by the prime minister’s office on an unspecified date. in the meantime, on 22 december 2000 the ministry of health decided to authorise the continued use of the cyanidation process at the mine for an experimental period of one year. the company re-started mining operations on 13 april 2001. it held that those risks and threats could not be eliminated by supplementary measures which continued to be based on the same leaching process. it also concluded that the issuing of the permit in question had been incompatible with the principle of the rule of law as that administrative decision had in reality been intended to amend a judicial decision that had become final. on 2 february 2005 the supreme administrative court upheld the judgment of 27 may 2004 and dismissed a rectification application by the ministry of health on 3 april 2006. on 18 august 2004 referring to the decision of 23 june 2004, the i̇zmir governor’s office ordered the closure of mine. on 7 october 2004 the supreme administrative court upheld the stay of execution of 23 june 2004. on 20 may 2005 the goldmine began operating again under a permit of the same date issued by the i̇zmir governor’s office. on 22 march 2006 the supreme administrative court annulled the decision of the cabinet of ministers a decision which was upheld on 21 february 2008 by the supreme administrative court. according to the documents in the case file, various sets of other proceedings were brought between 2006 and 2012 by other residents of bergama against various administrative authorities and normandy madencilik a.ş. before the administrative courts, some of which are still ongoing. the gold mine was in operation until at least 2014.
yeniköy konut yapı kooperatifi, is a housing construction cooperative under turkish law operating in i̇zmir. in 1993, a third party cooperative bought a plot of land measuring 12,000 square metres and the title deed of the land was registered in its name. in 1995, construction works started on the land in question. in 2000, the forest administration initiated proceedings before the menderes civil court of first instance for the annulment of the title deed to the land, alleging that it was part of the public forest area. in the meantime, the third party cooperative had merged with the applicant cooperative and the land had been registered in the land registry in the name of the latter. on 26 december 2002 the menderes civil court of first instance ordered that 9,322 square metres of the land be registered in the name of the treasury as it was part of the public forest area. it also ordered that the buildings constructed on this part of the land be demolished. subsequently, the applicant brought a case before the menderes civil court of first instance and sought pecuniary damages from the treasury under article 1007 of the civil code which provided for the state’s responsibility for any damage resulting from the keeping of the land registry records. on 4 february 2005 the menderes civil court of first instance awarded 138,917,600,000 turkish liras (trl – approximately 81,716 euros (eur) at the time) to the applicant. on 7 february 2006 the fourth civil division of the court of cassation quashed the judgment of the menderes civil court of first instance on the ground that there was no illegal act or action on the part of the land registry officials that might have had a causal link with the applicant’s loss. on 6 july 2006 the applicant submitted a further petition to the menderes civil court of first instance and indicated that there was a decision of the first civil division of the court of cassation which was in contradiction with the decision of the fourth civil division. in this context, the applicant alleged that its case should be accepted according to that decision of the first civil division issued on 7 may 2002 and numbered e.2002/3549 k.2002/5807. on 20 october 2006 the menderes civil court of first instance followed the decision of the fourth civil division of the court of cassation and dismissed the applicant’s claim. reiterating its allegations and referring to the decision of the first civil division of the court of cassation of 7 may 2002, it repeated its compensation request. on 1 may 2007 the applicant’s appeal was rejected by the fourth civil division of the court of cassation. in their decisions, neither the menderes civil court of first instance nor the fourth civil division of the court of cassation expressed any reason about why they had reached a different conclusion from the first civil division of the court of cassation.

the applicants were born in 1981 and 1966 respectively and live in ecemiş village near the town of lice, located with the administrative jurisdiction of the province of diyarbakır. the facts of the case as submitted by the parties, and as they appear from the documents submitted by them, may be summarised as follows. on 12 september 2008 murat tekdal returned to his village of ecemiş after having visited his uncle, the second applicant. later the same day he left his home to walk to the nearby şenlik village. the soldiers asked the persons to stop and surrender, but the persons opened fire on the soldiers. the soldiers returned fire and a clash ensued which continued for a period of approximately five minutes. at 5 a.m. the following morning the soldiers conducted a search in the area and noticed the footsteps of four persons. the footsteps disappeared some two kilometres away, next to a little brook in a valley. at that location the soldiers also found supplies of food. having regard to the particular brand of the glue which some people used for sniffing, as well as to the hunting rifle, the seven soldiers concluded in their report that the applicant’s relative had been a “terrorist posing as an ordinary citizen”. the lice prosecutor and a crime scene officer arrived at the scene at 10.45 a.m. on 13 september 2008 and searched murat tekdal’s pockets, where they found his identity card and a tube of glue. the body was then taken to the lice state hospital. they then took the body to the diyarbakır state hospital and subsequently drew up their own reports pertaining to the incident. a cursory examination of the barrel of the hunting rifle found next to the body did not reveal any smell of gunpowder. there were also no fingerprints on the rifle. in a small bag found next to the body there were personal effects such as toothpaste, a toothbrush, a flick-knife, a packet of cigarettes, two sim cards, gloves, a tax‑payer’s identity card and a bank card. he was fingerprinted and his jacket through which the bullet had gone was sent for forensic analysis. it was subsequently established by a police laboratory that there was gunpowder residue on the outside of his left hand. it was also established that he had been shot at close range. the headman of the applicant’s village formally identified the body as that of murat tekdal, and told the prosecutor that murat lived in ecemiş village. he also noted that bullets had skimmed both hands and the lower right side of the abdomen and caused superficial injuries. a bullet measuring approximately 0.7 centimetres was found inside the body. samples taken from the body were sent for further forensic analyses. he also recommended that the clothes with bullet holes in them be sent to the forensic authorities with a view to determining the distance and the direction from which he had been shot. on 24 november 2008 the applicants sent a letter to the diyarbakır prosecutor and stated that the lice prosecutor had started an investigation into the killing of their relative, but had subsequently decided that he had no jurisdiction to continue the investigation because the deceased had been a member of a terrorist organisation. in their letter the applicants denied that their relative had been a member of the pkk, and informed the diyarbakır prosecutor that their relative had been living in the village of ecemiş for the previous seven years and that all his fellow villagers knew him. they asked the prosecutor to identify and prosecute those responsible for the killing of their relative. on 5 october 2009 the applicants lodged an objection against the prosecutor’s above-mentioned decision of 22 october 2008. they alleged that no effective investigation had been conducted into the killing, and urged the assize court to order the investigating authorities to carry out an investigation. the applicants’ objection was rejected by the malatya assize court on 9 april 2010.
the applicants alleged principally that their twenty-one relatives (spouses, children, brothers and an uncle) had been killed by state servicemen on 5 february 2000 in the novye aldy settlement on the outskirts of grozny (see appendix for details). the documents indicate that only one applicant, olga soltykhanova (application no. 57941/00 and 2 others, 26 july 2007) in so far as the applicants claimed that their relatives had been killed by the same people and in the same circumstances as the relatives of the applicants in that case. it appeared that in the domestic criminal proceedings the proximity of the relationships between the victims and the deceased had not been fully ascertained, and, as noted in the musayev and others judgment, no single list existed of the victims and the people who had been granted victim status in the proceedings (ibid., §§ although the investigation file reflected some attempts to identify the servicemen involved, there was no information that anyone had been charged with the crimes. 12011, produced after the judgment issued in musayev and others. as the documents in the court’s possession indicate, in march 2005 thirty-one families of victims of the aldy events sent a letter to the court stating their intention to apply to the court. the signatories failed to submit proper applications or otherwise pursue that complaint, which was eventually discontinued. while the first applicant in the musayev and others case was a cousin and a nephew of the deceased, the applicants in the present group are the deceased’s spouses, children and brothers. eight applicants were questioned and received victim status in march and april 2000. six were granted victim status in april and may 2004, and one in march 2005. 30538/09); in december 2013 they questioned rashid gerikhanov (no. on 9 february 2009 mrs birlant beterakhmadova (application no. she did not appeal against that decision. was also charged with robbing two other people of money and jewellery, a.m and b.m. in february 2006 the zavodskoy district court in grozny ruled that s.b. and noted that the latest photographs on it had been uploaded in 2007. in may 2013 the investigators sought to obtain additional information about s.b. ’s whereabouts by questioning his other relatives, locating his mobile phone, and so on. during the questioning of victims and witnesses the investigators collected additional information about the suspects. the letter contained detailed information and questions about the events of 5 february 2000, and asked the prosecutor to identify and question the people who had used known radio call signs and to identify the commanders of the operation. 6 of the regiment, who, the investigators suggested, had written a note left by the servicemen for the local residents. it does not appear that any progress was achieved in this respect. others estimated the amount of pecuniary damage caused (see appendix). no one was granted victim status in relation to any property offence and no additional documents were requested from the residents. 12011 into the events of 5 february 2000 was resumed, and the victims were informed accordingly. a letter informing the victims of the adjournment was dated 24 october 2008. on 22 march 2010 the chechnya investigative committee gave an order for an investigating group to be set up which would include investigators from the military prosecutor’s office, in view of information about the possible implication of military servicemen in the crimes. in june 2010 the investigators watched a video filmed in the novye aldy on 9 february 2000 (see musayev and others, cited above, § 25) and produced the video’s transcript for the file. in december 2014 the investigation recognised civil party status of three applicants in connection with the destruction and theft of property during the events of 5 february 2000.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in budapest. on 20 july 2015 a quarrel broke out between the applicant and his common-law wife, h.m. at about 4.40 p.m., instead of an ambulance, police officers e.sz. according to the applicant he had no injuries when he was put into the police car. while he was handcuffed and in the room for short-term arrestees, one of the three police officers present either kicked or pushed him from behind onto the floor. he hit his face and nose, which started to bleed. he fainted and when he regained consciousness, about fifteen minutes later, he found himself handcuffed to a bench, his knees hurting. at 7.45 p.m. the applicant was examined by dr cs.h. he had bruises on the bridge of his nose and around his two wrists, abrasions on his right thigh, scratches below his left knee, and his left tibia was broken. he was hospitalised following the examination. on 22 july 2015 the applicant was examined by dr cs.h. the central investigation office opened an investigation into ill-treatment committed in the course of official proceedings, assault causing actual bodily harm, and grievous bodily harm. in his testimony the applicant stated that he had been kicked from behind when taken into custody. at that time he had been handcuffed and had fallen onto his face on the floor, as a consequence of which his nose had started to bleed. he had asked for help, but only when the police officers realised that he was unable to stand unaided had he been taken to hospital. describing the circumstances of the incident before the police arrived she stated that the applicant had not mentioned to her before the incident that he had hurt his leg. she proceeded to wake him up and could tell that he had been drinking alcohol. he did not identify himself, despite the officers’ order. he fell to the ground and his nose started bleeding. at the police station he continued to behave aggressively and tried to hit his head against the floor. he therefore had to be handcuffed and laid on the floor. he was not injured during these measures and his handcuffs were removed when he calmed down at around 7 p.m. he refused to be examined by a doctor. the central investigation office also questioned e.sz. confirmed what was in the police report and the other three witnesses denied any knowledge of ill-treatment having been inflicted on the applicant. the two members of the medical staff of orosháza hospital who had been present during the applicant’s treatment could not recall the event in detail but remembered that the applicant had not complained about ill‑treatment by the police officers and, although limping, was able to walk unaided to the x-ray examination room. on 17 december 2015 the central investigation office discontinued the criminal proceedings for lack of any conclusive evidence (as regards ill‑treatment committed in the course of official proceedings and assault causing actual bodily harm) and for the absence of a crime (as regards causing grievous bodily harm). according to the investigation office, it could not be established which injuries occurred during the police measures and whether they were caused by ill-treatment or the applicant’s own behaviour. the applicant filed a complaint against the discontinuation order. he maintained that his colleagues and supervisors, as well as the members of his household could have confirmed that he had no leg injury before the incident if they were heard as witnesses or if specific questions were put to them in this regard. it endorsed the first-instance decision concerning the assessment of evidence and the legal classification thereof, informing the applicant of the possibility of pursuing substitute private prosecution proceedings.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in istanbul. he was the owner and the editor-in-chief of a publishing house, aram basım ve yayıncılık, which published a periodical, vesta. entitled “on the kurdish intellectual” was published in vesta. on 29 december 2004 the istanbul public prosecutor filed an indictment with the istanbul assize court, charging the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. according to the indictment, certain passages of the article depicted the pkk[1] as part of the kurdish intellectual movement and hence constituted propaganda of the organisation, known for employing violence and terror. on 23 september 2008 the istanbul assize court convicted the applicant of disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk under section 7(2) of law no. 3713 as he had published the article in question in vesta. in its judgment, the istanbul assize court cited the following passages from the article:
“in kurdish history, there have been moments, in certain periods, during which kurdish literature and culture developed and shone. in those moments, sparks of thought appeared. however, objectively and without renouncing the past, the conditions of the birth of kurdish intellectualism are based on the 1970s. in earlier periods, there had only been individual and temporary developments not creating traditions. the political nature of the 20th century, the existence and rise of national liberation movements, the emergence of modern currents in kurdish politics and, most importantly, the creation of a mass movement, served as the basis for the birth of the kurdish intellectual. this process was manifested in the figure of the pkk. all political movements before the pkk were rebellious, devoid of political depth, tactical unity, stable path and permanence. the ideological and intellectual superficiality of these revolts and their fierce repression led to the loss of existing knowledge and to falling behind. from this point of view, through political and thoughtful analysis, while being free from the system and alienation, and bearing within it its own cultural identity based on the impoverished kurdish rustics, [the pkk] allowed the beginning of a permanent and stable political enlightenment process. ...
another characteristic of the pkk movement at the beginning was that it realised that [the previous] abstract and theoretical movements had not led to a solution but deepened the problem. ...
the fact that the pkk movement was based on the impoverished kurdish rustics who were intact and preserved their national identity paved the way for a start favourable for a confident, militant and revolutionary tradition. yet, the progress of the movement was accompanied by the downfall of the level of quality.” the court considered that the aforementioned passages and the article in its entirety constituted propaganda in favour of the pkk. it hence sentenced the applicant to ten months’ imprisonment and ordered him to pay a fine of 375 turkish liras (try). taking into account his good behaviour during the trial and his character, the court suspended the pronouncement of his conviction on condition that he did not commit another intentional offence for a period of five years, under article 231 of the code of criminal procedure (hükmün açıklanmasının geri bırakılması). on 22 october 2008 the court dismissed an objection lodged by the applicant against the above-mentioned decision.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in podgorica. on 6 september 2003 the applicant lodged an application with the commission for restitution (komisija za restituciju nepokretnosti) in berane requesting restitution of the property expropriated from his father in 1969. following the adoption of a new restitution act (zakon o povraćaju oduzetih imovinskih prava i obeštećenju), on 28 december 2005, the applicant submitted another application to the newly established commission for restitution and compensation in berane (komisija za povraćaj oduzetih imovinskih prava i obeštećenja) requesting compensation. in 2008 all the commissions for restitution and compensation were consolidated into three regional commissions in bar, bijelo polje and podgorica. due to the location of the expropriated property, the applicant’s request was assigned to the commission with its seat in bijelo polje (hereinafter “the commission”). on 19 february 2009 the applicant sought opinion from an independent expert regarding the expropriated property. on 21 july 2009 the commission also requested an assessment report on the expropriated property. the report was submitted to the commission on 24 july 2009. due to commission’s inactivity, on 4 september 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal (žalba zbog ćutanja uprave) with the appeals commission (komisija za žalbe u postupku za povraćaj imovinskog prava ili obeštećenja). on 23 october 2009 and 5 december 2013 the applicant filed complaints with the ministry of finance and the administrative court, respectively, about the appeals commission’s inactivity. on 24 december 2013 the appeals commission ordered the commission to decide on the applicant’s request within a period of 30 days. on 13 october 2014 the commission ruled against the applicant. on 23 december 2014 the appeals commission upheld that decision on appeal. the applicant filed and action with the administrative court seeking redress. on 17 april 2015 the administrative court rejected the applicant’s claim as unfounded. this decision was served on the applicant on 23 april 2015. on 23 june 2015 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal. on 24 july 2015 the constitutional court rejected his appeal for failure to make proper use of other available domestic remedies. according to the constitutional court, the applicant should first have made use of an additional request for the judicial review of his case (zahtjev za vanredno preispitivanje sudske odluke).
the applicant was born in 1941 and lives in the village of bajorai in vilnius region. on 29 december 1999, 28 march 2000, 2 may 2000, 4 may 2000, 16 august 2000 and 18 september 2000 the national authorities allocated plots of land to s.j., thus compensating them for their or their parents’ property nationalised by the soviet regime (see paragraph 25 below)), who later transferred their property rights to ž.s. in accordance with requests they had lodged on 28 october 1991, 10 october 1991, 22 november 1991, 8 august 1991 and 9 december 1991 respectively. the land allocated to these third parties was located in the same area as where the applicant’s father’s land was situated before nationalisation following the soviet occupation of lithuania in 1940. on 22 january 2001 the national authorities established that part of the land was unoccupied and could have been returned to the heirs. on 15 march 2002 the vilnius regional administrative court held that the restoration of property rights of i.t. as a result, a plot of land of 0.18 hectares was returned to the state. on 30 july 2002 the applicant changed his initial request (see paragraph 7 above) and asked for his property rights to be restored in natura. the authorities asked the applicant to provide them with some documents necessary to proceed with the restoration of his property rights. in january 2003 the vilnius county administration (hereinafter “the vca”) asked the vilnius city municipality (hereinafter “the vcm”) to determine whether or not the land in question was state redeemable. accordingly, the applicant was asked to express his intentions regarding the form in which he wanted his ownership rights to the property to be restored. in may 2006 the vca asked the vcm to demarcate a plot of land, previously owned by the applicant’s father, for the applicant. however, the vcm confirmed that the land was state redeemable because part of it was already being owned by third parties and was a state forest. in december 2007 the vca informed the applicant that his father’s land was state redeemable and that the question of restitution had to be dealt with by the other means provided for by law. the applicant was also informed that he was included in the list of persons waiting to have their property rights restored, and was 4,055th in line. on 5 february 2009 the authorities adopted a decision restoring the applicant’s property rights to 0.18 hectares of his father’s land and informed him that his property rights to the remaining 9.3905 hectares would be restored at a later date. his property rights therefore had to be restored. the vca explained that the applicant had submitted the request to have his property rights restored in 2000, while the third parties had done so in 1991 (see paragraphs 6 and 7 above). the vca also stated that the applicant had not provided any evidence that the requirements of the domestic law had been breached in restoring property rights to third parties. in 2001 the provision in question was declared unconstitutional (see paragraph 23 below). the court also held that the applicant had not lost the opportunity to have his property rights restored. it was also possible that he would be given a more valuable plot of land, therefore it was decided that he had not suffered pecuniary damage. on 15 march 2010 the supreme administrative court upheld the decision of the vilnius regional administrative court. the court also held that 29 october 2002 was the date when the specific location and borders of the land which the applicant asked to have returned in natura had been established. furthermore, it did not consider that the domestic authorities had acted unlawfully, which was a precondition for compensation in respect of pecuniary damage. he was also informed that if he wished to use that opportunity, he had until 1 june 2012 to provide the authorities with a written request (see paragraph 25 below). the applicant replied in may 2012 that he had not changed his mind and still wanted to receive the land in natura or, if that was not possible, a plot of land of equal value in vilnius. in august 2014 the national land service asked the vcm whether it was possible to demarcate any vacant land that was not state redeemable and could have been returned to the heirs of the applicant’s father. he was asked by letter to make a decision by 1 march 2015, but it appears that he did not respond.
the applicants, whose names, dates of birth and places of residence are shown in the appendix, were all individual small shareholders of demirbank, a private bank in turkey. on different dates they purchased different amounts of turkish and german share certificates in demirbank through the german stock market. by a decision dated 6 december 2000, the banking regulation and supervision board (bankalar düzenleme ve denetleme kurulu – hereinafter “the board”) decided to transfer the management and control of demirbank to the savings deposit insurance fund (tasarruf mevduatı sigorta fonu – hereinafter “the fund”). in its decision the board held that the assets of demirbank were insufficient to cover its liabilities and that the continuation of its activities would threaten the security and stability of the financial system. accordingly, demirbank’s management and control, and the privileges of its shareholders except for dividends, were transferred to the fund. the fund also confiscated all properties belonging to demirbank. on 6 december 2000 the board of directors of the fund decided to take over the shares of demirbank in exchange for paying demirbank’s loss corresponding to its paid-up capital, namely 275,000,000 turkish liras (try). on 31 january 2001 all equities of demirbank were removed from its account at the istanbul stock exchange and were transferred to the account of the fund. on 2 february 2001, the main shareholder of demirbank, namely cıngıllı holding a.ş., the ankara administrative court found that it lacked jurisdiction, and transferred the case to the supreme administrative court. on 5 november 2004 the supreme administrative court set aside the board’s decision of 6 december 2000, holding that the takeover had been illegal. an appeal and a request for rectification lodged by the agency were rejected on 14 april 2005 and 15 december 2005 respectively. on 20 september 2001 the fund entered into an agreement with hsbc bank, and sold demirbank to the latter. accordingly, demirbank’s legal personality was extinguished and it was struck off the commercial register on 14 december 2001. on 20 september 2001 ms s. cıngıllıoğlu, the main shareholder of cıngıllı holding a.ş., brought administrative proceedings against the fund before the ankara administrative court, seeking the annulment of the agreement to sell demirbank to hsbc. on 21 april 2004 the ankara administrative court annulled the agreement on the ground that the transfer of demirbank to the fund had been found to be illegal by the supreme administrative court. an appeal and a request for rectification lodged by the fund were rejected and the decision became final on 24 february 2006. on different dates the applicants applied to the board and claimed compensation arguing that they had lost their shares in demirbank, as a result of its transfer to the fund. the board did not respond to the applicants’ claims within the statutory period. the applicants therefore applied to the administrative courts and requested the annulment of the board’s implied rejection of their compensation claims. however, the administrative courts dismissed the applicants’ cases as out of time on the ground that they should have initiated proceedings at the latest within sixty days following 31 january 2001, the date on which demirbank’s equities had been transferred to the fund’s account at the stock exchange. the administrative courts’ decisions were upheld by the supreme administrative court and thus became final. following the annulment of the decision concerning the transfer of demirbank to the fund by the domestic courts in 2005, the applicants applied to the administrative courts. relying on the restitutio in integrum principle, the applicants argued that the judgment of the court which annulled the board’s decision dated 6 december 2000 had to be enforced and their rights as shareholders of demirbank should be reinstated. on different dates the applicants’ requests were rejected by the administrative courts and the administrative courts’ decisions were upheld by the supreme administrative court. it also maintained that even if that was the case, the judgment could not be executed, as demirbank’s shares had ceased to exist as a result of the loss of its legal personality following its sale to hsbc. following the annulment of the agreement to sell demirbank to hsbc, the applicants in the applications followed by an asterisk (*) in the annexed list, brought a third set of proceedings against the fund and claimed compensation for their lost shares in demirbank. the istanbul administrative court dismissed the applicants’ compensation claims for being out of time on the ground that they should

( the president of the panel and rapporteur), mr g.ch., according to the transcript of the hearing, the applicant admitted to the act he had been accused of. after examining the circumstances of the case, the panel found the applicant guilty of the misconduct in question. describing the mistake at issue as unacceptable, the panel decided, despite his lack of prior disciplinary sanctions and his good professional reputation, to remove the applicant from judicial office. the applicant lodged an appeal with the disciplinary council of judges (hereinafter, “the disciplinary council”) on points of fact and law. he questioned the assessment of the circumstances of the case and the application of the legal provisions to the established facts in the decision of 18 november 2004. by a decision of 27 january 2005, the disciplinary council unanimously upheld the panel’s decision of 18 november 2004 in its entirety. the applicant appealed on points of law to the supreme court of georgia. in a judgment of 11 july 2005, the supreme court quashed the disciplinary council’s decision of 27 january 2005 for lack of reasoning and legal assessment of the facts, and remitted the case for re-examination. on 4 august 2005 the disciplinary council, composed of six members, including three members, mr k.k. ( mr i.k, who had sat at the first hearing, re-considered the applicant’s case; another member of the disciplinary council who participated in the examination of the applicant’s case was ms n.k. during the oral hearing, the applicant challenged the above-mentioned three members of the bench – mr k.k., and mr i.k – on the ground that they had considered his case when it had come before the panel on 18 november 2004. after re-considering all the factual circumstances of the case, the disciplinary council found, in its decision of 4 august 2005, that the applicant had committed “a manifest breach of the law” and upheld the panel’s decision of 18 november 2004 in its entirety. in his appeal on points of law, the applicant complained that mr k.k. had presided over all of the benches of both the disciplinary council and the panel, and three of the members sitting on the disciplinary council when it ruled on 4 august 2005 had already dealt with the case at first instance on 18 november 2004. he also complained about his request for their withdrawal being rejected. finally, the applicant criticised the haste with which the case had been considered by the disciplinary council. on 14 november 2005 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law, finding that the case had been objectively and exhaustively examined by the disciplinary bodies and that the punishment imposed had been appropriate. as for the rest, noting that the disciplinary proceedings act had instituted a system whereby members of the disciplinary panel could also sit on the disciplinary council, the supreme court concluded that the composition of the benches complained of by the applicant had been perfectly legal. moreover, in the court’s opinion, the fact that the persons concerned had previously participated in the examination of the case was not in itself sufficient to prove that the disciplinary council, in its ruling on 4 august 2005, had not been impartial. according to the materials available in the case file, the applicant did not voice, even in remote terms, either before the panel, the disciplinary council or the supreme court any complaint about the lack of professional qualifications by any of the individual members of the disciplinary council who had participated in the examination of his case.

the applicant was born in 1975 in vladikavkaz, the republic of north ossetia‑alania. he is currently detained in correctional colony no. 1 in vladikavkaz (“the correctional colony”). on 21 january 2013 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking and taken to remand prison no. 20/1 in grozny, the chechen republic (“the remand prison”). on 17 july 2014 the gudermes town court of the chechen republic convicted him as charged and sentenced him to thirteen years’ imprisonment. the test, performed on 27 february 2013 at the regional cancer hospital in grozny, revealed melanoma, a type of skin cancer. radiotherapy and surgery were prescribed. such treatment was considered advanced medical care, which could only be provided under a special programme in limited numbers. in october and november 2013 he was transferred to the regional cancer hospital in rostov (“the cancer hospital”). he was examined and informed that the cancerous tumour could be removed, but he refused the treatment. on 3 june 2014 the applicant was examined at the rostov institute of cancer research (“the cancer institute”). surgical removal of the melanoma was recommended. it appears that several further consultations had been planned to take place at the facility, but the detention authorities failed to ensure his presence. on 22 september 2014 the applicant was admitted to the town hospital in groznyy for cancer surgery, but refused it the next day as he had no confidence in the doctors. several days later, after realising that the tumour had grown, the applicant gave his written consent to the prescribed surgery. on 6 april 2015 the head of the cancer hospital informed the detention authorities that the medical institution was unable to perform such complex surgery. on 27 october 2015 the applicant applied for early release from detention on medical grounds. on 23 november 2015 the promyshlenniy district court of vladikavkaz refused to examine the application on the merits, because his illness was not included in government decree no. 54 of 6 february 2004 setting out a list of illnesses warranting early release. under the decree, only patients with end-stage cancer could apply for early release on health grounds. on 25 january 2016 the court indicated to the russian government, under rule 39, that it was desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicant be immediately examined by medical experts independent from the penal system with a view to determining: (i) whether he had been receiving adequate medical care; (ii) whether his current state of health was compatible with detention in the correctional colony; and (iii) whether his state of health called for urgent surgery and/or for a transfer to an appropriate civilian or prison hospital. on 4 march 2016 the government responded to a letter from the court dated 25 january 2016, stating that the applicant’s transfer to a hospital for surgery was scheduled for 10 march 2016. according to a letter from the head of the medical unit dated 14 april 2016, the facility was unable to carry any surgery out as its surgical unit was undergoing renovation. having learned of the inability of the medical unit to provide the applicant with the required treatment, the detention authorities asked the cancer institute to perform the surgery. the request was refused due to a lack of appropriate security measures at the institution. it appears that in response to the steps taken by the detention authorities to ensure surgery for the applicant by a civilian cancer surgeon, on 31 may 2016 he refused the treatment. the following day he was discharged from the medical unit and returned to the correctional colony. on 6 october 2016 the applicant agreed to the treatment in a cancer hospital. the parties have not submitted information about any further developments in the case.

the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in százhalombatta. on 11 april 2009, quoting the relevant sections of the code of criminal procedure, the pest central district court ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention on charges of terrorist acts and other related offences involving abuse of firearms and explosives on the grounds that he might abscond for fear of a severe punishment, might frustrate the on-going investigation by colluding with accomplices still at large, or might execute the planned offences or re-offend. the detention measure was extended on 8 may and again on 7 august 2009. the court reiterated its earlier reasons, adding that the risk of collusion was serious, since certain other suspects had not yet been apprehended. a further extension was ordered on 9 november 2009. the court stated that the applicant was being prosecuted for terrorist acts committed as an associate of an organised criminal group whose plans entailed a real risk of loss of life. it was of note that the group had existed for quite some time and had been committed to carrying out terrorist acts. moreover, the volume of evidence supporting a reasonable suspicion, as weighed individually against the applicant, was increasing. on 9 february 2010 the applicant’s detention was again extended, the court noting that, in view of the grounds for his detention, not even his clean criminal record, family ties and settled background could provide adequate justification for a less strict measure. on 7 april 2010 the measure was renewed, with special reference to the fact that the case was concerned with a series of crimes committed over a long period of time by a criminal organisation. on 9 june 2010 the budapest regional court ordered that the applicant be held under house arrest, holding that the danger of his re-offending was not of a degree that justified his continued detention, noting also that the investigation was about to be wrapped up and that, in any case, some accomplices in the case had already been released pending trial. the applicant was released from detention the next day. during the ensuing period he complied with the rules of house arrest. on 7 july 2010 the budapest court of appeal again ordered the applicant’s detention. it held that the charges of several very serious offences committed over a long time in an organised group were of such gravity that they could not be addressed merely by house arrest. the measure was extended on 4 august 2010. in addition to the previously cited reasons, the court considered that there was no reason to assume that the applicant’s political motivation behind the incriminated acts had subsided, which meant that the risk of re-offending was real. on 24 november 2010 the budapest court of appeal ordered the applicant’s house arrest, observing that the applicant had abided by the previous house arrest (see paragraph 10 above) and holding that the risk of re-offending was slight. on 20 september 2012 the applicant’s house arrest was replaced by a restraining order, which was eventually lifted on 6 july 2014. on 22 april 2015 the applicant was again detained on remand for the purposes of prosecution for a new offence allegedly committed during the on-going proceedings. he was accused of having threatened and harassed a relative of one of the witnesses in the main case. for want of evidence, this new investigation was discontinued on 30 october 2015. on 18 december 2015 the applicant was released from detention and put under house arrest, which lasted until 27 july 2016. on 30 august 2016 the applicant and his accomplices were convicted. he was sentenced to 12 years in a strict-regime prison. both the defendants and the prosecution appealed. the outcome of the ensuing proceedings is unknown.

the applicant was born in 1981 and is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in nysa prison. on 27 march 2006 the katowice regional court ordered that the applicant should undergo a psychiatric assessment in a psychiatric facility. zaburzenia rozwoju osobowości), at the time the offences had been committed, and that he would not have been aware of and could not have controlled his actions. the katowice regional court examined the case at two hearings on 5 and 25 september 2007. t., an expert who spoke on behalf of the team, stated in particular that the experts had excluded the possibility that the applicant was simulating a mental illness. it also noted that the applicant had undergone psychiatric treatment since 2000. on 12 december 2007 the psychiatric commission on security measures (komisja psychiatryczna ds. there had been an improvement in his condition following the treatment, however there had been no complete recovery. in a joint opinion of 26 august 2011, lubliniec hospital psychiatrists confirmed that the applicant should continue treatment in a secure facility, as he still posed a serious threat to public order. however, they were of the opinion that his condition had significantly improved in recent years. it was therefore recommended that any prison sentence served by the applicant should be served in therapeutic conditions. the opinion was submitted to the katowice regional court on 11 september 2012. she further agreed with the pruszków experts’ opinion (see paragraph 24 above) that the applicant suffered from a personality disorder. on 24 september 2012 the katowice regional court dismissed the applicant’s application to be released from hospital. with reference to the discrepancies between the two expert opinions, the court held that the pruszków opinion concerned the applicant’s capacity tempore criminis, while the lubliniec opinion related to his general progress in treatment and his future prognosis. the applicant did not appeal against that decision. he also informed the director of lubliniec hospital that he had been pretending to have a mental illness. they had stressed that there was a risk that the applicant would commit a similar offence of significant harm to the community as a result of his psychiatric condition. they were convinced that, between june and august 2005, the applicant had been able to recognise the significance of his actions and control his behaviour. this risk was not related to a mental illness, but to a severe personality disorder. they also considered that it was highly likely that he would commit similar offences again. even if he had not been insane at the time when the offences had been committed, there was still a risk that he would commit further offences in view of his dissocial personality disorder. the court heard evidence from experts from cracow psychiatric hospital. on 22 november 2013 the applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal against that decision. on 15 may 2014 the katowice regional court appointed a new defence lawyer for the applicant, to replace the one who had resigned, and set a hearing date for 28 may 2014. the experts confirmed the findings they had made in the opinion of 30 april 2014. on 30 may 2014 the katowice regional court gave a decision and ordered the applicant’s release from the psychiatric facility. on 8 december 2010 the katowice district prosecutor charged the applicant with several counts of robbery (carjacking) committed between june and august 2005 (on 23 june, 27 june, 4 july, 5 july and 17 august 2005). allegedly, the applicant, together with a certain a.i. as indicated in paragraph 24 above, the medical opinion given by experts from pruszków hospital on 17 june 2012 stated that the applicant had had full mental capacity in 2005.
the applicant was born in 1961 and lives in split. on 19 may 2011 the applicant and several other individuals (see, for further information, šoš v. croatia, no. 26211/13, § 17, 1 december 2015) were arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking and detained under article 123 § 1(2), (3) and (4) of the code of criminal procedure (risk of collusion, risk of reoffending, and seriousness of charges). during the investigation, an investigating judge of the split county court (županijski sud u splitu) several times extended the pre-trial detention in respect of the applicant and the other suspects under article 123 § 1(2), (3) and (4) of the code of criminal procedure (risk of collusion, risk of reoffending, and seriousness of charges). the reasoning of the relevant decisions is outlined in the case of šoš (cited above, §§ 20 and 23). on 18 august 2011 the investigating judge extended the pre-trial detention in respect of the applicant and the other suspects under article 123 § 1 (3) and (4) of the code of criminal procedure (risk of reoffending and seriousness of charges). he found that all the relevant witnesses had been questioned and that there was no further possibility of remanding the suspects in detention on the grounds of the risk of collusion. as to the other grounds relied upon for the pre-trial detention, the investigating judge reiterated his previous findings. the investigating judge relied on the same reasons extending the pre-trial detention in respect of the applicant and the other suspects in the further course of the investigation. the reasoning of the relevant decisions is outlined in the šoš case (cited above, §§ 28, 31, 36 and 41). on 16 may 2012 the applicant and nine other individuals were indicted on charges of drug trafficking in the split county court. following the submission of the indictment, on 18 may 2012 a three-judge panel of the split county court extended the pre-trial detention in respect of the applicant and the other accused relying on article 123 § 1 (3) and (4) of the code of criminal procedure (risk of reoffending and seriousness of charges). his pre-trial detention was extended several times on the same grounds. the reasoning of the relevant decisions is outlined in the šoš case (cited above, §§ 44, 47 and 52). on 20 february 2013 the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske), acting as a court of appeal, found that the applicant’s detention should be extended only under article 123 § 1 (3) of the code of criminal procedure (risk of reoffending). it explained that the 2013 amendments to the criminal code provided that the offence at issue was punishable by a prison sentence of between three and fifteen years and no longer by long-term imprisonment. it was therefore not possible to remand the applicant on the grounds of the seriousness of the charges since the possibility of imposing a sentence of long-term imprisonment was one of the conditions for extending pre-trial detention under article 123 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure (seriousness of charges). on 20 april 2013 a three-judge panel of the split county court extended the pre-trial detention in respect of the applicant and the other accused under article 123 § 1 (3) of the code of criminal procedure (risk of reoffending), without changing its previous reasoning. on 17 may 2013 a three-judge panel of the split county court extended the maximum two-year statutory time-limit for the applicant’s pre-trial detention under article 133 § 1 (4) of the code of criminal procedure for a further six months (until 19 november 2013) relying on section 35(2) of the office for the suppression of corruption and organised crime act (hereinafter “the oscoca”). the applicant appealed to the supreme court arguing that section 35(2) of the oscoca was inapplicable to his case since he was not detained during the investigation. on 7 june 2013 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on the grounds that the said provision of the oscoca made a mistaken reference to article 130 § 2 of the code of criminal procedure. it also considered that the cited provision was incomprehensible since, if understood as provided in that act, it merely repeated paragraph 1 of section 35 of the oscoca, which would be obsolete. instead it should be interpreted in line with the previous abrogated version of the oscoca, which in its section 28(3) had provided for a possibility of extension of the overall maximum period of detention for a further six months, which was in the applicant’s case until 19 november 2013. on 18 june 2013 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) reiterating his previous arguments. on 11 july 2013 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as unfounded, endorsing the reasoning of the supreme court. the applicant’s pre-trial detention was extended, under article 123 § 1 (3) of the code of criminal procedure (risk of reoffending), until the maximum period expired on 19 november 2013, when he was released.
the applicant company was ordered to pay eur 10,000 in damages to a person referred to as a presumed member of the mafia on one page of a book published by it. the domestic court considered that the applicant company, which had based the impugned passage of the book on, inter alia, an internal report of the federal office of criminal investigations (bundeskriminalamt), had not complied with its duty to carry out thorough research and had seriously interfered with the personality rights of the person referred to. the applicant company is a prominent german book-publishing house with its registered office in munich. it deals, in its 352 pages, with the mafia’s ties to germany, its inner structures and its various branches. who had been mentioned already in 2000 in a report prepared by the federal office of criminal investigation, gained notoriety. [ both of whom had been dining there purely as a matter of chance, as [s.p.] has and the esteem in which he is held by the italian community, one forms the opinion that [s.p.] becoming a member of the romeo alias ‘staccu’ clan. ...
direct relatives of the clan live in germany and run pizza restaurants. taking the role of the so-called ‘capo locale’. had already been mentioned by name in the context of organised crime. on 13 november 2008, the munich regional court issued the injunction and confirmed it on 15 december 2008 after hearing both parties. the internal reports of the federal office of criminal investigation constituted an insufficient source for the allegations made in the book, since the reports were not intended for publication. accordingly, the book should have stated that the investigating authorities had not obtained any indications which would have served as a basis for filing an indictment, much less a sentence, and that in fact the investigations pursued against the plaintiff had not resulted in any such bringing of charges or in any sentencing. lastly, the court continued, the book had been published unlawfully because the plaintiff had not been given any opportunity to make a statement regarding the suspicion prior to publication. the section of the book dealing with the plaintiff did not allow an average reader to infer that the plaintiff’s membership of the criminal organisation ‘ndrangheta could only be assumed vaguely. the evidentiary facts researched by the author and published by the applicant company did not constitute sufficient proof of the exceptionally grave suspicion raised in the book. for example, it said that because of the high respect in which the plaintiff was held in the “italian milieu”, he must be a fully fledged member of the ‘ndrangheta. moreover, the court continued, certain statements in the book were incorrect, such as the region in which the plaintiff had been born. applied for damages in the amount of eur 20,000. the regional court reiterated the reasoning it had given in the judgment of 15 december 2008 and that given by the court of appeal in its judgment of 7 april 2009 (see paragraphs 13-14 above). the regional court dismissed the plaintiff’s application for damages as being ill-founded. the regional court refused to hear the witnesses as it found that they would be unable to give evidence regarding the alleged membership and that the applicant company had failed to identify the specific issues on which the witnesses could testify. the applicant company did not appeal against the judgment of the regional court. the plaintiff, however, appealed against the dismissal of his claim for damages. consequently, in so far as the judgment ordered the injunction, it became final. on 29 november 2011, the munich court of appeal, in addition to the injunction, sentenced the applicant company to pay damages in the amount of eur 10,000 and dismissed the plaintiff’s further claim for damages. this charge of gross negligence could not be put aside because the author had tackled a subject of strong public interest. the applicant company could not argue that it had not acted culpably, as it had based its publication on information obtained from a governmental authority. consequently, it found that the payment of damages was required.

the applicants were born in 1967, 1965, 1968, 1960 and 1958 respectively and live in i̇zmir. the facts of the case may be summarised as follows. the applicants have been employed in the duty-free shops at i̇zmir adnan menderes airport since 1993. during their employment the applicants operated in “work and rest cycles”. accordingly, in the four months of the summer period they worked continuously for twenty-four hours and rested the next twenty-four hours. for the remaining eight months of the year, the winter period, they worked for twenty-four hours and rested for the next forty-eight hours. their work schedule did not take account of weekends or public holidays as the duty‑free shops remained open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. they claimed compensation for the overtime hours they had worked beyond the legal working time for the previous five years of their employment. they referred to the labour code in force at the material time and to their collective agreement. he further referred to an official audit report by the ministry of labour, dated 10 september 2003, which noted that during the preceding summer period, between the months of june and september, workers at the company in question had worked overtime of 139.5 hours in months which had thirty-one calendar days and 135 hours in the remaining months. in the previous winter period, between october and may, they had worked 22.5 hours and fifteen hours of overtime respectively. on the basis of his examination of the company’s timekeeping records, the expert calculated the number of hours worked as overtime in respect of each applicant, deducting three hours of rest per each day worked. the expert determined that the employer did not owe anything to the applicants for weekend and public holiday work as the remuneration for those days had been in accordance with the applicable regulations. the expert also noted that the applicants could not claim any compensation for unused annual leave as they were still working at the company and such leave was only payable at the end of a contract. the applicants raised a number of objections to the expert report. in that regard, the applicants submitted that they had worked for more hours than established by the expert. they also submitted that the deduction of three hours of rest per day was not based on fact but was an assumption by the expert. in submissions of 22 july 2004, the defendant employer raised objections to the expert report and also argued that the timekeeping documents could not be relied on as they were unofficial copies. it submitted that the applicants had in any event been aware of the working arrangements and had never requested a transfer to another unit of the general directorate of monopolies. the i̇zmir labour court asked the expert to supplement his report with findings concerning the parties’ objections. on 4 july 2005, the expert submitted a supplement to his report, in which he corrected his findings concerning the rest periods in the light of the applicants’ objection and calculated the hours they had worked as twenty-four in the course of a twenty-four-hour shift. on 12 september 2005 the i̇zmir labour court found in favour of the applicants in part and awarded them the amounts given in the expert’s report in respect of the unpaid overtime. it rejected their claims for pay for weekend and public holiday work and for unused annual leave. both parties appealed to the court of cassation. on 17 april 2006 the court of cassation quashed the decision and remitted the case. it found that the labour court had not taken into account any time that could have been used for rest periods and that therefore the calculation of overtime could not be deemed accurate. in the resumed proceedings, the i̇zmir labour court requested that the expert amend the report in light of the court of cassation’s decision. on 26 may 2008 the i̇zmir labour court awarded the applicants compensation for overtime as determined in the revised expert report. on 25 january 2010 the applicants appealed against the decision and maintained that the fact that they had worked continuously for twenty-four hours had already been confirmed by the legal records of the ministry of labour, both parties’ witness statements and other evidence in the file, including the expert reports overturned by the court of cassation. although they had proven that fact, the judgment had been based on the presumption that working for more than fourteen hours a day was physically impossible.
the applicants are serving either life sentences or whole-life sentences in different prisons in bulgaria. the applicant is currently serving a whole-life imprisonment sentence in belene prison. the sentence was delivered by the dobrich regional court in 2003. it was confirmed on appeal in february 2004 and, subsequently, by the supreme court of cassation in a final judgment of 19 october 2004. the lighting at night was also insufficient. the cell was humid, badly heated during the winter and deprived of ventilation during the summer. the food was insufficient in quantity and of poor quality. his correspondence was routinely read by prison staff as he was obliged to transmit his letters to the outside world in open envelopes. he was detained in the high-security wing of this prison, alone in a cell. according to the government, since the beginning of his time in that prison, the applicant had gone on several hunger strikes. m, where only persons serving life sentences were taken. both parties submitted that each time the applicant left the high-security wing of the prison, he was handcuffed and the handcuffs were shackled to a belt. he claimed that his correspondence was routinely checked. in a final judgment of 15 may 2005 the supreme court of cassation sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment. the government submitted that he had been serving his sentence under the “special regime” since 5 may 2005. the government submitted that the applicant had been serving his sentence under the “special regime” in bobov dol prison between 5 february 2002 and 19 april 2007 when his regime had been changed to “severe”. m. the cell had contained a sink and a toilet separated from the rest of the space. the cells had been disinfected and treated against mice with the same frequency. the government submitted that the applicant had been kept in a permanently locked up cell in bobov dol prison, in strict compliance with the relevant legal provisions and in particular section 71(2) of the execution of punishments and pre-trial detention act. as of february 2016, they specified that the applicant had formally satisfied the conditions for being detained together with other prisoners but that the applicant had considered himself not ready for it. he complained that his sentence had amounted, from the time of its imposition, to inhuman and degrading punishment, in breach of article 3 of the convention and that he did not have an effective remedy in this connection. this was upheld on appeal by the sofia appellate court in a final decision of 9 february 2011. the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment in a final judgment of the supreme court of cassation of 13 november 2008. the government clarified that this changed in 2012 when a toilet had been built in his cell. he was also allowed to use sanitary facilities outside of his cell five times a day, and to shower twice a week. the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment and has been serving his sentence under the “special regime” since 2009. until 2009 he was detained in varna prison and since 18 february 2009 he has been detained in plovdiv prison. 16391/05, which was decided in a judgment of 10 january 2012. the applicant also claimed that the material conditions in which he had been serving his sentence were inadequate and that he had been offered no collective activities or other forms of occupation. furthermore, when various competitions had taken place in the prison, or there had been concerts or recitals, inmates serving life sentences had been offered a chance to attend them as spectators.
the applicants were born in 1966 and 1964 respectively and live in linz. they have been living in a stable relationship for many years. on 21 february 2010 the applicants lodged an application to enter into a registered partnership under the registered partnership act (eingetragene partnerschaft-gesetz). on 17 march 2010 the mayor of linz dismissed their application in accordance with sections 1, 2 and 5(1)(1) of the registered partnership act, finding that the applicants did not meet the legal requirements, as the registered partnership was exclusively reserved for same-sex couples. citing, inter alia, articles 8 and 14 of the convention, they complained of discrimination based on their sex and their sexual orientation. the upper austrian regional governor (oberösterreichischer landeshauptmann) dismissed the appeal on 18 august 2010, arguing with reference to schalk and kopf v. austria (no. 30141/04, echr 2010) that as the contracting states were allowed to restrict access to marriage to different-sex couples, it would appear unreasonable not to allow them to reserve access to registered partnerships exclusively for same-sex couples. the applicants subsequently lodged complaints with both the administrative court and the constitutional court, arguing that marriage was not a suitable option for them, as it was substantially different from a registered partnership. in their view, a registered partnership was in many ways more modern and “lighter” than marriage. the applicants put forward several examples: the different statutory time-limit for divorce versus the time-limit for dissolution of a registered partnership in the event of an irretrievable breakdown (unheilbare zerrüttung) of the relationship; the alimony payment obligations following a divorce/dissolution where blame could be placed on one spouse/partner; the obligations conferred by the respective legal institutions, in particular as regards trust, faithfulness and contributions to the household; and the consequences of a declaration of the death of a spouse/partner. the applicants argued that the court’s considerations in schalk and kopf in respect of marriage were not applicable to the registered partnership, which was a new legal institution, introduced in the twenty-first century. it was therefore neither based on a long-standing discriminatory tradition and deep-rooted social connotations, nor aimed at possible procreation. on 22 september 2011 the constitutional court dismissed the applicants’ complaint. the relevant parts of its judgment read as follows:
“article 12 of the [convention] only applies to the traditional civil marriage ..., which has ‘deep-rooted social and cultural connotations’ and was, in the historical context, clearly understood ‘in its traditional sense’ (echr, case of schalk and kopf, §§ 55, 62). if the court, in its judgment in the case of schalk and kopf, considers that the national provisions in the council of europe member states are diverse and range from allowing same-sex marriage to explicitly forbidding it, and concludes from this that, as matters stand, the question whether or not to allow same-sex marriage is left to regulation by domestic law (echr, case of schalk and kopf, §§ 60f), this must, in view of the small number of states providing for a registered partnership for different‑sex couples in addition to marriage, be even more valid for this question. ...
[a]s the austrian legislator has provided for the possibility of legal recognition for same-sex couples by introducing the registered partnership, people may rely on the prohibition of discrimination provided for by article 14 of the [convention] ...
the court has also stated, however, in the case of schalk and kopf, that the legislator may restrict access to marriage to different-sex couples because it has a certain margin of appreciation as regards the exact status conferred by alternative means of recognition. moreover, the court assumes that the registered partnership act allows couples to obtain, in many aspects, a legal status that is equal or comparable to marriage; apart from parental rights, there were only slight differences (see echr, case of schalk and kopf, §§ 108 et seq.). ...
the constitutional court is not called upon to examine whether the particular differences between these legal institutions, as regards the legal consequences and dissolution options, comply with the principle of equality [gleichheitssatz] and the prohibition of discrimination pursuant to article 14 taken in conjunction with article 8 of the [convention], since the only question to be examined is whether different-sex couples have a constitutional right to access to the registered partnership.” on 27 february 2013 the administrative court dismissed the applicants’ complaint (see paragraph 9 above) as unfounded. that decision was served on the applicants’ counsel on 25 march 2013.
the first applicant was born in 1978 and lives in turin. the only item of furniture in the cell was a bed with no mattress, bed linen or covers. the cell window had no window panes and the only source of heating was a small, malfunctioning radiator, which provided little protection against the december weather. for a number of days, although it is unclear for how many exactly, he was left naked. he was subsequently given rationed quantities of food. he was beaten on a daily basis, several times per day. the applicant’s food was rationed, and at certain times he was given only bread and water. the beatings occurred both during the day and at night. the applicant was beaten by four or five officers at a time. during the period he spent in solitary confinement he was only allowed outside the cell twice, once to shower and once for some outdoor time. a criminal investigation into the impugned treatment was launched in 2005. on 7 july 2011 five prison officers, c.b., the asti district court’s judgment was delivered on 30 january 2012. more specifically, the court found it established beyond reasonable doubt that the first and second applicants had been subjected to repeated physical violence from 10 to 29 december 2004 and from 10 to 16 december 2004 respectively. this was due, in the court’s view, to the acquiescence of high-level prison administrators and the complicity that existed among prison officers. it emerges that the court ordered an inspection of the correctional facility, including the solitary confinement wing, during the course of the trial. some did not have bed linen, mattresses, sanitary facilities or heating. was acquitted as to his involvement in the ill-treatment, and a.d. it went on to observe that italy had failed to incorporate the offence of torture into national legislation, in breach of its international obligations. were also responsible for the infliction of bodily harm, but that, as the statute of limitations was applicable to that offence as well, such a finding did not alter the substance of the decision. the court therefore ordered that the proceedings against c.b. the prosecutor contended that the most appropriate offence for the purposes of classification of the conduct in question would have been aggravated ill‑treatment under article 572 of the italian criminal code ‒ as initially identified in the bill of indictment ‒ in conjunction with article 608 of the criminal code. ’s potential knowledge of the decision at a later stage, as argued by the district court. based on the latter decision, on 10 october 2013 c.b. according to a document issued by the staff director of the prison administration department of the ministry of justice on 12 october 2015, and furnished by the government, the four prison officers were not suspended from duty (sospensione precauzionale dal servizio) during the course of the investigation or the trial. the record further indicates that another visual examination (also “behind bars”) took place on 15 december 2004. transfer to the infirmary for a medical examination was recommended. on 15 december 2004 the record shows that the applicant underwent a medical examination in the afternoon. palpation of the patient revealed diffuse pain. as to the first applicant, no copy of the prison medical register had been submitted by the government, notwithstanding the court’s request for such information.
the applicant was born in 1949, he is a lawyer and lives in nicosia. the applicant was provided with a copy of the letter of complaint and was requested to send his comments within seven days. on 21 december 2005, upon completion of the investigation, the investigating judge submitted a report to the supreme court summarising his investigation and the evidence collected. by a letter dated 10 february 2006 the chief registrar of the supreme court informed the applicant that the court had decided that a disciplinary process was warranted. this included two charges of misconduct, and details of the preparatory investigation by the investigating judge. in particular, he argued that the investigation had been incomplete as statements had not been taken from the people indicated by the applicant. the scj also held that the investigation had been adequate and had provided grounds for bringing charges. the applicant then pleaded not guilty to the charges. the applicant’s lawyer agreed that the proceedings would not be held in public. hearings commenced on the scheduled date. the hearings continued, with around seven more sessions being held. files of the proceedings over which the applicant had presided and in which the witnesses had been involved were admitted as exhibits. further statements that related to pending proceedings and complaints that had previously been dealt with by the supreme court were removed from the charge sheet. the witnesses read out and confirmed the contents of their statements. it therefore called the applicant to put forward his defence. the applicant took until 23 june 2006 to set out his defence case, testifying himself and calling thirty-six witnesses. those judges had also acted as prosecutors and had then tried the case. he stressed, however, that this had nothing to do with the judges as individuals. furthermore, the provisions of article 30 of our constitution, which are the equivalent to those of article 6 of the convention, are also applicable. ...
at no stage did the supreme council of judicature function as a public prosecutor against mr kamenos. the president and members of the supreme council of judicature did not put a single question to the witnesses who were listed on the charge sheet, or to those summoned on behalf of mr kamenos, which might have been construed as cross-examination for the purpose of contesting the witnesses’ allegations. not a single question was put to mr kamenos. it follows that this is the appropriate moment to refer to the suggestion made by mr kamenos’s lawyer in his final address. its subject relates directly and absolutely to what we have just said. 165) given in february 2003 by the commission of judicial performance of the state of california, in the united states of america, which concerned a procedure against a specific judge whose services were also terminated for misconduct, with facts and particulars similar to the case before us. the principle is based, as stated in the decision, on what was said by the supreme court of the state, that the purpose of the procedure was not to punish judges who have erred but to protect the judicial system and those who are subject to the formidable power exercised by judges. furthermore, with regard to the investigation and the object of the hearing, he observed:
“a judicial official with the duties of prosecutor was not appointed, a possibility which is referred to in rule 16, and we adopted the following approach: every witness read his statement to the investigating officer out loud and, immediately after, was cross-examined by mr kamenos’s lawyer. besides, as we have seen, of the 28 statements which the investigating office took, only 15 were attached to the charge sheet, with a further reduction to 10 in the course of the hearing. that is to say, whether, from each individual’s evidence and the correlation between them, to the extent possible, there arises conduct as cumulatively stated on the charge sheet, [and] in the case of the second charge “with the result that, owing to the agitation and disruption they were caused, the entire proceedings were diverted from their proper course”. he was paid a retirement lump sum and started receiving his pension.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in zujūnai. in 1992 the authorities allocated him an additional plot of land of 0.05 hectares and similar additional plots were allocated to another twenty‑four people. on 15 april 1993 the applicant purchased a total of 0.2 hectares of land from the state. nevertheless, the plot of land assigned to the applicant was approved by the county’s chief architect. this meant that an easement could only be established if it was objectively necessary. on 11 april 2008 the vilnius district court held that the land had been sold to the applicant in breach of the provisions of domestic law (see paragraph 65 below). the court also found that when the applicant had been allocated the first plot of land (see paragraph 6 above), there had been no other plots demarcated and the land in front of his had been vacant. the court stated that the mechanism of allocating the additional plot to the applicant had been breached, but that he was a bona fide owner. mistakes had been made by the authorities and taking the land from the applicant would have disproportionate consequences for him. the case file contains no information of whether there was an appeal on points of law. the prosecutor general lodged a separate complaint. the prosecutor general lodged an appeal on points of law. on 14 july 2011 the vilnius regional court held that the first‑instance decision (see paragraph 19 above) had lacked reasons for why a clear mistake in the application of the law had been made (see paragraph 57 below) and without them the appellate court could not decide whether the prosecutor general’s request to reopen proceedings had been examined properly. the court thus decided to return the case to the vilnius district court. reopening proceedings would thus lead to a repeated assessment of the facts and would be contrary to the domestic law and the main purpose of reopening proceedings. as a result, the prosecutor general’s request to reopen the proceedings was dismissed. violations of such regulations were directly related to a breach of the public interest. the applicant submitted a separate complaint. on 25 january 2013 the vilnius regional court upheld the decision of the court of first instance (see paragraph 25 above). the fact that the applicant had to return 0.05 hectares of land to the state did not prevent him from asking for an easement over the part of the state land where his waste water equipment and gas and water supplies were installed. the applicant lodged two appeals on points of law. in april 2013 the applicant applied for a suspension of the execution of the decisions of the vilnius district court of 15 june 2012 and of vilnius regional court of 25 january 2013 (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). he also sought to have the proceedings reopened. on 2 august 2013 the vilnius district court rejected the applicant’s request to reopen the proceedings. it held that his argument that new circumstances had arisen was unfounded. the allegedly new circumstances were the fact that a general plan of the settlements of 1986 had not been registered in the state register. furthermore, the fact that the plan had not been registered was not important to the examination of the case. the register had only been established in 1992 and had started functioning in 1996. on 27 february 2014 the vilnius regional court upheld the decisions of the lower courts and decided to terminate the applicant’s appellate proceedings. such objects did not include temporary constructions, engineering systems, buildings that did not have a clear functional dependency or use, or other constructions designated as serving as dependencies of a main construction.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in bacău. the envelopes, sent abroad by registered post sometime between 11 april and 13 may 2003, had been returned unopened as the intended recipients had failed to collect them. the people who had sent them could not be identified by postal workers and their addresses had proved to be fictitious. 143/2000 on the fight against drug trafficking and illegal drug use (“law no. between january and february 2005 similar envelopes containing similar prescription medicines meant to be sent abroad were discovered by the post office and given to the police. on 9 and 14 february 2005 the division for the investigation of organised crime and terrorism from the bacău prosecutor’s office (“the prosecutor”) issued orders authorising the seizure of the suspicious envelopes under the urgent procedure provided for by article 98 § 12 of the code of criminal procedure (hereinafter “the urgent procedure” and “the ccp” – see paragraph 26 below). as it appears that the envelopes contain prohibited substances which are among those listed in law no. on 18 february 2005 the prosecutor started criminal investigations in the matter against unidentified perpetrators. the measure was authorised by the bacău county court on 23 february 2005. the prosecutor’s orders read as follows:
“... a man brought a parcel with suspicious contents which were of interest to investigators ...
as the correspondence was of interest to investigators and as the situation is urgent and duly justified, under article 98 § 12 of the ccp
orders
that the police ... seize the parcel. correspondence and items which have been seized but which are of no relevance for the case shall be returned.” on 25 march and 18 april 2005 an expert examined the writing on the envelopes seized by the police and concluded that it belonged to the applicant. the pharmacists identified the applicant as the person to whom they had sold the medicine. based on the evidence that had been gathered, the prosecutor concluded that between 2003 and 2005 the applicant had obtained medical products classified as drugs without prescription and had tried to sell them abroad. on 2 june 2005 the prosecutor committed the applicant for trial on a charge of dealing in drugs. as for the contents of the seized envelopes, he stated that he had sent scientific papers and samples abroad in relation to his research work and that he had used a fake identity to protect his private life and reputation in case the quality of the scientific work was considered as poor. he denied any involvement in drug trafficking. on 27 february 2007 the applicant was acquitted. the county court excluded the prosecution’s main evidence, considering that the seized envelopes had been obtained unlawfully as the prosecutor had failed to ask the court to approve the measure. as for the remaining evidence in the file, it noted that the audio and video-recordings were not relevant for the accusations brought against the applicant and that the witnesses were unreliable as they had changed their statements in court. on 18 september 2007 the bacău court of appeal upheld the above judgment. it found that the lower courts had erred when they had set aside the evidence obtained from the seized correspondence. the decision of the high court of cassation and justice was final. on 12 february 2009 the bacău county court convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and gave him a three-year suspended sentence. there was also testimony from the family doctor, who denied prescribing any medicine to the applicant’s parents, as the applicant had asserted. it also reiterated that as the situation had been urgent, the prosecutor had been allowed by law to intercept the correspondence without court authorisation, provided that he informed the court afterwards, which he had done. he also contested the manner in which one of the postal workers had been interviewed by the prosecutor (see paragraph 21 above). he did not contest the lawfulness of the remaining evidence. he did not contest the remaining evidence in the file. the high court dismissed the case in a final decision on 22 june 2010.
the first applicant was born in 1955 and lives in belgrade, serbia. the second applicant is a privately owned company, founded by the first applicant in 1990, with its registered seat in ilijaš - podlugovi, bosnia and herzegovina. on 19 december 2001 the second applicant requested a licence to build a petrol station on the main highway in bosnia and herzegovina. on 21 october 2002 the federal road directorate of bosnia and herzegovina (“the directorate”) rejected the request. the second applicant appealed on 31 october 2002. on 28 february 2003 the federal ministry upheld that decision. on 28 march 2003 the second applicant initiated proceedings for judicial review before the supreme court of the federation of bosnia and herzegovina (“the supreme court”). on 25 august 2005 and 24 august 2006 the second applicant urged the supreme court to expedite the proceedings. on 22 november 2006 the supreme court quashed the decisions of 21 october 2002 and 28 february 2003 (see paragraphs 7-8 above) on procedural grounds, and remitted the case to the directorate. on 9 may 2007 the second applicant informed the supreme court that the decision of 22 november 2006 had not been enforced yet. on 16 august 2007 the directorate rejected the second applicant’s request. on 30 august 2007 the second applicant appealed. on 8 november 2007 the second applicant complained to the administrative inspectorate of the federal ministry of justice about the inaction of the administration. on 12 november 2007 the federal ministry upheld the decision of 16 august 2007 (see paragraph 13 above). the decision was served on the second applicant on 18 april 2008. on 30 may 2008 the second applicant initiated proceedings for judicial review with the supreme court seeking it to quash the decisions of 16 august 2007 and 12 november 2007 (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above). on 31 august 2009 the supreme court referred the claim to the mostar cantonal court, as the competent court. on 27 november 2009 the mostar cantonal court rejected the application for judicial review. on 6 january 2010 the applicant submitted a request for an extraordinary review of the decision of 27 november 2009 with the supreme court, which request was rejected as unfounded on 12 may 2010. that decision was served on the second applicant on 9 july 2010. on 6 september 2010 the second applicant lodged a constitutional appeal before the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina (“the constitutional court”) complaining, notably, about the length of the above administrative proceedings. on 23 december 2013 the constitutional court rejected the appeal as unfounded. it noted that the relevant proceedings had lasted eight years and five months in total, that seven different decisions had been rendered by the competent authorities and that, therefore, the length of the proceedings had not been excessive.
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in dublin, ireland. on 28 october 2008 the applicant was travelling on a passenger bus from moldova to romania, with ireland as his final destination. at 12.30 a.m. his bus arrived at the albiţa border crossing between moldova and romania. romanian custom officers stopped the bus, got on and started searching the passengers. two silver ingots were found in the applicant’s pockets. a customs officer decided that the applicant had failed to declare the ingots and confiscated them. an offence report drafted by the officer stated that the applicant had failed to declare two silver ingots of 1 kg each and had thereby breached the provisions of article 653 (a) of the customs regulations (see paragraph 12 below). in addition to the confiscation the applicant was fined 3,000 romanian lei (approximately 750 euros (eur)). the report also stated that according to documents produced by the applicant he had bought the two ingots from a bank. the applicant lodged an administrative complaint with the albiţa customs office, asking for the annulment of the offence report of 28 october 2008 and the restitution of the confiscated goods. he explained that he had legally acquired the two ingots, which had a value of eur 500. he had kept them on him in order to prevent them being stolen during the bus trip and not to elude customs. the passengers had not been allowed to get off the bus before the customs officers had got on and he had wished to avoid saying what he was carrying in front of the other passengers. on 26 january 2009 the huşi district court dismissed the applicant’s complaint as ill-founded. based on the elements in the case file, the court observed that the customs officer had asked the applicant whether he had anything to declare and the applicant had said no. under those circumstances the court held that the applicant had been correctly sanctioned by the customs officer. the court held that the applicant, who had signed the offence report, had failed to produce any evidence to challenge the customer officer’s findings in that document. the relevant provisions of the romanian customs regulations, as approved by government decision no. 707/2006, are as follows:
article 156

the applicant was born in 1952 and lives in celje. he had been a professional truck driver until he became unable to work due to epilepsy. on 29 september 2003 the applicant was certified as having a “category iii work-related disability” as a result of his condition. he was found to have a right to be reassigned to a suitable position of employment where he and others would not be at risk because of his condition, with (retroactive) effect from 14 august 2002. on 21 february 2005 the celje regional unit of the pension and disability insurance institute of slovenia (hereinafter “the regional zpiz”) granted the applicant a so-called “allowance for the period of waiting to be reassigned to or employed in a different appropriate position of employment” (hereinafter “waiting period allowance”) from 8 october 2004. though the sums appear to be lower during the first few months, he had been subsequently receiving around 390 euros (eur) per month in waiting period allowance. it noted that the applicant had been registered as unemployed on 3 march 2003 and had been a beneficiary under section 22 of the 1999 act from 1 march 2003 to 7 october 2004. thus, once his unemployment allowance had come to an end he had become entitled to a waiting period allowance under section 123 of the 1992 act (see paragraph 24 below). on 15 october 2010 the applicant’s doctor informed the regional zpiz about a shoulder injury the applicant had sustained and requested a reassessment of his level of disability. on the basis of, inter alia, information provided by the applicant’s doctor, the regional zpiz, on 2 february 2011, decided that the applicant had a right to be reassigned to another position of employment with several limitations, such as not to work at unprotected heights or drive category c and e vehicles, with effect from 1 february 2011. subsequently, on 28 june 2011 it adopted a decision granting him a disability allowance (nadomestilo za invalidnost) from 24 february 2011 onwards. it was established that his capacity to work had in fact further reduced, even though the category (iii) of his disability remained unchanged. it drew the applicant’s attention to section 185 of the 1999 act, which required beneficiaries to inform the zpiz of any change in circumstances which could affect their rights under that act (see paragraph 26 below). on 21 july 2011 the applicant appealed against the above decision, arguing that in determining the amount of his disability benefit, the regional zpiz should have respected the principle of acquired rights. he pointed out that his benefit had reduced considerably, even though his disability had in fact worsened, and claimed that such a decision was unlawful. on 5 december 2011 the applicant lodged a claim with the celje labour and social court challenging the above decisions. he reiterated that the disability allowance granted to him under the 1999 act violated his acquired rights and that instead of increasing his benefit it reduced it by half, which was unlawful and unconstitutional. on 26 march 2012 the celje labour and social court dismissed the applicant’s claim. in cases where a fresh assessment was made the 1999 act was to be applied. the court concluded that the 1999 act did not contain the right to a waiting period allowance. instead, under section 94, it provided for the disability allowance (see paragraph 25 below) which had been correctly granted to the applicant. on 25 april 2012 the applicant appealed against the judgment, repeating the complaints he had made before the first-instance court and alleging that he ought to have been informed of the consequences of a request for a reassessment of his disability. if that had been the case, he would have “forbidden” his doctor from making such a request. on 21 june 2012 the higher labour and social court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, confirming the position of the lower court that the applicant’s case concerned a change in the level of disability, which had required a fresh determination of his disability benefit. also, since the applicant’s rights had been determined anew, the higher labour and social court concluded that there had been no violation of his acquired rights related to social security, and thus no violation of the constitution. the applicant further alleged that the newly determined amount of disability benefit interfered with his constitutional right to property. on 5 march 2013 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law, finding that the higher labour and social court had sufficiently explained that the change in his level of disability had required a fresh determination of his benefit in accordance with the 1999 act. he argued that the reduction in the disability benefit had put his subsistence at risk and failed the test of proportionality. he thus received the disability allowance for a period of twenty-seven months. data concerning the applicant’s income provided by the slovenian tax authorities shows that he received eur 4,908 in 2010 in pension and disability insurance and, after the impugned change in his allowance, eur 2,902 in 2011 and eur 2,480 in 2012.
the applicant was born in 1990 and lives in gyöngyöspata. the applicant submitted that shortly afterwards, for about twenty minutes, he had been ill-treated by two police officers; at about 4.30 a.m. the two officers had returned and had continued hitting and kicking him for another thirty minutes or so. some two hours later the two officers had escorted the applicant to another room for questioning, but had then continued beating him, together with several other officers. in the applicant’s account of the events, altogether six officers and two security guards took part in the ill-treatment, with the apparent intention of extracting his confession to further offences. one of them had said that they would not mind if he died – there would just be one gypsy less. again, references were allegedly made to the applicant being a roma. since she had apparently been told only about chest complaints, she did not examine the applicant’s legs or feet. herself did not produce a medical report on the premises. still on the same evening, at 8.38 p.m., x-rays were taken of the applicant at albert schweitzer hospital in hatvan, a town at a distance of 32 kilometres, where the applicant was driven by his family members. he was diagnosed with a “chest contusion”, a “skull contusion” and “bodily injury inflicted by human force”. he added that between his release and the medical inspection, he had been continuously accompanied by his relatives, who testified in the ensuing proceedings that he had not suffered any injuries outside the police department. on 27 september 2010 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint alleging that he had been brutalised by police officers. on 8 november 2010 the applicant was heard as a witness and shown, for the purposes of his identifying his alleged assailants, the photos of police officers serving at the gyöngyös police department. nevertheless, he finally identified eight persons as the perpetrators – six police officers (t.b., and two security guards employed by the police department (p.g. this expert had at his disposal the medical reports issued by bugát pál and albert schweitzer hospitals. “a sérülések pontos keletkezési ideje nem határozható meg. tekintettel arra, hogy a vizsgáló orvos idősülőben lévő sérülésre jellegzetes elváltozásokat nem dokumentált, az valószínűsíthető, hogy a sérülések az orvosi ellátást megelőző 24-48 órás időtartamon belül alakultak ki. furthermore, the two security guards (p.g. the prosecutor was satisfied that the investigation had been adequate and comprehensive, and that the obtaining of further evidence – in particular, by questioning the applicant’s brother and friend, who were present at his release – was superfluous. this decision was served on the applicant on 23 january 2012. the motion included assertions about racial insults being uttered during the incident. the eger high court held a hearing on 26 september 2012. had beaten him, so he dropped the charges against them. accordingly, the court terminated the proceedings against these three defendants. the remaining defendants either denied the charges or refused to make any statements. who confirmed that she had not seen any marks of external injury on the applicant’s body when examining him on the day of the incident. they all stated that the applicant had already had those injuries at the moment of his release. criminal proceedings on charges of false accusation were conducted against the applicant. on 7 november 2013 the eger district court found him guilty as charged and placed him on three-year probation.
the applicant was born in 1947 and lives in co. roscommon. the sale took the form of two agreements. the first was an agreement to purchase the land from the owners, mr and mrs f, for the sum of 5,000 irish pounds (iep) (approximately 6,350 euros). the company was owned by mr and mrs f, who were the only shareholders. the house was covered by a guarantee provided by a company known as homebond. from the time she moved into the house in march 2000, the applicant noted major structural defects in the property. she reported this to homebond in september 2001. the fourth defendant entered its defence to the plaintiff’s claims in may 2004. in july 2004 the applicant again applied to the high court for a default judgment against the first three defendants, in light of their failure to enter their defence to the action. according to the applicant, in the years 2005-2008 her solicitors considered it more effective to engage principally with the fourth defendant, homebond, in light of the guarantee on the house. homebond made a proposal to the applicant in june 2006 to carry out remedial work on the house. the applicant indicated her readiness to accept the proposal. on 20 july 2009 the high court struck out the applicant’s motion for a judgment in default of defence. on 13 october 2010 the applicant again gave notice of her intention to proceed. in november 2011 she sought a trial date and was informed that a hearing would take place in march 2012, later moved to april 2012. by this stage she had been informed that the sixth defendant had gone into voluntary liquidation. in july 2012 the applicant was informed that the case would be heard in early 2013. the case was not heard as a single action. only the fourth and fifth defendants appeared (the latter only briefly) at the hearing that commenced on 29 january 2013. the first three defendants, although given notice of the hearing, were not represented at it. on 10 april 2013 the high court issued an order against the fourth defendant for the amount awarded to the applicant. homebond sought to appeal the judgment and order against it. for this it was required to serve the notice of appeal personally on the applicant within twenty-one days. the applicant brought a cross appeal, claiming that the high court had wrongly failed to award her legal costs. in october 2014 the applicant sought to have the appeal struck out for lack of prosecution by homebond. the applicant filed her submissions the following week. on 19 december 2014 it set a hearing date of 23 february 2015. on the latter date it allowed homebond’s appeal and dismissed the applicant’s cross appeal. on 24 january 2014 the supreme court again refused an application from the defendants to stay the judgment of the high court. it also refused to lift the garnishee order and to vacate the judgment mortgage obtained by the applicant.
the applicant was born in 1955 and lives in moscow. on 27 august 2002 the applicant brought civil proceedings against the administration of the mirninskiy ulus of the sakha (yakutiya) republic (“the administration”), a private person s., her husband b., and a private company a. claiming a title to a flat, damages, and s.’s eviction from the flat. on 13 november 2002 the supreme court of the sakha (yakutiya) republic overruled the refusal and remitted the case for a new examination, as the action included a new co-defendant, and, therefore, it could not be said that the dispute was among the same parties. on 15 january 2003 the district court ordered eviction of s. and her family from the flat and dismissed the claim against the administration. on 3 march 2003 the supreme court of the sakha (yakutiya) republic quashed the judgment on appeal and returned the case for a fresh examination, as the lower court had failed to address issues related s.’s property rights. on 29 july 2003 the district court ordered an expert examination of the flat in order to determine its market value. on 14 august 2003 the court proceedings resumed. in the meantime, the applicant amended his claims and sought to obtain compensation for his belongings allegedly stolen in 1999, non‑pecuniary damage, legal costs, travel expenses and reimbursement of the rent he had to pay after his eviction from the disputed flat back in 1999. in particular, the claim for compensation for the allegedly stolen property was dismissed as unfounded. on 20 october 2003 the judgment was upheld on appeal by the supreme court of sakha (yakutiya) and entered into force. on 11 june 2004, upon the applicant’s request, the bailiffs initiated the enforcement proceedings. on 27 august 2004 the district court granted the administration’s request for suspension of the enforcement of the judgment of 29 august 2003 until 15 january 2005 due to financial difficulties encountered by the debtor. on 15 november 2004 the applicant’s appeal against the above decision was dismissed. on 18 march 2005 the monetary award in accordance with the judgment of 29 august 2003 was paid to the applicant. the presidium found that the courts had incorrectly applied the material law to various aspects of the case, and had failed to join the appropriate financial body as co-defendant. it appears that the amounts paid to the applicant under the quashed judgment of 29 august 2003 have not been reclaimed. on 15 november 2005 the district court suspended the proceedings, due to b.’s illness and asked the applicant to clarify his claims. on 21 december 2005 the applicant submitted the amended claims. on 21 march 2007 the district court dismissed the applicant’s action. on 4 june 2007 the supreme court of sakha (yakutiya) upheld the judgment on appeal except for the parts concerning the eviction of s. and b., reimbursement of the rent, payments for utility services, a commission fee, and recovering of the cost of the apartment. the decision in those parts was remitted for a fresh examination due to failure by the lower court to assess certain evidence and misapplication of the material law. on 27 august 2007 the district court suspended the proceedings pending s.’s return from vacation. on 26 october 2007 the court ordered the applicant to clarify his claims and scheduled a new hearing on 23 november 2007. on 23 november 2007 the court issued a special writ ordering the bailiffs to obtain clarifications of the claims from the applicant. it appears that at some point the applicant provided the required information. on 30 april 2008 the district court dismissed the action as unfounded. the court explained that the applicant had other remedies to use under the civil law in order to protect his property rights. in particular, he could claim that an equivalent apartment or a compensation be provided to him. in the meantime, the applicant sued the administration for statutory interest for the delay in enforcement of the judgment of 29 august 2003. on 7 february 2007 the district court discontinued the proceedings as the judgment of 29 august 2003 had been quashed and a new decision in the case had not yet been adopted.
the applicants were born in 1949 and 1923 respectively and lived in bucharest, where the first applicant still lives. the applicants were co-owners of two adjacent plots of land in montenegro. on 13 june 2009, during a visit to the plots, the first applicant noticed a metal fence built partly on their property. the fence divided the two plots of land and made it impossible for them to access one plot from the other. it appears that the fence had been erected some time in february 2009. on 15 july 2009 the applicants, who had legal representation, instituted civil proceedings for trespass (radi smetanja posjeda) against b.ć., on 27 june 2011 the court of first instance (osnovni sud) in kotor ruled in favour of the applicants and ordered b.ć. to remove the fence and pay the applicants 1,435 euros (eur) in respect of legal costs. the court was satisfied that the applicants had lodged their claim in time, given that the deadline for initiating proceedings was 30 days from the day on which they had noticed the trespass, taking into account that 13 and 14 july were national holidays. in doing so the court relied on section 77 of property act (see paragraph 14 below). on 20 december 2011 the high court (viši sud) in podgorica, ruling on an appeal lodged by b.ć., quashed the previous judgment and rejected the applicants’ claim (tužba se odbacuje) as submitted out of time. the court held that 13 and 14 july were indeed national holidays when the courts did not sit. it considered, however, that the 30-day period within which the applicants could institute proceedings was mandatory “[in which case] there could be no shifting of the time-limit when its last day fell on a day when the courts [did] not sit”. the time-limit had therefore expired on 13 july 2009, and the applicants had not filed their claim until 15 july 2009.
the applicant was born in 1960 and lives in omsk. the applicant was deputy head of the omsk regional department for the execution of sentences. on 22 august 2002 the novosibirsk regional court authorised for 180 days the interception and recording of the applicant’s telephone conversations, interception of postal communications and the collection of data from technical channels of communication. the surveillance authorisation read in its entirety as follows:
“operational-search measures carried out with the aim of combatting corruption within state authorities have revealed indications of a systematic bribery scheme operated by certain prison officials in the omsk region. according to operative information, there are good reasons to suspect [the applicant], deputy head of the omsk regional department for the execution of sentences, of arranging for, and systematically receiving, unlawful payments from confidants of the convicts serving their sentences in omsk penal institutions in exchange for granting them various privileges (such as a prison leave, improved conditions of detention or transfer to another penal institution within the omsk region, which was for some reason preferred by the convict in question). given that [the applicant’s] actions contain elements of criminal offences under article 290 § 4 of the criminal code [bribe-taking], classified as a serious offence, and under article 285 § 1 of the criminal code [abuse of power], it is necessary to perform a combination of operational-search measures (interception and recording of telephone conversations, monitoring of correspondence and collection of data from technical channels of communication) in order to collect evidence of his criminal activities, and to receive information about the bribe‑givers and the payment mechanisms used.” on 18 february 2003 the novosibirsk regional court authorised “audio surveillance” of the applicant’s office for 180 days. the government did not submit a copy of that decision. charges of bribe-taking or abuse of power have never been brought against the applicant. in march 2003 the applicant was charged with disclosure of state secrets, an offence under article 283 § 1 of the criminal code, for informing a convict’s relative that the convict was under covert surveillance. when studying the criminal case file, the applicant learnt for the first time that his telephone conversations had been recorded and his other communications monitored. he also learnt that a recording of his telephone conversation with ms l., a sister of a convict detained in a penal institution under his supervision, formed the basis for the charge of disclosure of state secrets. during the conversation, which had taken place on 17 october 2002, the applicant had warned ms l. that her relative was under covert surveillance and that there were listening devices hidden in his cell. at the trial the applicant pleaded not guilty. he claimed, in particular, that the recording of his telephone conversation with ms l. was inadmissible as evidence as it had been obtained unlawfully. on 16 february 2005 the omsk regional court found the applicant guilty of disclosure of state secrets, an offence under article 283 § 1 of the criminal code. it relied on the recording of the applicant’s telephone conversation with ms l., among other evidence. it found that the recording was admissible as evidence as it had been obtained in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law. in particular, the interception of the applicant’s telephone conversations had been authorised by a court on the grounds that he was suspected of the serious criminal offence of bribe‑taking. the applicant was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, suspended for two years. in his appeal submissions the applicant complained, in particular, of a violation of his right to respect for his private life. he argued that the interception of his communications had been unlawful and unjustified, and that the recording of his conversation with ms l. was inadmissible as evidence. on 21 june 2005 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the conviction on appeal. it noted that all the evidence had been collected in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law and was admissible.
the facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, are similar to those in association “21 december 1989” and others v. romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 may 2011). between 21 and 27 december 1989 many people including the applicants and/or their close relatives involved in this case took part in the anti-communist demonstrations in bucharest, timișoara, brașov, reșița and craiova which led to the fall of the communist regime. they were injured or killed by gunfire during the demonstrations. in 1990 following the overthrow of the communist regime, the military prosecutor’s office opened investigations into the armed crackdown on the demonstrations. the main criminal investigation into the use of violence, particularly against civilian demonstrators, during the events of december 1989 in bucharest and other cities has been contained in file no. in a number of cases concerning events in bucharest and craiova, the prosecutor decided not to initiate a criminal investigation or to discontinue the proceedings. those decisions were taken between 1990 and 2007. it results from the documents submitted by the parties that, after the adoption of those decisions, the prosecutor continued to examine the circumstances of these cases in the main criminal investigation – object of file no. to date, the main criminal investigation appears to be still ongoing. the most important procedural steps were summarised in association “21 december 1989” and others (cited above, §§ 12-41) and alecu and others v. romania, nos. 56838/08 and 80 others, §§ 7-13, 27 january 2015. following the entry into force of the new code of criminal procedure in february 2014, jurisdiction over the case was relinquished in favour of the military prosecutor’s office. on 14 october 2015 the prosecutor’s office closed the investigation, finding that the applicants’ complaints were partly statute-barred, partly subject to an amnesty and partly ill-founded. it also found that some of the facts which had been investigated could not be classified as criminal offences and that some of them were res judicata. the parties have not submitted any information on whether there was an appeal against that decision (see ecaterina mirea and others v. romania, nos. 43626/13 and 69 others, § 15, 12 april 2016). however, from the information available on the prosecutor’s office website, the investigation is still ongoing and must have therefore been reopened.
the applicant was born in 1980 and lives in kópavogur. at the material time he was a well-known person in iceland who for years had published articles, blogs and books and appeared in films, on television and other media, under pseudonyms. in november 2011, an 18-year-old woman reported to the police that the applicant and his girlfriend had raped her. in january 2012 another woman reported to the police that the applicant had committed a sexual offence against her a few years earlier. on 22 november 2012 monitor, a magazine accompanying morgunblaðið (a leading newspaper in iceland), published an interview with the applicant. the applicant claimed several times that the accusations were false. when asked about his complaints against the girl for allegedly wrongful accusations, he stated again that he was not seeking revenge against those who had reported him to the police, but that it was clear that they had had ulterior motives. x had altered the picture by drawing an upside down cross on the applicant’s forehead and writing “loser” across his face. apparently x had believed that only his friends and acquaintances, who were his “followers” on instagram, had access to the pictures he published. however, his pictures were also accessible to other instagram users. on 23 november 2012 the newspaper vísir published an online article about x’s post, along with the altered picture and an interview with the applicant. furthermore, the email stated that x was sorry and that the picture had been shared without his consent or knowledge. on 17 december 2012, the applicant lodged defamation proceedings against x before the district court of reykjavík and asked for him to be sentenced to punishment, under the applicable provisions of the penal code, for altering the picture and for publishing it on instagram with the caption “fuck you rapist bastard”. by judgment of 1 november 2013, the district court found against the applicant. the court stated, inter alia, that the applicant enjoyed the personal protection afforded by law, irrespective of which of his pseudonyms he was using. in the same way, the applicant had to take responsibility for material he issued, irrespective of the name he chose to use when doing so. on 26 march 2014 the applicant appealed to the supreme court against the district court’s judgment. he submitted further documents to support his argument. the supreme court accepted that the altered picture had been accessible, not only to x’s followers on instagram, but to other users as well. furthermore, the judgment contained the following reasons:
“[x] claims that his act of uploading the altered picture onto the picture-sharing application in question did not constitute the publication of the picture within the meaning of article 236(2) of the penal code no 19/1940, as he had believed that only a limited number of people would have access to it. the appealed judgment describes in detail that, before the complaints of sexual offences against him as described above had been reported, [the applicant] had been a well-known person, not least for his performance in public under the names of gillz or gillzenegger, the names under which he wrote on internet, published books and pictures and presented himself in the media. the [applicant] has often justified such conduct by stating that the material had been meant in jest and that those who criticised it lacked a sense of humour. act no 62/1994, irrespective of whether he was appearing under his own name or a pseudonym. x] enjoys freedom of expression according to article 73(2) of the icelandic constitution and article 10(1) of the european convention on human rights, and the district court reached the correct conclusion that under these circumstances he had enjoyed greater freedom to express himself about the [applicant] and his opinions. the ruling of the supreme court on 29 january 2009 in case no 321/2008. if the altered picture and the comment ‘fuck you rapist bastard’ are taken as a whole – as the parties agree should be the case – the supreme court agrees with the district court that this was a case of invective on the part of [x] against the [applicant] in a ruthless public debate, which the latter, as stated previously, had instigated. it was therefore a value judgment about the [applicant] and not a factual statement that he was guilty of committing rape. in this context, it makes a difference, even though this alone is not decisive for the conclusion, that [x] did not maintain that the [applicant] had thus committed a criminal offence against someone else, named or unnamed. as a result he is acquitted of all the [applicant’s] claims. the minority concluded that, considering that the criminal investigation had ended with the case against the applicant being dismissed, and even if the applicant was a public person who had expressed himself in a controversial way in public, he should not have to tolerate this kind of comment.
between 1986 and 1987 the applicants took part in the clean-up operation at the chernobyl nuclear disaster site. they were subsequently registered disabled and became entitled to various social benefits and compensation paid on a regular basis. considering these benefits insufficient, the applicants together with other 482 people, sued the russian ministry of finance for additional compensation corresponding to non-pecuniary damage suffered as a result of their participation in the operation. on different dates in january and april 2011 the nalchik town court of kabardino-balkaria (“the town court”) allowed their claims in part and awarded each claimant, including the applicants, compensation ranging between 1,100,000 russian roubles (rub) and rub 1,800,000 for non‑pecuniary damage. no appeals were lodged against these judgments within the statutory ten-day time-limit. some judgments in respect of several applicants remained unenforced (see “enforcement status” in the appendix). on different dates in 2012 and 2013 the domestic courts granted the defendant authority’s request to extend the time-limit for appeal essentially on the ground that the defendant authority had not been served with the impugned judgments. subsequently the regional supreme court quashed the judgments delivered in the applicants’ favour on the grounds that they had been based on retrospective application of the law. the applicants were ordered to repay the sums received under the judgments. the applicants lodged a supervisory review application. there is no indication that they requested the enforcement proceedings to be suspended pending the examination of their supervisory review application. between june and august 2013 the presidium of the regional supreme court partially quashed the appeal judgments as regards the applicants’ obligation to reimburse the sums paid.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in belgrade. on 15 june 2004 the applicant was injured in a traffic accident. an investigation into this incident was initiated in november 2004 and terminated in may 2005, with no criminal charges being brought. on 10 june 2005 the applicant lodged a civil claim for non-pecuniary damages with the second municipal court in belgrade against the belgrade city’s transportation company (gradsko saobraċajno preduzeċe beograd). on 27 december 2007 the second municipal court ruled in the applicant’s favour. on 3 july 2008 the district court quashed the decision and remitted the case to the first instance. on 23 october 2009 the second municipal court adopted a partial decision (delimičnu presudu) against which the applicant and the defendant appealed on 7 december 2009 and 10 december 2009, respectively. on 30 september 2010 the court of appeals in belgrade quashed the decision and remitted the case to the court of first instance for a re-trial. in the meantime, on 22 december 2009, the applicant lodged an appeal with the constitutional court complaining under article 32 of the constitution (a provision which corresponds to article 6 of the convention) about the overall fairness of domestic proceedings and their length. the constitutional court’s decision was rendered on 4 november 2010. no violation in respect of the applicant’s complaints was found. due to applicant’s change to the value of the dispute (vrednost spora), on 31 october 2010 the court of first instance ruled that it had no further jurisdiction to examine the applicant’s complaint. the case was then sent to the high court in belgrade. on 20 june 2013 the high court adopted a partial judgment against which the applicant and the defendant appealed to the court of appeals in belgrade. on 6 june 2014 the court of appeals partly quashed the impugned judgment. it would appear that the case is still pending before the high court. additionally, on 28 october 2014 the applicant lodged a new submission with the constitutionals court concerning, inter alia, the length of the impugned proceedings. it would appear from the facts of the case that the constitutional court has not yet responded.
the applicants were born in 1957, 1961 and 1980 respectively and live in svetlograd, stavropol region. the first and second applicants are husband and wife. according to the first applicant, on 8 august 2003, at approximately 11.30 p.m., a police patrol car approached his car on a dark village road. a police officer, using a loudspeaker, ordered the first applicant to pull over. the first applicant replied that he would stop at the nearest road police post. the first applicant fell down and fainted. after he regained consciousness and stood up, the police officers claimed that he was drunk and told him to take a breath test which showed that the first applicant was sober. the police officers checked his documents, searched his car and left. the first applicant got into his car and drove away in the same direction. the first applicant approached the officers. the officer in charge identified himself as ye. and apologised for the excessive force his subordinates had used towards the first applicant. on the same day the first and third applicants filed a complaint about the incident with the local police station. according to the second applicant, her husband told her about the altercation with the police. ten days later he was released from hospital on conditions of bed rest and subsequent supervision by a neurologist and orthopaedist. the first applicant had refused to comply and had verbally insulted them demonstrating obscene hand gestures. on 9 september 2003 the first applicant underwent another forensic medical examination. it appears that the first applicant’s complaint about the police brutality was dismissed by the authorities on another six occasions. each time a superior prosecutor or a court quashed those decisions considering the investigator’s findings incomplete and unsubstantiated and ordering further inquiry into the first applicant’s allegations. on 6 march 2006 the investigator concluded that there was no evidence showing that the first applicant’s injuries had been caused by the police officers and that he was unable to establish the real perpetrator. on 3 april 2006 the district prosecutor partly accepted the first applicant’s complaint and resumed the investigation. a week later the proceedings were again stayed because the perpetrator of the offence remained unknown. the investigator also accepted that, as of the morning of 9 august 2003, the first applicant had bruises on the right cheek, the back and the left shin. the investigator dismissed the first applicant’s allegations referring to his prior criminal record. as regards the statements made to the contrary by the other neighbours, the investigator found them to be unsubstantiated. he also considered that the first applicant had willfully made false accusations against the police officers and should be held liable for his actions. on 1 march 2011 the senior investigator with the district investigative committee dismissed the first applicant’s accusations against the police officers duplicating the findings summed up in the earlier decisions on the matter. nevertheless, he allowed that the first applicant’s injuries could have resulted from the beatings and that a criminal investigation should be opened on charges of battery. on 15 june 2005 the petrovskiy district court found the applicants guilty of vigilantism and sentenced each of them to two and half years’ imprisonment. the sentence was suspended on eighteen months’ probation.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in ivanovo. at the relevant time the applicant was a member of the ivanovo region electoral commission. on 23 october 2003 a deputy head of the ivanovo region department of internal affairs ordered audio-visual “surveillance” (“наблюдение”) of the applicant’s office. the parties did not submit a copy of that decision. the surveillance was carried out from 27 october to 5 november 2003 by means of a hidden camera. the applicant was subsequently charged with abuse of power, an offence under article 285 of the criminal code. while studying the criminal case file he discovered that it contained video recordings of him talking on the telephone in his office. at the trial the applicant pleaded not guilty. he claimed, in particular, that the video recordings were inadmissible as evidence as they had been obtained unlawfully without prior judicial authorisation. he also challenged the authenticity of the recordings. on 27 september 2004 the leninskiy district court of ivanovo convicted the applicant of abuse of power and sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment, suspended for two years. the court relied on statements by several witnesses, physical evidence, expert reports and the video recordings of the applicant’s telephone conversations. it found that the video recordings were authentic and that they had been obtained in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law. he reiterated, in particular, his argument that the video recordings were inadmissible as evidence. on 12 november 2004 the ivanovo regional court upheld the conviction on appeal. the court held that the district court had correctly declared the video recordings admissible as evidence because they had been obtained in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law.
the applicant was born in 1952 and lives in sarajevo. in 1999 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against his employer, the local police, seeking his reinstatement and damages. the first-instance judgment was rendered by the sarajevo municipal court on 17 april 2006. the second-instance judgment was rendered by the sarajevo cantonal court on 27 march 2008. the third-instance judgment was rendered by the supreme court of the federation of bosnia and herzegovina on 26 january 2010. on 19 april 2010 the applicant filed a constitutional appeal with the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina complaining under article 6 § 1 of the convention and article 1 of protocol no. 1 about the outcome and length of his labour dispute. on 10 april 2013 the constitutional court found a breach of the applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time and rejected the remainder of the case.
the applicant was born in 1982 and lives in the krasnoyarsk region. at the material time the applicant was a police officer with the economic crimes department of the department of the interior of the krasnoyarsk region. on 31 july 2008 a certain mr p. complained to the internal security department of the department of the interior of the krasnoyarsk region (“the internal security department”) that the applicant had extorted money from him. in particular, the applicant had asked for money in exchange for assisting him, through his contacts in the regional government, in obtaining a licence for the retail sale of alcoholic beverages. mr p. gave the internal security department a recording he had made of his telephone conversation with the applicant earlier the same day. during that conversation the applicant had asked mr p. to bring him money before 2 august 2008. police officers invited mr p. to take part in an “operative experiment” (“оперативный эксперимент”), to which he consented. on the same day the head of the internal security department ordered an operative experiment in respect of the applicant with the use of audio and video recording devices. at the request of the police officer the money must be delivered in the period from 31 july to 2 august 2008; the exact time and place for delivering the money is to be agreed in advance by telephone [telephone number] given by [the applicant]. on 1 august 2008 the acting head of the internal security department sent a letter to the deputy president of the tsentralnyy district court of krasnoyarsk, informing her that on 31 july and 1 august 2008 the applicant’s telephone had been tapped in accordance with the urgent procedure provided for by section 8(3) of the osaa. he then repeated verbatim the decision of 31 july 2008 ordering the interception of the applicant’s telephone communications. the applicant and mr p. met in the applicant’s car, where mr p. left the marked money. immediately after mr p. had left, the applicant was arrested by the police, his car was searched and the money was seized. on 18 august 2008 the investigations committee of the krasnoyarsk region opened criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of attempted fraud, an offence under article 159 of the criminal code, in connection with the aforementioned incident. the applicant was suspected of attempted fraudulent appropriation of the funds of a private company in the amount of 200,000 russian roubles. on 28 october 2008, in reply to a request from the applicant for an expert examination of the recordings of his telephone conversations and the video recordings of his meeting with mr p., the investigator in charge of the case held, in so far as relevant, as follows:
“... [the applicant’s] guilt for the criminal offence under article 159 § 3 ... is completely proven by the preponderance of evidence collected.” identical statements were made by the investigator in his decisions of 7 november and 12 december 2008 and 1 april 2009 rejecting various complaints lodged by the applicant. in reply to the applicant’s complaints that his telephone had been tapped unlawfully without judicial authorisation, the investigator stated, in his decisions of 7 november and 12 december 2008, that section 8(3) of the osaa permitted the interception of telephone communications without judicial authorisation in urgent cases, provided that a court was notified within twenty-four hours of its commencement and judicial authorisation was obtained within forty-eight hours, failing which it had to be discontinued. the district court had been notified of the interception the next day, and on the same day, that is, before the expiry of the forty-eight-hour time-limit, the interception had been discontinued; hence, there had been no reason for seeking judicial authorisation. the interception of the applicant’s telephone communications had therefore been lawful. he argued, in particular, that the police had had insufficient grounds for carrying out the surveillance measures and that they had not obtained a judicial authorisation to intercept his telephone communications. on 7 december 2009 the tsentralnyy district court declared the audio and video recordings admissible as evidence. the operational-search measure against [the applicant] was carried out in conditions of urgency. the court agrees with [the applicant] that the case file does not contain a judicial decision authorising operational-search measures. no judicial refusal of authorisation was received. it therefore finds that no breaches of legal provisions governing operational‑search measures were committed in the present case ...” 18. the court based its judgment on the statements of numerous witnesses, material evidence, expert opinions, and the audio and video recordings made on 31 july and 1 august 2008. it found that the recordings were authentic and had been obtained in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, repeating the reasoning set out in the decision of 7 december 2009 on the admissibility of evidence. he also contested the authenticity of the recordings. it found, in particular, that the audio and video recordings had been correctly declared admissible as evidence and found authentic.
on 12 april 2002 the local police sent to the local investigations committee audio recordings of telephone conversations between the applicant and several persons, and video recordings of their meetings in a flat in novgorod. four more persons were arrested on the same charge. he remained in custody throughout the criminal proceedings. the applicant learned about the audio and video recordings on an unspecified date while studying the criminal case file. on 26 june 2002 the investigation was completed and the case was sent for trial to the novgorod town court. the hearing of 16 september 2002 was adjourned until 23 september 2002 because the applicant’s counsel was in hospital and because the prosecution witnesses did not appear. the trial eventually started on 20 november 2002. at the trial the applicant pleaded not guilty. they had also packaged and stored drugs in the flat. it relied on witness testimony, expert reports, audio recordings of telephone conversations between the defendants and video recordings of their meetings in the rented flat. it repeated verbatim the town court’s finding that the audio and video recordings were admissible as evidence because they “had been obtained in the course of authorised covert operational-search measures aiming at uncovering criminal acts committed by zubkov and the criminal group organised by him”. on 29 october 2004, while studying the criminal case file, the applicant discovered that it contained audio recordings of his telephone conversations during the period from november 2003 to march 2004. given that they were classified documents, the decisions could not be shown to the prosecutor and would be shown to the trial court only at its request. it held that the finding of guilt had been based on evidence which had been properly analysed and assessed by the regional court. the applicant was absent from the hearing but his counsel attended. on 14 july 2006 the vladimir regional court upheld the detention order on appeal. the applicant was absent also from the appeal hearing, which was again attended by his counsel. on 3 november 2006 the frunzenskiy district court extended the applicant’s detention until 5 january 2007. on 7 november 2006 the applicant appealed. the applicant’s detention was further extended on several more occasions. in the period from 14 september 2006 to 12 january 2007 the applicant was detained in four remand prisons. according to the applicant, all four remand prisons were overcrowded. m was equipped with seven sleeping places and accommodated up to eight inmates. the cell was equipped with wooden boards instead of individual beds. from 2 october 2006 to 12 january 2007 the applicant was held in remand prison 33/1 in vladimir. on 28 and 29 september 2006 the applicant was transported by rail between remand prison iz-76/1 and remand prison iz-43/1 from yaroslavl to kirov. on the same day the investigator refused his request. 336 of 13 may 1998 (see paragraph 54 below), he replied that the police were not required to send the interception authorisation to the investigator; it was to be kept in the operational search file. the vladimir regional court’s decisions of 28 may and 2 june 2004 authorising interception of the applicant’s telephone communications were stored by the local police. on 6 february 2007 the applicant complained to the frunzenskiy district court of vladimir that the interception of his telephone communications had been unlawful, in particular because the case file did not contain a judicial authorisation.
between 1986 and 1987 the applicants took part in the clean-up operation at the chernobyl nuclear disaster site. they were subsequently registered disabled and became entitled to various social benefits and compensation paid on a regular basis. considering these benefits insufficient, the applicants together with other 482 people, sued the russian ministry of finance for additional compensation corresponding to non-pecuniary damage suffered as a result of their participation in the operation. on different dates in january and april 2011 the nalchik town court of kabardino-balkaria (“the town court”) allowed their claims in part and awarded each claimant, including the applicants, compensation ranging between 1,200,000 russian roubles (rub) and rub 1,600,000 for non‑pecuniary damage. no appeals were lodged against these judgments within the statutory ten-day time-limit. the judgments became final but have never been executed. on different dates the town court granted the defendant authority’s request to extend the time-limit for appeal on the grounds that the authorities had not received a copy of the judgment in due course. subsequently the regional supreme court quashed the judgments delivered in the applicants’ favour on the grounds that they had been based on retrospective application of the law.
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in murmansk. there is no evidence that the police or the investigator were informed about that agreement. the applicant] is the leader of the gang. s. and m. were also charged with the same criminal offences. on 24 august 2004 the investigator appointed legal aid counsel for the applicant, noting that he had refused to choose replacement counsel and had insisted on being represented by g. 18. however, well aware that the applicant had committed serious criminal offences, g. had advised him what to do. he should therefore be called as a witness in the criminal proceedings against the applicant. on 11 october 2004 the criminal case against the applicant and his accomplices was transferred to the murmansk regional court for trial. a preliminary hearing was held on 21 and 22 october 2004. be admitted as his defence counsel instead of the legal aid lawyer. on 15 november 2004 the hearing was again postponed, until 22 november 2004, owing to the failure of one of the co-accused to appear due to illness. on 6 june 2005 the oktyabrskiy district court dismissed that complaint as inadmissible, finding that it could not be examined once the investigation had been completed. he claimed, in particular, that the transcripts had been obtained unlawfully. having analysed the transcripts of the applicant’s telephone conversations with g., it held as follows:
“the lawyer had not been formally admitted to provide legal assistance to [the applicant] at the time [when the interception had taken place]. the applicant appealed against the above extension orders to the supreme court. iz-35/2 in vologda from 12 to 17 october 2006; and in remand prison no. iz-77/3 in moscow from 18 october 2006 to 24 january 2007. the government submitted that it was impossible to provide original documentation concerning the conditions of the applicant’s detention in remand prison no. iz-51/1 (sizo-1) in murmansk because all the official records had been destroyed after the expiry of the statutory period for their storage. all cells were equipped with wash basins supplying cold water; hot water was available for personal and household needs. 423 the actual number of bunk beds had been eight and not three as submitted by the government, as could be seen from the photographs he had submitted to the court. in reply to the applicant’s complaints about poor conditions of detention, the murmansk regional prosecutor’s office stated, on 14 november 2005, as follows:
“... the applicant’s complaints ... that the conditions of detention in sizo-1 were not fully compatible with the sanitary regulations prescribed by the federal law on pre‑trial detention ... that the minimum individual space prescribed by the law (4 sq. in particular, he had shared a cell measuring 20 sq. he had been detained with thirty-six other detainees in a cell measuring 50 sq. m. the cell had been infested with cockroaches, bedbugs and rats. there had been a table measuring 1 m by 0.3 m but no benches or chairs to sit on. from 9 to 12 october 2006 the applicant was transferred by train from murmansk to vologda. he received his first meal on 13 october 2006. when the applicant was transferred from moscow to murmansk between 24 january and 9 february 2007, he was transported first alone in the railway compartment, then from st petersburg onwards he was transported with other inmates, none of whom were suffering from tuberculosis. he did not apply for medical assistance, nor did he complain about the state of his health.
the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. the first and second applicants’ son was killed in a traffic accident on 17 july 2010 in which the fourth applicant sustained serious injuries. the third applicant is the fourth applicant’s mother. the applicants joined the criminal proceedings concerning the accident as victims. on 9 and 10 december 2010 the applicants lodged a civil action within the criminal proceedings against the suspect, j., claiming compensation for non-pecuniary damage and reimbursement of the legal costs incurred in the criminal proceedings. they informed the prosecutor that they had agreed that the case would be settled (kokkuleppemenetlus). the report stated that the applicants had been informed of their rights under the settlement procedure and set out the consequences of applying the settlement procedure. in a section entitled “remarks”, it was noted that the applicants had given up their claims in respect of non-pecuniary damage against j. (as lodged on 9 and 10 december 2010), but had not given up their claim for reimbursement of the legal costs incurred in the criminal proceedings. at that time, the applicants had submitted neither an itemised list of legal costs nor any supporting documents. on 11 february 2011 j. gave his consent to the application of the settlement procedure. the agreement stated that the victims had withdrawn the civil claims they had lodged within the criminal proceedings. on 14 february 2011 the harju county court committed j. for trial and scheduled a hearing for 7 march 2011. j., his counsel and the prosecutor were summoned to appear at the court hearing. the applicants, however, were not summoned. the harju county court received their submission on 7 march 2011. j., his counsel and the prosecutor attended the hearing held before the harju county court as scheduled. according to the court record, the trial judge disclosed the applicants’ claim for reimbursement of their legal costs. j. asked the court not to examine the claim as it had been absorbed by the out-of-court settlement agreement. in a judgment of the same date, the harju county court convicted j. of violating traffic and driving regulations and sentenced him to a suspended prison term. the applicants lodged an appeal against that judgment. they complained that they had not been allowed to attend the court hearing of 7 march 2011 and that the court had left their claim for reimbursement of the legal costs undecided. on 23 march 2011 the harju county court refused to examine the appeal. the applicants appealed against the county court’s decision, insisting that they had been parties to the proceedings and had the right to appeal. at a public hearing on 5 april 2011 the tallinn court of appeal examined the appeal in the presence of j. and his counsel, the prosecutor and the applicants’ counsel. according to the report of the hearing, the prosecutor later noted that those documents could have been submitted when the applicants had signed the report (see paragraph 10 above) or a few days later. however, the court of appeal had refused, considering that it did not concern the subject matter of the dispute before the court in those proceedings. it referred to article 243 of the ccrp, under which the victim was not entitled to revoke his or her consent to the application of the settlement procedure, and to article 246 of the code, which provided that the victim did not have to be summoned to a court hearing in settlement proceedings (see paragraphs 28 and 29 below). the court of appeal concluded that the applicants, as victims, had not been parties to such court proceedings and that, accordingly, they had no right to appeal against the county court’s judgment. by a decision of 3 october 2011 in case no. it must also verify whether there were still questions that should be addressed in the subsequent judgment, but which had not been included in the settlement agreement.
he travelled to tajikistan on a number of occasions to visit his parents for short periods of time. on 3 may 2011 the applicant was charged in absentia in tajikistan with participating in an extremist religious movement, the islamic movement of uzbekistan, and an international search and arrest warrant was issued in his name. on 6 may 2011 the tajik authorities ordered his pre-trial detention. on 3 november 2013 the applicant was arrested in moscow and detained. on 4 november 2013 the meshchanskiy district court of moscow (“the district court”) ordered his detention pending extradition. on 4 december 2013 the tajik prosecution authorities requested the applicant’s extradition on the basis of the above charges. the request included assurances regarding his proper treatment, which were formulated in standard terms. on 12 december 2013 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 3 may 2014. an appeal by the applicant of 16 december 2013 was dismissed by the moscow city court (“the city court”) on 3 february 2014. on 29 april 2014 the district court again extended the applicant’s detention until 3 august 2014. an appeal by the applicant of 5 may 2014 was dismissed by the city court on 23 july 2014. on 9 october 2014 the applicant’s extradition was refused by the deputy prosecutor general of the russian federation, owing to the absence of culpable actions under russian criminal law. on 13 october 2014 the applicant was released from detention. on 13 october 2014, immediately after his release, the applicant was rearrested for violating migration regulations. on 14 october 2014 the district court found the applicant guilty of violating migration regulations, fined him and ordered his administrative removal. allegations by the applicant regarding a real risk of ill-treatment were dismissed, and he was detained pending expulsion. the district court assessing the risks stated that “[t]he claims of the representative ... are of a speculative nature and not confirmed by the case materials” 19. the above judgment was upheld on appeal by the city court on 24 october 2014. claims by the applicant under article 3 of the convention were dismissed with reference to the district court’s assessment of the case, which took into consideration “...the nature of the administrative offence, the character of the accused [who was criminally convicted in russia]... the length of his stay in russia and other circumstances of the case”. according to the latest submissions of his representative in 2015, the applicant was still in detention. on 18 december 2013 the applicant lodged a request for refugee status, referring to persecution in tajikistan and a real risk of ill-treatment. on 15 september 2014 his request was refused by a final administrative decision of the migration authorities. the applicant challenged that decision in the courts, referring, inter alia, to the risk of ill‑treatment. on 12 november 2015 his appeals were dismissed by a final decision of the city court.
the first applicant was born in 1969 and lives in illertissen. the second applicant was born in 1989 and lives in harburg. on 9 december 2007 both applicants went to a football match in munich. the officers of the munich riot control unit were dressed in black/dark blue uniforms and wore black helmets with visors. both uniforms did not include any name tags or other signs identifying the individual officers. the cordon was lifted after around fifteen minutes. subsequently, he returned to his home town, where he was treated in the emergency unit of the local hospital. he lay down on the ground and was subsequently struck on his left upper arm with a truncheon. he suffered swelling and redness of his face and pain in his arm. both applicants were able to identify their attackers as police officers, but were not able to distinguish them further, owing to their identical uniforms and the lack of identifying signs or name tags. according to the government the blockade was lifted due to the aggressive behaviour of some of the spectators and the pressure applied to the police cordon. the supporters’ conduct resulted in the arrest of one supporter and two police officers sustained minor injuries. after a few minutes the police pacified the situation and got the exiting supporters under control. in an article of 18 december 2007 a spokesperson of the police commented on the operation and stated that the alleged assaults by police officers would be investigated. on 2 january 2008, the munich public prosecutor’s office instigated a preliminary investigation. he filed a formal criminal complaint on 7 march 2008. the certificate was issued at 12.05 a.m. on 10 december 2007. the dvds were compiled by the “video officers” of the munich riot control unit. in line with their usual procedure the entire recorded video material was reviewed by the respective video officer after his or her deployment and the parts which were deemed relevant under criminal law and of sufficient quality to serve as evidence were copied to a dvd. on 10 september 2008 the competent public prosecutor discontinued the investigation. however, he concluded that the investigation had not led to a situation where concrete acts of violence could be related to specific police officers and it could not be ascertained either whether the use of force had been justified. subsequently, a further twenty-two witnesses were interviewed including fourteen platoon leaders, squad leaders and video officers of the deployed police units. the investigating police unit was also provided with video surveillance recorded by the 23rd platoon of the 6th dachau public-order support force battalion. in a detailed fifteen-page decision he first summarised the investigative measures taken, referring in particular to the interviews of several witnesses, including police officers and the alleged victims, the review of video material from the police and from the internet, the assessment of the applicants’ written observations and of the submitted documents, inter alia, medical certificates, as well as gathered information and reports on past events and applicable guidelines. after assessing all the available evidence, the public prosecutor concluded that the enquiries had shown that several supporters had aggressively approached, insulted and provoked the deployed police officers and that therefore a situation had existed in which the officers could have been justified in using their truncheons. on 19 september 2011 the munich court of appeal declared the applicants’ application to force further enquiries inadmissible. on 25 october 2011 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint, relying on articles 2 § 2, 19 § 4 and 103 § 1 of the german basic law (grundgesetz) (see paragraphs 29-31 below). moreover, the remaining gaps and factual uncertainties could not be attributed to omissions in the investigation. the court also emphasised that the public prosecutor’s office had been the responsible authority for the investigation and thereby “master of the proceedings” (herr des verfahrens). a subsequent appeal before the munich general public prosecutor was to no avail.
the applicant was born in 1964 and lives in riga. the next day civil proceedings were instituted in that connection. the applicant disagreed; she argued that she did not owe any money to the plaintiff – they had not concluded an agreement for maintenance services and she was free to choose another service provider. in those proceedings the applicant was represented by mr s. seļezņovs, who was not a lawyer. on 30 december 2005 a judge of the riga city kurzeme district court (rīgas pilsētas kurzemes rajona tiesa – hereinafter “the city court”) scheduled the first hearing to take place on 21 april 2006. during this hearing the applicant’s representative requested additional time to examine the relevant legal norms and to obtain the relevant documents from the plaintiff. the city court postponed the hearing to allow both parties to “prepare documents”. the next hearing was scheduled for 9 august 2006. on 17 october 2006 the plaintiff increased the amount of the claim and submitted the relevant documents. the applicant’s representative applied to have the hearing postponed so as to examine those documents. the applicant’s representative submitted written observations and some documents showing some debts that had been paid. the city court admitted them to the case file and scheduled the next hearing for 23 march 2007. the applicant’s representative requested that more detailed information be provided in this connection. on 17 october 2007 both parties pleaded their case. the city court ordered the plaintiff to provide more detailed information and scheduled the next hearing for 13 november 2007. the application was granted and the next hearing was scheduled for 14 february 2008. on 14 february 2008 the applicant’s representative pleaded the case. he argued that the service charges which the applicant had been asked to settle had been unclear. the plaintiff did not have all the relevant documents at hand and thus requested time to submit additional information. the parties continued to plead their case in the hearing of 4 june 2008. the plaintiff was ordered to submit the relevant documents by an unknown date in september 2008 and the next hearing was scheduled for 28 october 2008. on 27 november 2008 the plaintiff appealed against the judgment. the first hearing before the regional court was held on 13 september 2010. the plaintiff increased the amount of the claim because the applicant’s debt for services had in the meantime increased to lvl 3,173 (approximately eur 4,515) and submitted the relevant documents. on 8 december 2010 the regional court held the last hearing in the case. the plaintiff did not attend, nor did it inform the court of any reasons for its absence. she could contest bills provided by the plaintiff, however she had failed to do so. the applicant had selectively paid some bills, but not all of them. on 18 january 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. on 3 april 2012 the senate of the supreme court, following a preparatory meeting, refused to institute proceedings on points of law.
the applicant was born in 1945 and lives in manisa. 14350/05 and 2 others, § 16, 17 november 2015 for further details regarding that earthquake). were questioned by the police and the düzce public prosecutor, respectively. they denied all accusations in respect of the collapse of the building. it was also noted that the metal brackets had not been properly fastened to the girders. he denied all accusations in respect of the collapse of the building. on 14 september 1999 the applicant asked to join the proceedings as a civil party. in respect of the deaths caused by the collapse of the building in question on 17 august 1999. on this basis, the experts concluded that h.e. bore 25% and 37.5% responsibility for the collapse of the building. on 21 june 2001 the düzce assize court held that the statutory period during which h.e. on 21 october 2002 the court of cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court. it held that the statutory time-limit was to be calculated from the date on which the building collapsed, that is to say from 17 august 1999, the date on which the offence in question had been committed. on 6 july 2004 the court of cassation once again quashed the first‑instance court’s judgment, this time as the court had not taken any decision as regards the applicant’s request to join the proceedings as a civil party in respect of the case subsequently brought against t.a. it was also stated in the report that the defendants jointly bore 75% of the responsibility for the collapse of the building. on 7 june 2005 the düzce assize court convicted h.e., as charged, and sentenced each of them, once again, to 10 months’ imprisonment and a fine. relying on the findings of the later expert report as regards the responsibility of the municipal officials for the collapse of the building, it also decided that a criminal complaint should be filed against the relevant officials with the düzce public prosecutor’s office. the defendant h.e lodged an appeal against this judgment. 5237) which had entered into force on 1 june 2005. was null and void, since the earlier judgment of 7 june 2005 had already become final in their regard as they had not lodged an appeal. the applicant and his wife each claimed 2,000 turkish liras (try) in respect of pecuniary damage and try 1,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. on 29 december 2005 the sakarya administrative court commissioned an expert report to determine responsibility on the part of the administration for the collapse of the building. the building had, moreover, been illegally extended after its construction. the municipal officials had failed to duly inspect the building during its construction phase or before issuing the necessary permit for its occupation. they had also failed to carry out a soil survey in the area and to identify the potential “disaster zones” in the event of an earthquake, with a view to limiting the height of buildings in such areas. the experts concluded that, in view of such failures, the municipality had been 50% responsible for the collapse of the building in question. it rejected their claims in respect of pecuniary damage as being unfounded. on 14 september 2007 the applicant and his family received a total of try 11,371.80 (approximately 6,455 euros (eur) at the material time) from the municipality as compensation. on 23 may 2012 the supreme administrative court upheld the judgment of the lower administrative court.
by five judgments of the travnik municipal court (“the municipal court”) of 5 march 2009, 18 january 2012, 31 march 2010, 30 april 2012 and 13 june 2011, which became final on 17 june 2010, 13 february 2012, 1 september 2010, 12 march 2013 and 21 july 2011, respectively, the central bosnia canton (srednjobosanski kanton, “the cb canton”; one of the ten cantons of the federation of bosnia and herzegovina) was ordered to pay the applicants various sums in respect of unpaid work-related benefits together with default interest at the statutory rate and legal costs. the writs of execution issued by the municipal court on 23 september 2010, 14 june 2012, 4 october 2010, 13 february 2013 and 25 october 2011, respectively, were transferred to the competent bank and were listed among the charges on the debtor’s account. on several occasions thereafter the bank informed the municipal court that the enforcement was not possible because the budgetary funds intended for that purpose had already been spent. on 26 february 2013 and 7 january 2014 the ministry of finance of the cb canton (“the ministry”) informed the bank that no funds for the enforcement of final judgments had been provided in the cantonal budget for 2013 and 2014 and that, accordingly, the final judgments against the canton could not be enforced. however, on 9 january 2015, upon the applicants’ enquiry, the ministry informed them that in 2013 the canton had designated 620,000 convertible marks (bam)[1] for the enforcement of judgments and bam 605,900 in 2014 for the same purpose. the applicants complained of the non-enforcement to the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina (“the constitutional court”). ap 3438/12) and 26 february 2015 (decision no. ap 4242/14), the constitutional court found a violation of article 6 § 1 of the convention and article 1 of protocol no. 1 to the convention in the applicants’ and five other cases, on account of the prolonged non-enforcement of the final judgments in their favour. it ordered the government of the cb canton to take the necessary steps in order to secure the payment of the cantonal debt arising from the final judgments within a reasonable time. although some of the applicants submitted a claim for non-pecuniary damages, the constitutional court did not award any compensation. the relevant part of the decision of 17 september 2014 reads as follows:
“36. ... the court notes that the judgments [in favour of the appellants] have not been enforced due to the lack of funds on the debtor’s bank account. the constitutional court reiterates that under the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina and article 1 of the european convention all levels of government must secure respect for individual human rights, including the right to enforcement of final judgments under article 6 § 1 of the convention and the right to property under article 1 of protocol no. admittedly, a delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances, but the delay may not be such as to impair the essence of the right protected under article 6 § 1’ ... 40. the constitutional court agrees with the position taken by the european court ... it is nevertheless aware of the effects the global economic crisis had on bosnia and herzegovina...the court notes that the federal and the cantonal governments had taken certain steps with the view to enforcement of final court decisions. section 138 of the federal enforcement procedure act 2003 provides that the final judgments against the federation and the cantons shall be enforced within the amount of budgetary funds designated for that purpose ... and that the creditors shall enforce their claims in the order in which they acquired the enforcement titles ...
... 42. furthemore, there should exist a centralised and transparent database of all the claims listed in chronological order according to the time the judgments became final. it should include the enforcement time-frame and a list of partial payments, if any. this will also help to avoid abuses of the enforcement procedure. these measure and adequate funds in the annual budget would ensure that all the final judgments are enforced within a reasonable time ... and the cb canton would ensure the respect of its obligations from article 6 § 1 and article 1 of protocol no. the court considers that the adoption of section 138 of the enforcement procedure act 2003 had a legitimate aim, because the enforcement of a large number of judgments at the same time would jeopardise the normal functioning of the cantons. however, the limitation of the enforcement in the present case is contrary to the principle of proportionality enshrined in article 1 of protocol no. in order to comply with its positive obligation, the government of the cb canton must, as explained above, calculate the total amount of the aggregate debt arising from the final judgments and prepare a comprehensive and transparent database ... this court will not specify what a reasonable time-limit should be ... but, in any event, it must be in accordance with article 6 § 1 and article 1 of protocol no. the constitutional court’s decision of 26 february 2015 follows the same legal reasoning. on 19 january 2016 mr jasmin hodžić and ms jasmina mezildžić concluded out-of-court settlements with the government of the cb canton pursuant to which part of their principal claims were to be paid within 15 days following the settlement. they renounced the remaining principal claim and default interest. the legal costs were to be settled by a separate agreement. from the information available in the case it transpires that no such agreement has been concluded. as regards the rest of the applicants, the final judgments in their favour have not yet been enforced.
the applicants are turkish nationals, whose dates of birth and places of residence are shown in the appendix. they all own plots of land located in different cities of turkey. following local land development plans, the applicants’ plots of land were designated for public use. subsequently, complaining about the decrease in the market value of the land and the long-term uncertainty about the fate of their plots of land, the applicants initiated compensation proceedings before the civil courts. during the proceedings relating to their land, the applicants submitted the decision given by the plenary chamber of the court of cassation (civil divisions, numbered e.2004/5-555 k.2005/17) to the domestic courts and asserted that according to this decision their compensation claims had to be accepted. on various dates between 2007 and 2010, the applicants’ respective claims for compensation were dismissed by the domestic courts on the ground that their plots of land were not actually seized by the authorities. in their decisions, neither the courts of first instance nor fifth civil division of the court of cassation, which examined the applicants’ claims on cassation, expressed any reason as to why they had reached a different conclusion from the plenary court of cassation. the details of the proceedings may be found in the appended table.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lived, prior to his arrest and conviction, in moscow. on an unspecified date the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having murdered ch. he was charged with unlawful purchase and possession of firearms and aggravated murder. on 11 july 2006 the investigator questioned sh., identified the applicant as the perpetrator. on 27 july 2006 she confirmed her earlier statements in the applicant’s presence. was admitted to hospital and was unable to attend the trial. on 28 march 2007 the trial by a jury opened in the moscow city court. on 10 april 2007 the jury returned a guilty verdict. the twelve jurors held the applicant responsible for the murder by ten votes to two, and for unlawful possession of firearms by nine votes to three. by a judgment of 13 april 2007, the moscow city court sentenced the applicant to eighteen years’ imprisonment. on 18 april 2007 the applicant lodged a statement of appeal in which he alleged, inter alia, that sh. ’s statement had been read out during the trial in contravention of the applicable rules of criminal procedure. on 28 april 2007 he lodged a supplementary statement of appeal “in connection with newly discovered circumstances”. he wrote that he had found out that on several occasions the presiding judge had entered the room where the jurors had been deliberating and advised them to declare him guilty. the applicant asked the appellate court to take evidence from the jurors and to quash the conviction. on 21 may 2007 the applicant’s representative obtained a statement, certified by a notary public from n., a juror. the juror stated that during the trial the presiding judge sht. had often visited the deliberations room, that he had spoken of the applicant’s guilt as if it had been already established and that he had given them instructions on how to fill out the questionnaire. on 5 june 2007 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the conviction on appeal. it rejected the applicant’s complaint about the presiding judge’s interference with the jury deliberations in the following terms:
“the [applicant’s] allegations ... that the presiding judge breached the secrecy of jury deliberations and that he entered the deliberations room and told the jury how they were supposed to answer the questions [issued by the judge] are not substantiated. it follows from the trial record that the defence did not object to the actions of the presiding judge and did not allege any breach of confidentiality of jury deliberations. the [applicant’s] argument that he learned about those breaches only after the end of the trial is not grounds for quashing the conviction. the additional documents submitted by the defence – the statement by one of the jurors certified by a notary public – may only give rise to an application to law-enforcement authorities, which would have to decide on the institution of criminal proceedings. moreover, the jurors rendered the verdict by a majority vote rather than unanimously ...” 14. as regards the applicant’s argument that sh., a witness, was not questioned in person during the trial and that the presiding judge allowed an earlier statement of hers to be read out, the supreme court noted as follows:
“the defence did not object to the reading-out of the statement by sh., who did not appear in court on account of her undergoing treatment in hospital. neither [the applicant] nor his counsel questioned the authenticity of the medical certificate submitted by sh. by a letter of 16 july 2007, the moscow city prosecutor’s office rejected the applicant’s complaint concerning the actions by the presiding judge by reference to the supreme court’s findings in the judgment of 5 june 2007.
the writs of execution issued on 2 march 2007, 5 april 2010, 2 march 2010, 14 december 2010 and 24 june 2008, respectively, by the zenica municipal court and the tešanj municipal court, were transferred to the competent bank and were listed among the charges on the debtor’s account. on several occasions thereafter the bank informed the competent courts that enforcement was not possible because the budgetary funds intended for that purpose had already been spent. on 12 july 2008 the first applicant, mr suljo kunić, complained of the non-enforcement to the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina (“the constitutional court”). ap 2110/08) the constitutional court found a violation of article 6 § 1 of the convention and article 1 of protocol no. 1 to the convention in mr suljo kunić’s and ten other cases on account of the prolonged non-enforcement of the final judgments in the appellants’ favour. it ordered the government of the zenica-doboj canton to take the necessary steps in order to secure the payment of the cantonal debt arising from the final judgments within a reasonable time. the relevant part of the decision reads as follows:
“39. ... the court notes that the judgments [in favour of the appellants] have not been enforced due to the lack of funds on the debtor’s bank account. the constitutional court reiterates that under the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina and article 1 of the european convention all levels of government must secure respect for individual human rights, including the right to enforcement of final judgments under article 6 § 1 of the convention and the right to property under article 1 of protocol no. 1 to the convention ... the scope of that obligation is not reduced in the present case, notwithstanding the large number of judgments... [t]he constitutional court notes that in jeličić v. bih, and again in čolić and others v. bih, the european court of human rights reiterated that ‘it is not open to a state authority to cite lack of funds as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt. admittedly, a delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances, but the delay may not be such as to impair the essence of the right protected under article 6 § 1’ ... 46. the constitutional court agrees with the position taken by the european court ... it is nevertheless aware of the effects the global economic crisis had on bosnia and herzegovina ... the court notes that the federal and the cantonal governments had taken certain steps with the view to enforcement of final court decisions. section 138 of the federal enforcement procedure act 2003 provides that the final judgments against the federation and the cantons shall be enforced within the amount of budgetary funds designated for that purpose ... and that the creditors shall enforce their claims in the order in which they acquired the enforcement titles ... in 2010 and 2011 the amount of funds for that purpose in the budget of the zenica-doboj canton was 100,000 convertible marks. the court finds that the crux of the problem in the present case is that the zenica-doboj canton did not identify the exact number of unenforced judgments and the aggregate debt ... without which it is impossible to know when all the creditors will realise their claims against this canton. furthemore, there should exist a centralised and transparent database of all the claims listed in chronological order according to the time the judgments became final. it should include the enforcement time-frame and a list of partial payments, if any. this will also help to avoid abuses of the enforcement procedure. these measure and adequate funds in the annual budget would ensure that all the final judgments are enforced within a reasonable time ... and the zenica-doboj canton would ensure the respect of its obligations from article 6 §1 and article 1 of protocol no. the court considers that the adoption of section 138 of the enforcement procedure act 2003 had a legitimate aim, because the enforcement of a large number of judgments at the same time would jeopardise the normal functioning of the cantons. however, the limitation of the enforcement in the present case is contrary to the principle of proportionality enshrined in article 1 of protocol no. 1 which requires that a fair balance is struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights ... section 138 places a disproportionate burden on the appellants ... they are placed in a situation of absolute uncertainty as regards the enforcement of their claims...
... 52. in order to comply with its positive obligation, the government of the zenica-doboj canton must, as explained above, calculate the total amount of the aggregate debt arising from the final judgments and prepare a comprehensive and transparent database ... this court will not specify what a reasonable time-limit should be ... but, in any event, it must be in accordance with article 6 § 1 and article 1 of protocol no. ... the current situation does not give any guarantees to the appellants that their claims against the zenica-doboj canton will be enforced within a reasonable time.” on 16 january 2013 the constitutional court adopted a procedural decision to the effect that its decision of 12 october 2011 and eight other decisions on the same matter in cases concerning various individual appellants (see paragraph 15 below) had not been enforced. the final judgments in the applicants’ favour have not yet been enforced.
the applicant was born in 1984 and lives in mardin. an incident report regarding events that took place between 28 march and 1 april 2006 was prepared on 3 april 2006 by the police and was signed by more than 220 officers. the crowd blocked the traffic as they carried the coffins, chanted separatist, hostile slogans in turkish and kurdish in support of the organisation and abdullah öcalan, the leader of the pkk, and waved pkk posters and banners. the crowd then walked to a cemetery for the burial of the deceased. they were warned by the police that they were not allowed to chant illegal slogans, disseminate propaganda in support of the organisation or wave illegal flags. however, the crowd became agitated and started throwing stones at the police officers on duty, injuring a number of them and causing extensive damage to state buildings and vehicles, banks, shops and other vehicles belonging to private individuals. the report further stated that prior to those events some media organs controlled by the pkk had called for mass protests. a group of forty people entered the university building and asked the students to leave. on 9 march 2007 the applicant was arrested. on the same day, the applicant made a statement to the diyarbakır public prosecutor. the applicant was brought before a judge of the diyarbakır assize court later that day. he maintained that his statements to the public prosecutor had reflected the truth. 3713) and article 314 § 2 of the criminal code (law no. the public prosecutor also noted that the applicant had supported the chanting of slogans in favour of the pkk by applauding during the demonstration of 5 march 2007. the public prosecutor further claimed that the applicant had regularly, willingly and knowingly participated in illegal demonstrations organised by political parties, associations and persons who supported the pkk and that therefore he should be punished for membership of an illegal organisation. in the first recording, the applicant was seen in a crowd next to a coffin making a “v” sign. in the second recording the applicant was again seen in a crowd with the hood of his coat on his head. in the third recording, the applicant was seen applauding with other students. on 19 june 2007 the diyarbakır assize court held the first hearing during which the applicant made defence submissions. the applicant was also convicted of two counts of disseminating propaganda in support of the pkk under section 7(2) of law no. 3713, for which he received a sentence of a total of one year and eight months’ imprisonment. the court first gave a summary of the applicant’s defence submissions, the public prosecutor’s observations on the merits of the case and the evidence in the case file. they had subsequently turned into propaganda events in favour of the pkk and had become illegal demonstrations. hence, the court found it established that the applicant had acted with the intention of supporting the deceased on 28 march 2006 and had acted together with illegal demonstrators on 5 march 2007, thereby committing the offence of disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk and its leader. noting that the applicant had acted together with the aforementioned demonstrators on 28 march 2006, the diyarbakır assize court considered that the applicant’s participation in the funeral and demonstration and his conduct at that time had also occurred as a result of instructions and calls by the pkk. in his dissenting opinion, the judge stated that neither article 220 § 6 of the criminal code nor the explanatory memorandum on article 220 § 6 explained the concept of committing an offence on behalf of an illegal organisation. on 14 december 2012 the diyarbakır assize court decided to suspend the criminal proceedings against the applicant under section 7(2) of law no. 6352, which had entered into force on 5 july 2012. in the meantime, on 25 october 2010 the applicant was expelled from dicle university by the administrative board of the faculty of arts and science because he had failed to complete his degree within the maximum period of seven years for an undergraduate programme. the court considered that the fact that the applicant had been serving a prison sentence did not justify his non‑attendance at classes and examinations.
the applicant was born in 1948 and lives in yerevan. an ambulance was called, which arrived 40-45 minutes later. upon arrival, the ambulance doctor, a.g., nearly unconscious, with impaired breathing and low blood pressure. according to the applicant, the doctor was told at that point that k.m. two injections – one of relanium and one of magnesium – and took her to hospital. downstairs from the eighth floor of the building and put her into the ambulance. and the nurse drew up an ambulance visit record stating that they had arrived seven minutes after receiving the ambulance call and that they had administered only one medical injection, of relanium. according to its report (forensic medical opinion no. in her statement made on the same day a.g. was pregnant, she did not inject any other medication and did not take any further measures since she did not consider it necessary in the circumstances. in the course of the inquiry the investigator ordered a forensic medical investigation to be carried out by a panel of experts. according to the results of the opinion (forensic medical opinion no. 89) produced on 14 january 2008, the injection of relanium 2 mg and magnesium 3 g by the ambulance crew had been correct at the given moment, taking into account the patient’s condition − that is to say convulsion syndrome − and the injection of the given quantity of those substances was not contra-indicated. on 27 february 2008 the investigator decided to reject the institution of criminal proceedings for lack of corpus delicti. ’s pregnancy, impaired breathing and low blood pressure. ’s condition and whether it should have been administered by the ambulance crew or in hospital. whether the medical treatment had been appropriate and sufficient or whether omissions had occurred and, if so, who had been responsible for them. ’s five-week pregnancy contributed to the emergence and development of her illness, whether the pregnancy and the illness she was diagnosed with had a direct causal link with each other. if not, which doctor was responsible for errors and finally whether the medical treatment administered had brought about death. the scientific methods on which forensic medical opinion no. as regards prior diseases resulting in functional disorders which could have brought about the convulsion syndrome, it was impossible to draw any conclusions in the absence of relevant medical documents. not injecting magnesium at the given moment could have entailed negative consequences. had been performed properly, appropriately and in a timely manner without any errors or omissions. the investigator’s conclusion was therefore that the ambulance crew had arrived after a serious delay and had not provided proper medical assistance. on 30 april 2008 the applicant lodged a complaint with the avan and nor-nork district court of yerevan concerning the investigator’s decision of 25 april 2008 seeking the institution of criminal proceedings against a.g. received a reprimand for serious breach of work regulations and medical ethics. had been reprimanded for poor performance of her duties. with substances that were contra-indicated, given her condition, or the over-dosage thereof which, he alleged, had caused her death. on 30 september 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal with the court of cassation against the decision of the court of appeal.

the applicant was born in 1970 and is currently serving a prison sentence. on 23 january 2013 rioting broke out in the town of ismayilli, located to the northwest of baku. - the cause of the events is the general tension arising from corruption and insolence [of public officials]. this is no longer a political situation where we could stay there and try to change something; this is already a situation of disorderly crisis which requires conciliatory steps by the state to be resolved. on 30 january 2013 the applicant commented on that statement on his blog. during the course of the hearings, the sheki court for serious crimes examined testimonial evidence, as well as video recordings and other material. below is a brief summary of the evidence examined by the trial court, as described in the court’s judgment itself as well as, where relevant, in the indictment and in the parties’ submissions. pleaded not guilty and alleged that he had been beaten by investigators at the pre-trial stage with the purpose of obtaining a statement favorable to the prosecution. stated that he had been in the town between about 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. and that there had been many people in the town centre. was also asked by phone to go to the police station. in particular, in his pre-trial statement, tofiq yaqublu had stated that he had arrived in ismayilli at around 3 p.m. there he had seen a small group of eight to ten young locals. (i)  witness statements concerning the events of 23 january 2013 42. according to the documents in the case file, at least three of them stated that the people moved to the area close to the regional education department along the “hospital road”, which was the informal name for m.f. to ismayilli, stated that they had arrived in the town at around 4 p.m. there had been no rioting or clashes with the police at that time. at around 4 p.m. other journalists had arrived from baku. according to the description given in the court’s judgment, a video recording of 24 january 2013 showed the applicant and tofiq yaqublu “standing in the centre of the town of ismayilli, opposite to the administrative building of the education department, at a place where acts of mass disorder had been committed”. the description of the above recordings did not specify the time of day when those scenes had been shot. on 2 december 2013, after having consulted the transcript of the preliminary hearing, the applicant’s lawyers applied to the court to amend some of the wording used in the transcript to describe the applicant’s statement during the preliminary hearing to the effect that he considered the trial to be a sham and did not accept the trial court as a fair tribunal. in support of the request, the lawyer argued that all of those police officers had first been questioned five months after the events by the same investigator. at the hearing held on 13 january 2014 one of the applicant’s lawyers, mr f. agayev, lodged a second objection to the composition of the court, arguing, inter alia, that the court was biased: it had rejected all of the defence’s requests and created obstacles to the proper questioning of “fake witnesses” by the defence. stated that the interview ... had lasted about twenty minutes at most and that, during that period of time, he had not been aware of the whereabouts of [the applicant] and tofiq yaqublu. all the reliable and meaningful evidence produced at the trial had clearly shown that there had been no acts of mass disorder during the afternoon of 24 january 2013 while the applicant was in the town. a video made available by the yeni musavat newspaper showed the absence of any clashes between protesters and the police during the afternoon of 24 january 2013. also, both of them had alleged before the court that they had been ill-treated by the investigating authorities with the aim of obtaining statements incriminating the applicant. during the examination of the appeal by the sheki court of appeal, the applicant’s lawyers lodged a number of applications repeating those lodged with the first-instance court. the hearing was resumed on 13 october 2015. see paragraphs 52-56 above) indicated that between about 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. on 24 january 2013 there was mass disorder in front of the building of the regional education department and that the applicant and tofiq yaqublu had incited people to riot and resist the police. wanted to help [the applicant and tofiq yaqublu], whom they knew and had relations with, avoid criminal liability. as to the video evidence originally examined by the first-instance court, the sheki court of appeal mentioned the video recording showing the applicant and tofiq yaqublu “standing in the centre of the town of ismayilli, opposite to the administrative building of the education department, at a place where acts of mass disorder had been committed”, without specifying the time of day when that scene had been shot (see paragraphs 69 and 103 above). who had participated, as an attesting witness, in the inspection of the scene of the events [of the previous night] from 10 a.m. to 4.10 p.m. on 24 january 2013, and had later testified that at around 5 p.m. on the same day he had seen [the applicant and tofiq yaqublu inciting people to commit acts of disorder].

the ohrid archdiocese (охридска архиепископија), in its original form, existed until 1767, when it was abolished by the turkish sultan. after the holy synod of the moc had rejected that agreement, mr vraniškovski accepted a call by the soc for reunification dated 20 june 2002; on 21 june 2002 he publicly announced that he was prepared for canonical union with the soc. the government submitted that that had provoked a public reaction and that there had been street protests in several cities in the respondent state. on 25 december 2003 the applicant association constituted its own holy synod and appointed mr vraniškovski as its president. the letter, which remained unanswered, further stated:
“... the true macedonian orthodox church is the orthodox ohrid archdiocese. on 6 september 2004 mr vraniškovski submitted an application (барање за регистрирање) seeking that the applicant association be registered as a religious group (религиозна група). its aim was to acquire legal-entity status and to manage its property. the latter provided that the applicant “would be autonomous within the canonical jurisdiction of the peć patriarchy (the soc)”; it specified that its temporary place of registration would be in bitola, in the respondent state, “until it was possible to designate a permanent seat”; and that the applicant association and its structural units were legal entities and could obtain and manage property. it further provided that all legal persons that the applicant association might set up could have bank accounts. on 30 september 2004 the commission found the application to be incomplete, and requested that the applicant association submit the following further documents: a) a copy of a decision appointing the authorised person to seek registration of the applicant association and b) a copy of the minutes of the constituent assembly. that the applicant association would operate as part of a foreign orthodox church was, in the commission’s view, in violation of section 12 of the 1997 act. had only handed it over to the commission’s archives;
(b)  the applicant association had been founded formally on 1 september 2004. on 9 november 2005 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s claim. the court accepted the remaining reasoning given by the administrative bodies. that decision was served on the applicant on 15 july 2006. while relying on the decisions of the authorities refusing the applicant association’s registration as “orthodox ohrid archdiocese”, he also notified the court that a fresh application for registration had been submitted under the name “greek-orthodox ohrid archdiocese of the peć patriarchy” (see paragraphs 23-34 below). it is an autonomous church under jurisdiction of the peć patriarchy, notably the serbian orthodox church ...” 20. according to “the minutes of the constituent assembly” (записник од основачкото собрание) “... at the proposal of his beatitude (неговото блаженство), the archbishop of ohrid and metropolitan of skopje mr jovan (vraniškovski), the holy synod of the orthodox ohrid archdiocese composed of (bishops j., m., and d., all macedonian nationals) convened a meeting on 27 april 2009 in order to adopt decisions for setting up and registration of “the greek-orthodox ohrid archdiocese of the peć patriarchy”. on the same date a decision setting up the applicant association was adopted. it was also stated that a refusal to register a religious group would be unjustified in a democratic society unless it was proven that the teaching of the group was destructive. no such assembly had been held in the applicant’s case;
(b)  the application for registration concerned an organisation which had not been provided for under the 2007 act. its name did not specify whether it was a church, religious community or religious group. its use was not in conformity with the 2007 act (section 10 (3)). in this connection, the applicant submitted extracts from several media reports published at the time, according to which the competent body of the moc, at its meeting held on 4 and 5 october 2008, had refused to change the name in its constitution; (iii) that the moc had applied to the bureau for registration of the name “macedonian orthodox church-ohrid archdiocese” as a trademark was irrelevant, since the industrial property act concerned goods and services and not religious organisations. on an unspecified date thereafter, d.n. ( referring to the courts’ decisions rejecting the applicant association’s request for registration as “greek-orthodox ohrid archdiocese of the peć patriarchy” and relying on articles 9, 16 and 19 of the constitution and article 9 of the convention, the court stated:
“the court cannot examine the appeal on the merits since the complainant did not comply with the formal statutory requirements before a competent court (for registration of the applicant). the complainant was not a priori refused registration of his religious community by a final judicial decision. schismatics and renegades should be marginalised, isolated and rejected. following that discussion, the majority of bishops in the moc, as stated in the article, had requested that the moc should not accept any compromise which would prevent it from protecting itself against a parallel church, led by mr vraniškovski, being created. you know well that greek-orthodox does not mean greek (by nationality) of orthodox faith, but that name refers to all known christian orthodox churches.”
the applicants are the brother and the parents of mr costas tsalikidis, who was found dead on 9 march 2005. mr tsalikidis was network planning manager for v., a mobile phone operator. on 9 march 2005 he was found dead in his apartment by his mother (the second applicant). he was found hanged by a rope tied to pipes above the bathroom door and a chair lay knocked over on the floor nearby. he did not conduct a search for fingerprints. the body was transferred to the morgue, where an autopsy was performed on the body the next day by g.d.l., a coroner with the forensic medical service of athens. the hyoid bone and larynx appeared normal. the head of the forensic science service of athens university. in his view, a possible exhumation and/or toxicology test would be of no added value. on 25 september 2006 the decision was upheld by order no. v. was informed by e. that their network had been used to wiretap state officials on 4 march 2005. the applicants also declared that they wished to join the proceedings as civil parties. the first was an extract of comments taken from a report issued by the forensic institute in athens. this statement, too, is inconsistent with the normal colouration of the face as shown in the photographs. these include (1) photograph of the suspensory knot – it is a complex knot, and definitely not the sort of knots seen in routine suicides. the photographs do show that the deceased was unclothed; they also showed an obvious ligature mark that was located in mid-neck, parallel to the shoulders. neither the height nor the weight of the deceased was supplied. this means the autopsy was incomplete by u.s. while adequate examination is not possible only from inspecting photographs, the knot used to anchor the rope appears quite complex. the results, whether positive or negative, would be definitive. the medical examiner commented on the presence of pulmonary oedema. the fact that there was minimal suspension does not rule out suicide. the second evidence adduced by the applicants was an undated report produced at the applicants’ request by coroner th.v. he identified in particular the lack of reference to the existence or not of haemorrhagic infiltration where the rope was positioned, as well as the precise position of the rope with reference to the neck (obliquely or vertically directed). v. included in his report a number of elements of evidence which precluded certain conclusions as to the cause of death. in respect of the written statement given by f.k., a fresh examination of the place of death could also prove useful as long as the place was still intact. 865/25-11-2013 on the exhumed body, drawn up on 25 november 2013 by the forensic and toxicology laboratory of the school of medicine of athens university, the results were negative as regards the presence of poison or medication. his report dated 12 april 2012 stated that the deceased did not betray any of the personality characteristics associated with a suicide risk.
the first applicant is a french national who was born in 1970 and lives in mouroux. they live in mouroux, massy, valentigney and thulay respectively. on 12 november 2009, at about 4.30 p.m., m.b., he was known to the staff there, where he habitually went to collect the medicine prescribed for his psychiatric disorders. sat down on one of the chairs for customers at the pharmacy. when he vehemently refused, sergeant l. and constable d. seized him by the arm in order to remove him from the pharmacy. deputy police sergeant p. went to get the police vehicle to move it closer to the pharmacy. according to the incident room’s telephone log, at 5.07 p.m. the fire brigade asked the police to transfer m.b. he had calmed down, but his heart rate could not be measured with the pulse oximeter because the sensors were not working. on the same day mr s., a volunteer firefighter, was also questioned. he explained that he had requested medical reinforcements and that then, when they observed that his heart had stopped beating, the firemen had decided to take him back into the pharmacy to continue carrying out cardiac massage. on 13 november 2009 one of the pharmacists was questioned a second time. ’s right leg and that, just in front of the entrance to the pharmacy, m.b., deputy sergeant l. was also questioned on 13 november 2009. the other facial injuries suggested close contact on a rough surface. recent traumatic injuries consistent with action by third parties were observed. she said that she had seen four police officers with a man lying face down with his arms behind his back being punched and kicked. on 3 december 2009 a judicial investigation for manslaughter was opened in respect of a person or persons unknown and assigned to two investigating judges. on an unknown date the applicants applied to join the proceedings as civil parties. he said that the blows administered by constable m. and described as “two punches to the suspect’s abdominal area with the aim of distracting and and securely handcuffing him [were] among the priority areas for attempting to weaken the resistance of the person concerned. reports were produced by several experts appointed by one of the investigating judges. they did not indicate evidence of any “factor suggesting death by chest compression”. at the levels measured, the ingestion of psychoactive drugs revealed by the toxicological investigations does not appear capable of explaining the victim’s death by a process of direct toxicity. ... when the smur [mobile emergency and intensive care service] intervened the criterion of seriousness was ... the fact that [m.b.] had been suffering from heart failure for approximately twenty minutes. he found that whilst the police officers had been very quick to seek the assistance of the fire brigade and the emergency medical service, it was regrettable that the situation had been inaccurately described by the incident room to the firemen prior to their intervention (the latter had been informed of m.b. on 21 december 2012 the investigating judges ruled that there was no case to answer. whilst the intervention by the police inevitably generated stress, the victim had already been stressed well before their intervention. the applicants appealed against that ruling. the investigation division found that m.b.
the applicant company is a limited liability company registered in the town of kstovo, in the nizhegorodskiy region. in 2008 it changed its name to zemlyaki publishing house. the applicant company is the founder, editor and publisher of a local newspaper, zemlyaki, printed in kstovo and distributed in the kstovskiy district. in 2004 the applicant company published a series of articles commenting on the professional activity of y.l., the then head of the kstovo district administration (“the district administration”). i just do not understand, where exactly did you see the ‘strict economy regime’. and the setting up of mts was entirely your initiative and [it is your] creation. the trade committee is renting out the land for street commerce, but the profits somehow do not get back into the budget. you personally had given out the biggest shops for external management for free before the year in question, which resulted in budgetary losses of a few million roubles. i would not be surprised if [the shops] were sold by the trade committee to the ‘right people’, avoiding an open auction and following a well-established scheme (as was the case with your mercedes car). the marmoset (мартышка) borrowed money from a bank to pay her debts. she did repay them, but afterwards the bank required her to pay back both the loan and interest. in another article concerning the same subject matter, this time in issue 13 (402) dated 20 march 2004, authored by z.o. and entitled “the golden grin awards” (“вручение премии оскал”), the newspaper published a photo collage depicting y.l. for a rational proposal on the subject: how to dispose of industrial waste in village administration. the essence of the proposal is simple: ‘we could blow anything up. it is a pity that the employees of waste disposal services have not thought about this yet. or, more accurately, is going up in flames. or, even more precisely, has been blown to bits.” complained about the articles to the kstovo city court. he claimed that the articles published in the applicant company’s newspaper had contained defamatory and damaging material. on 31 august 2004 the court issued a judgment in which it granted y.l. 13 (402) dated 20 march 2004 in the article ‘the golden grin awards’ is defamatory to the claimant’s honour, dignity and reputation; and in particular, in the article ‘success has turned his head’, the defendant n.g. in the russian language dictionary edited by a.p. considering the events of last year: terrorist acts in america, russia, spain, iraq, the world’s public opinion on bin laden as terrorist no. 1, the court finds that the publication is defamatory to the honour, dignity and business reputation of the claimant and creates an image of an aggressive, cruel and fanatical actor. the court declared the information in question erroneous and defamatory, and ordered the applicant company to pay an amount of a symbolic value to the claimant in damages and publish a retraction phrased in the following terms:
“the editorial board of the [applicant company] offers its apologies to the head of the kstovo district administration, y.l., on 22 october 2004 the nizhegorodskiy regional court upheld the judgment on appeal. this being so, the court judgment was taken lawfully and justifiably, there being no grounds to quash it...”. further attempts by the applicant company to have the case reviewed by way of supervisory review procedure were unsuccessful.
the applicants were born in 1971 and 1997 respectively and live in st petersburg. in october 2000 the fms extended the forced migrant status of the first applicant and her mother until 2 june 2001. in july 2001 the second applicant was registered as living in the room. on 8 november 2001 the fms deprived the first applicant of her status as a forced migrant on the grounds that she had not applied in due time for it to be extended. according to the first applicant, she was not informed of that decision until 2003. on 20 february and 8 may 2003 respectively the fms upheld its decision of 8 november 2001 and dismissed the first applicant’s request. in february 2009 the first applicant’s mother died. the applicants did not vacate the room and continued to live in it. in december 2009 the applicants were placed on the waiting list for social housing. on 19 january 2010 the applicant applied to the fms with a new request to re-establish her forced migrant status. on 25 january 2010 the fms upheld its decision of 8 november 2001. the first applicant decided to challenge that decision in court. in particular, the court held that the first applicant had had valid reasons for missing the deadline for applying for an extension of her forced migrant status. on 25 january 2011 the st petersburg city court quashed the decision of 3 november 2010 and dismissed the first applicant’s complaint against the decision of the fms of 25 january 2010. therefore, there were no grounds for declaring that decision unlawful. the local authorities objected to the eviction, because the room was the only dwelling available to the second applicant. the applicants submitted that their eviction would be in breach of article 8 of the convention, since it was not necessary in a democratic society. the room in question was their only dwelling. they had been on the waiting list for social housing since 2009. in particular, the district court held as follows:
“... panyushkina m.s. [ the first applicant] lost her forced migrant status in 2001, her minor son has never had such a status, and therefore the court comes to the conclusion that the respondents unlawfully occupy the disputed housing and should be evicted without the provision of any alternative accommodation ...” 25. on 4 october 2012 the st petersburg city court upheld the eviction order. the first applicant] in her grounds of appeal, whereby the eviction from the disputed housing without the provision of any alternative accommodation is a violation of their [the applicants’] housing rights, since they do not have any other housing. on 22 november 2012 the bailiff instituted enforcement proceedings with regard to the eviction order. the applicants were given five days to comply voluntarily with the judgment of 15 may 2012. the government submitted that it had been open to the applicants to apply for an extension of that agreement. the applicants submitted that it had not been possible to ask for any extension of the agreement. on 12 september 2013 the applicants vacated the disputed room in compliance with the eviction order of 15 may 2012. her landlord had not registered her as living at the address of the rented room. according to the information provided by the government, in 2016 the administration of the primorskiy district of st petersburg prepared a draft order for the removal of the second applicant from the waiting list of persons eligible for social housing.
the applicant was born in 1972 and lives in dublin, ireland. in 2004 he married a slovak national and the couple settled in ireland. their two children, born in 2006 and 2008, are both irish nationals. on 6 january 2011 the mother travelled to slovakia with the two children and they have not returned to ireland since. on 1 july and 26 october 2011 respectively, the bratislava i district court and, following an appeal by the mother, the bratislava regional court, ordered the return of the children to ireland as their country of habitual residence and issued several ancillary orders. the return order became enforceable on 8 july 2011. on 6 february 2012 the applicant applied for judicial enforcement of the return order since the mother had not complied with it. on 9 february 2012 the michalovce district court attempted to have the mother comply voluntarily with the order. in response, she informed the district court that she had lodged a request with the prosecutor general for him to exercise his discretionary power to challenge the return order by way of an extraordinary appeal on points of law (mimoriadne dovolanie). they based their conclusions on the following two grounds. firstly, they concluded that there already existed a previous decision on provisional measures, which had been delivered by the michalovce district court on 16 may 2011. those interim custody rights were to be determined later by the competent courts in ireland. secondly, the return order had failed to specify that it was directed at the mother or to give a precise time frame for its implementation. given the fact that the mother had not been identified as the recipient and that the applicant had not been provisionally entrusted with the care of the children, the order could not be enforced. following the unsuccessful enforcement proceedings, the applicant applied to the same court which had delivered the return order, the bratislava i district court. he referred to the shortcomings in the order as identified by the enforcement courts and asked the court to specify to whom the order had been directed and to provide a time frame for the return of the children. the district court concluded that the applicant’s action was res iudicata and dismissed it on 6 november 2014. consequently, the constitutional court quashed the contested decision, remitted the applicant’s appeal against the district court’s decision of 18 october 2012 to the regional court for re‑examination and awarded him 3,000 euros (eur) in compensation for non‑pecuniary damage. in addition, the constitutional court awarded the applicant everything he had claimed in legal costs (eur 276.94). the judgment was final and not amenable to appeal. following the first constitutional judgment, the enforcement proceedings resumed before the regional court, which heard the case on 3 august 2015. however, having regard to the considerable length of time that had elapsed, it deemed it necessary to assess afresh all the circumstances decisive for the enforcement of the return order, such as the children’s whereabouts, their health and the possibility of their returning to ireland. it therefore quashed the district court’s decision under appeal and remitted the matter to it for re-examination. on 15 april 2016 the district court again declared enforcement of the order impermissible on the basis of newly obtained evidence. following an appeal by the applicant, the regional court upheld the lower court’s decision on 3 august 2016 and it became final and binding on 22 august 2016. in the meantime, the applicant on 22 february 2016 lodged another constitutional complaint aimed at the enforcement proceedings held before the district court (see paragraph 25 above). it also reproached the district court for the inadequate way it had dealt with the mother’s procedural requests. moreover, the constitutional court found that there had been a violation of the applicant’s right to respect for his family life as a consequence of the fact that throughout the enforcement proceedings, whose length had been in breach of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time, he had been unable to assert his parental rights before the competent courts. after the enforcement proceedings had been completed by a final and binding decision and before the second constitutional judgment had been issued, the applicant applied to the constitutional court a third time on 14 october 2016. he relied on that occasion on article 6 (fairness and length) in conjunction with articles 13 and 8 (family life) of the convention and challenged the decisions of 15 april and 3 august 2016 (see paragraphs 26 and 27 above) on their merits.

the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in reykjavík. he served as minister of finance in the years 1998 to 2005, minister for foreign affairs from 2005 to 2006 and prime minister from 2006 to 2009. after parliamentary elections in may 2007 the applicant led the government which was formed by the independence party (sjálfstæðisflokkurinn), of which he was a member, and the social democratic alliance (samfylkingin). in the beginning of october 2008 the icelandic banking system collapsed. lög um heimild til fjárveitingar úr ríkissjóði vegna sérstakra aðstæðna á fjármálamarkaði ofl., the sic made an extensive investigation during which it collected information from individuals, financial institutions and public institutions, conducted formal hearings with 147 individuals and meetings with a further 183 individuals. on 12 april 2010 the sic issued its report which contained a detailed description of the causes of the collapse of the icelandic banks as well as serious criticism of the acts and omissions of a number of public officials and institutions. in 2009 parliament passed an amendment to the sic act according to which it was to elect an ad hoc parliamentary review committee (þingmannanefndin; hereafter “the prc”) “to address the report of the sic on the collapse of the banks, and form recommendations as to parliament’s response to the sic’s conclusions”. she also submitted a draft text for part of an indictment. the committee received replies from 14 individuals, including the applicant who submitted his reply by letter of 7 june 2010. on 11 september 2010 the prc submitted a proposal for a parliamentary resolution to commence impeachment proceedings against four cabinet members: the three mentioned above (including the applicant) and ms ingibjörg sólrún gísladóttir, who was the former minister of foreign affairs and the head of the social democratic alliance. with similar small majorities, the votes concerning the other former ministers led to the conclusion that they should not be indicted. on the same day, 28 september 2010, the applicant designated a lawyer for his defence. the parliament resolution, containing the exact points of indictment, the prc’s proposal and an explanatory memorandum with the reasons for the proposal, was made available on the website of the parliament. it appears that counsel did not make any comments or requests in reply. on 11 april 2011 the applicant’s counsel was provided with a usb memory stick containing the documents which the prosecutor had obtained from the sic database. there was nevertheless specific reason to do so, especially after the meeting on 7 february 2008 between him, ingibjörg sólrún gísladóttur, árni m. mathiesen and the chairman of the board of governors of the central bank of iceland; after his and ingibjörg sólrún gísladóttir’s meeting on 1 april 2008 with the board of governors of the central bank of iceland; and following a declaration to the swedish, danish and norwegian central banks, which was signed on 15 may 2008. 4/1963, and, alternatively, section 141 of the general penal code, no. the case was filed by the prosecution with the court of impeachment on 7 june 2011. it had been apparent that important government matters had not been discussed by the cabinet and the knowledge that the defendant had demonstrably possessed had not been reported to the ministers. moreover, the applicant’s defence counsel had not asked that the applicant be heard during the investigative stage, although such an opportunity was provided by section 16(2) of the court of impeachment act and the prosecutor had invited him, by a letter of 9 december 2010, to make comments or request further information to be collected. 88/2008), according to which he or she is authorised to take various measures, including the collection of information and the making of decisions affecting the position of a suspect. however, the conduct imputed to the applicant in counts 1.1 and 1.2 had not been specified with sufficient clarity and these charges were accordingly dismissed. furthermore, the penal provisions invoked by the prosecution were worded in such a way that they could be interpreted on the basis of objective criteria and were clear enough to enable a proper defence. it started with the formal testimony of the applicant, the first statement he gave since the charges had been brought against him. even though parliamentary responsibility places great restraint on a minister, the constitution assumes that a breach in office on his part may entail criminal liability, as further laid down by law. in regard to the applicant’s motion to have the whole case dismissed due to the alleged lack of clarity of section 8(c) of the ministerial accountability act, the court of impeachment considered that the words “important government matters” in article 17 of the constitution, to which section 8(c) referred, could easily be understood by a reasonable man in the office held by the applicant and that the provisions contained predictable and reasonable criteria regarding the minister’s discharge of official duties. as regards the specific conduct imputed to the applicant, the court stated, inter alia, the following:
“according to that which has been related above, it is considered proved beyond doubt in the case that the great danger facing the icelandic banks and thus the welfare of the state was not discussed at cabinet meetings in the period from february 2008 until the end of september the same year. that was all the more urgent as the defendant did not convey important information which he possessed about the affairs of the banks to the minister for business affairs, to whom they pertained. for this reason it had been very important to discuss the danger facing the banking system within a small group, in full confidentiality.
the applicant company, a limited liability company based in vienna, owns and publishes the daily newspaper der standard and the online news portal derstandard.at. the carinthian regional hospital operating company (landeskrankenanstalten-betriebsgesellschaft – hereinafter “the kabeg”) is a public-law institution (anstalt öffentlichen rechts) which operates five hospitals in carinthia previously owned by the region of carinthia (land kärnten). the supervisory board consists of three members of the regional government, one person who is appointed by the regional government and two representatives of the employees of the kabeg. the chairperson of the supervisory board is appointed by the regional government. was the member of the board of management in charge of human resources. was deputy governor of the region of carinthia. on 28 october 2010 the medical director of klagenfurt regional hospital (landeskrankenhaus), who was in charge at that time, criticised i.m. in a confidential employees’ meeting of the medical doctors of the hospital. only a few hours later the medical director was dismissed without notice. was dismissed without notice immediately after the employees’ meeting. the informant was a trainee lawyer under [i.m.] he] took the blame and therefore had to explain himself before the bar association. referring to the statement, that he was supposed to be the spiritus rector of the spying operation, initiated private prosecution proceedings for defamation under the media act (mediengesetz) against the applicant company. the applicant company argued that the statement was a critical but permissible value judgment and had had a factual basis: k.s. had personally initiated or ordered that a spy be sent to the employees’ meeting; however, by regularly applying and publicly announcing such practices he had created a climate and environment where such unfair methods were anticipated as “normal” and commonplace. ’s claims under the media act as inadmissible, reasoning that the term spiritus rector was neither defamatory nor mocking, nor did it allege specific conduct. on 18 april 2012, following a prior complaint lodged by k.s., had been the “spin doctor” (ideengeber) of the spying operation. it was thus required to examine the factual basis of the article. having acted as a spin doctor or the like. it maintained its position that the statement was a value judgment. on account of defamation, and to publish the judgment. on 26 september 2012 the vienna court of appeal dismissed the applicant company’s appeal against this decision. the applicant company subsequently lodged an application for renewal of the criminal proceedings (erneuerung des strafverfahrens) under article 363a of the code of criminal procedure (strafprozeßordnung) with the supreme court (oberster gerichtshof), complaining under article 10 of the convention of a violation of its right to freedom of expression. on 26 june 2013 the supreme court rejected the application. it concluded that the interference with the applicant company’s right to freedom of expression had been prescribed by law, had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of others and had been necessary in the circumstances of the case, in particular taking into account the low amount of compensation granted. ’s application, would have a binding effect on the civil proceedings. on 19 march 2012, during a hearing, the vienna commercial court (handelsgericht) suspended the proceedings until the termination of the proceedings under the media act, holding that they should only be continued at one party’s request. ’s request of 1 october 2012, the commercial court resumed the proceedings on an unspecified date. on 19 november 2012 the commercial court granted the injunction, finding that the criminal conviction in the proceedings under the media act had binding effect on the injunction proceedings.
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in sarajevo, bosnia and herzegovina. on 6 august 2008 the pula county state attorney’s office informed the investigating judge that the applicant also used another telephone number, and requested an authorisation for the tapping thereof. in the ensuing period several further meetings and contacts between the applicant and the undercover agent took place. on 22 november 2008 the applicant, accompanied by his brother d.s., on that occasion he sold him 600 counterfeit 100 euro notes for 21,000 euros (eur). on the same day the applicant was brought before an investigating judge of the pula county court for questioning, during which he remained silent. the investigating judge ordered his remand in custody. as a witness but he invoked his testimonial privilege as the applicant’s brother and gave no evidence. in the course of the investigation, the investigating judge obtained an expert report stating that the 600 banknotes of 100 euro which the applicant had sold to the undercover agents were counterfeit. on 23 january 2009 the investigating judge questioned the undercover agent e.k. the applicant’s lawyer was present during the questioning. wished, they could arrange a further purchase of a larger quantity of such banknotes. on that occasion the applicant had offered e.k. the opportunity to buy a further 15,000 counterfeit euros. testified that a further meeting with the applicant had taken place in odra after a phone call from the applicant. following this exchange they had been in contact by phone but they had not met. they had then agreed to stay in touch and exchanged phone numbers. the illicit exchange had then taken place and the applicant had afterwards been arrested. a three-judge panel of the pazin municipal court confirmed the indictment on 10 march 2009 and sent the case for trial. following the applicant’s questioning, the trial bench concluded the trial proceedings and heard the parties’ closing arguments. it also confiscated hrk 300 (approximately eur 40) and eur 8,500 from the applicant and ordered his expulsion from croatia. also explained that a simulated purchase operation was sometimes carried out just once and sometimes on several occasions. was unable to recall who had initiated the meeting in lupoglav in mid-october 2008 when he had introduced the applicant to the second undercover agent a.b. nor could he say who had initiated the other meetings. at a hearing on 27 april 2010 the pazin municipal court heard the parties’ closing arguments. on the same day the pazin municipal court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to five years and six months’ imprisonment. taking note of the recorded statements of the undercover agents during their communications [with the applicant], it was established that the purpose of the communications was [organising] a meeting with the accused in order to effectuate a simulated purchase. those were attempts to contact the accused in the period which was ‘covered’ by the [investigating judge’s order]. contacted the accused only after the use of special investigative measures had been ordered and there is therefore no unlawfulness in his conduct. and the fact that the first meeting took place almost a month later (on 6 august 2008) ‒ when the undercover agent in duga resa bought one 100 euro counterfeit note from the accused for the amount of hrk 300 ‒ cannot be considered as an incitement but was a tactical action aimed at gaining the confidence of the accused and further uttering of counterfeit euros.
the applicant was born in 1953 and lives in katyr-yurt, the chechen republic. he is the father of mr r., who died of tuberculosis in a prison hospital. 4 in the arkhangelsk region where he was to serve his twelve-year sentence. on admission to that facility, he underwent a general medical check-up permed by a prison doctor who concluded that he was healthy. on 10 march 2005 mr r. complained to the prison medical authorities of fatigue and a cough. mr r. was admitted to the prison medical unit and prescribed medication and a special dietary regime. treatment with five first-line drugs was prescribed. it was started about two weeks later, but had no effect on mr r.’s health. on 12 april 2005 a drug susceptibility test was performed. in the light of the above, on 23 april 2005 mr r. was transferred to the arkhangelsk regional prison tuberculosis hospital (“regional prison hospital”), where his treatment continued as previously prescribed. according to the applicant, mr r. was unsatisfied with the quality of his treatment. in early may 2005 both the applicant and mr r. unsuccessfully sought the latter’s transfer to a medical facility located in a southern region, where mr r. could have been provided with adequate treatment in a more suitable climate. in the meantime, regular chest x-ray examinations showed that mr r.’s health was continuing to deteriorate. by mid-july 2005 pulmonary cavities had appeared, and his condition had become serious. on 18 july 2005 the regional prison hospital received the result of the drug susceptibility test of 12 april 2005. it revealed that mr r.’s tuberculosis was resistant to four antibiotics being used in his treatment. there are no regular entries showing the actual intake of the new drugs. in september 2006 the applicant asked for criminal proceedings to be instituted into the circumstances leading to his son’s death. on 21 october 2006 the primorskiy inter-district prosecutor’s office refused to open a criminal case. its page-long decision was based on the autopsy report and general information on mr r.’s treatment submitted by the prison medical authorities. by a letter of 9 january 2007 a prosecutor informed the applicant that a criminal inquiry had established that his son had contracted tuberculosis in early march 2005. the correctional colony had promptly identified the disease and had ensured treatment keeping the disease under control. the investigating authorities did not assess the quality of the medical services provided between late april and september 2005. shortly thereafter he had undergone medical testing. ms b. stressed that the testing had been complex and that the hospital had only received the test result in august 2005. they had prescribed treatment with advanced antibiotics. however, by that time pathological changes in the patient’s body had already become irreversible. having regard to the investigation file, the court noted that the investigating authorities had solicited neither the autopsy report nor medical documents concerning mr r.’s treatment and that they had not interviewed any doctor involved in the treatment. ten days later the district court re-examined the case. the applicant’s claim was accordingly rejected.
the applicant was born in 1961 and lived until his arrest in the town of yuzhno-sakhalinsk, the sakhalin region. on 3 april 2003 the applicant was apprehended in a flat with unregistered firearms in his possession. four tied persons with traces of beatings, including mr p., were discovered in a cloakroom of the flat. an investigator of the sakhalin regional police department drew up an arrest record. on the following day the applicant’s detention on remand was authorised. a week later the applicant was charged with a number of crimes, including organisation and leadership of an armed gang, several counts of aggravated kidnapping, extortion, robbery and fraud, as well as illegal possession of firearms. the applicant’s detention was further extended by the yuzhno‑sakhalinsk town court and the sakhalin regional court on thirteen occasions up until his conviction. when extending the applicant’s detention, the domestic courts referred to the particular gravity and quantity of the charges against him; complexity of the criminal investigation and difficulties of jury trial; the applicant’s liability to abscond, re-offend and interfere with the course of justice, given his personality and criminal record; significant volume of evidence presented by the defence during the trial. the applicant’s requests for release on bail, as well as his appeal complaints against the detention orders, were to no avail. on 21 april 2004 the applicant and his lawyers started studying the case file materials comprising nineteen volumes, 200-300 pages long each. on 7 september 2004 the town court set a time-limit for studying, affording the applicant additional twenty working days to complete it. on 29 december 2004 the case was referred to the regional court for trial. on 6 april 2006 the regional court, by a jury verdict, found the applicant and six of his accomplices guilty as charged. on 12 may 2006 the regional court, relying on the jury verdict, sentenced the applicant to twenty-one years’ imprisonment. the applicant was found guilty, in particular, of an aggravated fraud, robbery, kidnapping and extortion in respect of mr l., a businessman from the moscow region. the jury found that in may 2001 the applicant had approached mr l. under the pretence of being a car salesman. the applicant had promised mr l. to sell him a car for approximately 600,000 russian roubles (rub). however, after mr l. had transferred the money to an account indicated by the applicant, the latter had disappeared. in october 2002 the applicant contacted mr l., told him that he had just returned from japan with his car and invited him to come to sakhalin for it. on his arrival at the airport of yuzhno-sakhalinsk on 13 october 2002 mr l. was met by mr k., one of the applicant’s accomplices, and taken to the applicant’s country house where he was held until 6 november 2002, being subjected to beatings and extortion by the applicant and his gang. neither mr k., nor mr l. were heard in open court. mr k. had been found dead in a remand prison cell before the trial commenced. as for mr l., residing in the moscow region, the trial court attempted to secure his presence on several occasions by summoning him and ordering his escort to the court. in reply he informed the trial court about being unable to travel to yuzhno-sakhalinsk in view of his spinal disease and a medical contraindication to air travel. he submitted a number of documents in support, as well as a written notice in which he confirmed his pre-trial statements. having regard to these circumstances, the trial court allowed the prosecution’s request to read out mr l. and mr k.’s statements incriminating the applicant, despite the latter’s objections. the jury further established that in september and december 2002 and in march 2003 the applicant had organised an armed robbery and kidnapping of eight other victims, including mr p. and had extorted a large sum of money in exchange for their freedom. mr p. also was not heard in court as he was allegedly on vacation in ukraine. disregarding the applicant’s objections, the regional court read out mr p.’s pre-trial statements against the applicant. the applicant’s lawyer appealed against the judgment of the regional court, complaining, among other matters, about the decision to read out pre-trial statements by mr l., mr p. and mr k. on 14 november 2007 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the judgment of the regional court, noting that it had correctly considered that reasons for the witnesses’ absence had been extraordinary and that it had lawfully read out their pre-trial statements.
the applicant was born in 1974 and is detained in diyarbakır. on 8 march 1995 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of hizbullah, an illegal organisation. the applicant’s right of access to a lawyer was restricted during his police custody according to the now defunct law no. on the same day he was examined by a doctor at his own request. the doctor noted, in a police document, that there was no sign of physical violence on the applicant’s body. on 16 march 1995 the applicant was taken part in “an identification parade with statements (ifadeli yüzleştirme tutanağı)” with other accused persons and identified, in the absence of a lawyer, certain persons as members of the said organisation and confessed to committing a murder. on 26 march 1995 the applicant further participated in the reconstruction of the events (olay ve yer gösterme) in the course of which he had confessed, in the absence a lawyer, having carried out an arson attack. on 29 march 1995 the applicant was questioned by the police officers in the absence of a lawyer. in his statement, the applicant gave a detailed description about his involvement in hizbullah. on 5 april 1995 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and the investigating judge respectively, again in the absence of a lawyer. before the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, the applicant denied his police statements claiming that he had been subjected to torture. the investigating judge ordered the applicant’s detention on remand. on the same day and before his statements were taken, he had been examined by a doctor at the request of the police. the doctor noted, in a police document, that there was no sign of physical violence on the applicant’s body. on 12 april 1995 he was examined by a doctor at his own request claiming that he had been subjected to torture while in police custody. the doctor noted that there was no sign of physical violence on the applicant’s body. on 2 may 1995 the applicant gave evidence as complainant before the public prosecutor and stated that the had been subjected to various forms of torture, which included beatings, electric shock treatment, blindfolding, hosing with cold water, and being stripped naked. on 23 may 1995 the public prosecutor at the diyarbakır state security court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant and several other persons. the applicant was accused of carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory, proscribed by article 125 of the former criminal code. on 19 october 1995 the state security court held the first hearing in the case. 5190 of 16 june 2004, published in the official gazette on 30 june 2004, state security courts were abolished. the case against the applicant was transferred to the diyarbakır assize court. on 31 march 2005 the diyarbakır assize court convicted the applicant of attempting to undermine the constitutional order, proscribed by article 146 § 1 of the former criminal code, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. on 11 december 2006 the court of cassation quashed the judgment of 31 march 2005 in respect of some of the accused, including the applicant, and remitted the case to the diyarbakır assize court. on 9 november 2007, the diyarbakır assize court convicted the applicant of attempting to undermine the constitutional order, proscribed by article 146 § 1 of the former criminal code, and sentenced him to life imprisonment again. on 19 january 2009 the court of cassation upheld the first-instance court’s judgment.
the applicants were born in 1969 and 1961 respectively and live in podgorica. on 24 february 2011 the dean issued a decision introducing video surveillance in seven amphitheatres and in front of the dean’s office (ispred dekanata). the decision stated that access to the data that was collected was protected by codes which were known only to the dean. they relied on the personal data protection act (see paragraphs 24‑27 below).the applicants submitted, in particular, that the amphitheatre where they taught was locked both before and after the classes, that the only property there was fixed desks and chairs and a blackboard, that they knew of no reason to fear for anybody’s safety and that, in any event, there were other methods for protecting people and property and monitoring classes. they requested that the cameras be removed and the data erased. according to them, there had been cases of destruction of university property, the bringing in of animals, drink and tobacco, and the presence of people who were not students. while the decision on introducing video surveillance had provided that data would be stored for a year, the servers’ capacity was such that the data was stored for thirty days and then automatically erased by new recordings. on 22 march 2011 the applicants filed an objection to the report, submitting, inter alia, that they were not aware of any of the alleged incidents and that, in any event, it was unclear how such cameras could ensure the safety of people and property. they agreed that cameras over the entrances and exits from the university building might perhaps be an adequate form of ensuring such security. notably, the decision had been issued on 24 february 2011 whereas surveillance had commenced a few weeks before. they did not specify when exactly but referred to the minutes of the session of 1 february 2011 (see paragraph 6 above). on 28 april 2011, after the applicants’ objection to the report, the agency’s council (savjet agencije za zaštitu ličnih podataka) issued a decision (rješenje) ordering the school of mathematics to remove the cameras from the auditoriums within fifteen days as the video surveillance was not in accordance with the personal data protection act, notably sections 10, 35 and 36 (see paragraphs 24, and 26-27 below). none of the parties initiated an administrative dispute in court against that decision. on 25 january 2012 the school of mathematics was served with the agency council’s decision of 28 april 2011. the cameras were removed by 27 january 2012 at the latest. it appears that the data that had been collected was also erased on an unspecified date. they submitted in particular that such an interference with their private lives, without any possibility to control that process, was not provided for by any piece of legislation and that therefore it had not been in accordance with the law, within the meaning of article 8 § 2 of the convention. they also maintained that it had not pursued any legitimate aim and had not been necessary in a democratic society. on 27 december 2012 the court of first instance (osnovni sud) in podgorica ruled against the applicants. it was a working area, just like a courtroom or parliament, where professors were never alone, and therefore they could not invoke any right to privacy that could be violated. the data that had been collected could thereby also not be considered as personal data. those events had led to the hiring of a private security agency two or three years earlier. according to the witness, the police had suggested installing video surveillance equipment on the school’s premises. the court, for its part, did not deal with those issues. on 31 december 2012 the applicants appealed. they relied, inter alia, on article 8 of the convention. it had also not been necessary in a democratic society. furthermore, the court of first instance had not relied on any legal provision in ruling against them and had failed to assess their arguments. on 17 july 2013 the high court (viši sud) in podgorica upheld the first-instance judgment, endorsing its reasons in substance. the applicants did not file a constitutional appeal.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in nalchik, the ingushetiya republic. on 10 october 2006 the applicant was travelling by a collective taxi from nalchik to grozny in chechnya. at about 1 p.m. a police officer stopped the vehicle at the ingush-chechen administrative border and proceeded to check the passengers’ identity documents. the applicant raised his objections, claiming that the wrong kind of ink did not render his passport invalid. the police first took the applicant by car to the goragorsk police station (том пос. горагорск) where an inspector told him that he was “temporarily detained for the purpose of drawing up a report”. once the report had been completed at 3.15 p.m., another police officer took the applicant, again by police car, from goragorsk the nadterechnyi district police station (одч надтереченского района). an operative established his identity, verified his documents and let him go at 5.10 p.m. the station chief later stated that the applicant had “thanked him for a prompt release”. the applicant asked the supervising prosecutor to investigate whether the police had abused their powers by detaining him. the nadterechnyi district prosecutor’s office issued several decisions refusing institution of criminal proceedings. one of them was set aside by the nadterechnyi district court on 13 july 2007 for the following reasons:
“the issue whether the administrative detention of mr timishev was necessary has not been clarified. pursuant to article 27.3(1) of the code of administrative offences, administrative detention may be applied in exceptional circumstances if this is necessary for the prompt and proper examination of the alleged administrative offence. the decision ... refusing institution of criminal proceedings indicates that a report on the administrative offence ... was compiled and forwarded to [mr timishev’s] place of residence. in these circumstances, the court sees no grounds for the administrative detention of mr timishev.” subsequent decisions refusing institution of criminal proceedings stated alternatively that it was impossible to establish the time of the applicant’s detention because it had not been recorded in any documents, that the applicant had been detained for disobeying police orders, that he had been actually free to go after 3.15 p.m. but had asked to be taken to the nadterechnyi office to file a complaint there and the police had ensured his safe passage. each time the prosecutor concluded that the police had not committed any prosecutable offence. on 27 january 2009 the nadterechnyi district court identified a number of serious shortcomings in the investigation. the court pointed out that it had not been established why the report on the administrative office could not have been drafted at the checkpoint and why it was considered necessary to escort the applicant to goragorsk. it remained unclear what had happened to the report: the investigator had not obtained the forwarding letter or any information about the outcome of the proceedings. the investigator had not inquired why an escorting report required under article 27.2(3) of the code or the detention report required under article 27.4 of the code had not been prepared. nor had he determined what “exceptional circumstances” within the meaning of article 27.3(1) had called for the applicant’s detention and at what time the applicant had actually left the nadterechnyi police station. the court was not convinced that the applicant had asked the police to take him to the nadterechnyi office to file a complaint. it considered implausible that the police had provided a car and an escort to help him complain about their conduct. even assuming that he had indeed wished to make a complaint, the investigator did not establish what had happened to it or, alternatively, why he had not written it, or why he had gone there in person instead of sending it by post from goragorsk. finally, the court criticised the investigator’s assumption that the applicant had committed an administrative offence. it noted that, according to the guidance on issuing passports (order no. 605 of 15 september 1997), the head of the passports department should have asked the passport holder to sign the passport with special ink. responsibility for the wrong kind of ink should lie with the official who departed from the guidance rather than with the applicant. on 9 april 2009 the investigator issued a further decision refusing institution of criminal proceedings. it was similar in its wording to the previous ones and did not touch upon the areas of concern identified in the district court’s judgment.
the applicant was born in 1950 and is detained in dob pri mirni. were brought before the investigating judge. the applicant, who was assisted by counsel, gave the following statement in his defence. in order to demand that he pay rent for workers who had previously been accommodated in his flat and to cancel their residence registration at that address. had defended himself with a wooden clothes hanger. the applicant’s knife had had a ten-centimetre blade. testified that after being told that something was going on outside the bar he had gone out and found s.m. had approached them and a few seconds later they had started to fight. only those six people had been involved in the fight. he testified that the applicant and his sons had been the weaker parties in the fight until the applicant had pulled out a knife, saying, “now let us see”, and using it to attack š.a., stated during the questioning that his work visa was valid until january 2007. to a hearing that had been scheduled for 11 september 2008. on 20 march 2009 the court received a statement from i.b., however, in order to comply with the summons, he included his testimony, which he had given to the notary. wrote to the court to say that his father was very ill and that therefore he could not travel for the following two to three weeks. on his knees and the applicant stabbing him. he was asked to explain the difference between his testimony during the investigation, when he said he had fought with one of the applicant’s sons, and at the hearing, when he had said that he had not fought back. had sustained four wounds to his back and a number of wounds to his chest. in a judgment of fifty-four pages, the court established on the basis of the testimony, telephone and gps data that the applicant had called š.a. to sign the statement, but he had refused. it had finished when the applicant and his sons had left the scene and š.a. moreover, the court noted that none of the witnesses had testified that the applicant had lain on the floor and been kicked by the other men. on 7 july 2011 the higher court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. moreover, the higher court considered that the applicant had failed to comply with paragraph 2 of section 371 of the criminal procedure act (see paragraph 39 below) as he had not substantiated in what way his inability to question the two witnesses at the trial had undermined the legality of the judgment. the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint. if the defendant has counsel, the investigating judge in principle informs only him. ...

“27. however, conditions in police stations will frequently - if not invariably - be inadequate for prolonged periods of detention. in the view of the cpt, in those cases where it is deemed necessary to deprive persons of their liberty for an extended period under aliens legislation, they should be accommodated in centres specifically designed for that purpose, offering material conditions and a regime appropriate to their legal situation and staffed by suitably-qualified personnel. further, care should be taken in the design and layout of the premises to avoid as far as possible any impression of a carceral environment. for example, detained irregular migrants ... should be restricted in their freedom of movement within the detention facility as little as possible.”

the applicant company was established in 1991 and has its registered office in bratislava. it is the operator of two private television channels and the broadcaster of a television programme, joj plus. the present case concerns a commentary (glosa) delivered during a television programme broadcast on 12 april 2010 after the crash of the plane in which the late president of poland, lech kaczynski, had been travelling. the commentary’s title was “compassion in accordance with protocol”; the commentary contained the following:
“the crash of a polish plane carrying the presidential couple on board is a true human tragedy. the whole of poland is in mourning and politicians are more or less expressing their condolences. thus, slovak russophile politicians too shed a tear, albeit a forced one, over the death of the russophobe, lech kaczynski. even ordinary citizens, not bound by any protocol, are expressing their sorrow. jews, homosexuals, liberals, feminists and left‑oriented intellectuals are bitterly sorry for the death of a man who represented an extreme polish conservativism, and who was a symbol of a country where people who are not white heterosexual catholic poles were born as a punishment. following the broadcast of the above-mentioned commentary, the broadcasting council (rada pre vysielanie a retransmisiu) commenced administrative proceedings against the applicant company, pursuant to section 19(1)(a) of the broadcasting and retransmission act (law no. as amended - “the broadcasting act”), on 25 may 2010. on 14 september 2010 the broadcasting council found that the applicant company had breached its obligations under the broadcasting act in that the manner of processing and presenting the content of the commentary had interfered with the dignity of the late polish president, lech kaczynski. it fined the applicant company 5,000 euros (eur). the broadcasting council assessed the conflict between the applicant company’s freedom of expression and the protection of the human dignity of the late president. on the one hand, it acknowledged the aim of the commentator to express his opinion and his subjective stance on the social and political event through criticism, sarcasm and irony, which were inherent to journalistic expression. on the other hand, where the broadcasting council found difficulties was in particular the content of the last two sentences of the commentary (“i am sorry, but i do not pity the poles. the broadcasting council concluded that the manner in which the commentator had presented his opinion – that is to say his lack of regret for the polish president’s death – had contravened the duty to respect his human dignity. according to the broadcasting council, the degree of sarcasm and irony in the broadcast commentary had been so high that its content and the manner in which the author’s opinion had been presented had been sub‑standard and had dishonoured the late president. the broadcasting council noted that mr kaczynski, as president, was sufficiently recognisable as an “individual”, which was a prerequisite for the applicability of the protection of the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of “others” under section 19(1)(a) of the broadcasting act. it concluded that by broadcasting the aforesaid commentary the applicant company had committed an administrative offence (správny delikt) – in particular a breach of its duties under the said provision – and that imposing a fine on it in that respect was in order. it considered such a measure to be necessary in a democratic society, as it served a legitimate aim – that is to say the protection of the right to human dignity. on 10 march 2011 the supreme court upheld the broadcasting council’s decision. it rejected the applicant company’s argument that the broadcasting council had sanctioned it for voicing its political opinion. rather, the supreme court confirmed the broadcasting council’s conclusion about the defamatory character of the commentary in question and the interference with the late president’s human dignity. the applicant company lodged a complaint before the constitutional court challenging the decisions of the broadcasting council and the supreme court under articles 6 § 1 and 10 of the convention and articles 26 (freedom of expression) and 46 (right to judicial protection) of the constitution. it alleged that the decisions in question had been arbitrary, unfair and insufficiently reasoned and that their respective authors had breached its freedom of expression by sanctioning it for voicing its opinion regarding the late president as a politician. it considered, inter alia, that the above-mentioned authorities had duly explained their conclusions, without having overly strayed from a reasonable interpretation of the applicable rules and established practice. the constitutional court noted that the impugned commentary had expressed not only sarcasm and criticism of the late president’s policy but also a positive attitude towards his death. this very fact had interfered with his right to respect for his human dignity, which led the constitutional court to conclude that the domestic authorities’ decisions had not been arbitrary. as to the applicant company’s complaint under article 10 of the convention (and article 26 of the constitution), the constitutional court held that a general court could not bear “secondary liability” for a violation of fundamental rights and freedoms of a substantive nature unless there had been a constitutionally relevant violation of procedural rules. given that it had rejected the complaint concerning the alleged violation of procedural rules, it also had to reject the complaint relating to an alleged violation of a substantive provision.
the applicant was born in 1973 and lives in yekaterinburg. on 13 may 2009 he was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery. on the following day the verkh-isetskiy district court in yekaterinburg remanded him in custody and set the time-limit until 12 july 2009. on 13 july 2009 the district court granted a two-month extension of the detention period. however, on 31 july 2009 the sverdlovsk regional court quashed the extension order as it had been issued outside the authorised detention period, and ordered the applicant’s release. he was not allowed to leave the police ward and was re-arrested on the charge of theft. the arrest record mentioned the charge, without specifying when or where the theft had been committed or why the applicant was suspected of it. on 2 august 2009 the district court adjourned the detention hearing for seventy-two hours, at the request from the applicant’s counsel. on 4 august 2009 the district court issued a detention order which did not set a time-limit for the applicant’s detention or give any assessment to the existence of a “reasonable suspicion” against the applicant. on 2 september 2009 the regional court upheld the detention order on appeal. further extensions of the applicant’s detention were granted by the leninskiy district court on 29 september, 20 october and 2 november 2009. the last extension order was issued in the absence of the parties. on 25 november 2009 the regional court found that extension order unlawful and set it aside, but extended the applicant’s detention for a future period. on 23 december 2009 the bogdanovichi town court in the sverdlovsk region opened the trial and extended the applicant’s detention. the applicant’s appeal against the extension order was rejected by the regional court on 11 june 2010. on 2 march and 22 april 2010 the town court extended the applicant’s detention. each time the court referred to the gravity of the charges and the applicant’s criminal record. the appeals against the orders were rejected on 30 june and 11 june, respectively. throughout the trial the applicant was held in a metal cage. on 13 may 2010 the applicant was found guilty of theft and armed robbery and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. on 18 august 2010 the regional court upheld the conviction but reduced the sentence to three years’ imprisonment. on 24 june 2010 the applicant’s mother died. his request to be allowed to attend the funeral was rejected by the governor of the iz-66/1 remand prison and upheld by the courts on the ground that remand prisoners did not have the benefit of a leave of absence under russian law. when his father died on 5 november 2010, the director of the correctional colony in sosnovoborsk in the krasnoyarsk region also refused his request for a short-term absence, on account of the funeral being held outside of the region where the colony was located. the sosnovoborsk colony was located some 2,400 kilometres away from yekaterinburg where the applicant’s family lived.

the applicant was born in 1971 and is serving a prison sentence in valuyki, the belgorod region. on 14 june 2006 ms i., a university student, disappeared. according to the applicant, on the morning of 17 june 2006 the police searched his flat without drawing up a record. after the search the applicant was taken to the severnyy police department, where he was interviewed about i.’s whereabouts. he stated that he knew i. and had last seen her on 14 june 2006 but was unaware of her whereabouts. according to the applicant, police officers beat him up in order to extract information from him about i.’s whereabouts. according to the government, after being interviewed the applicant was released and later taken again to the police station. a record drawn up by operative officer m. states that at 9 p.m. on 17 june 2006 the applicant was taken in for committing petty hooliganism in the vicinity of the police station by swearing at passers-by. it is stated in the record that he had no injuries. at 11.50 p.m. that evening his administrative detention was ordered by the police. his mouth was taped so that he would not scream. when he was ready to give a statement in order to stop the torture, he was taken to a river bank and shown a dead body. the applicant was then taken to the place where he had allegedly hidden i.’s body. he also stated that he had burnt i.’s body after he had strangled her. the applicant also showed where he had hidden the victim’s mobile telephone. on 20 june 2006 investigator s. ordered a forensic medical examination of the applicant. that day an operative officer of the sovetskiy police department took him to the voronezh regional forensic medical bureau. an expert recorded multiple bruises and abrasions on his face, head, trunk and upper and lower extremities. on 21 june 2006 the applicant was questioned as an accused by investigator s. in the presence of lawyer p. he confirmed his earlier self‑incriminating statements and statements concerning his alleged ill‑treatment at the severnyy police department. in the criminal proceedings that followed the applicant was represented by a lawyer hired for him by his family. his two decisions of 1 july and 2 august 2006 were annulled by his superiors on the grounds that they had been based on an incomplete inquiry. that evening m. took him to the police station again for swearing on the street near the police station. from 9.50 p.m. on 17 june until 10.40 a.m. on 19 june 2006 the applicant was detained in a cell for administrative offenders. no physical force was used against him, and no complaints were made by him. his decision of 10 august 2006 was annulled by his superior as unlawful and unfounded. in the most recent refusal of 21 september 2006 to institute criminal proceedings for lack of evidence that a crime had been committed, the investigator found, relying on statements by the operative officers of the sovetskiy police department, that the applicant had been taken to the station with his consent and had confessed to the murder of i. he had also shown where he had hidden her body voluntarily, without any coercion. on 25 october 2006 the district court convicted the applicant of aggravated murder and sentenced him to twelve years’ imprisonment. p. was subjected to disciplinary liability in the form of a warning. however, it had established a breach of the procedure for providing legal assistance at the invitation of the investigating authorities. applications by the applicant for supervisory review of his case were dismissed by the regional court.
he is currently detained at săpoca psychiatric hospital, in a section of the hospital located in the municipality of ojasca (buzău county). the applicant has been in receipt of a second-degree disability allowance since 1993. 20 initiated a criminal prosecution against the applicant. he was alleged to have had sexual intercourse with his elder daughter and forced both his daughters to be present while he was having sexual intercourse with his wife. on the same day the applicant was admitted to the alexandru obregia psychiatric hospital in bucharest. a forensic medical report was drawn up on 2 november 2001 establishing that the applicant suffered from chronic paranoid schizophrenia and lack of discernment. the applicant did not attend the hearing, nor was he represented by a lawyer in court. the applicant was provided with a neuroleptic- and tranquilliser-based treatment. in july 2007 the competent medical board drew up a report based on the results of an examination of the applicant, the medical documentation transmitted by the psychiatric hospital, the report by his gp, a social welfare inquiry concerning the applicant conducted on 3 may 2006, the 22 april 2002 decision of bucharest district court 6 and the forensic medical report of 2 november 2001. it pointed out, however, that he had been hostile during the examination and had expressed delusional ideas of injustice and his intention to remedy the latter. it reasoned as follows:
“by criminal decision no. the applicant took cognisance of that decision in summer 2008, when he underwent a further forensic medical examination. it transpires from the decisions adopted, of which the court has copies, that the applicant was heard by both courts during the different sets of proceedings. the court referred to the 22 april 2002 decision and to a forensic medical report drawn up following an examination of the applicant in may 2008, which had recommended maintaining the measure. by decision of 1 april 2010 buzău district court maintained the detention measure in respect of the applicant. furthermore, although this aspect was not mentioned by the court, it transpires from that report that the applicant’s gp had noted an erotomaniac obsession with his former wife, which had indicated a total incapacity for social reintegration and would most likely have triggered conflicts or unforeseeable, potentially dangerous situations had he returned to the apartment where he had lived with his family. in november 2010, may and november 2011 and april 2012 the delegated judge requested the buzău institute of forensic medicine to carry out psychiatric assessments with a view to periodic reviews of the need to maintain the applicant’s psychiatric detention. by decision of 15 june 2015 the judicial inspection board dropped the applicant’s complaint. finally, the board recommended that the social welfare services of the applicant’s district of residence should be informed that they had to take the necessary action with a view to releasing him. consequently, it proposed provisionally maintaining the detention until the social welfare services could transfer the applicant to a specialised institution capable of providing him with appropriate living conditions and treatment. the applicant appealed to buzău district court against that decision. he added that he had a retirement pension. by judgment of 29 august 2016 buzău county court upheld the 27 may 2016 decision. (b) measures taken by the national administrative and hospital authorities 65. on 21 february 2017 the applicant was heard by buzău district court. by final decision given on the same day, buzău district court ordered the replacement of the detention measure with a compulsory treatment order until the applicant had made a full recovery. it referred to the forensic medical report of 25 january 2017 (see paragraph 70 above) and to the “aim of the preventive measures, which was to put an end to a situation of danger and prevent the perpetration of acts punishable under criminal law”. on 8 march 2017 the lawyer representing the applicant before the court sent a letter to săpoca hospital recommending, in the framework of enforcement of the decision of 21 february 2017, the applicant’s ultimate reintegration into society rather than his placement in a residential centre. he emphasised that releasing the applicant without adequate support would condemn him to vagrancy, destitution and the deterioration of his physical and mental health. it also attempted, unsuccessfully, to contact two foundations in bucharest for the same purpose.
in may 2008 the first applicant turned to the child welfare authorities because she was pregnant and was in a difficult situation: she did not have a permanent home and was temporarily staying with her parents, the fourth and fifth applicants. on 25 september 2008 the first applicant gave birth to a son, x, the second applicant. on 17 october 2008 the first applicant withdrew her consent to stay at the family centre. throughout the stay, the mother has made statements that we find very worrying. the mother should have an individual plan to ensure follow-up in several areas. furthermore, the fourth applicant had stayed with the first applicant and x during the first days at the family centre, but had not noticed the first applicant’s lack of parenting skills, even though it had been obvious to the staff. the first applicant did not appeal to the high court. on 9 october 2009, the child welfare authorities decided to appoint two experts, a psychologist, b.s., who submitted their report on 20 february 2010 (see paragraph 29 below). meanwhile, on 12 october 2009, the high court (lagmannsrett) granted leave to appeal on the ground that the ruling of, or the procedure in, the city court had been seriously flawed (see paragraph 66 below). the child slept more than they were used to. [ furthermore, the high court referred to the report of 5 december 2008 from the child psychiatry clinic (see paragraph 12 above). he turns away from his mother and prefers to seek contact with others. it is also a problem that the mother makes negative and offensive statements about the foster mother, so that the atmosphere becomes unpleasant and insecure. in conclusion to the question of the first applicant’s competence as a carer, she stated in her report that the stay at the family centre had illustrated that the first applicant “had problems handling and retaining information in such a manner that it could be used to guide her behaviour”. in this connection, the high court attached weight to the fact that both the first applicant and her immediate family had said that they did not want follow-up or assistance if x was returned to them. it agreed with the conclusions of the court-appointed expert, m.s., the foster parents were moreover considered suitable and wanted to take care of x as their own child. 52502/07, § 37, 28 october 2010 – were also pertinent to the present case:
“‘a decision that he should remain a foster child would tell him that the people with whom he has always lived and who are his parents and with whom he established his earliest ties and sense of belonging should remain under the control of the child welfare service — the public authorities — and that they are not viewed by society as his true parents but rather as foster parents under an agreement that can be terminated. ...’” the first applicant was now married and had another child that she was taking care of. moreover, x had a good attachment to his foster family and had lived with them for over three years. she had married in august of 2011, her husband had a permanent job and they had a daughter, y. it also noted that the child welfare authorities in the couple’s current municipality were conducting an ongoing inquiry concerning the mother’s ability to care for y. a staff member of the authorities in that new municipality had testified at the oral hearing, stating that they had not received any reports of concern other than that from the authorities in the first applicant’s former municipality. as part of their inquiry they had made observations at the first applicant’s home. the first applicant believed that returning him would be unproblematic and still did not understand why the child welfare authorities had had to intervene when he was placed in the emergency foster home. everyone who had been present during the contact sessions had described the atmosphere as unpleasant. the first applicant had not shown any positive developments in her competence in contact situations throughout the three years she had had rights of access. the fact that her parents, the fourth and fifth applicants, had a remarkably negative attitude to the municipal child welfare authorities did not make it any easier for her. the city court noted that psychologist k.m., in the present case, the decisive factor would be whether adoption was in x’s best interests and whether consent for adoption should be given on the basis of an overall assessment. applying the general principles to the instant case, the city court first noted that x was at the time three and a half years old and had lived in his foster home since he was three weeks old.
he currently lives in belgium, but at the material time lived in podgorica, montenegro. when the bosnian kickboxer appeared with his coaches, all of whom were muslim, y allegedly said that he would slaughter one of them, and x, another neighbour, made a disparaging reference to the bosnian kickboxer’s turkish descent. y said “turn it to the left”, which was the direction of the applicant’s terrace. v continued by saying that b and s “[could] use a hammer and a pruning knife (kosijer), and [she] would use an axe”. v said that the axe could serve just as well. on 15 september 2009 y was having an argument with m, another neighbour, when x joined and said, among other things, that if he “saw red”, he would “kill both you and your brother here like a dog” (“e ću te ubit ka psa i tebe i brata ođe”), apparently pointing at the applicant’s apartment, adding “dirty gypsy” (“cigane glibavi”) and “trash” (“ovo smeće”). between 19 and 22 october 2009 the police interviewed x, y, v, b, m, d, and three other neighbours. x, y, v, and b denied the applicant’s allegations. b denied that she had been in v’s apartment on that occasion. the other two neighbours were not aware of any conflicts amongst the neighbours, or that anybody ill-treated or insulted the applicant on the basis of his national origin. they had no idea who could be responsible for the incident of 22 september 2009. the incident of 22 september 2009, however, could be considered as jeopardising security. on 31 december 2009 the state prosecutor informed the applicant of this, as well as of the fact that he could file a criminal complaint against a specific person with appropriate evidence (uz valjane dokaze). he enclosed the relevant videos, and proposed that the court hear a number of neighbours, including those he suspected. on 26 march 2010 the applicant appealed against that decision. the fact that they had failed to do what they should have done was in no way his fault, as it was not up to him to tell the police what to do, but only to lodge a criminal complaint, which he had done. on 19 july 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal. he relied on the right to private life, the right to an effective domestic remedy, and the prohibition of discrimination. the government submitted information from the applicant’s criminal record reflecting convictions for minor offences in 1981, 1990 and 2002. for each of these offences he had received a suspended sentence. on 20 december 2007 the applicant was celebrating bayram. he was sentenced to a ten-day period of imprisonment and the pistol was confiscated. the medical expert submitted that the injury had been caused by a blunt object, possibly a “larger stone”, and that it could not have been caused by sand or “stones the size of beans”. the applicant reported the following events to the police, but to no avail: (a) on 6 october 2008 an unknown person had thrown a brick and broken one of the windows of his apartment; (b) on 11 september 2009 s and her husband, z, had tried to hit the applicant’s parked car with their own car; this was confirmed by another neighbour, n.l., on 21 october, 23 october and 30 october 2009 x, v and m.ć. that judgment was upheld by the high court on 15 october 2010. on 26 december 2012 the constitutional court dismissed a constitutional appeal by the applicant in this regard. on 7 may 2010 the applicant was fined 800 euros (eur) in minor offence proceedings (prekršajni postupak) for threatening (izazivanje osjećaja ugroženosti) v, a decision which was upheld on 7 july 2010. the girl apparently fainted and was admitted to hospital unconscious. they were allegedly on a hunger strike for the next twenty-four days, seeking help from various state institutions.
he is the grandfather of the second applicant. the second applicant was born in 1986 and lives in sarajevo. on 10 november 2005 the second applicant initiated administrative proceedings in order to obtain recognition of the veteran status of his late father. his request was rejected on 12 december 2005. the second applicant appealed on an unknown date in december 2005 or january 2006. on 26 january 2006 the competent ministry upheld the first-instance decision. on 21 january 2008 the sarajevo cantonal court quashed the decisions of 12 december 2005 and 26 january 2006, and remitted the case to the first-instance body. in the new proceedings, the second applicant’s request was again rejected. the last decision was given by the sarajevo cantonal court on 25 september 2012. it was served on the second applicant on 23 october 2012. in the meantime, on 10 october 2012, the constitutional court found a breach of the second applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time.
the applicant was born in 1942 and lives in maribor. the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia (“the sfry”) was a federal state composed of six republics: bosnia and herzegovina, croatia, serbia, slovenia, montenegro and macedonia. nationals of the sfry had “dual citizenship” for internal purposes, that is to say they were citizens of both the sfry and one of the six republics. the sfry had two pension systems – military and civil. the pension rights of military personnel were regulated by and secured through the federal authorities. this was the only pension fund existing at federal level. in parallel, each republic had in place its own pension legislation and public pension fund set up for the payment of civil pensions. on 25 june 1991 slovenia declared its independence. in 1992 the slovenian government issued the ordinance on the payment of advances on military pensions (see paragraph 28 below, hereinafter “the ordinance”) which regulated, on a temporary basis, the payment of military pensions to former ypa military personnel residing in the republic of slovenia who had applied for or fulfilled the conditions for retirement under the rules governing the pension and disability insurance of military personnel (hereinafter “the sfry military rules”) by 18 october 1991, the date of withdrawal of the ypa from slovenia (see p.p. 39923/98, commission decision of 1 july 1998, decisions and reports (dr) 3, p. 25). the (transformed) ypa fund continued paying ypa pensions to the citizens of the federal republic of yugoslavia. however, it remains uncertain to what extent, if at all, the ypa fund continued paying ypa pensions to the citizens of the federal republic of yugoslavia residing in the other former sfry republics (see also, mutatis mutandis, kudumija v. bosnia and herzegovina and serbia, and remenović and mašović v. bosnia and herzegovina, (dec.), 28233/08 and 2 others, § 11, 4 june 2013). the applicant was a citizen of the republic of serbia in the sfry. he has been residing in slovenia since 1964 and has had permanent resident status since 1981. he was a non-commissioned officer in active military service in the ypa until 30 september 1991, when he retired. on 23 october 1991 the applicant applied for slovenian citizenship under section 40 of the citizenship act (see paragraph 26 below). by a decision of 11 july 1992 the ministry of interior dismissed his application. after the constitutional court quashed the decision and the case was remitted to the ministry of interior for fresh consideration, the latter on 2 september 1997 again dismissed his application on the same grounds. the applicant instituted court proceedings, which were unsuccessful. on 13 october 2005 the constitutional court rejected a constitutional complaint by him on the grounds that it was no longer relevant because he had acquired slovenian citizenship in 2003 (see paragraph 19 below). by a decision of 17 may 1993 his payments were stopped with effect from 31 january 1992. his advance was suspended as of 31 october 1998. the institute decided that since the applicant had been in active military service in the ypa from 25 june to 18 july 1991 and from 18 july 1991 had been on leave, he did not fulfil the statutory conditions for converting the advance on his military old-age pension into an old-age pension under section 2(1)(4) of the 1998 act. it added that he could re-apply for an old-age pension under the 1998 act once he acquired slovenian citizenship. the applicant subsequently applied for judicial review of the institute’s decision before the ljubljana labour and social court, maintaining that, as a resident of slovenia, he should have been treated in the same way as slovenian citizens. on 13 january 2006 the ljubljana labour and social court dismissed the application for judicial review (see paragraph 18 above). the applicant lodged an appeal with the higher labour and social court. on 23 march 2009 it was dismissed by the supreme court, which followed the lower courts’ reasoning. it held that in the period at issue the applicant had not met the requirements of any of the categories of beneficiaries under section 2 of the 1998 act, having applied for the pension under the sfry military rules on 16 july 1991 and having only acquired slovenian citizenship on 1 april 2003.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in gornja maoča. one police officer was severely wounded in the attack. in april 2012 mr jašarević and two other members of the group were indicted in relation to that event. mr jašarević was eventually convicted of terrorism and sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment. according to the available sources and their own declarations, members of the community in gornja maoča oppose the concept of a secular state, democracy, free elections and any laws that are not based on sharia. ... 6.1.5.1  punishment of the accused (article 242 of the code of criminal procedure)
having been called by the court officer to stand up when the trial chamber entered the courtroom at the first hearing, the accused refused to do so. the court thereupon warned the accused that standing up was a statutory obligation of the accused and that under article 242 § 2 of the code of criminal procedure, disruptive conduct constituted contempt of court, which the court would punish by removing them from the courtroom. the transcript from the hearing was subsequently delivered to the accused. the accused fojnica and ahmetspahić then changed their mind and regularly appeared before the court, while the accused jašarević did so only at the following hearing. he appeared, as summoned, but refused to remove his skullcap, notwithstanding an order from the president of the trial chamber to do so. in addition, the court has pointed out to the witness that, in public institutions, it is not acceptable to display religious affiliation through clothing or religious symbols, and that the court is obliged to support and promote values that bring people closer, not those that separate them. thus, the court is not a place where religious beliefs can be expressed in a way that discredits certain common rules and principles in a multicultural society. the frequency of such disrespectful behaviour and contempt of court is producing dangerous criminogenic effects and undoubtedly presents a specific threat to society. it is not necessary to particularly substantiate how this behaviour impairs the court’s reputation and confidence in the court. restraint on the part of the state in cases of this or other types of extremism can have serious consequences for the reputation of the judiciary and the stability of society in bosnia and herzegovina. it held that the requirement to remove any and all headgear on the premises of public institutions was one of the basic requirements of life in society. this is indeed a matter of a generally accepted standard of behaviour in the courtroom which applies not only to this court but also to other courts; furthermore, it has always been applied. therefore, the allegations made by the lawyer mulahalilović in the appeal are not only unjustified but totally inappropriate. any behaviour to the contrary has always been interpreted and is still interpreted as disrespectful towards the court, and the appellant is aware of that. therefore, the allegations by the lawyer mulahalilović of a violation of the rights guaranteed by the constitution and the european convention on human rights, and of discrimination on religious grounds, are unsubstantiated. the maximum fine should be imposed in the most serious cases. everyone should therefore be held responsible and adequately punished for his/her conduct only, and not for that of other members of any group. that decision was upheld on 13 december 2012 and the applicant served his prison sentence immediately. the interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice (see kokkinakis, cited above). the constitutional court notes that the state court relied also on rule 20 of the house rules, providing that ‘visitors must respect the dress code applicable to judicial institutions’, as an internal act of the state court and other judicial institutions. in the present case, the state court considered the repeated refusal of the appellant to comply with an order of the court to be damaging to the reputation and the dignity of a judicial institution. finally, as to the question whether the decision was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve one of the legitimate aims under article 9 of the european convention, the constitutional court reiterates that, according to the settled case-law of the european court, the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the existence and extent of the need for interference, but this margin is subject to european supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts (dahlab, cited above). therefore, in view of the above and the circumstances of this particular case, the constitutional court holds that the impugned restriction did not constitute an excessive burden for the appellant, that the measure undertaken by the state court pursued legitimate aims within the meaning of article 9 of the european convention, and that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the restriction and the legitimate aim pursued. they disagreed with the majority as concerns articles 9 and 14 of the convention. they further maintained that, unlike public officials, private citizens, such as the applicant, did not owe a duty of neutrality.
the applicants complained of a breach of their property rights through the actions of russian military forces in chechnya in 2000 and the failure of the competent domestic authorities to provide them with effective remedies in respect of those breaches. the facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. he is represented before the court by mr d. itslayev, a lawyer practising in grozny. (a)  seizure of the applicant’s vehicle 7. the applicant lived at 109 sovetskaya street, urus-martan. the group’s commander introduced himself to the applicant as major iv. on 11 march 2000 the applicant was allowed by a soldier to enter the compound and he saw his vehicle there. the applicant states that he saw many other vehicles stationed there; some had parts missing. in july and august 2001 the ministry of justice replied to the investigator that no ministry serviceman by the name of iv. had been serving in urus-martan at the time in question. 3660 of the internal troops of the ministry of the interior, which was permanently based in the rostov region. at some point the applicant was granted victim status and information about the vehicle was entered in the national register of missing and stolen vehicles. the applicant lodged a claim for compensation against the state treasury. in the meantime, the applicant applied to the urus-martan town court, requesting that it confirm his ownership of the vehicle in question. the chechnya traffic police were unable to issue any documents since their archives had burned down in 2000, but a police inspector from urus-martan confirmed that the applicant had had the vehicle in his possession. two witnesses confirmed that the applicant had owned the vehicle. on the strength of the above, on 27 february 2006 the town court confirmed the applicant’s ownership of the vehicle in question. the applicant appealed, and on 4 july 2006 the supreme court of chechnya quashed the decision of 21 september 2006 and remitted the case to the urus-martan town court for fresh consideration. on 1 august 2007 the urus-martan town court dismissed the applicant’s claim, referring to the absence of conclusive proof that state servicemen had seized the vehicle. the application was lodged on 6 october 2008 by mr ismail amalayev, who was born in 1960 and currently lives in kiel, germany. in the evening of 14 october 2000 the applicant, his wife and aunt travelled in the applicant’s kamaz 53-20 lorry from the village of starye atagi to the chiri-yurt district of grozny, chechnya. 205 was passing by, and the applicant signalled to it by flashing his headlights. the apc stopped within 200-300 metres of the applicant’s lorry. it concluded that the applicant had left his lorry on the road and that the car had been destroyed by fire as a result of an electrical short circuit. on 25 march 2001 the grozny district prosecutor’s office opened a criminal investigation into the applicant’s allegations that his kamaz lorry had been shot at and been destroyed by fire by unidentified servicemen driving apc no. the investigation was adjourned on several occasions. it does not appear that the investigation progressed beyond the facts communicated by the applicant. on 11 june 2008 the supreme court of chechnya confirmed this decision. 205” did not exist, according to the general staff of the ministry of defence. it is not clear if the applicant appealed.
at the relevant time they were employed by one of the two national television stations in denmark, danmarks radio, hereafter “dr”. three experts participated in the programme: a medical doctor from karolinska hospital in sweden, a professor from switzerland and a medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany. they all used alimta as first-line treatment, most often in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin. the money had been used to pay nurses and students and for data collection. having received the above-mentioned memorandum, the first applicant again contacted the professor from switzerland and the medical doctor at grosshandorf hospital in germany. they are divided into different stages, called phases. a later phase iii trial aims to test whether a new treatment is better than existing treatments (standard treatment). these trials may compare a completely new treatment with the standard treatment or with different doses or ways of giving a standard treatment. her questions had been answered during her conversations with professor m on 19 october 2007 and s on 22 october 2007. subsequently no one had been willing to answer her questions. when it had not been possible for her to get any response to her many points of criticism, she had contacted h ... she had wanted statements from both h and s as the programme would be unbalanced if they were not heard ... some found that alimta had been better documented than vinorelbine. therefore no trial had been performed of vinorelbine ... he had provided the information included in professor m’s memorandum of 23 september 2008 ...he had talked to [the first applicant] several times and had spent a lot of time and energy on explaining cancer therapy... he had also lost confidence in [the first applicant]...”
h stated, among other things:
“ ...the approval of alimta by the danish medicines agency for the treatment of mesothelioma only means that a marketing authorisation has been granted for the drug, which means that advertisement of the product is permitted. vinorelbine has also been approved by the danish medicines agency, but for a wide range of oncological therapies ... in 2003 when alimta was tested [phase iii] the bar had been set quite low. the allegations were declared null and void. finally, the court also accepts as a fact that it has not been documented that alimta therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product is more effective than vinorelbine therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product. for years he has gone his own way, he has treated dying patients with chemotherapy that is not approved.’ - ‘however, that chemotherapy turned out to have huge consequences for her [sp].’ - ‘s can freely choose the medication that he thinks is best. accordingly, that is the only medication which is approved as treatment. in the worst scenario, that may result in patients dying earlier than if they had been given the approved medication.’ - ‘the family k ask themselves why s goes his own way. they suspect that he has other interests than those of the patients. that suspicion grows, when they talk to sk’s personal doctor.’ the money has been paid into s’s personal research account. against this background, in the programme, the applicants, as producer of the programme and as chief sub-editor, have made an allegation against copenhagen university hospital and s of malpractice and of nourishing irrelevant considerations to the detriment of the lives and health of patients. a very considerable public interest is related to journalistic discussion about risk to life and health, or suspicion thereof, as regards public hospital treatment. against this background, including the fact that the word ‘approved’ was not explained during the programme, namely the difference between medication approved for treatment and [medication] approved for marketing, and by consistently using the word “test medication”, even though only one patient in the programme participated in tests, [the applicants] made allegations which were based on an incorrect factual basis, of which they must have been aware via the research material. the aim of the programme – to make a critical assessment of the treatment of patients with pleural mesothelioma cancer offered by copenhagen university hospital and the responsible consultant – is a legitimate part of the press’s role as ‘public watchdog’, but it cannot justify an allegation, which is built on a factually incorrect basis, and thus a wrong premise. [ the high court thus dismisses the appeal and upholds the judgment of the copenhagen city court. this means that the persons claiming compensation are either patients or their dependants, one of the reasons being their belief that the combinatorial drugs administered to treat the disease were incorrect ones.
they now live in switzerland, where they were granted asylum in july 2017 (see paragraph 31 below). born respectively in 1975 and 1978, are spouses. they were travelling with four other families. on 17 august 2015, they hired other taxis to drive them to the bulgarian-serbian border, somewhere around the town of bregovo. shortly before the border, the applicants switched cars, getting into a toyota sports utility vehicle, which was supposed to take them through a wooded area to the border itself. they intended to cross that border covertly as well, and from there continue towards western europe. according to media reports, over the last few years the above‑mentioned route has been a popular one for migrants trying to cross bulgaria covertly on their way to western europe. one of the officers gave chase, while the other ordered all the passengers to step out of the vehicle. the first officer could not catch up with the driver and came back. according to the government, the drive could not have taken less than three hours. the preparation of the documents relating to the applicants’ arrest then took another hour, and the written declarations that they had been acquainted with their rights were stamped as having been signed at 9 p.m. the applicants could not have therefore been placed in their cell earlier than 10 p.m. 12. after the search, the arrestees were split into two groups. the furniture consists of two old and dilapidated bunk beds and a single bed, with four or five bare soiled mattresses. personal effects, such as a small shoulder bag, training shoes and some litter, are strewn about. other random objects – food remains, empty plastic bottles, rubbish and a torn blanket – are piled up in a corner. the video was submitted by the applicants on a digital video disk containing two video files. one is in .mpg format and bears a time stamp according to which it was last modified at 5.36 p.m. on 17 september ‎2015; and the other is in .mp4 format and bears a time stamp according to which it was last modified at 3.27 p.m. on 15 december 2015. the footage in both files is identical, except that: (a) the faces of the applicants in the first one have been pixelated (whereas in the second they have not); (b) the running time of the first video is one minute and twenty-one seconds (whereas that of the second is one minute and thirty-two seconds, as it continues for another ten seconds); and (c) in the first file the footage is horizontal whereas in the second it is rotated to the right at a ninety-degree angle. in a letter to the government agent, an official from the migration directorate of the ministry of internal affairs in sofia, having compared the video footage with the photographs in the applicants’ migration files, stated that he could confirm that the applicants were indeed the people featured in the video. they did not provide further details in that respect. according to the applicants, after being put in the cell, they were not given anything to eat or drink, or allowed to go to the toilet. since there was no toilet or a bucket in the cell, they had to urinate onto the floor. the government did not comment on that point. after that, the officers took out the second applicant for fingerprinting. according to the government, the applicants were provided with food and water, in accordance with the relevant regulations. in support of their assertion, the government submitted a table setting out the prescribed daily rations for adult and minor detained migrants and a report, drawn up by the head of the bregovo border police department on 1 september 2015, which listed the names of all migrants – including the applicants – which had been detained in the department’s detention facility in vidin during the month of august 2015 and provided with food there. according to the applicants, at about midday on 19 august 2015 they were given back their belongings and driven to an immigration detention facility in sofia. on 24 august 2015 the applicants sought international protection in bulgaria. in the meantime, the applicants made their way to switzerland, where they likewise sought international protection on 8 september 2015. following legal challenges by the applicants, on 7 july 2016 the swiss authorities varied their own decision and proceeded with the examination of the applications.
the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in riga. on 23 april 2003 criminal proceedings were instituted. on 29 april 2003 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of attempted bribery. on 2 may 2003 the applicant was detained on remand. on 25 july 2003 he was released and police supervision was imposed instead, under which he was obliged not to leave his home district without the authorisation of the investigation authorities, and to report to the local police department twice a week. on 2 december 2003 a judge of the riga regional court (rīgas apgabaltiesa) accepted the criminal case for trial. the first hearing was scheduled to take place from 1 to 4 august 2005. on 1 august 2005 the hearing was adjourned for an indefinite period owing to d.e. ’s poor state of health and the fact that the applicant’s defence lawyer was on vacation. on 1 october 2005 the new criminal procedure law entered into force; it introduced new rules concerning, inter alia, conflicts of interest faced by judges. on 31 july 2006 the hearing was adjourned because the prosecutor and the applicant’s defence lawyer were due to go away on holiday. on 13 november 2006 the hearing was adjourned once again owing to d.e. on 15 november 2006 a judge from the riga regional court requested the hospital in which d.e. was being treated to provide information about her state of health. on 20 november 2006 the court was informed that d.e. had been discharged from the hospital and placed under the care of her family doctor. on 27 february 2007 the hearing was adjourned for unspecified reasons. on the same day the riga regional court ordered that d.e. undergo a medical examination in order for her capacity to participate in the proceedings to be determined. the findings of that examination were delivered less than one month later and indicated that d.e. was able to participate in the proceedings. on 27 september 2007 the riga regional court scheduled the next hearing for 27 december 2007. ’s lawyer requested that that hearing be rescheduled in order to accommodate his taking planned holidays. the court dismissed that request, noting that six hearings had already been adjourned and that further delays in the proceedings could not be allowed. on 27 december 2007 the hearing was adjourned, as the prosecution needed to replace the charge against the applicant with a more lenient one. on 11 january 2008 the riga regional court started to hear the parties’ arguments regarding the merits of the case. on 15 january 2008 it convicted the applicant of attempted bribery and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment. on 4 february 2008 the applicant submitted an appeal. on 1 december 2008 the appellate court upheld the lower court’s judgment. in this respect he referred to several provisions of national and international law, including article 6 § 1 of the convention.
in 1957 several plots of land (agricultural land at the time) were expropriated from the applicants’ legal predecessors. the present cases concern restitution proceedings in which the applicants sought that the plots of land, which, at present, form part of a campsite on the shore of lake ohrid, be restored to their possession. on 14 august 2001 the applicants instituted restitution proceedings. on 15 september 2003 the ministry of finance’s restitution commission (“the restitution commission”) granted the applicants’ claims and awarded them compensation, the form of which was to be determined by a separate decision. it established that according to an urban plan of 20 march 2002 the land was designated as a public green zone in a tourist area. relying on an on-site inspection (увид) of 1 september 2002, it further held that the land was developed (уреден простор) with access paths and supporting infrastructure. on 4 december 2003 the applicants appealed, arguing that, inter alia, the land was undeveloped and could be restored to their possession. were the urban plan to be implemented in the future, the land could be expropriated anew. on 31 may 2005 the the second-instance administrative-procedure commission in the area of denationalisation (комисија за решавање во управна постапка во втор степен од областа на денационализацијата – “the second-instance commission”) dismissed the applicants’ appeal finding no grounds to depart from the established facts and the reasons given by the restitution commission. relying on section 10 of the restitution act (see paragraph 15 below), the second-instance commission held that the land in question was of public interest (јавен интерес) and could not be restored to the applicants’ possession, but that compensation should be awarded instead. on 21 september 2005 the applicants lodged an administrative-dispute claim with the supreme court reiterating that the land within the campsite was undeveloped and could therefore be restored to their possession. in submissions lodged subsequently, they further referred to decision no. 44-530/1 of 7 march 2006 in which the second-instance commission had accepted a similar claim and ordered that a neighbouring plot of land located within the same campsite had been restored to possession of the claimants. in that case, the second-instance commission had held, unlike in the applicants’ case, that access paths and supporting infrastructure had not been sufficient for the land in question to be regarded as developed. on 7 february 2008 the administrative court, which had in the meantime become competent to decide administrative-dispute claims, dismissed the applicants’ claim and upheld the findings of the administrative authorities. on 28 november 2003 the restitution commission upheld the applicants’ restitution claim and awarded them compensation in state bonds. relying on an on-site inspection of 13 may 2002 and a certificate of 15 september 2002 issued by the competent ministry, it established that the plot in question was located within the boundaries of the campsite; that it had been designated as a public green zone and that pedestrian paths and other similar infrastructure were planned for construction. it concluded accordingly that the plot could not be restored to the applicants’ possession. an appeal by the applicants of 7 april 2004 was dismissed by the second-instance commission on 15 november 2005. the latter held that, inter alia, the findings of the restitution commission had been based on section 10 of the restitution act. the applicants lodged an administrative-dispute claim in which, alike the applicants in application no. 38024/08, they referred to the second-instance commission’s decision no. 44-530/1 and asked the administrative court to ensure consistent application of the law. on 21 april 2008 the administrative court dismissed the applicants’ claim, finding no grounds to depart from the established facts and the reasoning given by the administrative authorities.
the applicant was born in 1973, lives in austria since 2001 and is currently in detention pending extradition at vienna-josefstadt prison. the application concerns proceedings for extradition from austria to kosovo, which have the following background: 9. the applicant testified as a witness during that trial. was released from prison in 2005, the applicant’s sister reported him to the police for having repeatedly raped her during their marriage, and for threatening to kill her and her family. on 20 january 2016 the ministry of justice of kosovo requested the applicant’s extradition. fired gunshots at a car in the vicinity of the intended victim s.lu., he claimed that the accusations had been invented by s.lu. as revenge for the applicant’s having testified against him during the criminal proceedings in austria. and his family, the applicant would have to fear for his life there. they could easily get to him in prison by using their connections. none of the evidence offered by the applicant had been capable of dispelling these suspicions immediately and without doubt, as would have been required by section 33(2) of the extradition and legal aid act (auslieferungs- und rechtshilfegesetz – hereinafter “the extradition act”). it could equally be argued that the applicant had wanted to take revenge on s.lu. a very influential member of that clan, was detained at mitrovica prison and following extradition to kosovo, he would be detained at that prison as well. it confirmed the criminal court’s finding that the applicant had failed to substantiate a real and individual risk of being subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, or that the kosovo authorities would not be able to protect him from third, private parties. furthermore, members of the allegedly influential lu. was convicted in kosovo for issuing a dangerous threat against the applicant, which demonstrated that the kosovo authorities were indeed capable of taking adequate measures to protect the applicant. clan could not be that influential if it was not capable of keeping its own members out of prison. concerning the conditions of detention, the court held that the report on kosovo by the committee for the prevention of torture (hereinafter “the cpt”) of 2011 (see paragraph 30 below) did not state that ill-treatment was the rule in kosovo prisons, but that there were merely sporadic incidents of violence. the mere possibility of ill-treatment by prison officers did not suffice to stop the applicant’s extradition. on 20 june 2016 the applicant requested that the court indicate to the austrian government to stay his extradition to kosovo under rule 39 of the rules of court. clan wanted to take revenge on him and the kosovo authorities were not willing or able to afford him protection. on 22 june 2016 the court granted the applicant’s request. on 17 june 2016 the applicant lodged applications for the reopening (wiederaufnahme) of the extradition proceedings and a stay of the extradition with the criminal court. he produced a certified declaration by l.q., he asserted that he had been tortured by the kosovo police during his questioning and had been pressured into blaming the applicant for ordering the murder. averred that he did not even know the applicant in person. on 6 september 2016 the supreme court rejected the applicant’s application. more pertinent had been the fact that, during the criminal proceedings against l.q. which had allegedly contained a conversation confirming his statements that the applicant had been to blame for the murder. was not capable of immediately dispelling the suspicion against the applicant on which the extradition request was based.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in sofia. the applicant was employed as a police officer in 1977. after having participated in several international missions, in 2001 he applied for a position as police observer in a new mission. this necessitated an assessment of his psychological suitability, which he underwent at the ministry of the interior’s psychology institute (hereinafter “the institute”) on 1 september 2001. the result of the assessment was negative and the applicant was not included in the contingent to be sent to the international mission. in an explanatory note sent to the head of the institute in relation to that check-up the psychologist who had carried out the assessment explained that during his interview with the applicant he had informed the latter of the results of the assessment in a “clement manner”, and that the applicant had been able to pose questions and to comment. after the negative outcome of the assessment, on 1 march 2002 the applicant retired from service. the parties have not specified whether he would have been able to continue working for the ministry of the interior at a different position. the new psychological assessment was conducted on 11 october 2002, and the institute psychologists concluded once again that the applicant was psychologically unfit for the job. thus, the applicant’s application to join the new mission was rejected. the applicant complained of this outcome to the minister of the interior and other bodies, such as the parliamentary commission on internal security and public order and the president of the republic. the human resources department of the ministry of the interior informed him, in a letter dated 29 january 2003, that the refusals to include him in the international contingents had been lawful. he argued that the file contained data which could be considered personal for the purposes of this act, including “appraisals, the results of different tests, data from psychological assessments”. in the subsequent administrative and judicial proceedings, as described below, the competent national authorities did not refer to any individual documents or a category of documents, but instead referred generally to the information sought by the applicant as “personal data” contained in his personnel file. this conclusion was upheld on 30 july 2004 by the supreme administrative court. on 31 january 2005 the minister of the interior issued a decision refusing the applicant access to his personnel file. he relied in general terms on the provisions of section 34(3) of the protection of personal data act and section 182(7) of the ministry of the interior act, as in force at the time (see paragraphs 22 and 25 below). this refusal was quashed by a three-member panel of the supreme administrative court on 29 july 2005, on the grounds that it had not been reasoned, as it had merely referred to the provisions restricting access to personal data without explaining how they had been relevant to the circumstances of the case and without accounting for the applicant’s own right to access to data concerning him. on 15 august 2006 a five-member panel of the supreme administrative court upheld these findings. in a new decision dated 17 october 2006, the minister of the interior refused the applicant access to his personnel file at the ministry. he explained that personnel files of officers contained information on “the enquiries in respect of a person applying to be employed” at the ministry and information revealing the ministry’s “structures, positions and functions”. it was explained further that even though personnel files also comprised documents which contained no sensitive information, owing to the presence of some classified documents the files had to be classified in their entirety. the applicant applied for judicial review. he stated furthermore that his application for access to his personnel file concerned his “professional identity”. he argued that the minister of the interior had not duly taken into account his right to access to information, that there were no legal grounds to consider the information referred to in the decision as classified, and that in any event, seeing that the applicant had left the ministry in 2002 and that the relevant time-limits for keeping classified documents representing official secrets had expired, any such documents in his file had had in the meantime to be declassified. in a judgment of 25 march 2008 a three-member panel of the supreme administrative court dismissed the application for judicial review. it held that the minister’s decision was well reasoned, and that the minister had correctly considered that the information concerned was classified. upon appeal by the applicant, in a final judgment of 8 july 2008 the judgment above was upheld by a five-member panel of the supreme administrative court. it endorsed the three-member panel’s reasoning, adding that the declassification of documents could only occur after an express decision of the competent official, despite the expiry of the relevant time-limits. in the proceedings before the court the government submitted copies of the applicant’s psychological assessments of september 2001 and october 2002.

when terminating the [enforcement] proceedings the [district court] has referred to the provisions of section 439 of the code of civil procedure and reached the conclusion that the terms of the said friendly settlement regarding the restructuring of the credit obligations of [russian credit] extended also to [the applicant]. the [city court] agrees with the said conclusion of the [district court] as based on the provisions of the law and confirmed by the circumstances of the present case.

“a.- does the applicant risk under us criminal law, in respect of the charges, a maximum penalty that precludes early release and/or release on parole? the report stated the following:
“by way of introduction, lopez elorza’s extradition is sought in order for him to stand trial on federal narcotics offenses in the eastern district of new york. the six puppies were bound for the united states, and the heroin they carried was surgically removed. see federal rule of criminal procedure 11(a). in the united states, the vast majority of criminal cases are resolved by guilty pleas. thus, if lopez elorza were willing and able to provide substantial assistance to the united states in the investigation or prosecution of another person who had committed a crime, a plea agreement might include a promise by the government attorneys, in exchange for his guilty plea, to file a motion with the court asking that lopez elorza’s cooperation be taken into account and permitting the court to impose a lower sentence that it might otherwise impose. the report concluded that while it was possible that any available maximum sentence could be imposed for an offence, under the circumstances present in this case, “the risk of lópez elorza receiving such a sentence is low”. the report specifically stressed that the bureau of prisons could reduce the applicant’s sentence if it found that there was “an extraordinary and compelling reason to do so; for example, if a medical condition arose with lópez elorza that would warrant such a modification”. on 31 july 2015 the interim measures under rule 39 were extended and the court requested that the government stay the applicant’s extradition to the united states while the proceedings were pending before the court.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in nizhniy novgorod region. on 24 october 2011 i. lodged a counterclaim, asking for a residence order under which the children would live with her in vladimir. the applicant strived to spend a lot of time with the children and was against punishing them. the audio recordings submitted by the applicant showed that he had tried to manipulate the children into saying that they wanted to live with him. it was preferable that they lived with her in vladimir where the living conditions were more comfortable and where they had constantly lived since their birth. it was i. who had always accompanied them to school and extracurricular activities. given that i. had never prevented the applicant from seeing the children, the applicant would be able to visit them as often as he liked, while the children would continue living in the environment familiar to them. she did not work and lived on social benefits and child maintenance. on 4 march 2013 n. and v. were assessed by a psychologist who found that their psychological state was good. they were resigned to their parents’ divorce and no longer experienced any negative emotions in that connection. on 22 march 2013 the childcare authority issued its opinion on the case. however, i. objected to any assessment of her children by a psychologist. the living conditions of both parents were satisfactory. the expert report did not however contain an explicit finding that the children were attached to their father more than to their mother. evidence showed that she was taking good care of the children. the applicant was to be able to have contact with the children each weekend from 5 p.m. on saturday until 7 p.m. on sunday at the applicant’s place of residence, with the mother’s prior agreement. a cassation appeal by the applicant was rejected by a judge of the vladimir regional court on 14 may 2014. the children invariably stated that they wanted to live with the applicant, complained that their mother shouted at them and whipped them with a belt, and protested, crying, that they did not want to return living with her. the children also stayed with the applicant on weekends. the applicant and i. were attending mediation sessions. i. stated that she loved her children and took good care of them. in reply to the applicant’s request to play the audio recordings submitted by him on 4 october 2013 (see paragraph 22 above), the judge stated that it was not necessary because the other party had not contested them. it had no reason to doubt that i. loved her children and took good care of them. the fact that she had no employment or income did not justify granting a residence order to the applicant. as indicated in the judgment of 6 may 2013, the expert report of 19 january 2012 did not contain an explicit finding that the children were more attached to their father than to their mother. there were therefore no reasons to issue a residence order in favour of the applicant. on 3 march 2016 the vladimir regional court upheld that decision on appeal. on 4 february 2016 the leninskiy district court rejected the applicant’s complaint, finding that those authorities had no competence in the matter. there is no evidence that the applicant used that procedure. on 24 may 2016 the leninskiy district court refused the applicant’s application for an interim order, finding that he had not proved that the failure to take interim measures might complicate or make impossible the execution of the forthcoming judgment.
the applicant was born in 1946 and lives in čačak. on 7 september 2005 the applicant instituted civil proceedings before the court of first instance (osnovni sud) in kotor seeking redress regarding various contractual issues. on 4 december 2008 the court of first instance in kotor ruled in favour of the applicant. on 17 november 2009 the high court (viši sud) in podgorica upheld this judgment on appeal. on 20 may 2010 the supreme court quashed the previous judgments and ordered a re-trial. on 12 august 2011 the court of first instance in kotor ruled against the applicant. this judgment was upheld by the high court in podgorica and the supreme court on 6 april 2012 and 12 september 2012 respectively. the supreme court’s judgment was served on the applicant on 20 october 2012. the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal on 28 november 2012. on 30 june 2015 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s appeal. this decision was served on the applicant on 25 september 2015.
they were born in 1971, 1968, 1992, 1995, and live in samara. on 26 april 2004 the oktyabrskiy district court of samara (“the oktyabrskiy district court”) ordered, inter alia, the management of the state unitary enterprise “16th military plant” (“the company”) to provide the applicants with a suitable dwelling, while keeping their names on the list of persons awaiting housing. on 11 may 2004 the judgment came into force. on 28 may 2004 the department of the bailiffs’ service for oktyabrskiy district of samara opened the enforcement proceedings. on 22 december 2004 the enforcement proceedings were terminated as the company had no available residential accommodation. on 1 october 2007, due to the reorganisation of the company (see paragraph 16 below), the enforcement file was sent to the department of the bailiffs’ service for the engelsskiy district of saratov region. on 21 april 2008 the bailiffs ruled that it was impossible to enforce the judgment in the part relating to the housing, as the new debtor, fgup 9 tsarz (see paragraph 16 below), had no available accommodation. the enforcement proceedings were terminated. on 26 august 2009 the engelsskiy district court of saratov region, following the bailiffs’ application, replaced the debtor in the enforcement proceedings from fgup 9 tsarz to oao 9 tsarz (see paragraph 17 below). on 14 october 2009 the oktyabrskiy district court clarified the judgment of 26 april 2004 stating that the applicants should be provided with an apartment in samara. several times in 2004-2011 the parties applied to the oktyabrskiy district court for changing the mode of enforcement of the judgment. each time the courts rejected the applications finding that a payment of the amount representing the cost of an apartment would be equal to modifying the original judgment. the judgment of 26 april 2004 remained unenforced. the company was incorporated as a municipal unitary enterprise. according to its articles of association, the company’s aim was to produce goods and render services for the ministry of defense of russia, as well as for meeting other public needs and making a profit. under the order of the federal agency for state property management dated 22 september 2005 the company was joined to fgup 9 tsarz (fgup 9 tsentralnyy avtomobilnyy remontnyy zavod – фгуп 9 царз or фгуп 9 центральный автомобильный ремонтный завод). the reorganisation was completed on 13 february 2007, and the latter company became the universal successor of the company. in accordance with the decree of the president of russia of 15 september 2008 and the decree of the russian government of 22 november 2008, fgup 9 tsarz was further reorganized into oao 9 tsarz, a publicly-traded private open joint-stock company incorporated under the laws of russia.
the applicants were born in 1977, 1978, 1977, 1981, 1981, 1980, 1982 and 1980 respectively. around the same time similar petitions were submitted by students studying at various universities in turkey. upon receipt of these petitions a disciplinary investigation was initiated by the university into the applicants’ actions. on 14 february 2002, relying either on regulation 9(d) or on regulation 10(e) of the disciplinary regulations of higher education institutions, the administrative board of istanbul university, after having heard defence submissions from some of the applicants, either suspended them from the university for a period of two semesters (mr çölgeçen and mr salim) or expelled them from the university (mr bek, mr çalışkan, ms işık, mr ay, mr uçak and mr turğay). some of the applicants also alleged that they were subject to criminal investigations. on 9 may 2002 and on 27 june 2002 (in respect of the fifth applicant) the istanbul administrative court suspended the execution of the applicants’ disciplinary sanctions on the grounds that, inter alia, the sanctions in question were unlawful and that, therefore, their application would cause irreparable damage to the applicants. it appears that the objections of the university to some of these decisions were also dismissed by the court on 4 july 2002. as a result they were allowed to take part in the repeat exams held on 1-12 july 2002. mr çalışkan was re‑enrolled on 23 july 2002 and he was allowed to sit his exams, upon his request, in the 2002-2003 spring midterm period. on 12 and 19 december 2002 the istanbul administrative court examined the merits of the cases and annulled the disciplinary sanctions against the applicants on the ground that they were unlawful. in its decisions, the court noted, inter alia, that there was nothing in the content of the petitions or in the manner in which they were submitted to warrant disciplinary sanctions. the university unsuccessfully challenged these decisions before the supreme administrative court. in 2004 the applicants each lodged an action for compensation with the istanbul administrative court pursuant to article 13 of the administrative procedure act (law no. between march 2007 and march 2008 the istanbul district administrative court quashed the judgments of the first-instance court and dismissed the actions. article 42 of the turkish constitution provides that no one shall be denied the right to education or to instruction. its last paragraph reads: “no language other than turkish shall be taught as a mother tongue to turkish citizens at any institutions of training or education. foreign languages to be taught in institutions of training and education and the rules to be followed by schools conducting training and education in a foreign language shall be determined by law. the provisions of international treaties are reserved”. article 74 of the turkish constitution reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:
 “citizens and foreigners resident in turkey, with the condition of observing the principle of reciprocity, have the right to apply in writing to the competent authorities and to the grand national assembly of turkey with regard to requests and complaints concerning themselves or the public ...” 21. at the material time, regulation 10(e) provided that a person who was a member of an illegal organisation, who engaged in actions on behalf of or who helped such an organisation, would be expelled from the higher education institution. the persons concerned may then bring an action before the administrative courts requesting the annulment of the administrative act and compensation for the damage they have sustained (section 12 of the administrative procedure act). under section 13 of the administrative procedure act (law no. the proceedings before the administrative courts are in writing. article 27 § 2 of the administrative procedure act stipulates that the supreme administrative court or a lower administrative court may decide to stay the execution of an administrative act if its implementation would result in damage which would be difficult or impossible to compensate, and if this act is clearly unlawful. on 2 august 2002 the law on foreign language education and teaching (law no. 2923 of 14 october 1983) was amended by law no. on 30 july 2003 an amendment was made to the second sentence of section 2 (a) of law no. 2923 with a view to enabling the opening of private courses for the teaching of the different languages and dialects used by citizens of turkey. this provision was further amended on 2 march 2014 by law no. on 5 july 2014 the regulation on foreign language education and training issued by the ministry of education was amended so as to provide for the possibility of education and training in a language or dialect that is traditionally used by citizens of turkey in their daily lives in private schools.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in kalush. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. the applicant’s future husband and his parents living in corporate housing (“flat a”) owned by “k.t.”, having accepted this offer, the three of them signed a written undertaking to vacate flat a when they moved to flat b. 7. and joined him, his parents and brother to live in flat a. 8. along with the applicant, he was registered by the local authority as a co-tenant of flat a on the grounds that both of them had become members of the original tenants’ family. company transferred ownership of flat a to the municipality. at various subsequent dates the applicant’s husband and parents-in-law moved out into flat b and registered their residence at the new address. according to the applicant, she and her son remained residents in flat a, as her marriage with v.d. was falling apart and living together had become intolerable. company decided to reallocate flat a to the family of r., its employee, who lived in an accommodation hall (гуртожиток). on 25 july 2006 the court dismissed the claim for the eviction of the applicant and her son. she and her son had never promised to relocate and had remained residents of flat a at the material time. they had not been included in the occupancy voucher («ордер») of flat b and had not been provided with any other housing. they could therefore not be evicted without being provided with alternative accommodation. company had transferred flat a to municipal ownership. it had therefore had no standing in 2005 to reallocate the same flat to r.’s family or to bring the present proceedings. company appealed, referring to article 55 of the housing code. it held that the kalush court, having properly established the relevant facts, had interpreted the law incorrectly. notably, according to articles 55 and 99 of the housing code, the applicant (together with her son) – having settled in flat a as a member of the original tenants’ family – was bound by the duty of the original tenants to vacate the flat. it had therefore had legitimate standing to seek the vacation of the flat by its previous tenants. the applicant lodged a request for leave to appeal in cassation. she noted that she and her minor son had been lawful and registered residents of the disputed flat for eight years. unlike her former husband and in-laws, she and her son had not given any promises to vacate flat a and had not acquired any rights to live in flat b with them. on 16 november 2006 the supreme court of ukraine rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal in cassation, ruling that her submissions did not contain any argument creating an appearance that there could be a problem under applicable law. on 15 december 2006 the applicant requested the kalush court to postpone her eviction, in particular, because she had no other accommodation and her salary was too small for her to rent private-sector housing. on 21 december 2006, while the applicant’s request was pending consideration, the state bailiffs arrived at flat a and had the applicant vacate it and surrender the keys. on 25 december 2006 the local registration authority annulled the applicant’s and her son’s registration as residents of flat a. 24. according to the applicant, after her eviction she had to seek emergency refuge in the home of a colleague and subsequently rented odd accommodations at various places. she submitted testimony given by various acquaintances and copies of some fixed-term lease agreements.

article 115
“a citizen is subject to the provisions of section one [conditions to contract marriage] of this chapter even when contracting marriage in a foreign state according to the form applicable in such foreign state ...”
article 130

court of cassation judgment no. 396/2000 concerning registration of marriages contracted abroad, given that article 28 of law no. indeed such power was attributed to the government in its collegial composition. the relevant council of europe materials can be found in oliari and others (cited above, §§ 56-61). portugal does not have an official form of civil union.

the applicant was born in 1969 and is currently detained in lannemezan prison. after spending some time in pakistan he entered the united kingdom in january 1993 using the false name of elias serbis. on 25 july, 17 and 26 august, 3, 4 and 7 september and 6 and 17 october 1995 eight terrorist attacks were carried out in france. led to a number of persons being arrested and to the search being focused on the united kingdom and an individual named elyes (also known as elyesse or eliass). the sources of these names or pseudonyms were a telephone conversation of 1 november concerning elyes and the western union bank, a search of b.b. the latter, who was living in london, was suspected of being one of the leaders of the gia in the united kingdom, in particular because of his involvement with the publication al ansar (or al ansaar) which the gia used as a mouthpiece abroad. the applicant lodged habeas corpus applications which were dismissed in june 1997 and in 2001. on 14 october 2005 the high court dismissed an appeal by the applicant. on 1 december 2005 the applicant was handed over to the french authorities and was remanded in custody the following day. in a judgment of 29 march 2006 accompanied by over thirty pages of reasoning, the criminal court first of all set out the facts with regard to the “political/religious background”, the emergence of the fis and then the gia, the “background to the attacks” in 1995 – which it listed and described as attributable in all likelihood to the gia – and the “context surrounding rachid ramda”. ruling on the criminal charges, the court began by examining the case against the applicant. the court further noted that the applicant had transferred gbp 5,000 on 16 october 1995, two days before the attack of 17 october 1995. the court also observed that one of the perpetrators of the attacks, b.b., in a final judgment of 18 december 2006 the paris court of appeal upheld that judgment. while referring expressly to the statement of facts as established in the judgment, it devoted some thirty pages to analysing the charges against the applicant, giving reasons. first of all, the court of appeal gave further details concerning the evolution and operation of the gia. ... [the applicant] knowingly played a decisive role, by means of the material acts referred to by the criminal court and by this court above, in the achievement of the gia’s goal, participating from london in the implementation of the group’s external structure, and played a vital role within the organisation whose aim was to prepare, assist in and carry out the attacks which took place.” and the applicant for the attack of 17 october 1995 and committed them for trial before the paris special assize court. on 3 august and 27 november 2001 the investigation division of the paris court of appeal upheld the orders issued by the paris investigating judge on 27 april (concerning the attack of 25 july 1995) and 13 july 2001 (concerning the attack of 6 october 1995) for the indictment of the applicant and b.b. the applicant faced trial for aiding and abetting the crimes of murder, attempted murder, destroying or damaging property belonging to others by the use of an explosive substance causing death, mutilation or permanent disability and temporary total unfitness for work of over eight days or of a maximum of eight days, in connection with a terrorist enterprise, and for the related offence of a breach of the explosives legislation in connection with a terrorist enterprise. written on the back, and an entry had been made in the credit column of b.b. ’s accounts for the sum of “5,000 pounds sterling from [w.], converted at a rate of 7.5%”; a sum of gbp 6,945 had been sent on 20 july 1995; between 20 and 25 july 1995 the sum of frf 300 had been entered as expenditure for the purchase of a “gb ticket”, demonstrating that the funds, after being exchanged in england, had been transported to paris in the days leading up to the attack at the saint‑michel suburban rail station; and a letter from british telecom had been found, addressed to “walid” at 122 hamlet gardens, the applicant’s address. the investigation division also noted that the applicant had made a transfer of frf 36,800 from london the day before that attack – as shown by the fact that his fingerprints had been found on the transfer slip in the western union office in london – which had been received by b.b. lastly, in its judgment of 27 november 2001 the investigation division also noted that it was clear from these different elements that the applicant had sent funds to the perpetrators of the attacks, not just in relation to the campaign of attacks as a whole but also for use directly in carrying out the attack of 6 october 1995. it sentenced him to life imprisonment with a minimum term of twenty-two years. the applicant appealed on 29 october 2007. 6, 12, 21, 26, 32, 37, 44, 50, 58 and 63). the parties did not comment on these questions. it adjourned the civil hearing for a later date. regarding his ground of appeal to the effect that no reasons had been given for the finding of guilt, based in particular on article 6 of the convention, it found as follows:
 “firstly, the impugned questions, which were put in accordance with the law, established in all aspects the acts of aiding and abetting of which mr ramda was found guilty.
the applicant was born in 1969 and lives in vila nova de gaia. he underwent the operation on 27 november 1997 and was discharged from hospital on 28 november 1997 at 10 a.m. 12. in the morning mr fernandes was examined by the new medical team on duty. he was prescribed a special diet and medication. a medical appointment was fixed for 9 february 1998. the applicant’s husband continued to suffer from severe abdominal pain and diarrhoea. mr fernandes therefore returned home the same day. on 25 january 1998 mr fernandes was readmitted to the chvng. a colonoscopy revealed infectious ulcerative colitis. discharged the latter on 3 february 1998. the latter showed ascites in the abdomen but did not confirm the initial diagnosis. on 7 march 1998 at 1 p.m. the applicant’s husband was placed on oxygen because he had difficulty breathing. on 30 october and 23 december 1998 the regional health authority for the north region sent the applicant copies of the reports drawn up by the chvng and santo antónio hospital on the basis of her husband’s medical records. the applicant gave evidence on 3 april 2002. on 23 september 2002 expert medical reports were requested. the report of the investigation was submitted on 28 november 2002. the report stated that there were no grounds for criticising the health-care personnel who had been involved in the care of the applicant’s husband in the chvng and santo antónio hospital, as the patient had received proper and appropriate medical assistance in terms of his diagnosis, supervision and treatment. in his view, the meningitis had developed unexpectedly. in the meantime, on 31 august 1998, the medical association acknowledged receipt of the applicant’s letter of 13 august 1998, informing her that steps would be taken in response to it. the role of the corticosteroids in aggravating or reactivating the peptic ulcer ... is not currently considered a risk factor ... however, given that the patient had already experienced one episode of intestinal bleeding, there would have been grounds for weighing up the use of these drugs. the fact that there was no one on the medical team trained in this type of diagnosis (for example, a specialist in infectious diseases) may be regarded as the only explanation for such an incident. a perforated duodenal ulcer requires immediate surgery. in an order of 28 december 2001 the regional disciplinary council for the north region decided, after having examined the conclusions of the different specialist panels, to take no further action on the applicant’s complaint, on the ground that there was no evidence of misconduct or medical negligence. on 18 march 2003 the appeal was declared inadmissible as being out of time. the applicant did not appeal against that judgment. accordingly, it declared the claim admissible only in respect of the hospitals. taking into account the medical records of the applicant’s husband and the various statements made by the witnesses who had given evidence, the court considered it established, inter alia,
(i)  that a polypectomy was a straightforward surgical operation which posed minimal risk and that the patient had been informed accordingly;
(ii)  that the operating theatre had been aseptic and sterilised at the time of the polypectomy;
(iii)  that the origin of the bacterium linked to the patient’s meningitis had not been proven. ...
on 25 january 1998 the patient again attended vila nova de gaia hospital, where he was diagnosed with pseudomembranous colitis caused by clostridium difficile ... the colitis was successfully treated in that hospital ...;
throughout his stay in vila nova de gaia hospital he was given treatment to protect his stomach. the other factors and circumstances preceding the operation ... thus cease to be relevant. the applicant appealed against the judgment to the supreme administrative court.

the applicant was born in 1982 and lives in switzerland. he grew up in iran and entered switzerland in 2009. on 13 august 2009, stating that he had entered switzerland illegally the same day. he had the opportunity to add comments at the end of the record of the hearing about any irregularities, but he made no such observations. he had been arrested during one such demonstration on 15 june 2009 in i. he was subsequently placed in prison, where he was severely tortured every day. he then managed to hide with his relatives. in support of his account, the applicant submitted copies of his identity card, a court summons of 9 july 2009 and a judgment of 21 july 2009. he had also contradicted himself regarding his transportation from the prison to court and his escape. the documents submitted by the applicant could not lead to a different result as they could easily be bought in iran and falsified. in substance, he stated that his relationship with his father had broken down entirely and that as a result he risked being arrested upon his return because his father had ties to the secret service. moreover, he had been baptised as a christian on 25 august 2013. he submitted a copy of his baptism certificate, issued by a pentecostal church, a protestant house church, to support his account. on 17 january 2014 the asylum authorities, who treated the applicant’s request as a second asylum application, questioned the applicant in person. a member of a non-governmental organisation was present as a neutral witness in order to guarantee the fairness of the hearing. the members of the latter had gradually become his family. he had regularly attended church services and after about six or seven months had been baptised in that church. for him, being a christian meant believing in jesus christ and spreading his message. he submitted statements that he had attended different churches to support his account. they considered that his conversion to christianity did not in and of itself expose him to a real risk of ill-treatment. such a risk could exist if he proselytised or attracted public attention in another way. based on his statement, they considered that he did not intend to practise his faith in such a manner. he pointed out that there had been an increased number of arrests of members of christian house churches since 2010 and argued that his conversion to christianity in and of itself exposed him to a real risk of ill-treatment. his conversion to christianity was genuine and lasting. it considered that a person could only face a real risk of ill-treatment upon return to iran if that person’s christian faith had been manifested in switzerland in such a way as to make it visible to the outside and if it could be assumed that his or her family and acquaintances in iran would learn about that active manifestation of faith, even if it was short of proselytising. where a conversion had taken place abroad, there had to be both an assessment of whether it was genuine and the extent to which it had become publicly known. there were no indications that the iranian authorities had even become aware of his conversion. to support his account he submitted photographs, letters of support from various persons and several reports. the personality of the individuals concerned, the form of their appearances in public and the content of their public statements were relevant parameters in that regard. on 13 july 2016 the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision, in substance repeating his earlier submissions. on 30 august 2016 the federal administrative court dismissed the appeal as manifestly ill‑founded, fully endorsing the asylum authorities’ reasoning.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in novyy, tatarstan republic, russia. on 13 september 2002 the applicant’s husband was taken to tukayevskiy police station. at around 1 p.m., according to the record, for the purpose of verifying his identity; this verification was completed and he was released at 1.30 p.m. it is also apparent from the evidential material that between 4.15 and 4.45 p.m. the applicant’s husband was in an office, apparently on the fifth floor, where he was interviewed by investigator r. according to the material in the case file record, the applicant’s husband stated during the interview that he and v. had left the house of victim g. after drinking vodka together. according to the authorities, the applicant’s husband left kh. the same evening he was found unconscious and was admitted to hospital. according to the applicant, during this inquiry investigative measures were carried out by unspecified officers from tukayevskiy police station. providing medical assistance to an unconscious man. this decision was annulled by the higher prosecutor and the inquiry was reassigned to another investigator. on 13 december 2002 the applicant’s husband died, apparently without ever regaining consciousness. a similar statement was made by paramedics zh. the latter had received a telephone call from the victim on the evening of 13 september 2002 in which his father had told him that he was to be interviewed and would be let go next morning. on 3 may 2003 investigator r. issued a decision discontinuing the criminal investigation for absence of any criminal event, while noting that “unidentified officers from the police station had manifestly exceeded their powers when placing [the victim] in an investigation room”. it appears that the criminal investigation was reassigned to another investigator, i., who suspended it on 20 july 2003. on 22 july 2003 the regional deputy prosecutor issued an order requesting further investigation and on 23 july 2003 the acting district prosecutor quashed the suspension and ordered the investigation to be continued. on 23 august 2003 investigator r. issued a decision discontinuing the criminal investigation in terms that were similar to the decision of 3 may 2003. this decision was subsequently quashed and other similar decisions were issued and quashed on several occasions. for instance, on 10 december 2008 an investigator issued a decision to discontinue the criminal case, concluding that the applicant’s husband had attempted to commit suicide. on an unspecified date, the investigating officer asked expert va., stated that the constriction mark on the victim’s neck could have been caused by soft pressure such a fabric jacket. on 25 august 2010 the decision of 28 january 2010 was revoked and the investigation was resumed. a new refusal was issued on 25 september 2010. and stated that v. had struck several blows to g.’s face and had then run away. the medical documents show no indication of any bodily injuries when he was admitted to the hospital. he had detached the jacket and had started to provide first aid to the victim. was interviewed in this connection and confirmed that it would have been possible for the hanging and the strangulation marks to have been created in the circumstances described by f.
interviews were carried out with those police officers at the police station who had talked to the victim on 13 september 2002. none of them indicated any other bodily injuries. neither of the above decisions contains any explanation about the change in the circumstances in which the victim had been discovered ... at the same time, the refusal to prosecute dated 10 december 2003 clearly indicates as an established fact that mr khayrullin had attempted suicide at the balcony of the fifth floor ...
it is apparent from the available material that a criminal investigation was opened under article 286 of the criminal code in respect of unidentified officials; this legal classification has not been changed since 2002; the investigation is ongoing. however, this court finds it established that the damage to mr khayrullin’s health was caused on the premises of the police station. the ministry of finance and the applicant appealed. on 22 january 2009 the supreme court of the tatarstan republic upheld the judgment.
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in zemun. during that time a large-scale police operation known as operation sabre (sablja) took place. the applicant was a member of a criminal group linked to the zemun clan. those arrested were also questioned about other crimes such as murders, abductions and drug trafficking. they put a pillowcase over his head, verbally abused him and made threats aimed at his family. he was taken to an office in which seven to nine people were present. according to the applicant, the maltreatment continued there. he was beaten with baseball bats and police truncheons. a truncheon was inserted several times into his anus. at around 3.30 a.m. on 2 april 2003 two police officers took him to a solitary confinement cell. in the cell his handcuffs were taken off and a detention order was put before him for signature. as alleged by the applicant, approximately half an hour later two police officers entered the cell. they handcuffed him, put a bag over his head and took him for questioning. during that time he was again beaten, kicked and maltreated. during the first five days no food was given to him. afterwards, he was given one sandwich per day. throughout that period police officers routinely questioned and ill-treated him in the same way as before. these included large haematomas on the soles of his feet, palms of his hands, face, shoulders and buttocks, as well as conjunctival hyperaemia (redness) on the external parts of his eyes. after two months he had fully recovered from the ill-treatment he had suffered. he was released from pre-trial detention on 25 june 2004 pending the outcome of appeal proceedings. on 18 may 2004 the applicant’s mother lodged a complaint with the inspector general’s service of the ministry of the interior (generalni inspektorat ministarstva unutrašnjih poslova), alleging that her son had been tortured by members of the special anti-terrorist unit and police officers working for the narcotics department of the criminal police directorate (odeljenje za suzbijanje narkomanije uprave kriminalističke policije, also known as the fourth department) in belgrade. on the contrary, the applicant had seemed pleased because he had been informed that he would be charged with lesser offences than expected. also claimed that the applicant had had no complaints about his treatment. gave a statement to the sector for the internal control of the police. on 21 march 2007 the applicant’s mother’s complaint of ill-treatment of her son was rejected by the inspector general’s service for lack of evidence of a crime. the officers stated that no violence had ever been used against the applicant. on 21 april and 18 november 2008 the investigating judge to whom the case was assigned interviewed three doctors who worked at the prison hospital. on 23 september 2009 the pre-trial chamber of the first belgrade municipal court upheld the decision of the investigating judge. on 11 july 2010 the applicant also lodged a constitutional appeal. this also implies that specific and detailed reasons of the alleged violation of the constitutional right have to be specified in the constitutional appeal, because only a causal link presented in such manner may compel the court to find a violation or denial of a certain right.”
the applicant, mr grigoriy nikolayevich pleshchinskiy, is a russian national who was born in 1954 and lives in solnechnogorsk, moscow region. the facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. the applicant was kept in solnechnogorsk police’s temporary detention centre in overcrowded cells from 2 to 10 october 2003; 20 to 24 october 2003; 17 to 21 november 2003; 21 to 28 november 2003; 22 to 29 december 2003; 26 to 30 january 2004; 2 and 3 february 2004; 31 march to 2 april 2004 and then on several occasions between april and 22 july 2004. he had to relieve himself in a bucket in the presence of other detainees and it was very difficult to breathe in the cells. there was no tap or other access to water, no proper light, no table on which to eat food and no area for outdoor activities. in the winter the walls and ceiling were covered with ice or damp. the applicant made numerous journeys in 2003-2004 between volokolamsk remand centre and the temporary detention centre in solnechnogorsk, which took three to four hours in an overcrowded van, which was cold in the winter and stuffy in the summer. on 11 july 2005 the applicant sued the state for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage caused by the allegedly appalling conditions of his detention in the temporary detention centre. on 14 november 2005 the solnechnogorsk town court rejected the applicant’s claims. it established that the material conditions of his detention could be explained by insufficient funding. on 22 november and 6 december 2005 the applicant lodged appeals against the decision of 14 november 2005. on 19 december 2005 the applicant was informed that the text of the judgment had been available since 5 december 2005. on an unspecified date the court sent a summons to an appeal hearing which had been scheduled for 30 january 2006. however, the applicant did not receive the summons as it contained an error in the address, which was written as “2, vishnevskaya street” instead of “2, vishnevaya street”. on 30 january 2006 the moscow regional court upheld the decision of 14 november 2005 in the applicant’s absence. in reply to an enquiry from the applicant about the date of the appeal hearing, he was informed on 1 february 2006 that it had been held on 30 january 2006. in december 1992 the municipality allowed the applicant and his son, a minor at the time, to obtain ownership of the flat in solnechnogorsk in which they were living by way of privatisation. the applicant obtained a title certificate, which, however, named him as the sole owner. after reaching the age of majority, the son sued the father, asserting his right to the flat and seeking an annulment of the above-mentioned certificate. in support of his claim the plaintiff submitted a copy of the housing register, and certificates from his school and kindergarten. all the documents showed that the plaintiff had been permanently residing in solnechnogorsk. the applicant sought to prove that at the material time the plaintiff had lived in a flat in another town, taganrog, and tried to obtain certificates of his moving in and out of the privatised flat. however, the competent authority would not issue them unless they were requested by a judge. however, the judge considered that the evidence adduced by the plaintiff sufficed. on 4 may 2005 the solnechnogorsk town court of the moscow region granted the plaintiff’s claim. it held that the housing law provided that minors living with a tenant in a flat leased under a social lease agreement enjoyed the same rights as the tenant as of the privatisation date. accordingly, where flats were privatised without payment, they could become owners of the flat together with the adults. furthermore, under the privatisation law then in force, a privatisation agreement had to contain a reference to the minors who enjoyed the right to use the premises in question. on 14 june 2005 the moscow regional court upheld the decision of 4 may 2005 on appeal.
the applicant was born in 1960 and lives in čurug. on 2 august 2002 the applicant and one of his colleagues (hereinafter “the plaintiffs”) instituted civil proceedings against their employer seeking payment of salary arrears and other employment-related benefits. on 8 february 2013, after two remittals the first instance court in novi sad, specifically its detached section in bečej, ruled partly in favour of the plaintiffs, ordering their employer to pay each of them specified sums in respect of salary arrears. the remainder of their claims was rejected. on 15 april 2013 the court of appeal in novi sad reversed a part of the above judgment, while upholding the remainder. this judgment was served on the plaintiffs on 6 june 2013. on 29 january 2014 the supreme court dismissed the plaintiffs’ appeal on points of law as the value of their respective claims was below the statutory threshold allowing for this remedy. on 9 april 2013 the plaintiffs lodged the constitutional appeal, complaining of a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time in the impugned proceedings. by its decision of 9 december 2015, the constitutional court found a violation of their right to a hearing within a reasonable time and awarded each of them eur 800 in respect of the non‑pecuniary damage suffered.

the applicant was born in 1960 and was serving a prison sentence at the time in question. his conviction was upheld on appeal by the supreme court of the autonomous republic of adjara on 19 july 2004. on 16 august 2005 he was transferred to the infectious ward, where he was treated for his viral hepatitis c. the applicant was discharged from the prison hospital on 10 september 2005. 1, despite the seriousness of his state of health, and that the treatment in that hospital had not produced any results. he observed that, in accordance with ministerial order no. according to the daily notes made in his medical file, the applicant continued to suffer from pain in the right foot. it can be seen from the contents of the medical file that his right foot was treated with antiseptic products and bandaged daily. he also prescribed alprostapint infusions. on 31 july 2008 the vascular specialist recommended a tc po2 test in order to assess the possibility of amputating the toe, and prescribed continuing palliative treatment. it appears from the case file that the relevant drugs were administered to the applicant by his wife and other family members. in his view, surgical intervention was not appropriate because the particularly low level of oxygen in the right foot would have hampered the healing of the resulting wound. on 11 june 2008 the tbilisi city court dismissed the applicant’s request, on the grounds that the prison hospital had a medical service capable of providing the necessary treatment and that the applicant, who was being looked after by specialist doctors, would be transferred to a specialist clinic if necessary. regarding the applicant’s heart condition, the expert had said that the applicant needed treatment in a specialist clinic to prevent sudden death. at the examination in the specialist hospital in question, apart from the findings of the above-mentioned expert report, buerger’s disease of the lower limbs had also been diagnosed. at the next hearing on 8 september 2008 the forensic expert repeated that the applicant’s state of health was serious, and that article 7 § 2 of order no. if that were to continue, the applicant might develop septicemia and die. the applicant’s doctor – a surgeon who was a member of the prison hospital’s permanent staff – also gave evidence before the court of appeal, explaining the diagnosis and confirming that his patient was seriously ill, with the arterial disease having reached the fourth and final stage. he further explained that at that stage of the disease the treatment usually prescribed was either palliative or surgical. the applicant was being given palliative treatment with medicines (antioxidants, protective drugs, sedatives). an operation was not recommended because it might make his condition worse. the likelihood of the scar healing was nil. this had then quickly spread, despite the treatment administered. at the time it was a question of saving the applicant’s life and subsequently considering whether to amputate the right leg. given that, according to the doctors, the applicant could not be cured, the lawyer requested that her client be dispensed from having to serve the remainder of his prison sentence (under article 608 § 1 of the ccp). in a judgment of 8 september 2008 the court of appeal ordered that the applicant’s prison sentence be suspended pending a substantial improvement in his state of health, provided that he undergo a medical examination every six months and provide the court with the results thereof. according to a medical report of 6 march 2009, the applicant suffered from cardiac ischaemia, second-degree angina pectoris, third‑degree hypertension and second-degree heart failure. from a cardiological point of view, his heart condition remained serious. the gangrene was still described as progressive. the experts concluded that the applicant required cardiological and angiological treatment in a specialist institution. over may and june 2011 the applicant underwent another forensic examination.

“‘it is a matter of honour for the general prosecutor’s office and the state tax administration to bring the story of slovyanskyy bank to its logical conclusion,’ said the president of ukraine during his speech at the session ... he stated that the chairs of the bank had turned it into a source of uncontrolled personal income. ‘ such money‑makers have powerful patrons, and there is great pressure on the investigation,’ stated the president.” on 29 june 2000 the national bank of ukraine (“the nbu”) suspended the applicant bank’s licence for some of its operations, considering that its financial position had deteriorated sharply and that it had been performing risky operations which threatened its solvency. on 18 september 2000 the nbu put the applicant bank under temporary administration, which involved suspending the functions of some of the bank’s managers. by the same resolution the nbu approved the composition of a liquidation commission for the bank, consisting of eleven officials from the regional departments of the nbu and two members of staff from the local tax office. on 5 march 2001 the first applicant, who was in detention at the time, brought a claim under the rules of chapter 31-a of the code of civil procedure of 1963 with the pechersky district court of kyiv, challenging the nbu’s decision. he maintained that the impugned resolution was unlawful and that the nbu had decided to liquidate the applicant bank owing to its failure to fulfil its financial obligations, whereas that failure had been caused by the nbu itself and the tax authorities. the first applicant emphasised that after the resolution had been adopted, the applicant bank had not been able to protect its rights and interests on its own. he added that the resolution had been detrimental to the interests of the applicant bank’s shareholders, including himself. on 26 june 2001 the court found that the first applicant could bring a claim, however, it had to be dismissed. the court held that the nbu had been competent to adopt the impugned resolution, that the measures taken had been lawful and that they had been made necessary by gross violations of banking legislation by the applicant bank and its difficult financial position. the first applicant appealed against that decision. on 5 july 2002 the kyiv city court of appeal upheld the decision of 26 june 2001 in part, but changed its reasoning. it held that the nbu’s resolution of 11 january 2001 had not concerned the first applicant and it had not been established during the determination of the claim that his rights and freedoms had been violated. for those reasons the court of appeal dismissed the claim. the first applicant appealed on points of law. it found as follows:
“... the first and second-instance courts have established that mr b.m. feldman brought a claim as a shareholder of slovyanskyy bank, however he did not request the protection of his own rights and freedoms but, in fact, acted in the interests of slovyanskyy bank, without being duly authorised [bold text in the original]. according to articles 1 and 12 of the code of commercial proceedings, disputes between a subject of entrepreneurial activities and enterprises, institutions and organisations concerning the protection of their rights and freedoms, and their disputes concerning the declaration of legal acts as invalid, should be examined by the commercial courts. given that a shareholder is not entitled to apply to a court for the examination of such a dispute and that this case is not to be examined in accordance with civil procedure, the decisions adopted in this case should be quashed and the proceedings should be terminated, in accordance with article 136 § 2 (1) and article 227 § 1 of the code of civil procedure ...” 19. the liquidation process of the applicant bank was completed on 30 november 2012. the bank was removed from the legal entities official database on 4 august 2014.
the applicant was born in 1971 and lives in melitopol. between 2004 and 2006 the applicant was head of melitopol city council’s disadvantaged persons’ welfare centre (центр по обслуговуванню одиноких, непрацездатних та малозабезпечених громадян управління праці, соціального захисту та житлових субсидій мелітопольської міської ради – “the centre”). on 21 april 2006 she was dismissed as part of a reorganisation of the centre. another person was subsequently appointed to a position similar to the one previously occupied by the applicant. in may 2006 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the melitopolskyy local court (“the melitopolskyy court”) seeking reinstatement, salary arrears and compensation for non-pecuniary damage. on 24 october 2006 the court rejected the applicant’s claim. it found that the centre had offered the applicant another position but that she had rejected this proposal, and that a more experienced person had been appointed as the head of the centre. following an appeal by the applicant, on 7 december 2006 the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal upheld the decision of 24 october 2006. the applicant lodged a further appeal, and on 22 august 2007 the supreme court of ukraine quashed these decisions and remitted the case to the first-instance court for fresh consideration. it held that the case was to be considered under the administrative justice procedure since it concerned a public-service dispute. accordingly, the applicant instituted administrative proceedings before the melitopolskyy court, which, on 21 february 2008, again found against her for reasons similar to those listed in its decision of 24 october 2006. the applicant appealed, and on 16 july 2008 the dnipropetrovsk administrative court of appeal quashed this decision and terminated the proceedings on the grounds that it fell to be examined under the civil justice procedure as the applicant was not a public servant. on 2 march 2011 the higher administrative court of ukraine upheld this decision. on 14 april 2011 the same court rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal to the supreme court of ukraine against the decision of 2 march 2011. on 28 march 2011 the applicant again lodged a civil claim seeking reinstatement, salary arrears and compensation for non-pecuniary damage. on 4 august 2011 the melitopolskyy court refused to examine the merits of the applicant’s civil claim as the applicant had sought to have adjourned previous court hearings in respect of her case on numerous occasions without good reason. on 5 october 2011 the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal upheld the decision of the first-instance court.
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in voluntari. in march 2014 a large-scale criminal investigation was initiated against several persons for money laundering and fiscal fraud. on 3 december 2014 the investigation was extended in respect of thirty-two other persons, including the applicant. the order to appear had been issued by the prosecutor on 3 december 2014. the documents on file show that between 8.40 a.m. on 4 december 2014 and 3 a.m. the next day, the investigating authorities, namely five prosecutors and six judicial police officers, conducted interviews in respect of fourteen witnesses and twenty-five suspects and/or defendants in connection with the criminal investigation involving the applicant. entered the premises of the police headquarters at 4.10 p.m. the applicant contended that up until that time, her lawyer had been prevented from joining her because he had not submitted a written mandate proving that he lawfully represented her (see also paragraph 22 in fine, below). when invited to give a statement, she refused, claiming that she was unwell and needed medical assistance. the minutes recording this interview do not mention the exact time of their drafting; they are signed by the applicant, who confirmed having received a copy. her lawyer does not appear to have been present. the government contended that the applicant’s request for medical assistance had been part of her defence strategy, as proved, in their view, by the transcripts of a phone conversation she had had with a third party at 7.14 p.m., in which she was advised accordingly (see also paragraph 13 above). it arrived at 7.50 p.m. and provided medical care (mainly intravenous infusion with minerals) to the applicant until 8.31 p.m., when she was taken to the emergency university hospital. she remained in the hospital until 00.10 a.m. the next day and several medical examinations were performed during this time, following which vitamins, calcium and analgesics were administered. the applicant claimed that during the whole time she was in hospital she had been guarded by police officers, who had then escorted her back to the police headquarters. at about 00.22 a.m. the applicant’s questioning started. in the presence of her chosen lawyer, the applicant refused to give a statement on the grounds that she was very tired, having spent the last four hours in hospital. subsequently, at 01.10 a.m., the applicant was informed in the presence of her chosen lawyer that the prosecutor had decided to remand her in custody (reţinere) for twenty-four hours. the applicant mentioned that her lawyer had not been allowed to accompany her or to assist her because he did not have a written mandate, even though the lack of such a document was objectively justified by the circumstances in which she had been taken to the police station. on 5 december 2014, relying on testimonial, documentary and audio surveillance evidence, the prosecutor asked the bucharest county court to place the applicant in pre-trial detention (arest preventiv) for thirty days as her release posed a threat to public order. by an interlocutory judgment delivered on 6 december 2014, the bucharest county court allowed the prosecutor’s request and ordered the applicant’s detention until 3 january 2015. an appeal lodged against this was dismissed by the bucharest court of appeal on 15 december 2014. her pre-trial detention was extended for another thirty days by a decision of the bucharest county court issued on 29 january 2015, upheld on appeal. the applicant was released on 11 february 2015 after two months of pre-trial detention. it appears that the proceedings on the merits are still pending. the applicant claimed that for two months, she had been placed in a cell measuring 9 square metres, which she had shared with three other detainees. she also complained about the poor conditions of hygiene, lack of ventilation and natural light. according to the applicant, the toilet was not separated from the living area by any partition, thus offering no privacy. the government provided information about the applicant’s conditions of detention. they submitted that the applicant had been detained in a cell measuring 9.32 sq m, which she had occupied with two or three other detainees from 5 to 8 december 2014. they stated that each cell had sanitary facilities such as a toilet and a shower, which were separated from the rest of the cell by a curtain. both cells had access to natural and artificial light, as well as ventilation provided by a double-glazed window measuring 115cm x 77cm.
the applicants were born in 1968 and 1972 respectively and live in vilnius. sold a plot of forest land measuring 0.4807 hectares to the applicants. the purchase agreement categorised the land as forest. in february 2005 a registration certificate was issued for the plot of land. the court noted that the first applicant was the owner of a plot of forest land on which construction of new buildings was prohibited, unless it was a reconstruction of a former residential property. a representative from the utena district environmental protection department of the ministry of the environment (hereinafter “the utena environmental protection department”) had no objections to the establishment of the legal fact. in november 2005 the first applicant asked the authorities to issue him with the relevant documents necessary for construction. the utena environmental protection department stated that the construction of a building had to comply with the law on construction; the existing flora had to be preserved and the method of waste collection had to be decided on. the permanent committee on construction of the molėtai municipality verified the documents submitted by the first applicant and recommended that he be issued with a building permit. in 2007 the plan of the building was specified (the facades were modified) and the amendments were verified by the utena environmental protection department. on 2 may 2011 the ministry of the environment received a report via a hotline for allegedly illegal construction work. on 10 may 2011 the authorities estimated the distance between the house and the lake at 27 metres, and between the terrace of the house and the lake at 24.5 metres. on 5 august 2011 the prosecutor’s office started court proceedings and asked the domestic courts to revoke the recommendation to grant the first applicant building permission; to annul the building permit and oblige the applicants to demolish the building at the expense of the established guilty parties, that is the applicants, the molėtai municipality, and the utena environmental protection department. moreover, it had been established that any construction work in the forest could only be started after having received building permission and in accordance with the relevant plans. moreover, the court was not convinced that the environment would be restored to its previous state if the buildings were demolished because the demolition would also cause some environmental damage. a summer house could not be constructed as it did not fall within the category of buildings that could be constructed in the forest. the court did not explain how the costs of demolition had to be divided between the three parties. on 27 september 2013 the supreme court held that relevant laws provided that the only buildings that could be constructed in the forest were timber storehouses and other buildings for forestry equipment. there were no provisions allowing construction of residential or commercial buildings in the forest. it was in certain cases possible to change the purpose of the land, but as the land in question was situated in a surface water protection zone, any such change was prohibited. the court held that although the applicants referred to the regulation of construction on private land (see paragraph 49 below, hereinafter the “regulation”), none of the provisions of that regulation could be interpreted as allowing construction of the buildings in question. there was no argument that the buildings in question had been constructed where farm buildings had previously been sited, thus the provision of the regulation allowing construction where residential buildings had previously been sited did not allow the applicants to construct a summer house. as to the applicants’ argument that the appellate court had breached the principle of legitimate expectations, the court held that the construction in question had been prohibited by the relevant domestic legislation in force at the time. even if the applicants had misinterpreted the provisions of the regulation, the constitutional court had found the regulation to be inconsistent with the law, and, by extension, with the constitution on 14 march 2006, only three months after the building permit had been issued to the first applicant. the applicants should therefore have been able to understand the consequences of constructing illegally and to avoid them. the legal regulation established the responsibility of the authorities for the unlawful issue of the construction permit. as a result, the court upheld the decision of the panevėžys regional court (see paragraph 17 above). on 12 february 2014 the molėtai district court dismissed the bailiff’s request because she had failed to provide specific details as to what required clarification. on 23 december 2015 the utena district court held that domestic law did not oblige the bailiff to suspend the execution of judgments if the applicants had lodged an application with the european court of human rights. the state territorial planning and construction inspectorate lodged a separate complaint, but on 15 march 2016 the panevėžys regional court upheld the first-instance decision.
the applicants are sisters, who were born in 1949 and 1950 respectively and live in vilnius and varėna. his property rights were registered on 6 june 1996. two plots of land measuring 8.93 hectares and 0.94 hectares respectively were returned to them in natura. the cadastral measurements of the house were taken in september 1992, and the building was classified as residential. ’s heir, asked for the plot of land of 0.51 hectares to be entered into the land registry in his name. if there was a dispute, the aca would initiate court proceedings in order to annul part of the decision of 23 may 1996. as there was a dispute, the aca asked a prosecutor to start court proceedings. in april 2008 the prosecutor lodged a claim with the varėna district court and asked it to annul part of the decision of 23 may 1996 (see paragraph 6 above) restoring the property rights of the applicants’ father in respect of 0.4863 hectares of land, and the relevant part of the succession document issued to the applicants. the applicants’ property rights would be protected by giving them an equivalent plot of land in another area. on 4 november 2009 the vilnius regional court upheld the decision of the court of first instance. and that the applicants had signed the documents and agreed with the borders of the plot under the buildings. the property rights of land owners were not absolute, and in the case at issue the lawful interests of a third party had to be protected. on 2 february 2011 the vilnius regional court sent the case back to the court of first instance for fresh examination, stating that the substance of the case had not been examined thoroughly. had previously been a school building, but since 1992 it had been registered in the register of immovable property as a residential building. was entitled to a plot of land measuring 0.51 hectares was unfounded. moreover, although the applicants and j.p. the court considered that the person who had measured the land for the applicants had not marked the house in that area, and had not taken any actions to find out who the owner of the house was; therefore, he was the person who had made a mistake. in march 2014 the national land service informed the applicant that she could start court proceedings for damages. ’s buildings was valid, and that, in accordance with the decisions of the domestic courts, j.p. the national land service stated that the applicants were aware of the court proceedings regarding the decision of 23 may 1996 to restore their father’s property rights. was entitled to buy the plot of land for residential purposes located under the buildings from the state. in may 2015 the varėna division of the national land service explained that the applicants’ property rights to the plot of land of 0.4863 hectares had been annulled in accordance with the decisions of the domestic courts (see paragraphs 17-19 above). in january 2014 the applicants had been asked to choose the means by which they wished their property rights in respect of the 0.4863 hectares of land to be restored (see paragraph 20 above), but they still insisted on having the land returned in natura (see paragraph 21 above), which was not possible. the monetary compensation procedure could be started after the applicants submitted a request for their property rights to be restored by means of monetary compensation. as a preliminary estimate, the value of the plot at issue was estimated at 217 euros (eur). the meeting was adjourned once until 25 july 2017 because the applicants’ lawyer had holidays planned. one of the applicants collected the decision on 8 september 2017. was using land to which he had no rights. that decision was upheld by a higher prosecutor in december 2010 and by the varėna district court and the vilnius regional court in january 2011. ’s house had previously been a school, and thus its purpose was communal and not residential.
the first applicant was born in 1976 and lives in žagarė and the second applicant was born in 1957 and lives in šiauliai. in december 2010 the first applicant bought a house at an auction organised by the state and registered his property rights in the state property register. the auction was organised as a result of a debt of z.b. in january 2011 the first applicant lodged a claim with the court, asking to evict z.b. lodged a complaint against the bailiff but on 6 june 2012 the šiauliai district court dismissed it. in october 2012 the bailiff asked the authorities about the permanent place of residence of z.b. ’s daughter and granddaughter were living together in vilnius. ’s state of health, he postponed the eviction until 14 december 2012. ’s illness and the presence of his minor granddaughter in the house. to vacate the house before 15 may 2012; thus he had given them thirty-nine days. submitted a separate complaint against the decision of the šiauliai district court (see paragraph 15 above), complaining that the court had made a purely formalistic assessment of his minor granddaughter’s living arrangements in the house and that it had not commented on the fact that the bailiff had ignored his wife’s illness. the bailiff submitted a separate complaint against the decision of the šiauliai district court (see paragraph 14 above). on 25 january 2013 the šiauliai regional court dismissed the bailiff’s complaint holding that g.b. ’s illness had been grounds to suspend the eviction proceedings. on 3 april 2013 the bailiff informed z.b. that the eviction would take place on 16 april 2013. stated that his mother was living in the house and, because she was not on the list of persons who could be evicted, the eviction could not take place. ’s mother had to be taken care of by the police or other relevant authorities. the bailiff agreed with the first applicant that z.b. the first applicant then lodged a complaint before the šiauliai district court, complaining about the bailiff’s inactivity. only the persons listed on the writ of execution could be evicted, and any other persons were considered to be only temporarily present and had to immediately leave the premises. the court held that the bailiff had failed to perform the execution of the eviction properly and that he had had no grounds to suspend or postpone the execution. on 31 october 2013 the šiauliai regional court dismissed it. on 7 november 2013 the bailiff issued an order for forced eviction. on 18 november 2013 the forced eviction took place, with the participation of the bailiff, the locksmith and two police officers. the next day, the bailiff drew up a document by which the second applicant was assigned as the property manager of the goods that had been left in the house and that had been seized. after this date the sale of the property would become lawful. against the bailiff, the second applicant and third parties regarding the annulment of the negative consequences caused by the unlawful actions of the bailiff and compensation for non-pecuniary damage. had asked it to rule that some personal belongings could not be sold at auction. had not taken advantage of the opportunity to name buyers who might have had an interest in taking part in the auction that had been subsequently carried out.
at the time of the events the applicants were all working as cashiers for m.s.a., a spanish family-owned supermarket chain. at the beginning of february 2009 the applicants’ employer noticed some irregularities between the supermarket stock levels and what was actually sold on a daily basis. in particular, the shop supervisor identified losses in excess of eur 7,780 in february, eur 17,971 in march, eur 13,936 in april, eur 18,009 in may and eur 24,614 in june 2009. in order to investigate and put an end to the economic losses, on 15 june 2009 the employer installed surveillance cameras consisting of both visible and hidden cameras. the purpose of the visible cameras was to record possible customer thefts and they were pointed toward the entrances and exits of the supermarket. on 25 and 29 june 2009 all the workers suspected of theft were called to individual meetings. security cameras had also caught them allowing customers and co-workers to leave the store with merchandise that had not been paid for. on 22 july 2009 the first applicant brought proceedings for unfair dismissal before the granollers employment tribunal no.1 (hereinafter “the employment tribunal”). the same day the second applicant brought similar proceedings before the employment tribunal in a joint application with the third, fourth and fifth applicants (see paragraph 20 below). in the framework of the proceedings both applicants objected to the use of the covert video surveillance, arguing that it had breached their right to protection of their privacy. on 20 january 2010 the employment tribunal issued two judgments ruling against the applicants, declaring both dismissals fair. the main evidence supporting the fairness of their dismissals was the recordings resulting from the covert surveillance, as well as the witness statements of co-workers dismissed for their involvement in the thefts, the shop manager, the union representative and the company’s legal representative. this had been confirmed by the constitutional court in several judgments (see, among other authorities, judgment no. the applicants appealed before the high court of justice of catalonia on 16 and 22 march 2010 respectively. while acknowledging that it was possible that the employer could face an administrative sanction for not informing its employees and the staff committee in advance of the installation of the cameras, that fact alone had no relevance from a constitutional point of view, since from that perspective the covert video surveillance had been justified (in that there had been reasonable suspicions of theft), appropriate to the legitimate aim pursued, necessary and proportionate. consequently, their dismissals had been justified on the same grounds as already stated by the employment tribunal. the applicants brought cassation appeals, which were declared inadmissible on 5 october 2011 and 7 february 2012 respectively. on 25 and 29 june 2006 the applicants were dismissed on disciplinary grounds: they had been caught on video helping co-workers and customers steal items and stealing them themselves. according to the employer, the security cameras had caught the third applicant scanning items from the grocery baskets of customers and co-workers and afterwards voiding the receipts. security cameras had also caught her allowing customers or co-workers to leave the store with merchandise that had not been paid for. in the meetings at least one union representative and the company’s legal representative were also present. according to the applicants, the settlement agreements had to be declared void. they also argued that the evidence derived from the covert video surveillance had been obtained illegally. on 20 january 2010 the employment tribunal ruled against the applicants and declared the dismissals fair. it carefully analysed the settlement agreements signed by the applicants. accordingly, the settlement agreements were declared valid under article 1.809 of the civil code and, consequently, the employment tribunal ruled against the third, fourth and fifth applicants. the applicants appealed before the high court of justice of catalonia on 16 march 2010. referring to the constitutional court’s case-law, it confirmed that the defendant party had been authorised to carry out the covert video surveillance on the applicants. the applicants brought a joint cassation appeal, which was declared inadmissible on 7 february 2012.
the applicant was born in 1982 and is currently detained in bostadel prison, in menzingen. the criminal court sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment, after deducting periods spent in pre-trial detention from 22 may to 25 june 2003 and from 3 may 2004 until the delivery of the judgment. on 19 july 2005 the applicant was transferred to bostadel prison. in a judgment of 12 may 2007 the federal court dismissed a subsequent appeal by the applicant. the intercantonal commission submitted its report on 29 october 2007. the intercantonal commission thus concluded that the applicant was to be regarded as a danger to the public. acting on instructions from the department of justice of the canton of basle urban, dr r.a., found that these disorders had already been present at the time when the offences had been committed. on 15 october 2008 the governor of bostadel prison drew up a progress report on the applicant’s detention, in which he noted that there was a high risk that the applicant might escape and accordingly proposed that he be employed within the prison premises. in a report dated 10 november 2008 the intercantonal commission found that the applicant represented a danger to the public, and recommended that no adjustments to the conditions of his sentence be ordered and that the appropriate court be asked to review whether the conditions for an (outpatient) therapeutic measure in conjunction with the sentence (vollzugsbegleitende therapeutische massnahme) were satisfied (article 63 of the criminal code). the intercantonal commission also recommended that should such a measure prove unsuccessful, consideration be given to converting the sentence into indefinite detention. to clarify this possibility, it proposed that an additional expert report be drawn up. in a report dated 5 january 2010 the governor of bostadel prison noted in particular that the applicant had displayed good behaviour while working in an outside environment and that release on parole could therefore be envisaged, even if only for a limited period. she added that the applicant was not especially overawed, in emotional terms, by the sentence he was serving. however, she did not rule out all possibility of treatment, referring to some more promising therapeutic approaches. on 7 july 2010, referring to the above-mentioned additional psychiatric report, the post-sentencing authority of the canton of basle urban (“the post-sentencing authority”) asked the court of appeal to review whether, following its judgment of 12 january 2007, the conditions for ordering subsequent indefinite detention, or possibly an institutional therapeutic measure, were satisfied (articles 64 and 59 of the criminal code respectively, taken together with article 65; see paragraph 24 below). in a letter dated 21 april 2011 to the court of appeal, they confirmed their findings of 17 december 2010. in a judgment of 6 may 2011, after hearing evidence from professor a.e. it noted that indefinite detention was an exceptional measure and could only be ordered with caution. in addition, the federal court noted that it was appropriate to consider whether an institutional therapeutic measure should be ordered. accordingly, it quashed the judgment appealed against and remitted the case to the court of appeal for a fresh decision. before giving judgment, the court of appeal had requested information from professor a.e. according to the applicant, he should have completed his sentence on 19 march 2013, taking into account his pre-trial detention from 22 may to 25 june 2003 and from 3 may 2004 onwards (see paragraph 6 above). more specifically, the federal court acknowledged that the law governing measures for offenders other than sentences (articles 56-65 of the criminal code) applied retrospectively to criminal acts committed before the entry into force of the relevant law on 1 january 2007 (paragraph 2, sub-paragraph 1, of the transitional provisions of the 13 december 2002 amendment to the criminal code). such a link had been present in his case. 7 to the convention provided for a number of exceptions to that principle, the federal court observed that the review conducted in the present case for the purposes of ordering a subsequent institutional therapeutic measure on the basis of the applicant’s serious mental illness, which had already been present but had not been detected at the time of the initial judgment, did not constitute a second penalty in respect of him. having been invited by the court to provide information about the applicant’s current situation, the parties submitted observations on the matter. he maintained that he was not receiving any treatment or therapy. in a letter dated 31 may 2016 the government confirmed that the applicant was still in bostadel prison. both parties appended reports by bostadel prison on the applicant’s behaviour.
the applicant was born in 1930 and lives in vilnius. on 29 december 2001 the applicant’s husband asked the national authorities to restore his property rights to a house and a plot of land in vilnius which had belonged to his grandfather before nationalisation. on 10 april 2003 the vilnius county administration informed the vilnius municipality that the property rights of the applicant’s husband would be restored to 0.1638 hectares of land for residential purposes. on 11 june 2003 the vilnius municipality informed the vilnius county administration that a plot of land of 0.1007 hectares had been formed near the buildings owned by the applicant’s husband. in november 2003 the vilnius city first district court established as a legal fact that the grandmother of the applicant’s husband had owned a plot of land in vilnius measuring 362 square “fathoms” (sieksnis – 1 fathom equals 1.82 m). on 12 march 2004 the vilnius county administration informed the vilnius municipality that the property rights of the applicant’s husband would be restored and that he was a candidate to receive a plot of land measuring 0.1638 hectares in natura. in august 2006 the authorities replied to the applicant husband’s letter asking why only a plot of land of 0.1007 hectares instead of 0.1638 hectares had been formed near the house, and stated that the plot of land 0.1007 hectares where the premises had been situated, would be divided for several co-owners of the premises and the rest of the land would be returned to the applicant’s husband by the means he chose. on 16 may 2007 the applicant’s husband died and the applicant became his heir. on 9 april 2009 the property rights of the applicant’s husband were restored in natura to 0.0467 hectares of land and it was provided that compensation of approximately 1,642 euros (eur) would be paid in securities for the remaining 0.1181 hectares of land. in february 2010 the applicant applied to have the administrative proceedings suspended and to have the matter of calculation of compensation referred to the constitutional court. the court stated that in comparison with these numbers, the value of the plot of land provided by the vilnius county administration (see paragraph 14 above) was 327.5 times lower, and it could not conform to the principle of equal value. moreover, in accordance with the methodology approved by the government, the calculation was the same for plots of land in the city centre and outside the city. the court thus decided to suspend the administrative proceedings and to refer the matter to the constitutional court. in april 2013 the national land service informed the applicant that the relevant laws had been changed and that she could change the form of restoration of the property rights to 0.1286 hectares of land. instead of securities she could choose one of the following: to be assigned a new plot of land of equivalent value to the one held previously; to have the liabilities to the state legally voided; to be assigned a new plot of land for individual construction; to receive monetary compensation. it appears that the applicant did not reply to this letter. on 30 september 2013 the applicant was included on the list of persons to receive a plot of land for construction of an individual house. after the matter had been resolved by the constitutional court (see paragraph 35 below), the vilnius regional administrative court rejected the applicant’s claim on 4 november 2013. the court analysed the domestic regulation regarding the calculation of the value of the land and observed that this matter had been referred to the constitutional court, which held that the methodology approved by the government setting down the principles of calculation of the value of the land was in accordance with the law. if no other means were chosen, the property rights had to be restored by paying monetary compensation. the court further observed that the authorities had suggested the applicant choose other means to have her property rights restored (see paragraph 17 above), and that in september 2013 it had been decided to include the applicant on the list of persons to receive a plot of land for construction of an individual house. the decision to restore the applicant’s property rights by paying her compensation in securities had to be changed to monetary compensation. on 29 may 2014 the supreme administrative court upheld the first-instance decision. the supreme administrative court also held that the applicant had complained about the length of the court proceedings. the court held that the applicant had lodged the complaint on 4 november 2009; it had been accepted by the vilnius regional administrative court on 17 november 2009. on 10 february 2010 the vilnius regional administrative court had decided to apply to the constitutional court, which had adopted its decision on 11 september 2013. the proceedings in the administrative case had recommenced on 16 september 2013 and the decision had been adopted on 4 november 2013. given the complexity of the case and referral of the matter to the constitutional court, the length of proceedings had not breached the reasonable time requirement. the applicant was asked to express her wish before 1 march 2015. it appears that she never replied to this letter.
in 2005 he was granted a temporary residence permit in sweden which was made permanent in 2007. both permits were based on the applicant’s family ties, but he was not granted swedish citizenship. in march 2016 the swedish security service (säkerhetspolisen) applied to the migration agency (migrationsverket) requesting the applicant’s expulsion. during the migration agency’s examination of the request, the applicant applied for asylum, claiming that he was in need of international protection. he further contested the security service’s request alleging that, since the security service had branded him a terrorist, he would risk torture and at least ten years’ imprisonment in morocco. he submitted that he would be forced to confess to an act of terrorism that he had not committed. during the visit, police officers had approached him and informed him that they were monitoring him and advised him to “listen to our friends in sweden or stay away from morocco forever”. moreover, to his knowledge, his parents had never been approached by the authorities because of him and the moroccan authorities had never contacted him in sweden. however, he claimed that the swedish security service would inform the moroccan authorities of the reasons for his arrest and expulsion and other moroccans in sweden might also submit such information. he was not aware if his situation had been noted in morocco. the applicant referred to country information about morocco according to which physical ill-treatment and arbitrary detention occurred, in particular of suspected terrorists. such persons had been tortured into confession and sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment. it noted that the human rights situation in morocco had improved significantly. violence at police stations and prisons had decreased. imprisonment was common in terror-related cases and persons affiliated with islamic movements ran a higher risk of being subjected to violence. however, the moroccan authorities had publicly stated that the fight against terrorism should not be used as a pretext for depriving people of their rights. torture was illegal and efforts to curb the use of torture had been successful. as concerned the applicant’s situation, the migration agency found no reasons to question the security service’s assessment of the applicant. moreover, the agency considered that he had not made out that the moroccan authorities had previously showed an interest in him. it took into account that he had lived outside morocco for about a decade and that, as he said himself, he had lived an inconspicuous life in sweden without political or religious activities. his parents in morocco had not reported any visits from the authorities enquiring about him and the moroccan authorities had never contacted him in sweden. they had never requested his extradition either, or informed him that he was suspected of terrorism or any other kind of criminality. it took into account that no objective evidence suggested that the moroccan authorities were aware of his case and that the legislation had regard to the possible risks of being labelled a terrorist and had been designed to avoid such risks. it thus rejected his request for asylum and international protection, revoked his permanent residence permit and ordered his expulsion to either morocco or another specified country. it also decided on a lifelong ban on returning to sweden. the agency maintained its stance and stated, inter alia, that the applicant had not made it probable that he was of interest to the moroccan authorities and there was no concrete information indicating that they should be aware of what had happened to him in sweden. the security service stated that it was as transparent as possible but, for reasons of confidentiality, could not reveal its working methods and sources. it added that it was continually assessing whether it was possible to enforce the expulsion. on 8 september 2016 the government upheld the migration agency’s decision in full. the government noted the security service’s submissions concerning the applicant’s background and connections and found that there were no grounds for questioning these submissions.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in larnaca. following his dismissal from cyprus airways ltd as a trainee pilot, the applicant on 26 june 1998 brought a civil action before the district court of nicosia for wrongful dismissal and defamation (civil action no. the defendant company was represented by a law firm. on 29 december 2006 the court dismissed the action. on 9 february 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal with the supreme court (appeal no. the appeal was tried by a bench of three judges. the hearing of the appeal was held on 11 march 2007. on that date the managing partner of the above-mentioned law firm, mr p.g.p., appeared for the defendant company and addressed the supreme court. up until that date, other lawyers from the firm had appeared before the appeal bench on behalf of the defendant company. on 21 april 2010 the supreme court dismissed the appeal unanimously. the applicant submitted that after the judgment of the supreme court was given, he discovered that the son of one of the judges sitting on the bench, judge a.k., were married and that both worked at the latter’s law firm. the lawyer representing him in the domestic proceedings had not requested the exemption of the judge in question because he had not had sufficient knowledge of the relevant facts at the time. the applicant had also not instructed his lawyer to do so as he had found out about this fact only after the appeal proceedings had ended.
the applicant was born in 1974 and at the time of lodging his application he was serving his prison sentence in the bolu f-type prison. on 25 january 2008 the applicant wrote a letter to the ministry of justice, in which he had praised the imprisoned leader of the pkk, abdullah öcalan by using the honorific “sayın”, meaning esteemed. pursuant to the regulations on the administration of penitentiary institutions and the execution of sentences, the applicant was found guilty of breaching a prison order by the bolu f-type prison disciplinary board (referred hereafter as “the board”). on 1 february 2008 the applicant was sentenced to 11 days’ solitary confinement on the orders of the board, on account of his statements in the above-mentioned letter. on 26 february 2008 the bolu enforcement judge rejected the applicant’s objection. on 11 march 2008 the bolu assize court upheld the judgment of 26 february 2008.
on 27 december 2010 the applicant was arrested on drug-related charges and placed in custody. on 14 december 2012 the case was submitted for trial to the voronezh regional court. on 11 july 2013 the court returned the case to the deputy prosecutor general for remedying certain procedural defects. on 20 september 2013 the investigations department of the federal drug control service received the case file and forwarded it to its regional branch in st petersburg. on 1 november 2013 an investigator asked the st petersburg city court to extend the applicant’s detention for a further four months, until 31 march 2014. on 8 november 2013 the city court granted the application. he pointed out that the maximum statutory time period for keeping him in pre-trial detention had expired a long time ago and that any further extensions had been unlawful. on 27 november 2013 the st petersburg city court rejected his appeal in a summary fashion, without examining his arguments in detail.
the applicant is a non-governmental organisation which promotes tolerance and condemns all types of racially motivated discrimination. it was established under swiss law and registered in zürich. on 5 november 2009 the youth wing of the swiss people’s party (junge schweizerische volkspartei) held a demonstration in the train station square in the town of frauenfeld concerning a public initiative to support the prohibition of the building of minarets in switzerland. after the event the party published a report on its website, including the following excerpts:
“in his speech in front of the thurgau government building [thurgauer regierungsgebäude], b.k., a symbolic sign, such as the prohibition of minarets, would therefore be an expression of the preservation of one’s own identity.” the president of the local branch of the young swiss people’s party, emphasised that it was time to stop the expansion of islam. he added further: ‘the swiss guiding culture, based on christianity, cannot allow itself to be replaced by other cultures. swiss people’s party of switzerland canton representative h.l. on 29 november 2009 the popular initiative against the construction of minarets was accepted in a referendum and a constitutional amendment banning the construction of new minarets was introduced. he applied, firstly, to have the applicant organisation withdraw the entry in question from its homepage and, secondly, for it to be replaced with the court’s judgment. on 15 march 2011 the kreuzlingen district court dismissed b.k. on appeal, on 17 november 2011 the thurgau cantonal high court (obergericht des kantons thurgau) reversed the first-instance judgment. ’s speech as “verbally racist” had been a mixed value judgment, which could lead to an infringement of personality rights if it was based on untruths. on 25 january 2012 the applicant organisation filed an appeal with the federal supreme court (bundesgericht), reiterating its argument that any interference with b.k. ’s personality rights had been justified. to fulfil its role of watchdog in that sense, it published articles and interviews concerning current events relating to racism and anti‑semitism. not only in the context of the criminal offence of racial discrimination (article 261bis of the criminal code) but more generally, the term in question is, in the eyes of the average reader, capable of deliberately debasing the person whose comments have been classified as ‘verbally racist’, accusing him or her of behaviour which is frowned upon by society in the form of an act which is, at the very least, questionable in constitutional terms (cf. bge 127 iii 481 e. 2b / aa p. 487, 129 iii 49 e. 2.2 p. 51 and 715 e. 4.1 p. 722). the appellant referred to the respondent’s speech at the public demonstration of 5 november 2009 on its website ... freely accessible on the internet, commenting on the term ‘verbal racism’. it contains a substantive core and, at the same time, a value judgment. in order to justify the substantive core, it is necessary to examine whether the respondent’s comments were indeed racist. the term ‘racism’ is understood as ‘a doctrine’ which states that ‘certain races or nations are superior to others in terms of their cultural capacity’, and, on the other hand, a ‘certain attitude, manner of thinking and acting towards people of (certain) other races or nations’ (cf. duden, the great dictionary of the german language in six volumes, vol. verbal racism is, therefore, no longer merely a certain attitude, but an attitude in the instant case which was expressed publicly through language (as opposed to, for example, through deeds). ‘ verbal racism’ could therefore mean racial discrimination in the criminal sense, as the respondent claims. what is decisive, however, as the second-instance court correctly stated, is that the mere demonstration of a difference between two individuals or groups does not constitute racism. in his public speech, the respondent expressed his opinion on the prohibition of minarets, which, in the opinion of the high court, would not be compatible with freedom of religion and non-discrimination. for the average listener, that does not result in the blanket denigration of the followers of islam or show fundamental contempt for muslims. therefore, the substantive core does not apply and the assessment is not acceptable. therefore, the mixed value judgment, which infringed personality rights, cannot be justified by any overriding interest within the meaning of article 28 § 2 of the civil code.
the applicant was born in 1981 and lives in sochi. on 27 november 2010 the applicant, a police captain, was arrested for soliciting a bribe. he was taken into custody and his detention was extended on several occasions. on 4 july 2011 the case was submitted for trial in the tsentralnyy district court of sochi. on 8 july 2011 the district court determined that the case was not ready for trial and returned the file to the prosecutor. by the same decision, it extended the applicant’s detention until 10 august 2011. on 9 august 2011 the director of the iz-23/2 remand prison where the applicant was held reported to the sochi prosecutor and to the president of the tsentralnyy district court that, in the absence of an order extending the applicant’s detention beyond 10 august, he would need to be released on that date. on the same date the sochi prosecutor replied to him that there were no grounds for releasing the applicant because the date for hearing the prosecutor’s appeal against the district court’s order of 8 july had been fixed for 17 august. the applicant was not released on 10 august. he complained about his unlawful detention to the head of the investigations committee and the regional head of the ministry of the interior but did not receive any reply. on 17 august 2011 the krasnodar regional court quashed the district court’s order on appeal. as regards the custodial measure, it held that no extension had been necessary because by virtue of article 255 § 2 of the code of criminal procedure the applicant could be held in custody for an initial six-month period starting from the date on which the case had been submitted for trial.
the applicant was born in 1984 and lives in toksovo. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. on 2 october 2009 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of raping k., who was employed at the vasileostrovskiy district court in st petersburg as an assistant to judge n., and who also was the daughter of that court’s former president, judge k., who carried on working as a judge at that time. on 4 october 2009 judge r. of the vasileostrovskiy district court remanded the applicant in custody. he rejected a challenge for bias which the applicant’s lawyer raised in respect of the entire composition of the district court because of a link between the alleged victim and the judges of that court. on 26 october 2009 the st petersburg city court upheld the detention order on appeal, rejecting a challenge by the applicant as unsubstantiated. on 30 november 2009 a deputy president of the city court referred an application by an investigator for an extension order to the oktyabrskiy district court for consideration. the district court granted the application on the following day. on 11 december 2009 the city court upheld that decision on appeal. however, on 31 march 2010 the supreme court of russia determined that the decision to refer the application to another district court had been invalid, because the city court’s deputy president had decided on the change of venue of his own initiative without hearing what the defendant’s opinion on that issue was. on 30 december 2009 a further extension was granted by the president of the vasileostrovskiy district court, judge sh., who again rejected a challenge for bias by the applicant. on 26 january 2010 the city court upheld the extension order on appeal. by a separate decision of the same date, it upheld the rejection of the challenge in respect of judge sh.: on 27 january and 27 february 2010 extension orders were issued by judges of the kalininskiy district court, which had territorial jurisdiction over the area where the applicant was detained. those orders were upheld on appeal on 25 march and 8 april 2010. on 11 march 2010 the case against the applicant was referred to the vasileostrovskiy district court for trial and allocated to its president, judge sh. allowed the applicant’s challenge for bias in respect of the entire composition of that court, holding as follows:
“it has been established that the injured party in the criminal proceedings [k.] works as an assistant to the vasileostrovskiy district court’s judge [n.], and that her father [judge k.] is a judge of the vasileostrovskiy district court. it follows that circumstances exist leading the defendant and his counsel to believe that [judge sh.] and all the judges of the vasileostrovskiy district court are, either directly or indirectly, interested in the outcome of the criminal case. in order to ensure an impartial examination of the criminal case, the challenge ... must be allowed and the case referred to the president of the st petersburg city court for determination of the territorial jurisdiction.” extended the applicant’s detention until 12 may 2010. on the last day of the extended period the presidium of the city court, by way of supervisory review, quashed the decision of 23 march in part in relation to the detention matter, on the grounds that an extension could not have been granted by a judge who had recused himself. the presidium extended the applicant’s detention until 12 august 2010. on 15 april 2010 a deputy president of the city court determined that the trial would be held in the petrogradskiy district court. on 31 march 2011 the petrogradskiy district court found the applicant guilty of rape and sentenced him to five years and six months’ imprisonment.
the applicants are owners of residential buildings or apartments which were subject to the rent-control scheme. under the relevant legislation they were obliged to let their flats to tenants while charging no more than the maximum amount of rent fixed by the state. the legislation precluded them from unilaterally terminating the leases or selling the flats in question to anyone other than the respective tenants. the particulars of the flats affected by the rent control are set out in appendices 10 ‑ 17 (columns a ‑ f). the situation of the applicants is structurally and contextually the same as that of the applicants in bittó and others v. slovakia (no. 30255/09, 28 january 2014 (merits) and 7 july 2015 (just satisfaction)), and subsequently decided cases concerning the rent-control scheme in slovakia (see krahulec v. slovakia, no. 19294/07; bukovčanová and others v. slovakia, no. 38082/07, 5 july 2016; riedel and others v. slovakia, nos. 44218/07, 54831/07, 33176/08, 47150/08; and mečiar and others v. slovakia, no. 62864/09, 10 january 2017; matuschka and others v. slovakia [committee], nos. 33076/10, 14383/11, balan and others v. slovakia [committee], nos. two residential building at 27 panenská st. in bratislava were acquired in 2002 by a religious organisation with legal personality, cirkevný zbor evanjelickej cirkvi augsburského vyznania na slovensku bratislava (hereinafter “the bratislava evangelical church”). this body established three other entities with legal personalities, including the applicant organisation the old town evangelical church. the property in question was conveyed by the bratislava evangelical church to the old town evangelical church by way of donation on 6 february 2013. on 15 february 2013 the previous owner ceased legally to exist and was legally succeeded by the old town evangelical church and the other two entities. on 22 february 2012 the old town evangelical church gave formal notices of termination of their lease to the two tenants residing in flat no. 11 situated in the residential building at 27 panenská st. by law, these tenants had under certain circumstances the right to claim that the municipality provide them with a substitute flat on the termination of their lease. they did not avail themselves of that right. on 6 august 2013 the old town evangelical church applied to the bratislava i district court for an eviction order against the occupants of this flat who had failed to vacate it by the expiry of the twelve‑month notice period. as the occupants eventually vacated the flat on 25 february 2015, the old town evangelical church withdrew its action and the proceedings in respect of it were discontinued on 9 march 2015. until the vacation of the flat, the occupants had paid the old town evangelical church compensation in an amount equal to the regulated rent. 5 and 12 within the same building owing to rebuilding of the original flats. the tenants continued to pay the regulated rent. 5 was rebuilt and its area was changed from 110.27 sq. a similar situation arose in the residential building on 33 pražská st. in bratislava where in 2014 the tenant residing in flat no. 9, and in the residential building located on 15 vrbovská cesta st. in piešťany, where the tenant living in the flat no.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in bucharest. at 6 p.m. on 11 december 2011 two police officers arrived at the applicant’s door and asked for his identification papers without giving their names or informing him of the purpose of their visit. the applicant asked them what the purpose of their request was but they did not answer. noting the escalation of events, the applicant’s partner, g.c., searched for his identification papers and handed them all to the police officers: identity card, pension benefits slip and a certificate that he had been a fighter in the 1989 revolution. the police officers took the papers without looking at them and took the applicant to police station no. the pain was so intense that the applicant soiled himself. during the beating, the applicant’s mobile phone and still camera were destroyed and his clothes were torn. when they returned they informed him that they were leaving on a mission. the police officer sent him home to clean himself up. the applicant went home and then returned to the police section to recover his identity papers. on 16 december 2011 the applicant was examined by a forensic doctor at mina minovici national forensic institute (“the forensic institute”). the doctor drafted a medical report dated 16 december 2011; a copy of the report was given to the applicant on 4 january 2012. two weeks after the incident, the applicant received by mail an offence report (proces verbal de contravenţie) drafted by the police officers on 23 december 2011 in his absence, whereby he was fined 100 romanian lei (ron) for “refusal to present data necessary for his identification”. on 11 december 2011 two police officers were directed by the officer on duty at police station no. 19 to settle a conflict between the applicant and a neighbour. upon arrival, the police officers asked the applicant to present his identity papers, but he became violent and refused to comply. when the applicant tried to return to his apartment the police officers handcuffed him and transported him to the police station. after his identity had been established, the applicant left the police station. these investigators heard evidence from the two police officers, from the officer on duty on the day of the events and from the neighbour’s husband (see below). lastly, the two police officers gave their statements on respectively 4 and 5 october 2012. the applicant’s partner, was never heard by the investigators. 218/2002 on the organisation and functioning of the romanian police (see paragraph 26 below). the applicant lodged a complaint with the bucharest county court against the two decisions. he contested the prosecutor’s opinion that the injuries incurred had been superficial. he referred to the court’s relevant case-law, which required a plausible explanation for any traces of violence sustained while a person had been under police supervision. on 11 june 2013 the county court dismissed the complaint and consequently upheld the prosecutors’ decisions. the court considered that the police intervention had been lawful. the court considered that the applicant had not been kept unlawfully in the police station but had been released as soon as his identity had been established, and that the consequences of the police intervention had not been serious enough to constitute the crime of torture, as alleged by the applicant. the decision was final, no further appeal being possible.
the first applicant, habibe i̇ncin, is the wife of kerim i̇ncin; the second to seventh applicants are his children; the eighth applicant is his mother and the remaining seven applicants are the siblings of kerim i̇ncin. on 22 march 2005 the applicants halima i̇ncin and hazım i̇ncin, with the assistance of their lawyer, submitted a petition to the hakkari prosecutor. in their petition the two applicants alleged that after severe military clashes had taken place in the vicinity of their village, in 1994 they and their family members had left turkey and moved to live with their relatives in iraq. in june 1995 kerim i̇ncin had gone back to their village in turkey to collect a sum of money he was owed. while he was having dinner in the village headman’s house, village guards had arrived and taken him to the nearby geçimli military station. while at the military station kerim i̇ncin had been questioned and subjected to ill-treatment. after having detained him at the station for a week, the soldiers had taken him back to the village, where they had shot him and buried him. in their petition the two applicants also gave the prosecutor the names of a number of people who they alleged had witnessed the incident in question. they asked the prosecutor to carry out an investigation, to identify and question all the eyewitnesses, to exhume the body of kerim i̇ncin and to find and punish those responsible for the killing. the prosecutor started an investigation into the applicants’ allegations immediately. in the course of the investigation, between 2005 and 2006 the prosecutor questioned the applicants and other members of their family. during the same period the prosecutor also identified, summoned and questioned a large number of witnesses and members of the military who had lived or worked in the region at the time of the events but who, in the years that had elapsed since the killing, had moved to different parts of the country. a number of witnesses told the prosecutor that they had seen kerim i̇ncin being taken away from the village by the soldiers and added that shortly afterwards a large-scale military operation had been conducted in the area and they had heard that kerim i̇ncin had been killed in the course of that operation. as a result of the questioning the prosecutor found it established that kerim i̇ncin had indeed been killed and that his body had been buried in taşbaşı village cemetery. on 26 may 2006 the prosecutor asked the hakkari gendarmerie command whether there would be any security concerns if he were to visit that cemetery with a view to exhuming a body. the prosecutor continued to request security updates from the military until 2009 and sent approximately twenty letters requesting that the military inform him as soon as it was possible to visit the village. in their replies during spring, summer and autumn months, the soldiers informed the prosecutor that it was not a good idea to go to the area in question because a military operation could be conducted there at any time. finally, on 11 june 2009 the prosecutor informed the military of his intention to go to the cemetery on 18 june 2009 and instructed the military to take the necessary security measures for his planned visit. on 18 june 2009 the prosecutor went to the cemetery in question and a body was exhumed from a grave in his presence. it was subsequently established by dna analysis that it was the body of kerim i̇ncin. forensic examinations showed that there were ten holes in the clothes in which kerim i̇ncin had been buried and that the cause of death had been numerous firearms injuries inflicted on his body and skull. on 25 march 2010 the prosecutor took a decision not to prosecute ten of the suspects who had been working as members of the military at the time of the events, for lack of evidence. the following day the prosecutor prepared an indictment and charged y.k. − who had been the commander of the geçimli military station where kerim i̇ncin had allegedly been taken at the time of the events − with the offence of murder. the trial before the hakkari assize court started on 12 april 2010. in the course of the trial a total of twenty hearings were held. on 27 november 2014 the hakkari assize court acquitted y.k. the same day the applicants appealed against the judgment acquitting y.k. and the proceedings before the court of cassation are still pending. at the request of the court, the government stated that, in accordance with the applicable statute of limitations, the criminal proceedings against y.k.
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in voluntari. who was employed at voluntari city hall – had, at the request of the applicant, antedated the registration of six applications for title submitted by m.c.i. on 19 february and 23 july 2004 respectively the prosecutor questioned n.g. the applicant gave statements on 27 february and 11 august 2004. to falsify the date of registration of the applications. had antedated the registration of the six applications. he decided not to institute a criminal investigation against m.c.i. had asked some civil servants at voluntari city hall to antedate the registration of the applications. at a hearing on 11 march 2005 the buftea district court questioned the applicant and n.g. in respect of the charges brought against them. changed the statements she had made initially before the prosecutor and stated that the applicant had only called her and asked her to help m.c.i. the applicant did not change his statements and continued to deny any involvement in committing the intellectual forgery. with the registration of the applications as the latter had arrived after closing time. two other witnesses made statements at the same hearing. by a judgment of 9 may 2005 the buftea district court convicted n.g. of intellectual forgery, imposed a suspended sentence of six months’ imprisonment and placed her on probation. had given contradictory statements to the prosecutor and to the court with respect to the applicant’s role in the commission of the offence. and the witnesses were not heard directly by the county court. to antedate the registration of the applications. no new pieces of evidence were adduced before the bucharest court of appeal. by a final decision of 3 march 2006, the bucharest court of appeal allowed the appeal on points of law lodged by the prosecutor’s office, quashing the two previous decisions. it convicted the applicant of inciting intellectual forgery and imposed a suspended sentence of six months’ imprisonment, placing him on probation. the appellate court based its reasoning on the evidence existent in the file. it held that both the lower courts had made a wrong assessment of evidence. however, it did not question the applicant, the co-defendant n.g., or the witnesses, instead merely citing some of the statements they had made before the prosecutor and the first-instance court. to the prosecutor on 19 february and 23 july 2004 and before the district court on 11 march 2005, and to the statements given by the applicant on 27 february and 11 august 2004. having reassessed the facts without rehearing any evidence, it arrived at the conclusion that the applicant had incited n.g. the final written decision containing the court’s reasoning became available on 20 march 2006. the applicant alleged that he had been served with a copy of the decision later but he was not able to state any date.
the first and second applicants are ilinden’s chairman and deputy chairman. the remaining seven applicants are members of ilinden’s board of management. 44079/98, 20 october 2005; united macedonian organisation ilinden-pirin and others v. bulgaria, no. 59489/00, 20 october 2005; ivanov and others v. bulgaria, no. 46336/99, 24 november 2005; united macedonian organisation ilinden and others v. bulgaria, no. 48284/07, 18 october 2011; and united macedonian organisation ilinden-pirin and others v. bulgaria (no. on 19 september 2010 ninety-eight members of ilinden held a founding meeting at which they resolved to form the organisation and apply to register it, adopted articles of association, and elected individuals to the organisation’s constituent bodies. on 27 september 2010 ilinden’s managing council applied to the blagoevgrad regional court for it to be registered as an association. in the course of the proceedings, the court several times asked the applicants to rectify deficiencies in the registration papers. бос), the blagoevgrad regional court refused to register ilinden. it noted that it had on several occasions instructed the applicants to rectify deficiencies in the registration papers, the latest such instruction having been given on 29 november 2011. the applicants had not clearly set out the competences of the association’s constituent bodies and had not made it clear which of the several copies of the articles of association filed with the court, in which differences appeared, had been the ones adopted at the founding meeting. also, ilinden’s aims, as defined in its articles of association, contravened article 44 of the constitution (see paragraph 22 below). it was true that ilinden intended to use peaceful means to attain those aims. ilinden asked that bulgaria “stop carrying out its policy of assimilating macedonians”, “stop supporting nationalist propaganda that [has] sow[n] discrimination, hostility and threats against macedonians”, “stop preventing macedonians from holding peaceful rallies”, and “not [to] discriminate against macedonians”. they were therefore unlawful and precluded ilinden’s registration. the real reason for the refusal to register it had been that it had advocated opinions which were at odds with official opinion. the registration papers met all the required formalities. сас, гк), the sofia court of appeal upheld the refusal to register ilinden. it held that its aims, as set out in its articles of association, were political, which was not permissible for an association seeking registration under the non-profit legal persons act 2000 (see paragraphs 19-21 and 23 below). for instance, in clause 2 of its articles of association, ilinden proclaimed itself as successor to “the national liberation struggle of the macedonian nation”, and in clause 3 stated that it would “express and protect the civic, political, national, social and economic rights of macedonians living in bulgaria”. clause 5 said that ilinden would strive to free macedonians from the sense of fear engendered by the bulgarian state’s policy of discrimination and assimilation and to outlaw bulgarian racism against macedonians. at the end of its decision, the sofia court of appeal said that it was amenable to appeal on points of law before the supreme court of cassation. in a decision of 30 april 2013 (опр № 133 от 30.04.2013 г. it held that under the applicable provisions of the 1952 code of civil procedure, as construed in a binding interpretative decision in 2001 (see paragraph 24 below), appellate decisions upholding refusals to register a non-governmental organisation had been amenable to appeal on points of law. however, that was not the case under the 2007 code of civil procedure, which had come into effect on 1 march 2008. they contested the way in which the three-member panel had construed the relevant provisions of the new code. in a final decision of 15 july 2013 (опр. another three-member panel of the supreme court of cassation upheld the first panel’s decision. analysing in detail the applicable provisions of the new code, it confirmed the manner in which the first three-member panel had interpreted them.
the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in yerevan. he is a former minister of foreign affairs and at the material time he headed a political movement called “civil disobedience”. on 5 may 2007 criminal proceedings were instituted under article 190 § 3 (1) of the criminal code (money laundering) in respect of the applicant. on 7 may 2007 the applicant was arrested and on 10 may 2007 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan ordered the applicant’s detention for a period of two months, upon an application by the investigator, taking into account the nature and the dangerousness of the imputed offence and the fact that the applicant, if remaining at large, could abscond and obstruct the investigation by exerting unlawful influence on the persons involved in the proceedings. the applicant objected to that application, arguing that the investigator had failed to submit any well‑founded arguments in support of the allegation that he would abscond or obstruct justice, whereas he had no previous convictions, was known to be of good character, had a permanent place of residence and stable social life, and was a well-known public figure. the district court’s decision stated that it could be contested before the criminal court of appeal within fifteen days. on 11 may 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal, raising similar arguments. on 24 may 2007 the criminal court of appeal decided to uphold the decision of the district court, finding that the nature and the dangerousness of the imputed offence, the particular circumstances of the case and the possible investigative measures to be carried out gave sufficient reasons to believe that the applicant could obstruct the investigation. on 2 july 2007 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan extended the applicant’s detention by two months, upon an application by the investigator, finding that the applicant, if remaining at large, could obstruct the investigation, abscond, exert unlawful influence on the persons involved in the proceedings and commit another offence. the district court’s decision stated that it could be contested before the criminal court of appeal. on 3 july and 3 september 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal, raising arguments similar to those previously raised. on 24 july 2007 the criminal court of appeal decided to uphold the decision of the district court, finding that the nature and the dangerousness of the imputed offence, the particular circumstances and complexity of the case; the investigative measures to be carried out and the applicant’s behaviour, namely his refusal to give any testimony, which was a factor slowing down the investigation, gave sufficient reasons to believe that the applicant could obstruct the investigation by exerting unlawful influence on the persons involved in the proceedings and also abscond. on 31 august 2007 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan extended the applicant’s detention by two months, upon an application of the investigator, on the same grounds as before. the district court’s decision stated that it could be contested before the criminal court of appeal. on 3 september 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal, raising arguments similar to those previously raised 15. on 6 september 2007 the investigator decided to replace the applicant’s detention with a written undertaking not to leave his residence and to release him in view of the fact that the investigative measures would take some time and it was no longer necessary to keep the applicant in detention. on 17 september 2007 the criminal court of appeal decided to leave the applicant’s appeal of 3 september 2007 unexamined in view of the fact that he had been released.
the applicant was born in 1942 and lives in blagoevgrad. 44079/98, 20 october 2005; united macedonian organisation ilinden-pirin and others v. bulgaria, no. 59489/00, 20 october 2005; ivanov and others v. bulgaria, no. 46336/99, 24 november 2005; united macedonian organisation ilinden and others v. bulgaria, no. 37586/04, 18 october 2011; united macedonian organisation ilinden and others v. bulgaria (no. the applicant was one of the applicants in ivanov and others (cited above). the rally would consist of the laying of wreaths and flowers and the reading of a short address. the same day the mayor replied to the applicant that the rally could not proceed as the municipality had planned an event in macedonia square for the same date – a concert marking the day of music. that parallel event made the staging of the rally impossible. he argued that under the applicable international-law agreements, that organisation was entitled to stage peaceful rallies without being registered. it was not appropriate to hold the rally, which, in view of its intended theme, was political in character, alongside the municipality’s event. the performance of musical works could not at all be reconciled with political addresses. as a result, the macedonian initiative committee called off the rally. he had made a request for information in that connection under freedom-of-information laws, but had not received a reply. the municipality’s cultural calendar for 2006 showed that the concert marking the day of music had been scheduled for 1 october rather than 30 september 2006. blagoevgrad’s mayor had banned that rally, and a legal challenge to his decision had been dismissed by the blagoevgrad district court on 8 september 2006 (see united macedonian organisation ilinden and ivanov (no. the event, which was to mark the anniversary of ‘the genocide against the macedonians’, would consist of the laying of a wreath and flowers on the monument and a short speech. on 29 august 2007 the mayor replied that the notification could not be examined as ilinden had not produced documents proving its official registration. on 30 august 2007 ilinden sought judicial review by the newly created blagoevgrad administrative court ..., reiterating the arguments raised in its previous applications. it therefore sent the file to the blagoevgrad district court. in a final decision of 5 september 2007 the blagoevgrad district court dismissed the application. it held that, while the lack of registration did not amount to sufficient grounds to prohibit the rally, the fact that another event, likely to draw a number of people, many of whom were children, was due to take place on the same date in macedonia square was enough to justify the ban. in the court’s view, it was inopportune to allow two wholly different events to be staged at the same time and place. according to the applicants, no school event took place at 4 p.m. on 12 september 2007 on macedonia square. when a number of members and supporters of ilinden gathered in front of the american university in blagoevgrad at about 5 p.m., they were stopped by the police and a number of them were arrested. they were taken to a police station, held for about three hours and charged with committing administrative offences for having tried to take part in a banned rally. on 22 october 2007 the deputy mayor of blagoevgrad imposed administrative punishments (fines of 200 bulgarian levs (102.26 euros) each) on [mr yordan kostadinov ivanov] and on a number of members of ilinden for having taken part in a banned rally, in breach of a public-order regulation issued by the blagoevgrad municipal council. in some of the judgments it found that they were invalid, as under the applicable rules the deputy mayor had no power to impose administrative punishments. in other judgments the court found that the deputy mayor’s decisions were defective because they did not specify which administrative offences had been committed. it was the applicant who acted on behalf of ilinden in its dealings with blagoevgrad’s mayor and the courts in relation to that rally.
the applicant was born in 1949 and lives in yerevan. on 1 august 2002 the government adopted decree no. 1151-n, approving the expropriation of tracts of real estate situated within the administrative boundaries of the kentron district of yerevan, to be taken for state needs, with a total area of 345,000 sq. it appears that the applicant ran a small kiosk on a plot of land situated within the area to be expropriated. it also appears that the authorities demolished this kiosk for the development of that area within the framework of decree no. on 10 october 2002, as compensation for the applicant’s kiosk, the mayor of yerevan adopted decision no. 1785-a, granting her the right to lease a plot of public land of 5 sq. m. at a specified address in the kentron district of yerevan for seven years and to construct and run her kiosk on this land. by the same decision, the mayor authorised the local authority of kentron district to conclude the lease agreement with the applicant. on 17 december 2002 the applicant received planning permission for the plot of land specified in decision no. 1785-a, the kentron district authorities suggested that the applicant address her enquiries to the mayor of yerevan, while on 1 may and 6 september 2007 the latter suggested that the applicant address her enquiries to the kentron district authorities. on 26 february 2008 the applicant initiated proceedings in the administrative court against the mayor and kentron district, seeking to implement decision no. on 30 july 2008 the administrative court granted the applicant’s claim and obliged the mayor of yerevan to conclude the agreement specified in decision no. no appeals were lodged and this judgment became final on 30 august 2008. on 9 september 2008 the administrative court issued a writ of execution for the judgment of 30 july 2008. however, by her letter of 30 june 2009 the applicant refused to negotiate with the mayor’s office. on 16 june 2010 the applicant initiated proceedings in the administrative court against the deja, requesting that the court oblige it to enforce the judgment of 30 july 2008. on 22 june 2010 the administrative court declared the applicant’s claim inadmissible on the grounds that she lacked standing. the administrative court noted that the deja had taken certain actions in order to enforce the judgment of 30 july 2008 and that the enforcement procedure was still pending. the decision of the administrative court of 22 june 2010 was upheld in the final instance by the court of cassation on 25 august 2010. on 21 october and 4 november 2010, following an enquiry by the applicant, the bailiff responded that the enforcement was in progress and that the applicant would be informed of the results. on 24 january 2011, pursuant to the applicant’s enquiries concerning the implementation of decision no. on 27 february 2012 the applicant instituted proceedings in the administrative court against the deja, seeking to declare the decision of 4 august 2011 null and void, as well as to oblige the deja to enforce the judgment of 30 july 2008. on 15 february 2013 the administrative court rejected the applicant’s first claim, reasoning that there were not sufficient grounds for declaring the deja’s decision of 4 august 2011 null and void. it refused to examine the applicant’s second claim. on 12 june 2013 the administrative court terminated the proceedings on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction. this decision was upheld in the final instance by the court of cassation on 18 december 2013. on 4 december 2013 the administrative court rejected the applicant’s claim, reasoning that, for the proceedings which had been discontinued on the grounds of impossibility, there were no legal grounds for reopening. on 28 september 2016 the administrative court granted the applicant’s first claim, declaring the decision of the deja of 10 february 2014 invalid. as to the applicant’s second claim, the administrative court terminated the proceedings in that regard on the basis of the lack of jurisdiction.
the background to the refusal to register ilinden at issue in this case has been set out in detail in the judgments in the following cases: stankov and the united macedonian organisation ilinden v. bulgaria, nos. 44079/98, 20 october 2005; united macedonian organisation ilinden-pirin and others v. bulgaria, no. 59489/00, 20 october 2005; ivanov and others v. bulgaria, no. 46336/99, 24 november 2005; united macedonian organisation ilinden and others v. bulgaria, no. 37586/04, 18 october 2011; united macedonian organisation ilinden and others v. bulgaria (no. on 27 september 2010 ilinden’s board of management applied to the blagoevgrad regional court for it to be registered as an association. on 3 february 2012 the blagoevgrad regional court refused the application, and on 23 april 2012 its decision was upheld by the sofia court of appeal. a detailed account of those proceedings may be found in yordan ivanov and others v. bulgaria (no. on 23 march 2014 the second and third applicants and seven other people held a meeting at which they resolved to set up ilinden as an association. бос) the blagoevgrad regional court refused the application. the court went on to note that ilinden’s articles of association stated that it would strive for, inter alia, the introduction of the macedonian language in schools, the protection of the right of macedonians to refute propaganda about their history and culture, and the protection of macedonian cultural heritage, which was being “subjected to ethnocide by bulgarian cultural institutions”. moreover, the statements, combined with the existence, albeit brief, of a political party called the united macedonian organisation ilinden-pirin, whose re-registration had recently been refused, and with the existence of organisations bearing the same or similar names, led to the conclusion that the intention was to mislead society and to obtain the registration of an organisation pursuing political aims (see paragraphs 18-20 below), or an organisation directed against the unity of the nation. lastly, the association’s intended name was not unique, as required by law. they submitted that the court had misconstrued ilinden’s articles of association and had erred in finding that its activities would be political or directed against the unity of the nation. the real reason for the refusal to register ilinden had been that it advocated views which were at odds with the official ones. the court began by saying that when assessing the aims of an association seeking registration, it had to base itself chiefly on the articles of association. the court also had to bear in mind the traditions which the association purported to represent and the historical figures with which it identified, the past activities, if known, of its founders, leaders and supporters, as well as the positions they had advocated. the same went for the declaration in the articles of association that ilinden would only resort to peaceful means to achieve its aims. the court had to also take into account the complex ethnic and religious situation in some neighbouring countries, as well as the severe migrant crisis affecting all of europe and bulgaria in particular, as a front-line state of the european union. in those circumstances, the application to register ilinden had to be turned down for two reasons. in the tense situation facing bulgaria and its neighbouring states, that had to be seen as a genuine possibility. all were entitled to believe that they were not citizens of a state which had committed international crimes, that they did not engage, in their capacity as bulgarian citizens, in propaganda and manipulation of the history and culture of a neighbouring country and that they were not citizens of a state whose institutions had subjected the cultural heritage of part of its population to ethnocide. the sofia court of appeal concluded that it was necessary to refuse the registration application, even though it recognised that it was also possible to dissolve an already registered association if it engaged in anti-constitutional or unlawful conduct. the refusal was a justified preventive measure. the dissenting judge noted that ilinden’s founders had complied with all formal requirements of the law. she then noted how that article had been construed by the european court of human rights in several cases, including united macedonian organisation ilinden-pirin and others and united macedonian organisation ilinden and others (both cited above), and stated that, in her view, the fact that an association advocated a form of minority consciousness could not justify a restriction of its rights under that article. the refusal to register it was thus disproportionate and unjustified. ilinden’s founders sought to appeal on points of law. in a final decision of 15 july 2016 (опр. the supreme court of cassation dismissed the founders’ appeal against the judge-rapporteur’s order.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in yerevan. the applicant was employed by the state revenue service (“the service”), division no. on 23 february 2009 the head of the service decided to terminate the applicant’s employment. on 2 april 2009 the applicant initiated proceedings in the administrative court against the service seeking to 1) have the decision of 23 february 2009 annulled; 2) be reinstated in her previous position; and 3) recover her average salary starting from the moment of her dismissal until her reinstatement to the previous position. on 17 september 2009 the administrative court granted the applicant’s three claims. in particular, it annulled the decision of 23 february 2009, ordered the service to reinstate her to her previous position and to pay her her average monthly salary starting from 23 february 2009 until her reinstatement. it reasoned its decision, inter alia, by stating that while the service had been under an obligation to offer the applicant another position within the service before deciding to dismiss her, it had failed to do so, even though such a position had existed in the service at the material time. this judgment was upheld in the final instance by the court of cassation and it became final on 4 november 2009. on 29 november 2009 the service paid the applicant 1,197,748 armenian drams (amd) (approximately 2,131 euros (eur) at the material time) as compensation for her unemployment during the period from 23 february to 29 november 2009. on 11 december 2009 the administrative court issued a writ of execution. on 25 february 2010 the department for the enforcement of judicial acts (“the deja”) initiated enforcement proceedings. on the same day the deja gave a decision obliging the service to comply with the writ of execution of 11 december 2009 within two weeks. it appears that no further actions were taken by the deja and the service in relation to the enforcement of the judgment of 17 september 2009 between the period of 25 february 2010 and 18 july 2011. on 18 july 2011 the bailiff decided to discontinue the enforcement proceedings on the basis of section 41(1)(8) of the enforcement of judicial acts act. the bailiff reasoned that the service had already paid the applicant amd 1,197,748 while the reinstatement of the applicant in her previous position in the service was impossible because that position was no longer vacant. on 29 may 2012 the applicant asked the deja to resume the enforcement proceedings. on 1 june 2012 the bailiff granted the applicant’s request and decided to resume the enforcement proceedings. on the same day the bailiff gave a decision on obliging the service to take certain actions. in particular, the bailiff obliged the service to 1) annul the decision of the head of the service of 23 february 2009; 2) reinstate the applicant to her previous position; and 3) pay her her average monthly salary for the period between her dismissal and her reinstatement to the previous position. on 2 july 2012 the bailiff decided once again to terminate the enforcement proceedings on the basis of section 41(1)(8) of the enforcement of judicial acts act. in particular, the bailiff reasoned that the service had already paid the applicant amd 1,197,748 as ordered by the judgment of 17 september 2009 while the reinstatement of the applicant in her previous position in the service was impossible because division no. 2, where the applicant had previously worked, no longer existed.
the applicant is a professor of law at a private university in skopje. she holds a doctoral degree in the field of criminal law. on 14 january 2010 the applicant lodged a request with the ministry of justice (“the ministry”) in order to be recognised as having the same status as a person who had passed the bar examination (изедначување со правата на лицата кои положиле правосуден испит). as she did not obtain a decision, she lodged two further requests, on 24 november 2011 and 6 february 2012. on 11 april 2012 the ministry rejected her request, holding that she did not meet the relevant criteria to obtain such recognition. in particular, the ministry found that although she was a professor of law at a university, she did not hold a bachelor’s degree in law (дипломиран правник на правен факултет). the ministry further found that the bachelor’s degree which she had obtained had been awarded by the faculty of security and social defence (факултет за безбедност и општествена самозаштита), and not by a faculty of law, as required. on 10 may 2012 the applicant brought an action with the administrative court (управен суд), challenging the refusal. she argued that as a university professor at a faculty of law she met the relevant criteria. on 30 may 2013 the administrative court dismissed the applicant’s action. it held that regardless of her current status, she did not meet the criteria to obtain the desired recognition under domestic law. in particular, it established that the applicant did not hold a bachelor’s degree in law, which was a condition for the recognition she sought. on 23 september 2013 the applicant lodged an appeal with the higher administrative court (виш управен суд). she argued that she met the relevant criteria and that the lower court had failed to properly interpret the procedural and substantive law in the case. on an unspecified date, the ministry submitted observations to the higher administrative court concerning the applicant’s case. the ministry stated in the observations that the right to obtain recognition as having the same status as a person who had passed the bar examination was dependent on having a bachelor’s degree issued by a faculty of law. the applicant did not possess such a degree and had therefore failed to meet the criteria under domestic law. those observations were not communicated to the applicant. on 30 january 2014 the higher administrative court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, reiterating in full the reasons provided by the administrative court. it restated that the recognition sought by the applicant was dependent on her having a bachelor’s degree issued by a faculty of law, a condition which she had failed to meet. the decision was served on the applicant on 19 may 2014.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in kocaeli. following a dispute with a private third party, the applicant initiated compensation proceedings. on 12 march 2009 the tuzla civil court of general jurisdiction granted the applicant compensation, amounting to 386,464.75 turkish liras (try) (approximately 174,000 euros (eur)). in the operative part of the judgment, the court indicated that the defendant party had to pay try 16,000 (approximately eur 7,400) for court fees pursuant to the law on charges. the court registry accordingly sent a payment order to the defendant party. on 18 may 2009 the applicant submitted a petition to the registry of the first instance court, requesting that the judgment be served on her in order to commence enforcement proceedings. on the same day, the court rejected the request on the ground that it was impossible under section 28(1) (a) of the law on charges (law no. 492) to serve a copy of the judgment unless the court costs that should have been born by the defendant party had been discharged. at the time when the application was introduced, the applicant had therefore been unable to bring enforcement proceedings in order to have the above-mentioned judgment executed unless she herself was willing to pay the court fees that the defendant party had failed to pay. following the introduction of the present application with the court, the domestic legislation was amended (see paragraphs 11-13 below), and subsequently the judgment in question was served on the applicant. in the absence of an appeal, the judgment became final on 17 october 2012. on 5 march 2013 the applicant initiated enforcement proceedings against her debtor. on 10 april 2013 the applicant further requested the enforcement office to place a lien on the debtor’s property. according to the documents in the file, as of 14 april 2017 the debt, which is still not enforced, amounts to try 812,648.94 (approximately eur 193,500) including the initial amount of compensation awarded by the domestic court plus interest running at statutory rate.
the applicant was born in 1969 and lives in timişoara. in 2004 the applicant lodged a civil action against her employer, a private company, c.g.h.t. (“ on 29 april 2004 the timiș county court dismissed her action as ill‑founded. the domestic court also awarded the applicant the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings. however, the company refused to fulfil its obligations. she argued that the matter was urgent because she needed to obtain the salary entitlements that would allow her to provide for herself and her infant. on 2 june 2005 the timișoara district court allowed the company’s complaint against the enforcement proceedings. the court held that the procedural requirements had not been thoroughly complied with in so far as the bailiff had failed to serve the company with a copy of the enforceable judgment. on 6 october 2005 the timiș county court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as ungrounded. the first-instance judgment thus became final. in the meantime, on 29 june 2005, the bailiff issued another notice of payment. on 4 july 2005 it was posted, together with the enforceable judgment, at the company’s main entrance. on 2 november 2005 the bailiff received a letter from the applicant, in which she enquired whether the company had complied with the outstanding judgment. the bailiff replied in the negative on 4 november 2005. in so far as this was the last exchange of information between the applicant and the bailiff concerning the impugned enforcement procedure, and in view of the obligations imposed by law on the creditor, who was required to play a constantly active role throughout the enforcement procedure, on 28 may 2007 the bailiff issued an official report, noting that, under article 389 of the rccp as in force at the time, the procedure had become time-barred (“perimarea executării”; see paragraph 38 below). it is not clear whether that report was communicated to the applicant or not. on 5 may 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint before the timișoara district court seeking to obtain a court order for immediate enforcement of the judgment, pursuant to article 5803 of the rccp as in force at the time (see paragraph 40 below). on 12 july 2005 the applicant complained to the minister of justice about the outcome of the judgment of 2 june 2005 (see paragraph 16 above). the complaint was lodged under the provisions of law no. 303/2004, defining the framework for judges’ disciplinary and criminal responsibility and the specific authorities empowered to initiate such proceedings. on 5 december 2006 a criminal investigation was initiated against m.d., the company’s administrator, for refusal to execute the judgment. and fined him ron 1,000, namely approximately eur 250. on 2 june 2008 both the applicant and m.d. appealed against the prosecutors’ decisions before the timişoara district court. the court dismissed both appeals on 17 october 2008. ’s appeal, it reiterated that even though he had not executed the judgment, his actions could not be classified as an offence and, therefore, the administrative fine had been fair. in a final judgment of 28 january 2009 the timiş county court dismissed appeals on points of law lodged by the applicant and m.d. it was noted in an accounting report drawn up on 30 august 2014 that the company’s only creditors were the two shareholders. no appeal was lodged against the decisions taken by the companies registration office in respect of the company.
the applicants, whose names are listed in the appendix, are turkish nationals. on 17 and 18 july 2008, each of the applicants sent a letter to the halfeti (şanlıurfa) public prosecutor`s office which contained the following passage:
 "if using the word of “sayın” (esteemed) is an offense, then i also say “sayın abdullah öcalan”, i commit this offense and denounce myself." on 19 september 2008, the public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the halfeti magistrates’ court in criminal matters against the applicants. they were charged with praising an offence and offender, prescribed by article 215 of the criminal code (law no. 5237), on account of their statements in the above mentioned letters. on 9 march 2009 the halfeti magistrates’ court in criminal matters found the applicants guilty of praising the imprisoned leader of the pkk, an illegal armed organisation, on account of their statements in the aforementioned letters and accordingly, sentenced them each to two months and fifteen days’ imprisonment. in accordance with article 50 of the criminal code, this prison sentence was commuted to a fine of 1,500 turkish liras (try). the applicants appealed against this judgment. on 20 june 2012 the court of cassation, holding that the amount of the fine that had been imposed on the applicants did not attain the minimum requisite level, dismissed the appeal request.
the applicant was born in 1984 and lives in chisinau. at the material time, the applicant was a student and was undertaking an unpaid internship at a law firm. on 23 october 2008 criminal proceedings were initiated against t., a lawyer with whom the applicant worked, on charges of trading in influence. in particular, t. was accused of receiving 10,500 euros (eur) from d. to pass on to the judges examining a criminal case against a relative of d.’s in order to obtain his acquittal or a more lenient sentence. the applicant had no procedural standing in those proceedings. on 30 october 2008 the police lodged with an investigating judge a request for a warrant to search the applicant’s apartment. the request was granted; the decision to issue the warrant read as follows:
“the criminal investigation against t. was initiated on 23 october 2008 ... in the course of the investigation it has been established that from march until september 2008, t. extorted and received from d. in several instalments the amount of eur 10,500, [to be given to] the judges who examined d.’s relative’s case, in order to obtain his acquittal or a more lenient sentence. on 24 october 2008 t. was caught in flagrante receiving 3,800 us dollars (usd) from d., allegedly for influencing the prosecutor not to appeal against the [subsequent] judgment [acquitting the accused]. the evidence in the file and the material obtained through the operational investigation allow the well-founded assumption that at [the applicant’s] home, situated at [address], can be found eur 10,500 received from d. and relevant documents,
decides
to order a search of [the applicant’s] residence, situated at [address], with the aim of finding and seizing eur 10,500 received from d. and documents concerning the criminal case.” on the same day, a prosecutor lodged a request with the buiucani district court for a warrant to be issued for the search of the applicant’s apartment. his request took the form of a verbatim copy of the police decision. also on the same day the buiucani district investigating judge issued a decision authorising the search. the decision read as follows:
“the present criminal proceedings were initiated on 23 october 2008 ... against t.
after hearing the prosecutor and examining the material, and taking in consideration the fact that that material had been obtained in [a manner] in compliance with the law, the court finds that the request for the authorisation of the search is well founded and should be upheld. on the basis of articles 41, 125, 301, 305 and 306 of the code of criminal procedure, the court:
... 9. on 10 december 2008 the police searched the applicant’s apartment in the presence of her elderly mother [but not the applicant]. on 21 august 2009 the applicant lodged a request for access to the evidence which had been presented to the judge to justify the search. on 3 september 2009 the buiucani district investigating judge replied that the case file was held at the [premises of] the investigating authority and that access could only be granted pursuant to the law. it appears from the material in the case file that the criminal proceedings against t. ended with the latter’s acquittal.
the applicant was born in 1960 and at the time of lodging his application he was serving his prison sentence in the bolu f-type prison. on 3 december 2007 the applicant wrote a letter to the ministry of justice, in which he had praised the imprisoned leader of the pkk, abdullah öcalan by using the honorific “sayın”, meaning esteemed. pursuant to the regulations on the administration of penitentiary institutions and the execution of sentences, the applicant was found guilty of breaching prison order by the bolu f- type prison disciplinary board (referred hereafter as “the board”). on 12 december 2007 the applicant was sentenced to 11 days’ solitary confinement on the orders of the board, on account of his statements in the above mentioned letter. on 25 december 2007 the bolu enforcement judge rejected the applicant`s objection. on 15 january 2008 the bolu assize court upheld the judgment of 25 december 2007.
the applicant, a practising defence lawyer, represented ‒ initially before the ljubljana district court and subsequently before the appellate courts ‒ a defendant, i.p., the offence carried a thirty-year prison sentence. were asked to assess the accountability of the defendant and the probability that he had committed the criminal offences of which he had been accused. at the final hearing held on 12 march 2004 v.r. replied to questions put by the applicant and the public prosecutor. under the rules of the criminal procedure act, a new expert witness should not be appointed unless there are contradictions or deficiencies in the available expert opinion or if reasonable doubt arises with regard to its correctness – the applicant therefore pointed out what he considered to be such deficiencies with respect to v.r. he gave examples from the expert opinion, such as its finding that the accused had little sense of reality but, at the same time, good general knowledge, and that while he was mentally rigid he was of above-average intelligence. was convicted of three counts of murder and sentenced to thirty years’ imprisonment. on 22 june 2004 the applicant lodged an appeal with the ljubljana higher court. he supplemented it with further written submissions and on 16 december 2004 attended a session and a hearing before the court. in his written and oral submissions before the ljubljana higher court, the applicant strongly criticised the work of the experts, public prosecutor and the court and used a number of expressions which the higher court found amounted to contempt of court (see paragraph 19 below). he argued that he had not intended to insult anyone, and had only wanted to draw attention to the unacceptable way by which the opinions that could result in a potential thirty-year prison sentence had been prepared. he argued that he had expressed the impugned opinions with the aim of providing the best possible defence to his client and that his punishment had not been necessary in a democratic society. furthermore, alternative less severe measures were available, such as a private prosecution for slander. the constitutional court has already [emphasised] in decision no. this is a constitutionally admissible aim for which it was admissible to limit the complainant’s right to freedom of expression. the expressed contemptuous criticism is beyond the reasonable argumentation by which the defence counsel could justify his motion that new expert witnesses be called. u-i-145/03 that it is of exceptional importance that parties to proceedings [realise] that insulting sharp speech before the court does not prove that the defence counsel has provided quality representation. the constitutional court reached the above decision by six votes to one. who voted against, wrote an extensive dissenting opinion. the court found that the following remarks of the applicant, the translation of which has not been disputed by the parties, amounted to contempt of court (taken from the decision):
“as regards the state prosecutor:
‘... it can be concluded that someone – a person who was aware of the exculpatory nature of this documentation for the defendant – hid this documentation ...’
‘... it is permissible for a prosecutor to hide crucial evidence which could release the defendant from his liability ...
as regards the expert psychologist ... [j.r.] ... : as regards the level of the fine imposed on the applicant, the court noted that it reflected the nature and seriousness of the offensive statements, the fact that he was a lawyer with many years’ experience of representation in court proceedings and the fact that he had previously made similar offensive statements during the first-instance proceedings. among other things, he stated that “such a way of evidence taking [was] mystic and [had] no connection with the modern trial”. had been using methods which had not been within his competence, and had claimed to have been using a particular test “without ever seeing the original ... in his life”. the applicant stressed that his comments had related to j.b. on 16 march 2006 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal in which he complained of a violation of article 10 of the convention and article 39 of the constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression. he also argued that he had expressed acceptable criticism which, though presented in a slightly illustrative manner, had not been insulting to the experts but instead had challenged the credibility of their opinions. on 5 december 2016 the constitutional court sent to the applicant a corrigendum of its decision of 3 december 2008, noting that judge j.z. had not been submitted a decision as he had withdrawn from the case. had not taken part in the proceedings in question.
the applicants were born in 1967, 1965 and 1972 respectively and at the time of lodging their applications they were serving their prison sentences in the muş e-type prison. on 6 and 7 march 2006 each applicant sent a letter to the ministry of justice, referring to the imprisoned leader of the pkk, abdullah öcalan, by using the honorific “sayın”, meaning esteemed. pursuant to the regulations on the administration of penitentiary institutions and the execution of sentences, the applicants were found guilty of breaching prison order by the erzurum h- type prison disciplinary board (referred hereafter as “the board”). on 5 april 2006 the applicants were each sentenced to 12 days’ solitary confinement on the orders of the board, on account of the statements in the above mentioned letters. on 17 april 2006 the erzurum enforcement judge rejected the applicants’ objections. on 30 june 2006 the erzurum assize court upheld the judgment of 17 april 2006. furthermore, on 4 july 2005 a disciplinary sanction was imposed on the first applicant, as he avoided visits and telephone calls to protest against the detention conditions of öcalan. he was accordingly banned from receiving visitors for 2 months. on 21 october 2005 and 14 november 2005, respectively, the erzurum enforcement court and the erzurum assize court rejected the first applicant’s appeal requests.
the applicant was born in 1930 and lives in valencia. he has lived in san josé, a residential district of valencia since 1962. in view of the problems caused by the noise, the city council resolved on 22 december 1983 not to permit any more licensed premises to open in the area. however, the resolution was never implemented and new licences were granted. in 1993, the polytechnic university of valencia carried out a study of the levels of night-time noise during the weekend on behalf of the city council. it was reported that in the san josé district the noise levels were notably higher to the legally accepted norm. in 1994, the applicant became president of the neighbourhood association of his district. he also asked for the withdrawal of the business licences of several establishments. on 28 june 1996 the city council adopted the municipal ordinance on noise and vibrations (ordenanza municipal de ruidos y vibraciones ‑ hereinafter “the ordinance”). on 14 june 1999 the applicant brought a preliminary state liability claim before the city council, relying on article 15 (right to life and to physical integrity) and article 18 § 2 (right to privacy and inviolability of the home) of the constitution. on 5 january 2001 the city council issued a resolution denying his preliminary state liability claim. the city council joined the proceedings before the high court. the applicant provided the court with two reports: the first one of 1 april 1998 prepared by the municipal service for the environment stated that:
“prior to the entry into force of the declaration of an acoustically saturated zone, the levels of disturbance by noise during the night exceeded 65 decibels, mainly during the nights from thursdays to sundays from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. in the morning. in order to sustain his arguments, the applicant also produced an expert report, produced by an applied physics professor, which was joined to his complaint. the report noted as follows:
“the measured noise on the street and the noise perceived by neighbours in their homes, in the xuquer area of valencia – which is where the applicant lives – rise high total levels of ... 70 decibels ... those levels are clearly related to the presence of a concentration of the entertainment industry in that area (pubs and discotheques). the expert highlighted that the city council had recommended a maximum permitted level at night of 30 dba. consequently, there was a difference of 20-30 dba. however, the expert report pointed out that this was a general estimation and that it was made without measuring the inside of the dwellings concerned. lastly, the applicant produced a medical report stating that he was suffering from anxiety due to the excessive noise inside his flat. during the proceedings, the high court ordered a legal medical expert report by a specialist in preventive medicine. in a judgment of 20 june 2003 the high court dismissed the complaint. it found that there was no causal connection between the noise pollution and the alleged damage caused to the applicant, since there was no evidence proving that in his particular flat the level of noise pollution exceeded the established limits. indeed, the applicant had decided to replace his windows without previously asking for a measurement of the noise inside his flat, as provided by article 54 of the ordinance. furthermore, it should be taken into account that the applicant’s flat was on the fourth floor, where the noise would certainly be less intense than on a lower floor. this appeal was initially dismissed on 18 october 2004. in the proceedings before the constitutional court, the public prosecutor claimed that there had been a violation of articles 15 and 18 § 2 of the constitution. in a judgment of 29 september 2011, served on the applicant on 19 october 2011, the plenary of the constitutional court dismissed the amparo appeal, arguing that (1) both cases were not identical, (2) the applicant had not proved that in his particular case the noise at his flat was above the permitted level, (3) that the city council had indeed adopted specific measures to reduce noise pollution at the applicant’s neighbourhood and (4) that he had not proved that his health problems had been directly caused by noise pollution. the judgment was not adopted by unanimity. three judges out of twelve issued a dissenting opinion holding that there had been a violation of articles 10 § 2, 18 §§ 1 and 2 of the constitution. they reiterated that according to the judgment delivered in the moreno gómez case (cited above), the assessment of a violation no longer depended on the evidence provided by the applicant about the seriousness of the noise pollution inside his home.
the applicants were born in 1966 and 1976 respectively. it concerned a case that had caused a public outcry in turkey, namely that of metin göktepe, a journalist who was beaten to death by the police whilst under arrest in 1996[1]. following the killing, the turkish grand national assembly set up a parliamentary inquiry commission in order to shed light on the murder of metin göktepe. this was an expression of his commitment and involvement in life with a great enthusiasm, which went beyond the mere love of his job. the difference between doing this job [journalism] reluctantly and doing it wholeheartedly and flawlessly was apparent in his effort to report events fully, notwithstanding the hindrances created by the police at alibeyköy, where he went on the day of the events. in the last ten years alone, fifty-one journalists have been swallowed up by this well. the important message behind this is that we need determination to go beyond the darkness and reach the light. or, to put it a different way, it is not possible to reach the light from the darkness without eliminating the eliminators (ya da, başka bir deyişle, “bertaraf ediciler”, “bertaraf” edilmeden karanlıktan sürekli aydınlığa çıkmak da mümkün değil). indeed, they thought that it was already too late. we have learnt that the murderers will be tried, and we are duty-bound to ensure the effective continuation of such proceedings. who issued the collective detention order which ended with the death of metin, and around vice-director k.b., ’ın üzerindeki koruma halesinin sonsuza kadar öyle kalacağını düşünmek ise, herşeyden önce verilen onca mücadeleye karşı bir inançsızlık olur). the fact that the eliminators dragged one more name into their dark well after metin’s, namely that of ahmet taner kışlalı, has shown another reality. absolute protection from this fate requires constant and persistent monitoring. is there any solution other than coming after the “eliminators”, whilst “surely watching”, and removing them and their collaborators completely from our soil, in order to save ourselves from becoming a country in which gangs can behave as they please?” 3713), namely disclosing the identities of public officials who are involved in the fight against terrorism, thereby rendering such persons targets for terrorist organisations. in addition, he called for the application of additional section 2 of the press act (law no. 5680) and article 36 of the former criminal code. in accordance with additional section 2 § 1 of law no. 5680, the first-instance court also ordered the temporary closure of the newspaper for a period of seven days. according to the brief reasons given by the istanbul state security court, the following sentences from the article were sufficient to conclude that o.t. who executed this order, would remain in place forever would represent nothing but a lack of faith in all these struggles. on the same day, the applicants lodged an appeal. the applicants argued that the purpose of the article had been to raise concern over the fact that some high-ranking officials had not been tried and that those accused in metin göktepe’s trial had still not been convicted, four years after the death of metin göktepe. the applicants maintained in this respect that the two officials concerned, namely o.t. were the ones who had given and executed the detention order which had resulted in metin göktepe’s death. as regards the content of the article, the applicants observed that the writer of the article had defended the rule of law and the notion of justice and had not incited people to violence or advocated terrorism. lastly, they asserted that with the expression “coming after” the writer had obviously referred to the aftermath of metin göktepe’s trial which contributed significantly to the punishment of the accused police officers. on 1 february 2001 the court of cassation rejected the request for a hearing and upheld the judgment. the closure order for the newspaper was executed from 20 to 27 march 2001.
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in erzincan. the applicant was a civil servant in the erzincan provincial directorate of environment and forestry, and at the time of the events he was a member of the local branch of a trade union affiliated to kesk (kamu emekçileri sendikaları konfederasyonu – confederation of public employees’ trade unions). on 27 november 2004 and 12 december 2004 respectively, the applicant participated in a press statement and a demonstration organised by his trade union. subsequently, a disciplinary investigation was initiated against the applicant for his participation in the above mentioned trade union activities. on 31 august 2005 a disciplinary sanction in the form of a reduction in salary was imposed on the applicant for having participated in trade union activities. on 27 october 2005 the applicant filed a petition with the sivas administrative court and requested the annulment of the disciplinary sanction that had been imposed on him. on 18 may 2006 the sivas administrative court dismissed the applicant’s request, considering that the administrative decision was in accordance with law and there were no grounds for its annulment. on 20 october 2008 the supreme administrative court upheld the judgment of the sivas administrative court.
the first applicant, mrs daniela nedescu, is married to the second applicant, mr călin nedescu. they were born in 1976 and live in bucharest. following an ovarian stimulation and in vitro fertilisation, seven embryos were obtained, of which three were transferred immediately to mrs nedescu, who became pregnant and gave birth. on 15 july 2009 the procedure for obtaining the required authorisation from the transplant agency was completed and the s. clinic was authorised to act as a medical centre that could function as a storage bank for genetic material. on 24 july 2009, following a criminal investigation into the delivery of the above authorisation, the directorate for the investigation of organised crime and terrorism attached to the prosecutor general’s office of romania (diicot) closed the s. clinic, seized all the genetic material found there, including the applicants’ embryos, and transferred it to the mina minovici institute of forensic medicine (“the ifm”). the applicants’ embryos and those of other couples were kept in containers. each container had different vials for each set of embryos. they had to be accompanied by an embryologist and provide a special container with liquid nitrogen. on 21 july 2010 the applicants went to the ifm accompanied by an embryologist, however, they were not allowed to retrieve the embryos. they were asked instead to show that the transplant agency had approved the transfer. however, on 18 august 2010, while being treated for premature menopause, she underwent a medical examination which revealed that her state of health did not allow her to undergo another ovarian stimulation. the applicants were directed to bring a claim for damages before a civil court. on 12 december 2010 mrs nedescu had another examination, which led to the same conclusions as on 18 august 2010. at a hearing on 22 march 2011 the applicants asked the court of appeal to order the transfer of the embryos from the ifm to a private clinic of their choice located in sibiu, the p. clinic, which was authorised to carry out assisted reproduction and act as a genetic material storage bank. the court dismissed the applicants’ application on the same day. the applicants appealed against the judgment to the high court of cassation and justice. on 12 october 2011 diicot appointed a public hospital, the p.s. on 20 december 2011 the high court of cassation and justice allowed the appeal against the judgment of 22 march 2011 and ordered the transplant agency to implement the prosecutor’s decision to return the embryos by allowing their transfer from the ifm to an authorised clinic or hospital of the applicants’ choice in romania or abroad. hospital, which informed them on 27 september 2012 that they could only retrieve the embryos if they were accompanied by a representative from the transplant agency, an embryologist from the s. clinic, where the embryos had been stored initially, and a diicot representative. on 12 november 2012, in reply to a request from the applicants, p.s. nevertheless, the applicants could attempt to obtain new embryos at the hospital which could then be transferred to her. in a letter dated 7 january 2013 to the government agent, a representative of p.s. it also stated that they declined any responsibility for the identification, quality and viability of the frozen embryos deposited with the ifm because diicot had not organised any individual identification when the embryos had been transferred. the hospital reiterated that the ifm had no authorisation to function as a genetic material bank (for tissues and cells). furthermore, the hospital did not only have the task of implementing diicot’s decision to allow the applicants to remove the embryos and ensure respect for the conditions that the removal be made in the presence of an embryologist and include the provision of a container with liquid nitrogen. it also had to comply with the relevant legislation on the removal and transfer of genetic material and with the conditions set down by the transplant agency in a decision of 3 june 2011, decision no. the representative also stated that the existing embryos could be transferred to the mother at the hospital but that the hospital’s own doctors would not carry out the procedure as they could not assume any responsibility owing to the quality of the embryos. however, the hospital preferred that such a transfer be performed elsewhere. they indicated that they were able to bear the costs of becoming custodians. in any event, “no formula allowing for consensus among all the parties involved has so far been identified”.
the applicant was born in 1973 and lives in galway, ireland. she already had a son from a previous relationship, b, born in 1993. would return the child to ireland after their holidays in poland. on 29 june 2009 she instituted proceedings before ennis district court under the guardianship of infants act of 1964, seeking declaration that the habitual residence of the child was in ireland and that the child was to return to ireland on 15 august 2009. on 2 july 2009 the ennis district court issued a consent order as an interim measure. and established that her habitual residence was in ireland. failed to return a to her mother on 15 august 2009. on 15 september 2009 the ennis district court decided that a’s residence would be in ireland with her mother, who was granted sole custody. it decided to commission an expert opinion from the regional family consultation centre (rodzinny ośrodek diagnostyczno-konsultacyjny – “rodk”). was closer to a and more attentive to her particular needs than the applicant. the child, at that time nine-years-old, was considered by the experts as mature and aware of her family situation. the applicant underlined her lack of contact with her daughter. on 22 june 2010 the gdańsk court of appeal quashed the decision of the gdańsk regional court of 4 december 2009. the court decided that the irish court had ruled on parental responsibility and that judgment could not be reconciled with the subsequent judgment of the polish court of 18 december 2009 dismissing the applicant’s claim for the child’s return under the hague convention. on 28 february 2012 the gdańsk court of appeal refused to declare that the order of 15 september 2009 was enforceable on the grounds that the high court of ireland had made a new custody order on 9 september 2011 (see paragraph 27 below). the report recommended that the court should take account of the wish a had expressed to attend school in poland and to consider an arrangement whereby the child lived with her father during school terms and spend her holidays in ireland. in october 2011 the applicant lodged an application with the polish ministry of justice to enforce the judgment of the high court of ireland of 9 september 2011 and for the return of the child to her. on 23 january 2012 the irish department of justice, equality and law reform received a letter from the polish ministry of justice stating that the applicant’s application for the compulsory removal of her daughter and her return to ireland had been sent to the gdańsk district court that day. it stated that a had wished to stay in poland where she had had home, school, and friends. a expressed her wish to have regular contacts with her mother via skype. on 13 july 2012 the guardian made a third unsuccessful attempt to remove the child. on 24 july 2012 the guardian requested that the police intervene. brought proceedings in the polish courts for an order that a be returned to him. ’s action, stating that the irish courts had jurisdiction given a’s habitual place of residence. on 4 july 2011 the gdańsk regional court granted m.k. the letter requested that the information be passed on to the judge in the polish divorce proceedings. on 13 may 2014 the gdańsk court of appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the first-instance judgment. on 8 october 2009 the applicant saw a for the first time during an interview conducted by court experts. she also saw her in february 2011 and attended her birthday party in march 2011. at that time a, the applicant, b and m.k were all interviewed by the high court’s expert.
the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in smolyan. in two final judgments of 28 february 2005 and 8 may 2006 the supreme court of cassation awarded the applicant pecuniary damages in respect of breach of contract for construction works which she had carried out. the awarded damages comprised bgn 52,784 for the principal amount, plus bgn 17,685 in default interest and bgn 5,433 in costs and expenses, or a total amount of bgn 75,902.93, the equivalent to 38,000 euros (eur). the damages were awarded to the applicant against the national centre for recreation, rehabilitation and sport – ministry of education and science (“the centre”, a state body subsidised by the ministry of education and science and exercising certain functions delegated by the ministry). by an order of 25 may 2005 the minister of education closed down the centre and ordered that its remaining property be managed by the ministry of education. the ministry then established a state-owned joint‑stock company with part of the centre’s property, including the real estate in which the applicant had carried out the construction works. on 13 may 2005 and 15 march 2007 the applicant was issued with two writs of enforcement for the amounts awarded in the final judgments of 2005 and 2006 (see paragraph 5 above) and on 6 february 2008 she presented the writs to the ministry of education asking it to pay. the ministry replied in writing that it was not the successor to the centre and did not owe payment to the applicant. in october 2009 the applicant reiterated her request but received a similar reply by the ministry. the ministry also pointed out that payment could not be sought from the state-owned joint-stock company either as it had a legal personality separate from that of the ministry. by a letter of 23 september 2010, the minister provided a similar explanation to the applicant. the applicant brought judicial review proceedings challenging the minister’s refusal. in a final decision of 8 april 2011 the supreme administrative court rejected the appeal as inadmissible. as of 19 march 2015, the date of the applicant’s last communication to the court, no change in the above circumstances had been reported.
the applicant was born in 1972 and lives in saatli. the applicant was a journalist and worked for the bizim yol newspaper at the time of the events described below. following the publication of a series of articles criticising the activities of the ministry of labour and social security (“the ministry”) written by the applicant, the head of the ministry’s administration, r.a., contacted the applicant and asked for a meeting. they met on 11 june 2007, and then on 19 and 20 july 2007 as well. according to the applicant, during these meetings r.a. firstly demanded that he stop writing articles about the ministry. also threatened him saying that he should not forget the case of b.h., a journalist who had been heavily beaten in may 2006. realised that the applicant would continue to write articles about the ministry’s activities, he proposed him money in exchange for stopping writing the articles. according to the applicant, at the beginning he rejected that proposal, but he later accepted it because of his difficult financial situation. on 24 july 2007 they met again at a restaurant in baku. during the meeting when the applicant received 3,500 united states dollars from r.a., on 26 july 2007 the applicant was charged under article 311.1. on the same day the nasimi district court ordered the applicant’s detention pending trial for a period of three months. the judge substantiated the necessity for this measure as follows:
“taking into account the possibility of the accused’s absconding from the investigation, and the character and gravity of the crime attributed to him, i consider it necessary to apply the preventive measure of remand in custody in respect of him.” on 27 july 2007 the applicant appealed against the detention order, claiming that there was no risk of his absconding or obstructing the investigation and that the court had failed to take his personal situation into consideration. on 3 august 2007 the baku court of appeal dismissed the appeal. the appellate court did not make mention of the applicant’s particular complaints. in that connection, he submitted that more time was needed to complete the investigation. on 19 october 2007 the nasimi district court granted the prosecutor’s request by extending the applicant’s detention pending trial by three months, until 24 january 2008. on 22 october 2007 the applicant appealed against that decision, claiming that the first-instance court had failed to justify his continued detention and to take his personal situation into account. the applicant did not make any mention of his and his lawyer’s absence from the hearing of 19 october 2007 in his appeal. on 31 october 2007 the baku court of appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that the nasimi district court’s decision of 19 october 2007 was justified. it appears from the appellate court’s decision and the transcript of the court hearing of 31 october 2007 that the hearing was held in the absence of the applicant, but in the presence of his lawyer. on 21 january 2008 the assize court found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment. on 4 april 2008 the baku court of appeal upheld the applicant’s conviction, but reduced his sentence to five years’ imprisonment. on 25 december 2009 the applicant was released from serving the remainder of his sentence after being pardoned by a presidential decree. on 1 august 2007 a television programme concerning the applicant’s arrest on 24 july 2007 was broadcast on a private television channel. at the end of the programme the narrator stated that the criminal investigation was ongoing and that the public would be informed of further developments.
the applicant was born in 1938 and lives in sofia. the sofia municipal council approved the exchange of a municipal flat for a smaller flat owned and occupied by the applicant in december 2005. however, the mayor of sofia did not issue the necessary order and did not sign a contract for the exchange, as provided in the applicable rules. the applicant brought judicial review proceedings challenging the mayor’s tacit refusal to act. the sofia administrative court quashed the mayor’s tacit refusal in a judgment of 1 april 2010 and instructed the mayor to issue an order for the exchange of the flats. that part of the judgment became final and enforceable on 19 may 2010. by a decision of 25 march 2010 the sofia municipal council revoked its december 2005 decision approving the exchange of the two properties. the applicant lodged a challenge against that 25 march 2010 decision. in a final judgment of 7 march 2011 the supreme administrative court declared the council’s decision of 25 march 2010 null and void. on 18 april 2011 the mayor issued a decision explicitly refusing to issue an order for the exchange of the two flats. following an application by the applicant for judicial review, on 30 march 2012 the supreme administrative court declared that decision null and void as having been issued in breach of the judgment of the sofia administrative court of 1 april 2010. the court also instructed the mayor to issue an order for the conclusion of the exchange agreement. the mayor ordered the flat exchange on 6 march 2013 and the applicant signed a contract for the exchange on 25 june 2013.
fnass, which was established in 1992, is a federation of trade unions representing professional athletes, which today comprises the unions representing track and field athletes (saf), basketball players (snb), cyclists (uncp), footballers (unfp), handball players (ajph) and rugby players (provale). it represents around 3,500 professional athletes in france. on 14 april 2010 the government issued order no. 2010-379 on athletes’ health, bringing the sports code into line with the principles of the world anti-doping code (hereafter “the order of 14 april 2010”). article 6 of the order (article l. 232-13-1 of the sports code, see paragraph 63 below) provided, in particular, that individualised anti-doping testing of athletes included in the testing pool could be carried out at training and sporting venues, but also “at any location chosen with the athlete’s agreement at which the test can be carried out in compliance with the athlete’s right to respect for his or her privacy, including, at his or her request, at home.” in their view, the unconditional implementation of article 3(i)(3)(d) of the order, allowing tests to be carried out independently of sporting events and outside training periods, meant that between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. (the testing period laid down by article l. 232-14 of the sports code, see paragraph 64 below) the athletes in the testing pool faced the permanent prospect of physically intrusive tests. they had all undergone testing, some of them between two and eight times. (d)  with regard to mr kerckhof, the government stated that he had been included in the testing pool on 7 november 2009 and had been kept on the list for a further year from 17 september 2010. (b)  information provided by the applicants 15. in their observations in reply of 3 december 2013 the eight applicants who were not in the afld testing pool (see paragraph 13 (a) above) stated that they were in the testing pool of the international rugby board (irb). however, they did not produce the updated list of athletes who had been retained in the pool. (b)  a further four (mr busselier, mr ternel, mr kiour and mr haon) had been included in the testing pool in 2009 or 2010 and had been retained for another twelve months from 23 september 2010. they produced a letter from the afld to the president of the national basketball league dated 11 june 2010, asking the latter to send a list of players by 30 august 2010 who should be included or retained in the testing pool. they did not provide any documents demonstrating that they belonged to the testing pool. keeping me in the testing pool for another 18 months stigmatises me in the eyes of my teammates as a potential cheat and is not acceptable. the applicant, who was born in 1958, is a french national. she stated that she had undergone more than 1,200 anti-doping tests in the course of her career. at that time athletes could be included in the testing pool for an indeterminate period. in a letter of 20 december 2011 the afld invited the applicant to submit observations on her possible re-inclusion in the testing pool. in a letter dated 20 march 2013 the applicant contested the possibility of her renewed inclusion in the testing pool. these entail, in particular, the ability to carry out unannounced tests in order effectively to detect the use of certain performance-enhancing drugs which can be detected only for a short time after being taken despite having more lasting effects. hence, these provisions interfere with the right of the athletes concerned to respect for their private and family life, as guaranteed by article 8 of the convention, only to the extent that is necessary and proportionate to the general-interest aims pursued by efforts to combat doping, namely to protect athletes’ health and to ensure fair and ethical sporting competitions. ... this convention, which is the european reference instrument, has been ratified by all the council of europe member states and by five non-member states (australia, belarus, canada, morocco and tunisia). it lays down a number of common rules and standards on the basis of which the states parties undertake to adopt the necessary harmonisation measures at national and international level in order to effectively combat doping in sport. the revised version of the wadc, which entered into force on 1 january 2015, contained numerous amendments. under the revised article 2.4, a violation is established where three “whereabouts failures” occur within a twelve-month period (rather than eighteen months as previously, see paragraph 47 above). the comment on this clause stated that the athletes concerned could choose which location to nominate for this sixty-minute time slot: it could be their place of residence, training or competition, or it could be another location (for instance, work or school). the unesco convention has hitherto been ratified by france and by 186 other states. the eu contributes to the revision of the wadc. in another contribution concerning the revision of the wadc (no.
the applicant was born in 1946 and lives in cork. in the following years she received a variety of treatments for her condition. in 1995 she became the patient of dr b, a consultant endocrinologist. in august 2000, at the request of dr b, the applicant underwent another mri scan. dr b received the result of the first test on 5 september 2000. he spoke by phone with the applicant, telling her that the tumour was very unsatisfactory. as the drug led to severe gastrointestinal side effects within a short time, dr b reduced the dosage by half. it appears there were no side effects following the injections of october and november 2000. at the end of the year the applicant was unwell, and was hospitalised in early january 2001 suffering from vomiting, diarrhoea, severe exhaustion, headaches, cramps and muscular spasms in her arms and legs. a blood test indicated that she was also severely hypothyroid. it was later established that this was a side-effect of the drug, not known at the time. dr b proposed to defer the next injection until the following month. the applicant received two more injections, in february and march 2001. in may 2004 the applicant commenced civil proceedings in the high court against dr b and the hospital. the hospital entered its defence in june 2005, and also sought further and better particulars. according to the government, between february 2005 and september 2008 eleven motions seeking various forms of interim relief were brought before the high court and decided in relation to the case. a hearing date in april 2010 was set for the case. in january 2010 the applicant’s solicitor replied to the request for further and better particulars made by the second defendant in june 2005. the hearing commenced on 13 april 2010 and took place over twelve days. two expert witnesses appeared for the applicant and two for the defence. the high court ruled against the applicant on all grounds. on the question of consent, the judge considered that while the applicant had misunderstood the exact state of her tumour, this was not to be blamed upon dr b, who had fulfilled his legal duty by giving her accurate and appropriate information about her condition. he found that dr b had not been aware of the applicant’s misunderstanding and could not be blamed for the deficiencies in her knowledge of her condition. it remained pending before the supreme court until it was transferred to the newly-established court of appeal on 29 october 2014. the court of appeal addressed two issues. it rejected her claim that the high court had made a clear error on this point. it considered that dr b’s actions had been in keeping with the relevant domestic legal principles. as surgery was not possible, the only alternative was medication. it was, the court of appeal held, reasonably open to him to hold that view. on 8 march 2016 the supreme court refused.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in kyustendil. in a judgment of 15 august 2004 the sofia district court awarded the applicant bgn 2,120.28 (about 1,100 euros (eur)) in damages, plus the legal interest for the period starting on 11 february 2003 until full payment, and bgn 200 in costs and expenses, against the national centre for recreation, rehabilitation and sport (“the centre”). the centre was a state body subsidised by the ministry of education. it exercised certain functions entrusted by the ministry. the damages were awarded for loss of salary following the applicant’s unlawful dismissal from work. the judgment became final on 11 february 2008. in the meantime, on 25 may 2005 the minister of education ordered that the centre be closed down and its remaining property be managed by the ministry of education. the ministry then established a state-owned joint-stock company with part of the centre’s property. on 26 november 2008 the applicant was issued with a writ of enforcement for the amount awarded against the centre in the final judgment of 11 february 2008 (see paragraph 5 above). on 18 march 2009 he filed a request with the minister for education for payment of that amount. the ministry of education replied in may 2009 that neither the ministry, nor the state-owned joint-stock company, was the successor of the centre and that the amount claimed was not due by them. as of 23 march 2015, the date of the applicant’s last communication to the court, no change in the above circumstances had been recorded.
the applicant was born in 1960 and lives in giresun. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents submitted by them, may be summarised as follows. who was the sole eyewitness to the incident. on the other hand, testified before the trial court that as she opened the door of the classroom in question, she saw the applicant sitting on a desk in the dark with his legs apart, hugging x. who was sitting on his lap, facing the blackboard. within a matter of seconds, upon seeing her, the applicant threw x. away in panic. stated that while she had never witnessed similar behaviour by the applicant before, the scene she had seen on the day in question looked suspicious. she also confirmed that there was another pupil in the classroom at the time. say that the applicant had engaged in indecent behaviour towards some pupils at the school where he had worked previously. respectively an employee and the manager at the public education centre ‒ the applicant had been dismissed from his previous job for similar behaviour. had given him this information, although he himself had never witnessed any indecent behaviour by the applicant. confirmed that the applicant had apologised to him following the incident. there is no information in the case-file as to the exact content of this apology. on 13 january 2009 the acquittal judgment became final in the absence of any appeal. the manager of the public education centre, from b.a., a teacher at the primary school, from a.t., the principal of the primary school, and from the applicant, who was being held in detention in relation to the criminal proceedings at the time. the medical diagnosis was stated as autism. in coming to this conclusion, the inspectors noted the following:
“...the eyewitness, e.u., she stated that] what she witnessed did not look like a regular display of affection and when she had entered the room, he had thrown the child off him in panic. entered the room, he was trying to get the minor off him. [ the applicant’s] statement that he had fallen onto a desk with the minor as a result of the latter trying to hug him corroborates e.u. moreover, the consistent statements of e.u., taken under oath, who as a mother and an educator seems to have suffered a great deal of emotional distress from these events, give the impression that the allegations against the applicant are well-founded. he added that it was not logical that he would have committed the alleged act in the presence of another pupil in the classroom right before the start of the classes. on 5 july 2006 the supreme disciplinary council issued the following decision in relation to the applicant, in so far as relevant:
“upon examination of the file ... and of the defence statement duly taken [from the applicant], the following has been decided:
on the basis of the information and documents in the file, the veracity of the act [harassment of x.] attributed to the applicant has been conclusively established... for this reason, it has been decided unanimously to accept the proposal to dismiss the applicant from the civil service in accordance with section 125 § e (g) of the law no. 657 provides that shameful and disgraceful conduct that is incompatible with the civil service requires dismissal from the civil service. referred to in the ordu administrative court judgment, is not mentioned in the judgment of the espiye criminal court of first instance. on 28 july 2007 the applicant appealed against the decision of the ordu administrative court, which he considered to be based on groundless accusations. the deputy principal at the previous school, denying any such allegations of indecent behaviour. on 7 july 2010 the supreme administrative court rejected the applicant’s rectification request.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in kırıkkale. on 25 september 1998 the applicant was arrested by police officers and taken into custody on suspicion of being a member of an illegal organisation. he confessed that he was a member of the organisation in question and gave information about certain activities in which he had participated. on 2 october 1998 a statement was taken from the applicant by the istanbul public prosecutor. he confirmed the statement he had made to the police. he confirmed the statement he had made to the public prosecutor, but withdrew the one he had made to the police. the applicant alleged that he had given the statements under duress. the investigating judge ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention. the criminal proceedings commenced before the istanbul state security court, the bench of which included a military judge. on 12 october 1998 the istanbul state security court held a preparatory hearing and decided that the first hearing would take place on 16 december 1998. on 16 december 1998 the other co-accused, namely g.t., they did not give any statement in relation to the applicant. on 8 march 1999 the trial court, noting the absence of the accused, decided to adjourn the hearing. at the hearing held on 2 june 1999, the applicant gave evidence in person and stated that he had been forced to sign his previous statements. the applicant retracted those statements while maintaining that he had not been involved in any of the offences attributed to him. at the same hearing, the other co-accused, namely a.b. they did not make any statements in respect of the applicant. while the criminal proceedings against the applicant were pending, on 18 june 1999 the constitution was amended and the military judge sitting on the bench of the istanbul state security court was replaced by a civilian judge. on 4 august 1999, the state security court, composed of three civilian judges, heard evidence from a.s., two of them made incriminatory statements in relation to the applicant. when asked his comments concerning those statements, the applicant rejected them, maintaining that he had had no connection with the accusations. on 25 april 2001 the public prosecutor read out his observations on the merits (esas hakkında mütalaa) and requested that the applicant be convicted and sentenced under article 125 of the former criminal code. at the same hearing, the applicant’s lawyer requested time to submit the applicant’s defence submissions. on 29 august 2001 the applicant’s lawyer made his defence submissions in relation to the merits of the case. on 19 june 2002 the applicant’s lawyer, again reiterated his previous defence submissions. at the same hearing, the applicant stated that he had agreed to his lawyer’s submissions. on 2 september 2002 the applicant and his lawyer presented their closing arguments. on the same day the istanbul state security court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to thirty years’ imprisonment, pursuant to article 125 of the former criminal code. on 7 april 2003 the court of cassation upheld the judgment. on 29 may 2003 that decision was deposited with the registry of the istanbul state security court.
the applicant political party has its registered seat in budapest. on 2 october 2016 a referendum related to the european union’s migrant relocation plan was held in hungary. the referendum was initiated by the government and posed the following question: “do you want the european union to be entitled to order the mandatory settlement of non-hungarian citizens in hungary without parliament’s consent?” in the course of the campaign several opposition parties called on voters to boycott the referendum or to cast invalid ballots that would not count in the final tally but could still be interpreted as rejecting the idea of the referendum. it also enabled voters to comment on the reasons for how they cast their ballot. the posting and sharing of photographs were anonymous. the application was reported in major online journals. on 29 september 2016 a private individual lodged a complaint with the national election commission (nemzeti választási bizottság) about the application. xxxvi of 2013 on electoral procedure and article 2(1) of the fundamental law. relying on a previous resolution issued in 2014, it held that voters could not treat ballot papers as their own [property], and therefore could neither take them out of the voting booths nor take a photograph of them. it held that taking photographs of ballot papers could lead to electoral fraud. furthermore, although the principle of secrecy did not create any obligation on the voters’ side, it nevertheless did not entitle them to abuse their situation, bearing in mind that voting secrecy could only be maintained with their cooperation. the commission concluded that the phone application was capable of discrediting the work of election bodies and tallying systems in the eyes of the public. the applicant sought judicial review of this decision before the kúria. the kúria held that the purpose of the ballots had been to enable voters to express their opinion on the referendum question, and that taking photographs of ballots and subsequently publishing them had not been in line with this purpose. a ban on photographs and on publication had not infringed voters’ freedom of expression, since they had been free to express their opinions by casting their ballots and to share with others how they had voted. it found that there was no regulation prohibiting voters from taking photographs of their ballot papers in the voters’ booths and that their identity could not have been revealed through the mobile telephone application. the complainant maintained that by operating the mobile telephone application and by encouraging voters to make use of it, the applicant political party had infringed the principles governing the bona fide and proper exercise of rights, and also the principles of fairness and secrecy of elections. the commission supplemented its previous reasoning by noting that the mobile telephone application calling on voters to cast an invalid ballot could have influenced voters and had thus constituted unlawful campaigning. the applicant political party sought judicial review of this decision as well. by a decision of 18 october 2016 the kúria upheld the commission’s decision as to the finding of an infringement of the principle of the proper exercise of rights. it reduced the fine to huf 100,000 (approximately eur 330). the applicant organisation lodged a constitutional complaint against the decisions of both 10 and 18 october 2016. citizens regularly share events, thoughts and opinions on internet websites through photos taken with their mobile phones. in the context of elections, this led to the fact that all over the world, voters take photos of their ballot papers and share it through social media. by developing the mobile phone application the applicant wanted to enable voters to share photos of ballot papers (or in case of those who absented from the referendum photos of the activities undertaken instead of voting) and other messages in an anonymous way and exercise their right to freedom of expression in a way that the content of the vote could not be linked to the voter. ... thus, it argued that these aims could not serve as a legitimate basis for restricting the right to freedom of expression. in any event, even if the application could have infringed the secrecy of voting, the ban on the application had been disproportionate. it reiterated the kúria’s finding that although the case related to the freedom of expression of voters, this had not been infringed by the decision of the election commission, which had only found that the method used – that is to say uploading photographs to a mobile application – had not been in compliance with the obligation to exercise voting rights in accordance with their purpose. in the constitutional court’s view the applicant political party had merely provided a forum for voters to share photographs of their ballot papers or their intention to abstain from voting, it had did not itself expressed an opinion.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in ankara. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents submitted by them, may be summarised as follows. at the time of the events giving rise to the application the applicant was serving as a chief police officer in ankara. he had been wearing glasses and had held a police radio in his hand. around 2 a.m. while he was patrolling with his colleague, s.a., according to the applicant they had also offered to take her to the police station, which she had also declined. had started behaving strangely, taking off her clothes and acting in a sexually inviting manner. and told him that they had to leave immediately. told the police that she could not remember whether the police officers had taken her to an apartment or some other place as she had been very intoxicated. was carried out on the same day, showing that she had no bruises on her body. said that she had flagged down a police car that day to ask for help. as she had been intoxicated, she could not remember exactly what had happened later or which officer had raped her. the chief public prosecutor submitted an opinion on the merits and stated that the applicant’s conduct should be reclassified as rape and unlawful detention and that of s.a. he therefore argued that the case should be referred to the ankara assize court, which has jurisdiction to hear such charges. on 13 july 2004 the ankara criminal court of first instance ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. who, contrary to her previous statements, submitted that the officers had not raped her and had not taken her anywhere without her consent. she then submitted that she wished to withdraw her complaint. on 13 september 2005 the ankara assize court acquitted the applicant and s.a. had been drunk that night, her allegations of rape and of being held against her will needed to be supported by some sign of resistance. could not be deemed to have committed the separate offence of the unlawful use of a public vehicle. had seduced him to the point where he had had to ejaculate in his own hand. the applicant was also requested to submit a written defence statement. he pointed out that the forensic expert evidence had established that there had been no traces of violence, whether on s.k. an investigation report dated 6 june 2002, prepared by the police investigator, concluded that the applicant had committed the offence of rape, while s.a. the relevant parts of the decision read as follows:
“... the victim complained to the police and confirmed the event by giving the licence plate number of the vehicle and accurately describing the officer as wearing glasses and holding a police radio in his hand. after examination of the file, it appears that the case concerns the applicant’s dismissal from the police force on the basis of a disciplinary investigation which established that he had intercourse with a woman without her consent on the pretext of calling her a suspect .., by asking her to get into a police car so that he could verify her identity at the police station, although in the end he took her to a piece of empty land and had intercourse with her without her consent. one judge out of the five expressed a dissenting opinion, reasoning that the applicant had been acquitted of the charges in the parallel criminal proceedings, including of rape, and that therefore the disciplinary decision to dismiss him from the police force on those grounds could no longer be upheld. he argued before the ankara administrative court that the establishment of his innocence should be regarded as new grounds for reopening the dismissal proceedings. on 27 may 2009 the applicant’s request was dismissed. according to the information submitted by the government, the applicant did not appeal against that decision.
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in budapest. she is the widow of a well-known hungarian poet, györgy faludy. they married in 2002, and their relationship, partly due to a significant difference in age, as well as their life and work, were constantly the subject of widespread media coverage. on an unspecified date in 2008 an article was published in a daily newspaper, blikk, based on an interview with the applicant, revealing that she wanted to have a child who would be a blood relative of both her and her late husband and have the same intellect and attitude as him. the applicant explained that she envisaged her own sister and her late husband’s grandson being the parents of that child. following some talks with the applicant, on 26 march 2008 helyi téma, at the material time the biggest weekly journal, republished the same story, adding that the late poet’s grandson had dismissed the idea of having a child with the applicant’s sister. the widow does everything for the limelight”. despite a previous request by the applicant, the article made no mention of a book to be published on the applicant’s late husband. subsequently, in reaction to a complaint by the applicant, the newspaper published an additional article on the book under publication; however, it did not appear on the front page as the applicant’s had presumably wished. the applicant asked for a further article to be published but the newspaper declined. she maintained that the headline published on 26 march 2008 had negatively affected her public image. she sought an injunction against any further infringement of her right to reputation, an apology from the publisher and compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the amount of 4,000,000 hungarian forints (huf – approximately 13,000 euros (eur)). according to the witnesses who gave evidence before the first-instance court, the applicant had been truly saddened by the way the article had presented her family plans, especially that her statements had been hurtful to the memory of her late husband. she had also received a lot of criticism from her acquaintances. in a judgment of 5 april 2009 the budapest regional court granted an injunction against any further infringement, ordered a public apology and obliged the publisher to pay the applicant huf 600,000 (eur 2,000) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. the remainder of the applicant’s claim for compensation was dismissed. it turned out that she seduced the poet from a man ... the poet-prince (költőfejedelem) happily introduced to the world his then yet unknown lover, who became his muse and who was 65 years younger than him. the kossuth prize winner and internationally recognised poet had a tendency to push the boundaries, openly admitted his homosexual adventures and love affairs, and held that taboos were to be dismantled. therefore, when the country just began to digest and accept his relationship with fanny, the poet accepted an offer from penthouse magazine, which has since closed down, agreeing to be presented in the magazine in high-quality erotic pictures with his lover ... [the plaintiff] had even been subject of numerous hurtful and degrading remarks and attacks during györgy faludy’s life. ...
...the plaintiff’s idea can be said to be bizarre and eccentric, nonetheless, how she has spoken about childbearing does not, following the rules of formal logic, mean that she has trampled on her husband’s memory. based on the witness statements and the role the plaintiff’s late husband played in public life, the court concluded that the applicant’s idea about childbearing was not contrary to the thinking of györgy faludy...” 13. the regional court added that both the applicant and her late husband had unusual, provocative personalities and ways of thinking, and the statement according to which she had infringed her late husband’s memory did not correspond to reality and was unjustifiably hurtful. the court concluded that the statement that the applicant did everything for the limelight had not infringed her personality rights, whereas the statement that she had trampled on her husband’s memory had infringed her right to reputation and dignity (33.p.22.472/2009/16.). on 8 december 2011 the budapest court of appeal reversed the previous judgment finding an infringement of the applicant’s reputation and dismissed her action in its entirety. it also stressed that statements should be assessed in context and with regard to their background. the court explained in detail that the applicant and her husband had triggered controversial reactions and “everyday people with an average mindset” would have had an opinion on their relationship and marriage. it held that the headline was not a statement of fact but a value judgment expressed in connection with the applicant’s own “peculiar” statements. the applicant lodged a petition for review with the kúria. in a judgment of 12 september 2012, the kúria endorsed the finding of the second-instance court that the headline did not constitute a statement of fact but a value judgment concerning the unusual manner in which the applicant intended to start a family. since it was not devoid of factual basis, it could not be considered humiliating, hurtful or offensive and as such had not infringed the applicant’s dignity.
the applicants’ particulars appear in the appendix to this judgment. at the beginning of august 1995 the croatian authorities announced their intention to take military action with the aim of regaining control over krajina. the operation was codenamed “storm” (oluja) and took place from 4 to 7 august 1995. before the military action, the vast majority of the population of krajina fled croatia. most of them went to bosnia and herzegovina but some also went to serbia. the number of people who fled is estimated at between 100,000 and 150,000. on 5 november 1997 croatia ratified the convention. the applicants and p.m. (born in 1942), who was the husband of one of the applicants and the father of the others, lived in razbojište, near the larger village of krupa, on the territory of krajina. during the night of 4 to 5 august 1995 all the family, save for p.m., fled croatia. p.m. was killed during operation storm on 5 august 1995. according to the government, he was armed and was killed in an exchange of fire with the croatian army in the broader area of krupa. the villages of razbojište, krupa and žegar and the settlement of milići are located near each other. on june 2002 exhumations were carried out at gračac cemetery. on 24 november 2003 the third applicant identified the remains as those of her father, p.m. 11. the police opened an investigation into the circumstances of p.m.’s death after the applicants on 5 september 2005 brought a claim for damages with the state attorney’s office in connection with his killing (see paragraph 20 below). who said that p.m. had joined a village guard unit during the war. did not know who might have killed p.m. 13. on 11 august 2015 the zadar police received an anonymous letter stating that on 10 august 1995 two men, v.g. said that he had never heard of someone being killed in the “milića” cave even though he had lived all his life in the area. on 26 august 2015 the zadar police informed the zadar county state attorney’s office that five persons had been killed in the settlement of milići during operation storm, one of whom was p.m., who had died on 5 august 1995. on 14 september 2015 the police interviewed v.g., a captain in the croatian army during operation storm, who had been in command of the zadar military police third company of the 72nd battalion, who said that he had never been to žegar and had never heard of anyone being killed there. he had been in benkovac (a town situated some forty kilometres from žegar) throughout operation storm. he had also said that he could state with certainty that none of the members of his unit had committed any crimes, otherwise he would have known about it. a croatian soldier and member of the 72nd battalion during operation storm. he also said that he had never been to žegar and had never heard of anyone being killed there. however, five members of the serbian paramilitary forces had been killed during operation storm, including p.m. enquiries had therefore been stopped since the information given in the anonymous letter had proved to be unreliable. on 5 september 2005 the applicants submitted a claim for damages with the state attorney’s office in connection with the killing of p.m. the request was refused. in addition, the claim had become statute‑barred. the first-instance judgment was upheld by the zagreb county court on 21 september 2010.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in sofia. the applicant signed a contract with the then bulgarian ministry of agriculture and forests (hereafter “the ministry”) on 15 july 2004. according to the terms of the contract the applicant undertook to act as a legal representative for the ministry in a case before the international court of arbitration in paris, for which the ministry was to pay him 58,100 bulgarian levs (bgn, about eur 29,600). this sum comprised a legal fee and all related costs and expenses incurred by him in connection with the representation. the ministry paid the applicant half of the amount due on the day the contract was signed. the contract stipulated that the second half was to be paid to him at the end of the proceedings. the proceedings before the international court of arbitration in paris ended on 28 november 2005. on 19 december 2005 the applicant asked the ministry to pay him the balance due, but the ministry failed to reply. the applicant then asked the sofia district court to issue him with a writ of enforcement against the ministry. on 24 february 2006, in compliance with article 399 of the 1952 code, a notary acting for the applicant served the original writ of enforcement on the ministry and requested that the institution pay. as the ministry still did not reply, the applicant sought the assistance of the ombudsman. subsequently, the ministry confirmed to the ombudsman in a letter of 27 march 2006 that it had received a notarial request for payment and the writ of enforcement in the applicant’s case. it also stated that, if money for the honouring of debts of the ministry had not been included in the current year’s budget, this would be done in the following year’s budget. in july 2006 the ministry asked the sofia bar association to open disciplinary proceedings against the applicant for acting against the interests of his client, the ministry. the sofia bar association terminated those proceedings the same year after establishing that the applicant had not acted contrary to the interests of the ministry. the ministry did not pay the balance due to the applicant. instead, on 26 july 2006 the ministry brought a civil claim against him in court, seeking damages for his failure to carry out the duties ensuing from the contract of 15 july 2004. in its claim before the court the ministry made no mention of the balance of the fee it owed the applicant on conclusion of the contract of 2004; a sum subject to a writ of enforcement and served on the ministry earlier in 2006. in a judgment of 3 august 2009 the sofia city court, acting as a first-instance court, rejected the ministry’s claim in respect of all amounts. as regards the first half of the fee paid to the applicant, in particular, the court observed that the ministry had not claimed that the contract it had concluded with the applicant had been cancelled and found that the first half of the fee paid could not be considered as damages. the court held, however, that the applicant owed the ministry the amount of bgn 4,648 (about eur 2,300) by way of penalty because during the arbitration proceedings he had omitted to transmit to the ministry a request by the arbitrator that the original of a document be submitted to the latter. the penalty agreed in the contract between the ministry and the applicant was payable in the event of the failure of the applicant to comply with his obligations and the ministry did not need to prove that it had incurred any loss as a result of the applicant’s conduct. the court therefore allowed the ministry’s claim for the amount of bgn 5,102.88, which corresponded to bgn 4,648 by way of penalty and bgn 418.88 for case-related costs. in a final decision of 28 june 2011, the supreme court of cassation (scc) did not allow a cassation review, finding that the statutory conditions for this were not met. the judgment of the sofia court of appeal thus became final on that date. on 15 july 2011 the ministry replied that its debts were to be paid from its annual budget and, in the event of the non-availability of funds, money for outstanding debts was to be included at the latest in the following year’s budget. the ministry also asked the applicant to submit the original writ of execution. the applicant wrote to the ministry on 28 july 2011 stating that he had already served it on them and specified the date and reference number of the notarial document with which that had been done (see paragraphs 8-9 above). on 2 august 2013 the applicant again asked the ministry in writing to pay him the outstanding amount. they replied in writing the same month stating that they had received the original writ of enforcement on 24 february 2006 but could not trace what had happened to it thereafter.
the applicant was born in 1958 and lives in leipzig. on 30 october 2009 the munich ii public prosecution office charged the applicant with coercion to engage in sexual activity in at least 300 cases and with sexual coercion in another eighteen cases. on 20 july 2012 the munich ii regional court, after taking evidence at seventeen days of hearing, issued a decision limiting the prosecution to charges concerning four incidents which had taken place between 19 and 25 august 2007. the applicant was further informed that if he was convicted the court could take into account findings made in respect of the other incidents when setting his sentence. in a judgment delivered on the same day, the regional court convicted the applicant of four counts of coercion to engage in sexual activity, committed between 19 and 25 august 2007, and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment. the court had regard to p.’s extensive description of different incidents, which happened either in the house the applicant and p. were both living in or in the applicant’s car. p. had notably explained how the applicant had regularly, when his wife and son were absent, brought her into his apartment or in the basement boiler room, had undressed himself and had instructed her how to satisfy him, partly while playing pornographic films. the applicant had systematically threatened p. that she would have to return to a home for the disabled if she did not comply with his requests. from 19 to 25 august 2007, when the applicant’s wife and son were on holiday, the applicant had forced p. to satisfy him orally at least twice and to satisfy him manually on two further occasions in their house or in the basement boiler room. ´s consistent statements was confirmed by further witnesses and three psychological expert opinions on p. the regional court explained that it had restricted the conviction to the four events that had taken place between 19 and 25 august 2007. it had discontinued the proceedings in respect of the at least 300 further charges under article 154 § 2 of the code of criminal procedure but was convinced that in at least fifty cases there had been incidents comparable to the four of which the applicant was formally convicted. it had simply been impossible to determine their exact time and place due to the victim’s speech disorder. the injured party herself said that the applicant had coerced her to perform sexual acts from as early as 2001. from 2003, the frequency of these incidents had increased and the applicant had demanded sexual gratification from her approximately every 1½ weeks. even if one were to disregard the years 2001 and 2002 and august and october 2007 in favour of the applicant and also to presume that from 2003 onwards, such incidents occurred only once a month there are 56 cases. following the deduction of a further safety margin the chamber assumes that there were at least 50 more, comparable cases during the total period from january 2001 to october 2007. ...
on the other hand, the chamber considers as an aggravating element that it is convinced that, in addition to the four incidents in august 2007 which the accused has been convicted of, there have been at least 50 comparable incidents since january 2001. a conviction for those events was only made impossible by the victim’s incapacity to substantiate them in terms of the time and the place where they happened in a manner making it possible to define them as procedural offences (offences in the procedural sense). as it could no longer be determined with certainty in which cases the accused, by his threats, made the victim satisfy him orally or manually, the chamber will proceed on the basis that there were 50 further cases of manual satisfaction.” (“die kammer ist aufgrund der glaubhaften aussage der geschädigten davon überzeugt, dass es neben den vier abgeurteilten taten im zeitraum januar 2001 bis oktober 2007 zu mindestens 50 weiteren, vergleichbaren fällen kam. die geschädigte selbst gab an, der angeklagte habe sie bereits ab dem jahr 2001 zu sexuellen handlungen genötigt. ab dem jahr 2003 sei die frequenz dieser vorfälle gestiegen und der angeklagte habe ungefähr alle 1 ½ wochen sexuelle befriedigung von ihr verlangt. selbst wenn man zugunsten des angeklagten die jahr 2001 und 2002 sowie den august und oktober 2007 unberücksichtigt lässt und zudem davon ausgeht, dass es ab dem jahr 2003 lediglich einmal im monat zu derartigen vorfällen kam, so ergeben sich 56 fälle. nach abzug eines weiteren sicherheitsabschlags geht die kammer von mindestens 50 weiteren, vergleichbaren fällen im gesamten zeitraum von januar 2001 bis oktober 2007 aus. ...
andererseits wertet die kammer zu lasten des angeklagten den umstand, dass es nach überzeugung der kammer neben den verurteilten vier vorfällen im august 2007 bereits ab januar 2001 zu mindestens 50 vergleichbaren vorfällen gekommen war. eine verurteilung dieser vorfälle scheiterte lediglich an der mangelnden fähigkeit der geschädigten, die vorfälle zeitlich und örtlich so zu konkretisieren, dass diese als prozessuale taten abgrenzbar waren. da sich nicht mehr mit sicherheit aufklären ließ, in welchen fällen der angeklagte die geschädigte durch seine drohung zu einer oralen und in welchen zu einer manuellen befriedigung brachte, geht die kammer insoweit von 50 weiteren fällen der manuellen befriedigung aus.”) the federal public prosecutor general argued that the regional court had been entitled to take account of the sexual offences committed previously by the applicant as an aggravating element as part of his previous history (vorleben) and thus as one of the elements in setting his sentence under article 46 § 2 of the criminal code (see paragraph 18 below). on 6 february 2013 the federal court of justice dismissed the applicant’s appeal as ill-founded, without giving specific reasons.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in kyiv. prior to the events in question, he had been actively involved in ukrainian politics. from 25 may 2006 to 15 june 2007 and from 23 november 2007 to 23 may 2008 he was a member of parliament and from 26 december 2007 to 24 march 2010 he was first deputy minister of justice. his father-in-law was president of the supreme court of ukraine from 2006 to 2011. accordingly, changing the legal services’ provider would be costly and unjustified. the applicant’s letter, which was subsequently submitted to the economy ministry, provided the basis for naftogaz to contract further legal services from magisters ltd without pursuing a bidding procedure. on 28 december 2009 the pecherskyy court quashed that ruling. its decision was upheld by the appellate court on 10 february 2010. it appears that it was not challenged on points of law. on 6 august 2010 the pgo re-sent the “invitation” to the applicant. however, he did not appear before the prosecutor. on 20 december 2010 the pgo instructed the kyiv city police to establish the applicant’s whereabouts and to hand him a summons for questioning at 10 a.m. on 22 december 2010. also on 20 december 2010 the pgo enquired with the state border service regarding the applicant’s trips abroad in 2009 and 2010. at the time, he was in hospital with his wife, who was giving birth to their third child. in the afternoon of 22 december 2010, the applicant appeared before the investigator and after being questioned was arrested at 4.50 p.m. under articles 106 and 115 of the code of criminal procedure (“the ccp”; see paragraph 41 below). the procedural rights of arrestees were also listed. the applicant signed it with a remark that he considered his arrest as unlawful given that he had complied with the investigator’s summons in accordance with the ccp and that there was no risk of him hindering the establishment of the truth as he was no longer a civil servant. on 24 december 2010 the applicant challenged his arrest before a court. that indicated, in his opinion, that he had had no intention of absconding or hindering the investigation. also on 24 december 2010 the investigator applied to the court for the applicant to be held in pre-trial detention. furthermore, the case file contains sufficient evidence showing that [the applicant] avoided appearing before the investigation authorities, that he travels abroad regularly and that he is absent from his registered address. therefore, the application of any other preventive measure in respect of the accused ... will not be able to ensure his proper procedural conduct and the fulfilment of procedural decisions...” 26. in particular, the file did not contain sufficient information about the applicant’s health, family and financial situation or his occupation. the court therefore extended the applicant’s preliminary detention to ten days as a temporary preventive measure. it rejected the applicant’s complaint about his arrest as unsubstantiated. furthermore, he complained that the pecherskyy court had failed to justify the application of what was the most intrusive preventive measure available in his case. in the alternative, he indicated that he was ready to pay bail for the applicant. the change of preventive measure was explained by the fact that the applicant could no longer influence witnesses or impede the investigation. the applicant publicly denied those rumours. publicly available material shows that he was amnestied in december 2011.
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in csobánka, hungary. the couple, who were becoming gradually estranged, returned to hungary in 2004. on 26 december 2004, after a quarrel, h.b. took their son and left for an unknown destination. subsequently, the applicant filed for divorce. on 16 november 2005, as an interim measure immediately enforceable irrespective of any appeal, the szentendre district court placed the child with the applicant, pending the outcome of the divorce proceedings. the interim decision became final on 14 january 2006. meanwhile, on 29 november 2005 the applicant had lodged a criminal complaint with the szentendre police department alleging child abduction. on 7 december 2005 the authorities carried out an identity check on h.b. who declared his address to be in sopron, hungary. he declared the same address as on 7 december 2005. and obtain information regarding the whereabouts of the child, but they had failed to do so. on 18 may 2006 the szentendre police department issued a warrant against h.b. on 2 april 2008 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the sopron police department alleging h.b. was not aware of the district court’s judgment containing the obligation to pay child maintenance. on 4 april 2008 the applicant lodged another criminal complaint with the szentendre police department. a complaint submitted by the applicant challenging this decision was dismissed on 17 december 2009. on the basis of this information, on 28 june 2013 the applicant’s father lodged a criminal complaint with the szentendre police department alleging unlawful change of a minor’s residence. on the same day the criminal complaint was transferred to the sopron police department, within whose territorial competence it fell. and established that neither he nor the child lived there. and the child might be residing in the united states. apparently, no further measures were taken in these proceedings. had in the meantime brought him back to hungary. was expelled from canada and was ordered to leave the country before 7 january 2010. had not been on the flight indicated by the canadian police. were probably in canada and transferred the request to the canadian authorities. was on the list of wanted persons in canada and that he had previously fled from custody. was apprehended in budapest and the child could at last be located. article 14

the applicant was born in 1964 and lives in kyiv. the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 were marked by a dispute between ukraine and russia on the conditions for gas supplies, including the price paid by ukraine and the transit price charged by ukraine to russia. it culminated in russia cutting off supplies in early january 2009, affecting not only ukraine but also european states dependent on russian gas. 1, a claim of 11 billion cubic metres of natural gas imported by way of transit to ukraine by rosukrenergo ag was ceded to naftogaz ukrayiny. on 28 january 2009 the president of ukraine mr viktor yushchenko appointed the applicant as chief of the state customs service of ukraine, upon the prime minister’s nomination. on 8 june 2010 the institute found for rosukrenergo ag. on 22 june 2010 the police questioned mr sh., on 23 june 2010 the applicant appeared for questioning as a witness in the proceedings against d. he was accompanied by his lawyer. the questioning concerned the two letters sent to the applicant on 26 february 2009 and his actions thereupon. the applicant remained at the security service, without any immediate procedural steps being taken against him. according to him, he was not allowed to leave. the government stated that it was the applicant’s own decision to wait until the decision on criminal proceedings was ready. at 6.42 p.m. on 23 june 2010 the applicant signed the decision on the institution of criminal proceedings against him with a statement that he had de facto been under arrest from 3.43 p.m. that day. as noted in the report, the investigation had established that the applicant had had no legitimate grounds to endorse the first deputy prime minister’s request of 26 february 2009 (see paragraph 12 above). he emphasised that he was willing to cooperate with the investigation and that his behaviour in the proceedings had been flawless. by way of reasoning, the court noted that the applicant was suspected of a serious offence potentially entailing imprisonment; that he could interfere with investigative activities, either by absconding or tampering with evidence; and that he was capable of influencing witnesses, regard being had, in particular, to his connections with former colleagues, his prominent social status and his wealth. moreover, the applicant had no employment or young children under his charge. the applicant appealed, contending in particular that his arrest had been arbitrary and not based on a reasonable suspicion that he had committed a crime. moreover, the court’s findings as to the probability of his interfering with the investigative activities were arbitrary. he had been a civil servant with an impeccable reputation, no prior criminal record, strong family ties and a permanent residence in kyiv. lastly, he referred to the surety offered by the members of parliament to ensure his proper conduct in the proceedings. on 27 september and 12 october 2010 the shevchenkivskyy court and the court of appeal, respectively, rejected the applicant’s complaint, finding that the investigator had acted in accordance with the law. on 12 october 2010 the court of appeal upheld the first-instance court’s decision. there was no follow up to that complaint. on 14 april 2011 the pecherskyy court held a preparatory hearing for the applicant’s trial. it decided to keep him in pre-trial detention as it found no grounds to change the measure. on 26 april 2011 the pecherskyy court remitted the case to the prosecutor general’s office for further investigation given that meanwhile, on 11 april 2011, the latter had instituted criminal proceedings against former prime minister tymoshenko on suspicion of abuse of authority for signing the gas contracts in january 2009 (see paragraph 7 above). on 20 july 2012 the pecherskyy court found him guilty as charged and gave him a suspended sentence of four years’ imprisonment. the parties did not inform the court of any further developments in the criminal proceedings against the applicant. publicly available material shows that on 3 march 2014 the pecherskyy court absolved him from criminal liability and found him not to have had any criminal record.
the applicant was born in 1955 and lives in kharkiv. on 6 february 2004 a certain m. went to the passport registration office where the applicant worked to apply for a passport for her son, who had reached the age of sixteen. the applicant allegedly told m. that it might be time-consuming to settle the matter, in particular because of the fact that m.’s son had been born in russia and his original birth certificate was not available. m. confirmed that she was aware of the criminal liability for knowingly making a false report about a crime. according to the police records, the above statement was made at 5 p.m. however, as subsequently established (see paragraph 59 below), that was an error and the actual time of the statement was about 10 a.m. 10. at about 1 p.m. on the same day m. entered the applicant’s office and emerged a few minutes later, indicating to the investigator and the attesting witnesses that she had given the usd 100 banknote to the applicant. the investigator drew up an inspection and seizure report. the applicant had also clarified that she would be working in a different office from monday, 9 february 2004. and the latter was admitted to the proceedings. however, she had seen m. putting a usd 100 banknote on the table and had decided to take advantage of the situation given her own financial difficulties. on the same date, 16 february 2004, m. was also questioned. on 28 february 2004 formal charges were brought against the applicant and her status changed from being a suspect to an accused. on the same day the applicant changed her lawyer. she also undertook to keep the banknote until the end of the proceedings. on 10 november 2004 the kyivskyy court dropped the charge of incitement to bribery. on 18 july 2005 it decided that it was impossible to complete its judicial investigation in their absence and ordered the police to ensure their attendance. the other attesting witness, t., was always away from home when visited by the police and his neighbours had not seen him for some time. it is not known whether there was a hearing on 6 december 2005. it is an established fact, however, that t. did not attend any of the hearings. by the same ruling, the kyivskyy court ordered the prosecution authorities to ensure the mandatory presence of t. 35. the verdict noted that the applicant had initially confessed to the offences, but had later retracted her confession for no apparent reason other than an attempt to escape liability. the applicant did not refer in her appeal or in its supplement to her inability to examine t. or to have him examined. there were no reasons to question the veracity of the statements they had made during the pre-trial investigation. however, two days later the investigation was resumed. instead of opening a criminal case, it provided for the initiation of an investigation by way of making an entry in the unified register of pre-trial investigations. on 22 march 2013 a criminal investigation into the applicant’s failure to comply with the judgment of 16 february 2006 was launched again and was registered in the unified register of pre-trial investigations. on 8 april 2013 they were, however, resumed. she enclosed copies of the two rulings of those dates, by which the investigator had opened and had discontinued the criminal proceedings against her. she further argued, in general terms, that the court had incorrectly interpreted article 1176 of the civil code (see paragraph 63 below) and that it had not calculated, as prescribed under the compensation act (see paragraph 64 below), an amount of compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage to which she was entitled. however, there was no indication of a criminal offence.

the applicants were born in 1931, 1972, 1948, 1965, 1970, and 1964 respectively, and live in golubovci. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. the applicants intervened, as injured party, in criminal proceedings against x, in the course of which they sought 2.705,70 euros (eur) as compensation for legal costs. on 14 october 2008 the high court (viši sud) in podgorica found x guilty and, inter alia, ordered him to pay the applicants 505.70 euros (eur) for the costs of legal representation, without specifying what exactly was covered by this amount. on an unspecified date x and the high state prosecutor appealed. on 30 march 2009 the applicants appealed in respect of costs and expenses. on 6 may 2009 the high court transmitted the applicants’ appeal to the court of appeal (apelacioni sud) in podgorica. on 22 september 2009 the court of appeal ruled on the appeals lodged by the high state prosecutor and x. the applicants learned of this judgment on 27 may 2010 when checking the case-file at the high court. on 28 may 2010 the applicants complained to the president of the supreme court that the court of appeal had failed to rule on their appeal. on 7 june 2010 the president of the supreme court notified them that she had been informed by the high court president that the case file had been “at the court of appeal in order for it to rule on [their] appeal in respect of costs of criminal proceedings given that it had not been ruled upon by [its] judgment of 22 september 2009”. on 24 october 2011 the applicants requested the president of the high court to transmit the case file to the court of appeal given that they had learnt that the file had been archived in the high court, contrary to what that court had said to the president of the supreme court. on 11 january 2012 the applicants again complained to the president of the supreme court. it would appear that the court of appeal has not ruled on the applicants’ appeal. on 14 march 2011, in the absence of any ruling by the court of appeal, the applicants filed a compensation claim against the state. on 17 june 2011 the court of first instance (osnovni sud) in podgorica rejected the claim (odbacuje se) finding that the high court had awarded them the costs, which judgment had become final in the meantime, and that the issue was thus res iudicata. on 7 july 2011 the high court upheld this judgment. on 12 july 2012 the constitutional court (ustavni sud) dismissed the applicants’ constitutional appeal, considering that there was no violation of article 6 as res iudicata was indeed a procedural obstacle which prevented further proceedings. it further held that the applicants’ dissatisfaction with the costs awarded in the criminal proceedings did not mean that they could claim them by a regular civil claim (putem redovne građanske tužbe). in any event, the civil proceedings could not serve to correct the final decisions issued in criminal proceedings. on 8 december 2011 the high court issued a decision ordering its finance department (računovodstvo) to pay the applicants’ representative the amount awarded by the high court on 14 october 2008. this decision became final on 5 january 2012, given that no appeal was lodged against it. on 10 january 2017 the high court informed the agent’s office that the court of appeal had not ruled on the applicants’ appeal in respect of costs of criminal proceedings, but that the high court, after its judgment of 14 october 2008 had become final, had issued a decision on 8 december 2011 ordering that the applicants’ representative be paid the sum awarded thereby.

the applicant was born in 1963 and at the time of lodging his application he was serving his prison sentence in the bolu f-type prison. on 3 december 2007 the applicant wrote a letter to the ministry of justice, in which he had praised the imprisoned leader of the pkk, abdullah öcalan by using the honorific “sayın”, meaning esteemed. pursuant to the regulations on the administration of penitentiary institutions and the execution of sentences, the applicant was found guilty of breaching prison order by the bolu f- type prison disciplinary board (referred hereafter as “the board”). on 12 december 2007 the applicant was sentenced to 11 days’ solitary confinement on the orders of the board, on account of his statements in the above mentioned letter. on 25 december 2007 the bolu enforcement judge rejected the applicant’s objection. on 15 january 2008 the bolu assize court upheld the judgment of 25 december 2007.

the applicant was born in 1990 and lived in moscow until his arrest. 74568/12, §§ 7-65, 5 january 2016), and yaroslav belousov v. russia (nos. 2653/13 and 60980/14, §§ 7-33, 4 october 2016). to control the crowd the police cordon forced the protestors to remain within the barriers; there were numerous clashes between the two sides. it took them about two hours to clear the square. on the same day the moscow city department of the investigative committee of the russian federation opened criminal proceedings to investigate suspected acts of mass disorder and violence against the police (articles 212 § 2 and 318 § 1 of the criminal code). on 18 may 2012 the file was transferred to the headquarters of the investigative committee for further investigation. the two criminal cases were joined on the same day. at the time of his arrest the applicant was a second-year student at the moscow university of social studies and worked part-time as a courier for an insurance company. in response, the protesters dragged metal barriers in place to protect themselves from the police. after the events in question he continued to live at his usual address and pursue his studies. on 26 july 2012 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having participated in acts of mass disorder on 6 may 2012. according to that report, the applicant was an active member of organisations of a destructive character. another police officer, l., also identified the applicant as a participant in acts of mass disorder who had tried to prevent the police arresting another protestor. on 22 october 2012 the moscow city court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the extension order of 24 september 2012. on 17 april 2013 the moscow city court upheld the extension order. the decision concerned eleven defendants. the applicant was held in iz-77/2 for the whole period of his pre-trial detention from 4 september 2012. 25664/05, §§ 42 and 58-63, 6 december 2007; zentsov and others v. russia, no. 18813/06, §§ 26‑27 and 38-43, 11 april 2013). the applicant submitted that his conditions of detention had been similar. on 6 june 2013 court proceedings began in hearing room no. on 6 june 2013 the zamoskvoretskiy district court of moscow began a preliminary hearing in a criminal case against ten participants in the demonstration at bolotnaya square, who were charged with participation in acts of mass disorder and committing acts of violence against police officers. on 18 june 2013 the same court began the trial on the merits. the applicant had caused him pain but had not inflicted any injuries. on 21 february 2014 the zamoskvoretsky district court of moscow found the applicant guilty as charged. he did not see what was happening, but at one point ... he had been able to proceed with the flow of people towards the stage. then [the applicant] was arrested and taken to a police vehicle. ... the court considers the [defendants’] arguments that they were protecting somebody from police officers or happened to be victims of the police’s use of force as farfetched and aimed at the mitigation of their responsibility ...” 31. he insisted that he had not used violence against t. because the latter had not suffered any pain or injuries.
the applicant was born in 1990 and lives in moscow. 74568/12, §§ 7-65, 5 january 2016), and yaroslav belousov v. russia (nos. it took them about two hours to clear the square. on the same day the moscow city department of the investigative committee of the russian federation opened criminal proceedings to investigate suspected acts of mass disorder and violence against the police (articles 212 § 2 and 318 § 1 of the criminal code). on 28 may 2012 an investigation was also launched into the criminal offence of organising acts of mass disorder (article 212 § 1 of the criminal code). the two criminal cases were joined on the same day. protestors were surrounded and squeezed together. the applicant was both angered and scared by the actions of the police and actively resisted. he was eventually seized by four police officers and escorted to a police car, which took him to a police station. the justice of the peace established that after the meeting at bolotnaya square the applicant had shouted anti-government slogans, ignoring the lawful demands of the police to cease those acts. he had thrown objects at the police officers, including stones, flagpoles, empty plastic bottles, and pieces of asphalt, and had refused to proceed to the police van. the applicant was sentenced to detention of twenty-four hours. it referred to the gravity of the charges and stated that if he was at liberty the applicant could co-ordinate his position with accomplices whose identities were still being established by the investigation. in addition, the court relied on information obtained from undercover sources that the applicant had connections with football fans and groups of anarchists. it dismissed a request from the applicant for an alternative preventive measure and found that his release was not required on health grounds. on 31 october 2012 the basmannyy district court examined a new application for an extension of the applicant’s pre-trial detention. on 13 november 2012 the applicant lodged an appeal against the extension order, which was dismissed on 3 december 2012 by the moscow city court. on 16 november 2012 the charges against the applicant were updated. on 23 april 2013 the moscow city court granted an extension of the applicant’s detention until 6 july 2013. the decision concerned eleven defendants. the moscow city court upheld that extension order on 2 july 2013. from mid-september 2013 to the end of 2013 the hearings continued at the nikulinskiy district court of moscow in hearing room no. other police officers had picked him up to take away him from the crowd. testified that the applicant had kicked an unidentified police officer. he had also uttered obscenities to the police officers and shouted at them. on 21 february 2014 the zamoskvoretsky district court found the applicant guilty as charged. he was hit several times on the shoulder and the head, which led to dizziness. a few minutes later he was taken out of the crowd and beaten, his t-shirt was torn, then ... four police officers seized him and dragged him along the tarmac to the police vehicle.

the applicant company is a limited liability company established under lithuanian law with its registered office in vilnius. ’s website (hereinafter “the advertisements”). she had a halo around her head and was holding a string of beads. the third advertisement showed the man and the woman together, wearing the same clothes and accessories as in the previous advertisements. the man was reclining and the woman was standing next to him with one hand placed on his head and the other on his shoulder. in this case the game has gone too far. ( humour is understandable but it can really offend religious people. on 8 october 2012 the scrpa received a complaint from a law firm in kaunas concerning the advertisements. it asked the scrpa to fine the applicant company and to order it to remove the advertisements as being contrary to public order and public morals. religious people always react very sensitively to any use of religious symbols or religious personalities in advertising. the use of religious symbols for superficial purposes may offend religious people. advertisements must not include statements or visuals which are offensive to religious feelings or show disrespect for religious people.” dievuliau, viešpatie, gink dieve) and many others. it further submitted that the people depicted in the advertisements could not be unambiguously considered as resembling religious figures, but even if they were, that depiction was aesthetically pleasant and not disrespectful, unlike various kitschy and low-quality religious items typically sold in markets. on 27 november 2012 the inspectorate drew up a report of a violation of the law on advertising against the applicant company. the report essentially repeated the contents of the inspectorate’s previous letter to the applicant company (see paragraph 13 above), adding that “advertisements of such nature offend[ed] religious feelings” and “the basic respect for spirituality [was] disappearing” (nelieka elementarios pagarbos dvasingumui). in the christian tradition, a religious symbol is a visible sign representing the invisible sacred reality. christ and mary, as symbols of faith, represent certain moral values and embody ethical perfection, and for that they are examples of appropriate behaviour and desirable life for the faithful. a representative of the bishops conference repeated its previous position (see paragraph 16 above) and stated that it had received complaints from about a hundred religious individuals concerning the advertisements. they further submitted that the advertisements had relied on wordplay and they had been meant to be funny but not to offend anyone. it must be emphasised that respect for religion is undoubtedly a moral value. on 12 november 2013 the vilnius regional administrative court dismissed the applicant company’s complaint. the court considered that the scrpa had correctly assessed all the relevant circumstances (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above), and concluded that “the form of advertising used by [the applicant company was] prohibited because it distort[ed] the main purpose of a religious symbol (an object of religion) respected by a religious community – that purpose being to refer to a deity or to holiness”. the applicant company appealed against that decision. the court held:
“the entirety of the evidence in the present case gives grounds to conclude that the advertisements displayed by [the applicant company] are clearly contrary to public morals, because religion, as a certain type of world view, unavoidably contributes to the moral development of the society; symbols of a religious nature occupy a significant place in the system of spiritual values of individuals and the society, and their inappropriate use demeans them [and] is contrary to universally accepted moral and ethical norms. on 21 august 2014 the president of the supreme administrative court asked that court to examine whether there were grounds for reopening the proceedings in the applicant company’s case (see paragraphs 40 and 41 below). on 20 november 2014 a different panel of the supreme administrative court refused to reopen the proceedings in the applicant company’s case. it emphasised that proceedings which had been concluded by a final court decision could be reopened only when there had been a manifest error in the interpretation or application of the law, and not when it was merely possible to interpret that law differently. referring to the judgments of the european court of human rights in müller and others v. switzerland (24 may 1988, § 35, series a no. 133) and otto‑preminger‑institut v. austria (20 september 1994, § 50, series a no.
the applicant was born in 1988 and lives in diyarbakır. in 2005, while he was a first-year mechanics student in the technical faculty of fırat university (“the faculty”), the applicant was seriously injured in an accident which left his lower limbs paralysed. he had to suspend his studies until he had recovered sufficiently to return to university. the faculty replied to that request by letter of 25 may 2007. it added that the mechanics course required the applicant to participate in practical workshops, considering that as things stood such participation would cause problems. the faculty concluded that if the applicant wished to continue his studies it would help him as far as possible. on 16 august 2007 the applicant sent, through a notary, formal notice to the administration of fırat university and the faculty dean inviting them to carry out the redevelopment work requested. relying on article 42 of the constitution, section 15 of law no. 5378 on persons with disabilities and article 2 of protocol no. 1 to the convention, he affirmed that it was the state’s duty to guarantee the citizens’ right to education, in line with the principle of equal opportunities. he further alleged that the faculty’s reply to his request (see paragraph 8 above) had been intended solely to induce him to abandon his studies. furthermore, any problems encountered by the applicant in attending the theoretical classes administered in a three-storey building could be resolved with the help of a companion. the administration pointed out that the practical workshops were held on the ground floor of the building and posed no problems with regard to access, and that the applicant would consequently have no difficulty in attending the courses administered in the framework of those workshops. furthermore, all the parties involved were anxious to help students in difficulty, and there was no question of deterring the applicant from continuing his studies. he claimed 25,000 turkish liras (try) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and try 30,000 in respect of pecuniary damage. the administration of fırat university replied in a defence memorial of 24 march 2008. it criticised the applicant for having opted for judicial channels, and alleged that he was acting in bad faith, adding, in that connection, that he had been informed that he would be provided with support should he decide to return to university. the administration further argued that it had offered the applicant the services of an assistant, but that he had not submitted any request for such help. lastly, it pointed out that the applicant had never been barred from any course. the applicant replied, refuting the arguments put forward by the administration. 3194 on urban planning (see paragraph 23 above). furthermore, he considered that the authorities’ offer of an assistant illustrated their ignorance of his personal situation and the implications of that situation. he added that it would be degrading for him to be placed in a situation of dependence on a third person because of his disability, citing the example of how the constant presence and assistance of a third person would invade his privacy. on 13 october 2008 the faculty terminated its contracts with a number of students, including the applicant, on the grounds that they had not re-registered at the start of two successive academic years. 2 november 2009 saw the enactment of legislative decree no. under the legislative decree students who were already registered could continue their studies in the new faculties. in the reasoning of its judgment it stated, in particular, that the buildings in question had been erected in accordance with the regulations in force in 1988. the court took the view that although it was incumbent on the authorities to apply the technical guidelines set out in the legislation subsequently enacted for persons with disabilities, it could not be contended that the respondent authority had not followed those guidelines during the construction of a building erected in 1988, before the guidelines had come into force. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the supreme administrative court against that judgment. on 28 september 2011 the supreme administrative court dismissed the applicant’s application, holding that there were no grounds for rectification.
the applicants were born in 1945 and 1951 respectively and live in sliema. pursuant to the terms of a contract of 11 april 1962 a house (of fourteen rooms, including four double bedrooms) in sliema (hereinafter “the property”) owned by a third party was rented out under a contract of temporary sub-emphyteusis to j.g. for twenty-five years as from 15 june 1962 at 100 maltese liras (mtl – approximately 233 euros (eur)) per year. according to the contract the tenant was responsible for all maintenance work, both ordinary and extraordinary, internally and externally. on 15 june 1987, by operation of law (act xxii of 1979), that contract was converted into one of lease, and the owner continued to receive rent. had three children, one of whom was unmarried. however since all the descendants had settled lives of their own, the applicants expected that the property would be returned to them after the tenant’s and his wife’s death. at the time the applicants lived in the united kingdom. whether he was willing to vacate the property, but he did not consent to do so. eventually the applicants agreed that j.g. in 1993 the applicants returned to malta. in consequence the applicants had to reside in their smaller apartment on the island of gozo and the first applicant was obliged to commute by boat on a daily basis to get to work. allegedly the applicants spent eur 12,000 in maintenance and furnishings. in 2004 and 2008 respectively her parents passed away. as a tenant and refused to accept rent from her. they also insisted she had to undertake repair work in the property pursuant to the original contract. a seventy-year old pensioner, had a constant and considerable income (a monthly pension of 900 pounds sterling (gbp), and during her stay in malta she was letting her property in the uk at gbp 1,000 a month); she eventually sold her property in the uk for gbp 305,000. she went on to inherit various assets and sold them for a considerable sum. in the constitutional redress proceedings (mentioned below), she declared that she needed the property which was spacious in order to store her parent’s furniture. pursuant to the current law the rent applicable in the applicants’ case is increased every three years in accordance with the increase in the inflation index (capped at a 100%). on 17 february 2010 the applicants instituted constitutional redress proceedings. the applicants asked the court to order the eviction of the tenant and the latter to pay for ordinary and extraordinary repairs, and to award damages for the loss sustained as a result of the low amount of rent received, and in connection with the disbursements they had to make for their own housing. 1 to the convention as a result of the application of articles 2 and 12 of chapter 158 of the laws of malta and ordered that the tenant be evicted within four months of the date of judgment. the court rejected the remainder of the claims. the government and the tenant appealed and the applicants cross‑appealed. it considered that act xxii of 1979, which provided for the conversion of a temporary emphyteusis into a lease, had constituted interference with the applicants’ right of property as it had created a forced landlord-tenant relationship for an indeterminate time, during which they had not been able to use their own property and during which they had suffered financial losses as a result of the low amount of rent received, which had been established by law. whose emphyteusis had just been converted into a lease on 15 june 1987, and from whom they continued to receive rent. the applicants are now of pensionable age. the government submitted that the applicants had failed to prove that they had been paying rent and, if so, what rent they had been paying for these premises. according to the applicants, they have since moved to a different property.
the applicants were born in 1979 and 1984. they are currently serving life sentences imposed in the impugned proceedings described below. in the incident three children were killed and six people were seriously injured (“the victims”). following a criminal complaint for murder lodged against unknown perpetrators, on 3 august 2006 the public prosecutor requested that an investigating judge question the victims and a certain b.h. none of them identified the applicants as the perpetrators. he stated that a certain f. had introduced him to the buyers. during the investigation, there were several unsuccessful attempts by the investigating judge to summons b.h. having been alerted to the summons and the police inquiry, b.h. appeared in court to testify before the investigating judge. he stated that there had been four people in the car and that all had fired on the café. he also alleged that he himself had been the most likely target of the attack owing to his alleged involvement in the killing of the applicants’ brother, which had happened at the beginning of 2006. on 4 may 2007 two people who had been eye-witnesses to the incident gave oral evidence in the presence of the investigating judge and the public prosecutor. vodno” also identified the other applicant as having fired on the café. on 11 may 2007 another individual was examined before the investigating judge and the public prosecutor under the pseudonym “vardar” for the same reasons as the witness “vodno”. on the same date, the investigating judge opened an investigation against the applicants and dz. the applicants, who had in the meantime been arrested, were remanded in prison custody. the applicants formulated seven questions to be put to each witness. both witnesses submitted that, despite the impaired visibility, there had been sufficient light to see the applicants. a transcript of their replies was communicated to the applicants. who did not recognise mr ramiz asani as the buyer of the car used in the incident. since the identity of witness “vardar” had been disclosed in the proceedings (f.s.), was in the respondent state and had been involved in incidents relating to the parliamentary elections of 1 june 2008. it disregarded his statement of 1 april 2008 (see paragraph 17 above), finding that it had been given under duress and the threat that he or his family would be killed. for this reason it considered it irrelevant to examine the remaining witnesses proposed by the defence. they dismissed appeals lodged by the applicants in which they complained inter alia that the trial court had failed to admit evidence proposed by the defence, that their conviction could not be based solely on the statements of the anonymous witnesses, which had been unlawfully obtained, and that the trial court had not examined b.h. notwithstanding their claims that he would have been available for examination. had been wounded and hospitalised and later detained by the police. in this connection they found that the trial court had admitted other evidence, both documentary and verbal. as regards the evidence produced by b.h., in subsequent criminal proceedings, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment.
the applicant was born in 1976 and is serving a sentence of life imprisonment. in december 2005 violent robberies were committed at two scrap metal collection points in odesa. in the course of the investigation, the police organised an ambush, which led to the applicant and his acquaintance, mr d., being arrested. as established by the domestic courts, before his arrest the applicant had pointed a gun at a police officer, who had knocked it out of his hands using a martial arts technique. the gun had been loaded and had had its safety catch released. on an unspecified date the applicant had free legal counsel appointed for him for the pre-trial investigation and the proceedings before the first‑instance court. on 4 september 2006 the odesa regional court of appeal, sitting as a court of first instance, found the applicant guilty of the illegal handling of arms, robbery with violence, intentional murder for profit and an attempt on the life of a law-enforcement officer. it relied, inter alia, on the statements of several eyewitnesses who had recognised the applicant. having regard to the fact that the applicant had previously been convicted of the intentional infliction of fatal injuries and that he had committed the crimes at issue while on probation following release in october 2005, the court sentenced him to life imprisonment. the applicant, who was no longer legally represented, appealed in cassation. he complained, in particular, about the absence of free legal assistance at that stage of the proceedings. the applicant contended that the first-instance court had erred in its assessment of the facts of the case and their legal classification. on 30 january 2007, following a hearing with the participation of mr d. (the other defendant) and his lawyer, as well as the prosecutor, but without the applicant or any representative from his side, the supreme court upheld the judgment of 4 september 2006. on 11 june 2007 the applicant, who was not aware of the above ruling, requested that the supreme court ensure his presence at its hearing. on 17 august 2007 a copy of the supreme court’s ruling of 30 january 2007 was sent to the applicant.
following the death of her grandmother in 2010 the applicant, who was a minor at the time, began to show signs of distress. her parents sought the opinion of a psychiatrist, who emphasised that their daughter was suffering from emotional instability, alternating between periods of anger and periods of agitation. on 19 april 2013 the applicant went to a party where there were drugs and alcohol. the police arrived, seized the drugs and alcohol and checked the identity of the minors who were present. a criminal investigation was opened and the public prosecutor at the youth court was informed. on 5 june 2013 the public prosecutor heard evidence from the applicant, who stated that she had started to take drugs when she was twelve but had since stopped. 1404 of 1934 and to have the minor placed in a specialist institution and in the care of the social services. on 14 october 2013, that is, almost three months later, the youth court gave the social services notice to appear before it. they informed the social services that a criminal investigation was in progress. on 19 december 2013 the public prosecutor at the district court informed the public prosecutor at the youth court that a criminal investigation was in progress concerning two individuals for exploitation of the applicant for prostitution. the public prosecutor stressed that the arrest of the two suspects was imminent, and requested the prosecutor at the youth court to inform him of the measures taken to implement the youth court’s decision of 9 december 2013 (see paragraph 17 above), given that the applicant was due to give evidence at the ad hoc hearing (incidente probatorio) (see paragraph 51 below). on 20 december 2013 the applicant reiterated that she did not wish to be placed in a specialist institution. on 31 january the applicant went to hospital with a police officer and her mother in order to be examined. on 6 february 2014 the social services told the youth court that they had had several meetings with v.c. ’s parents and with the psychologist and psychiatrist whom she was seeing. on 7 february 2014 the social services were informed of the assault on the applicant. on 13 march 2014 the youth mental health department informed the youth court that the applicant had been diagnosed as being anti-social and drug-dependent and that she had agreed to being placed in a treatment centre (comunità terapeutica). the department had therefore requested the v.l. they also requested that a curator be appointed and that the court take urgent steps to protect their daughter. the measure took effect on 14 april 2014. the social services did not respond to this request. on 22 october 2015 the social services sent a report to the youth court stressing that two meetings had been held with the applicant’s parents and that a psychiatric expert assessment had been carried out. she stated that she had gone back to school and was continuing to be monitored by the social services. the applicant stated that no such programme had actually been in place. an investigation into the prostitution ring was opened in april 2013 and was concluded in december of that year. she said that she had worked as a prostitute for two individuals. it also ordered them to pay damages to the applicant, who had applied to join the proceedings as a civil party. on 4 february 2016 the court of appeal upheld the conviction. the case was set down for preliminary hearing on 6 november 2015 before the rome district court. it appears from the file that a further hearing was held on 16 february 2016 and that the proceedings are still pending.
the applicant was born in 1988 and lives in varna. in the summer of 2002 she obtained temporary residency status. her father opened his own construction business in bulgaria. the turkmen prosecutor ordered their detention in relation to those charges and filed a request for their extradition with the bulgarian authorities. on entering the apartment the officers informed the applicant that they had come to arrest her parents. it appears from the documents before the domestic courts that at that time, the parents were out shopping accompanied by their legal representative, who returned home with them. the applicant’s parents were arrested as soon as they arrived home. he did not know where the police officers had taken the applicant’s parents but said that he thought that they had been taken to the regional investigation office. in any event, he had visited them the following day but could not remember exactly where. he did not know what had happened to the applicant and had not seen her after her parents’ arrest. the applicant’s father was taken to varna prison and her mother to sliven prison. according to the latter, when her mother was asked by the judge through an interpreter whether there was anyone who could take care of her child, her mother replied by shaking her head. in their view, this was evidence of the mother’s reply. in addition, they cited an excerpt of the court’s record where the applicant’s mother had addressed the court in the following terms: “i am very surprised as i have worked as an associate professor, with a doctorate in science, for ten years, and for some reason, they want to accuse me of something that happened out there, and i’ve been living here for a whole year. there is someone to take care of my child.” the applicant’s parents were released on bail and returned home to the applicant the same day. the refusal became final on 30 may 2003 as it had not been appealed against. it is alleged that the applicant’s parents were arrested so rapidly that they did not manage to leave any money for her, or to give her any instructions as to whom to turn to or how to go about caring for herself. both prospects caused the applicant anguish as she had heard that prisons were horrible both in turkmenistan and in bulgaria. her mother took her to hospital on 18 december 2002, the day after she was released from detention, fearing that the wound might have become infected. the government alleged that it had not been proven that the applicant had been left alone, without an adult carer, during the period in question. she directed her claim against the varna regional office of the ministry of the interior, the prosecution service, the ministry of justice and the supreme judicial council, and sought to establish the responsibility of the authorities that had left her unattended during her parents’ detention in december 2002, in breach of the child protection act. on 14 february 2007 the supreme court of cassation quashed the lower court’s decision, finding that it had wrongly instructed the applicant to specify individual respondents. on 25 october 2007 the applicant further specified her claim before the varna regional court, in particular describing her circumstances in the immediate aftermath of her parents’ arrest and the continuing psychological trauma which she had suffered as a result. she showed signs of accumulated tension, fear, worries, disappointment and anger towards the officials who had abandoned her to her own devices following her parents’ arrest. two additional medical expert reports were prepared in 2008. the doctors stated in court that no improvement was likely in her case and that her condition was expected to become chronic. the applicant appealed to the varna court of appeal. the appellate court confirmed the lower court’s decision on 10 december 2010. the applicant was granted humanitarian status on 10 march 2004 and refugee status on 15 september 2007.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in san jose, the united states of america. on 6 september 2005 the applicant brought proceedings against the private company x and a third party, seeking the recovery of property rights pertaining to land, both on his own behalf and on behalf of six other plaintiffs who were allegedly co-owners of the property. on 21 december 2005 the district court ordered the applicant to inform it by 31 january 2006 of the home addresses of the other six plaintiffs on whose behalf he had brought the proceedings. the applicant complied with the court’s order. on 29 november 2006 the applicant informed the district court on behalf of himself and the other six plaintiffs of the cancellation of the legal representation contract they had signed with their initial legal representative. on 24 march and 21 april 2008 the district court adjourned the proceedings on procedural grounds and in order to allow the applicant to add to the file the relevant documents proving that he and the other six plaintiffs were entitled to claim the land in question and that the applicant was authorised by the other plaintiffs to represent them. the court also noted that the proceedings would be suspended in accordance with the relevant civil procedure rules if the applicant failed to comply with the court’s request to add the requisite documents. on 16 june 2008 the district court suspended the proceedings in accordance with article 242 § 1(2) of the former code of civil procedure (hereinafter referred to as the “ccp” – see paragraph 25 below) on the grounds that none of the parties had attended the hearing scheduled for that date. on 26 january 2009 the district court amended of its own motion the decision of 16 june 2008. it held that some of the parties had in fact attended the hearing of 16 june 2008. the applicant appealed on points of fact and points of law against both the decision of 16 june 2008 and that of 26 january 2009 (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). on 11 february 2010 the county court allowed the applicant’s aforementioned appeal against the district court’s decisions and ordered the reopening of the proceedings. it held that there was no evidence in the file that four of the other plaintiffs had died or that the first-instance court had adjourned the proceedings in order to allow the applicant to submit proof of those deaths. also, the decision of 26 january 2009 to amend the decision of 16 june 2008 (see paragraph 12 above) had been unlawful. he complained that even though the county court had ordered the reopening of the proceedings in the case in february 2010, the district court had still not resumed the examination thereof. on 14 october and 9 december 2010 and 3 march 2011 the district court adjourned the proceedings on procedural grounds to allow the plaintiffs’ legal representative to add documents to the file and to prepare his defence, and for the court to deliberate. in addition, it ordered the applicant to clarify whether the other six plaintiffs were still alive and, if not, to establish who were their heirs. it noted that the applicant had made some attempts to obtain the requested information from the relevant domestic authorities, but he had failed to provide relevant information about the plaintiffs which would have enabled the authorities to identify them. moreover, the summonses sent by the court to the known foreign addresses of the other six plaintiffs provided by the applicant had either not been received by the recipients or had been returned because the intended recipients had been unknown at those addresses. the applicant appealed on points of fact and points of law against the decision. on 28 march 2012 the county court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of fact and points of law against the district court’s decision of 8 march 2011 (see paragraph 18 above). it held, amongst other things, that the applicant had acted as the other six plaintiffs’ representative without being able to prove that they were still alive or to identify their heirs, if such heirs existed. since he was the one who had brought the proceedings, he had a duty to produce evidence in respect of the persons he was representing and was solely responsible for the way he had chosen to formulate his action before the court. the court was bound by the procedural framework set by the applicant. since he had chosen to sign the application to the court both on his own behalf and on that of other persons, he should have been aware that he would be responsible for proving his status and his right to act as a representative. on 29 november 2012 the county court dismissed the extraordinary appeal for a review of proceedings instituted by the applicant against the final judgment of 28 march 2012 as having been lodged out of time. on 23 may 2013 the district court of its own motion declared the proceedings brought by the applicant on 6 september 2005 (see paragraph 6 above) to be barred by limitation on account of his inaction. it held that for more than a year the applicant had failed to make any request for the proceedings to be reopened. it reiterated the reasons provided by the first-instance court. it also held that the extraordinary appeals lodged by the applicant against the judgment of 28 march 2012 (see paragraph 20 above) had not put a stop to the bar by limitation, because they could not be considered as procedural acts aimed at reopening the proceedings.
the applicant company is a legal entity registered in vilnius. the main objectives of the development plan were published in the official gazette (valstybės žinios) (see paragraph 53 below). there were two military barracks, a canteen, a store house and two sheds. the buildings had to be integrated in the landscape; as they were sited in the forest, the purpose of the use of the land had to be changed. the applicant company’s claim was dismissed on 23 october 2003 by the klaipėda regional administrative court and on 27 january 2004 by the supreme administrative court. however, as there was no detailed plan of the area, the land could not be leased. the applicant company was also obliged to pay the land tax. in february 2006 the applicant company asked the authorities to include the land in question in the landscape management recreational zone. in february 2012 the inspectorate replied that when approving the curonian spit national park management plan (hereafter “the management plan”), a decision on a compensation mechanism and time-limits would also have to be taken. in june 2012 the authorities replied that the working group had to be set up before 29 june 2012. the working group was set on 20 july 2012 and had to provide its proposals before 19 november 2012. on 30 august 2010 the klaipėda regional administrative court allowed the claim, holding that the applicant company had been paying the land tax, which was evidence that it had been using the plot of land. it held that the applicant company had not provided any information proving that it was the owner of the plot of land, so the authorities had not been obliged to issue planning permission for renovation of the canteen. on 6 june 2012 the government approved the management plan by resolution no. the management plan included the reserve land in juodkrantė, indicating that its purpose was to compensate for the possible losses incurred by lawful owners of buildings that had been earmarked for demolition. on 4 july 2012 the applicant company lodged a complaint with the vilnius regional administrative court, urging it to revoke the part of the government resolution where it had been decided that the buildings at 21 miško street (the location of the applicant company’s buildings) would be demolished and to order the authorities to amend the management plan. on 23 july 2012 the vilnius regional administrative court refused to examine the claim. moreover, the court had already ruled on the issue of the attribution of the management plan to the jurisdiction of the administrative courts and had decided that it had not been attributable to those courts (see paragraph 79 below). the court indicated that a legal act could consist of textual and graphic information (tables, drawings, schemes, plans, symbols, emblems). the applicant company’s request to organise the procedure to amend the management plan so that it included the land in question in the landscape management recreational zone was dismissed because the applicant company had failed to address the authorities or the courts after the approval of the management plan. the applicant company then applied for the reopening of the proceedings. the applicant company had indicated major repair work. the authorities stated that a detailed plan was not necessary, the location of the building to be renovated was not important and a document proving ownership of the land (see paragraph 25 above) was not necessary either. the state representative refused to agree to the proposal because it was in breach of domestic law (see paragraph 63 below). however, when using them the applicant company had to follow the legal regulations, which established that construction in the area in question was not allowed and that it was attempting to protect its rights in the wrong way. on 15 april 2015 the government adopted resolution no. in june 2016 the applicant company submitted its proposals, namely that the area in which its buildings were located be included in the landscape management zone and that the buildings there should not exceed one storey with an attic. the applicant company stated that it had paid eur 41,887 in land tax and eur 22,795 in property tax between 2000 and 2014. there had also been no indications about the exact time-limits and procedure for the removal of the buildings. on 15 december 2016 the vilnius regional administrative court dismissed the applicant company’s appeal.

 -  she and n. had been living in the flat since 1994 as husband and wife;
 -  she had shared a common household with n.;
 -  n. had let her live in the flat as his family member;
 -  she had been paying the charges for the flat;
 -  she had no other housing. on 23 november 2015 the district court refused to evict the applicant from the flat. the court found, with reference to article 31 of the housing code, that n. had let the applicant live in the flat as a family member, and until his death had shared a common household with her. therefore, after n.’s death the applicant had not lost the right to live in the flat. in its appeal against that judgment the district administration submitted that it had become the owner of the flat on 10 may 2013 following the death of the applicant’s partner. therefore the applicant’s right to use that flat had come to an end on the same date. who had let the defendant live in [the flat], died on 9 may 2013. ...

the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in belebey, republic of bashkortostan. in october 2007 the applicant and his family moved from uzbekistan to russia, apparently for the purpose of obtaining russian nationality as well as seeking medical treatment for the applicant’s drug addiction. in december 2007 the uzbek authorities charged the applicant with large-scale drug-trafficking committed in october 2007 and issued a detention order and an international search warrant. on 12 july 2008 the applicant was arrested in moscow and on 14 july 2008 the dragomilovskiy district court of moscow ordered the applicant’s detention pending extradition, without setting any time-limit. on 9 december 2008 the russian prosecutor general’s office ordered the applicant’s extradition. on 28 january 2009 the moscow city court confirmed the lawfulness of the applicant’s arrest and detention, and upheld the extradition. in the meantime, on 4 march 2009 the supreme court of russia upheld the judgment of 28 january 2009. on 10 august 2009 the applicant issued an authority form to lawyers to lodge an application with the court on his behalf. on 21 august 2009 the extradition order was enforced and the applicant was transferred to uzbekistan. on 28 august 2009 the applicant’s lawyers – who were apparently unaware of the extradition − requested an interim measure under rule 39 of the rules of court in order to stay the removal. on 1 september 2009 the court indicated the relevant measure to the russian government. however, after the russian government had informed the court about the extradition on 21 august 2009, the interim measure was lifted on 7 october 2009. the parties submitted no information on related events in uzbekistan. on an unspecified date the applicant joined his family in russia.

[ [the applicant] is accused of having committed a crime under article 386 paragraph 2 of the criminal code of ukraine. however, the court believes that [the applicant], acting through unidentified individuals, has taken steps aimed at obstructing the truth from being established in the case in the course of the court’s consideration of his case. thus, according to statements of 28 december 2007 made by the victim, ya., and i., a witness, unknown individuals acting on [the applicant’s] behalf, have put psychological pressure on them, trying to prevent their appearing at the hearing of 29 december 2007. on 23 january 2008 the kherson regional court of appeal refused the applicant leave to appeal against the decision of 16 january 2008 remanding him in pre-trial detention (see paragraph 17 above), since that decision was not open to appeal. on 29 february 2008 the district court released the applicant on bail. and i. had complained on 28 december 2007 to the police that that they had been threatened by individuals unknown to them. on 16 april 2008 the district court sentenced the applicant to five years’ imprisonment for taking a bribe. on 24 june 2008 the kherson regional court of appeal upheld the district court’s judgment. the applicant served his sentence at dariyivska correctional colony no. according to the applicant, there were up to ninety inmates in the living quarters. the washing facilities were situated in the basement, which was constantly flooded by underground water. there were five basins and three taps for 300 detainees. there was no electricity or light at night. the food was of a very low quality and the water was undrinkable. according to the government, the applicant was held in a block which measured 271.7 square metres and was designed to accommodate up to ninety prisoners, thus each prisoner had no less than 3 square metres of personal space.
is a romanian company whose registered office is in timişoara. on 12 december 2008 the timişoara finance inspectorate (hereinafter, “the t.f.i.”) instituted enforcement proceedings against the applicant company on the grounds that it had an outstanding tax liability for the year 2008 amounting to 237,128 romanian lei (ron). the applicant company, represented by its appointed lawyer, mr. p. sălăjan, challenged before the timişoara district court the t.f.i. ’s decision to open enforcement proceedings. it claimed that it had no outstanding fiscal debts and submitted documentary evidence in this respect. at the first hearing in the proceedings the t.f.i. acknowledged that the applicant company had no outstanding tax liability and that the enforcement proceedings had been instituted in error. invoking article 275 of the romanian code of the civil procedure (hereinafter, “the ccp” – see paragraph 15 below), it also contended that as it had acknowledged its error at the first hearing in the proceedings it should not be ordered to pay the costs and expenses incurred by the applicant company. by a judgment of 16 february 2009 the timişoara district court allowed the applicant company’s challenge concerning the t.f.i. ’s decision to open enforcement proceedings and ordered the t.f.i. to pay the applicant ron 9,893; this sum represented respectively the fees of the applicant company’s lawyer (9,700 ron), stamp duty and trial tax (193 ron). had acknowledged its error at the first hearing it could not be exonerated from the payment of the costs and expenses incurred by the applicant company, as the challenge proceedings were the result of a mistake on its part. had started enforcement proceedings against the applicant company for a non-existent debt and that the latter had accordingly had to hire a lawyer and pay the trial fees in order to defend itself. the court also noted that the applicant company had submitted evidence to support its request for the reimbursement of the expenses it had incurred. lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of 16 february 2009. it claimed that the first-instance court had not observed the principle of adversarial proceedings and of equality of arms, as it had not had the opportunity to challenge the amount paid by the applicant company in lawyer’s fees, which in its opinion were too high. by a final judgment of 12 august 2009 the timiş county court dismissed the appeal as unfounded. while holding that the lawyer’s fees corresponded to his input in the case, the court reiterated that the judge was entitled to increase or to reduce a lawyer’s fees, according the specific criteria set out by article 274 of the ccp (see paragraph 15 below). the court thus concluded that the judgment given by the timişoara district court was lawful and well-founded; it further awarded the applicant company the amount of 7,596 ron in legal costs in respect of the appeal proceedings. lodged with the timiş county court an application for the judgment of 12 august 2009 to be set aside (contestaţie în anulare – see paragraph 14 below) on the grounds that the county court had not examined all the arguments that it had raised in its appeal on points of law; the t.f.i. referred in particular to the fact that before the timişoara district court they were not given the possibility to bring their arguments concerning the amount requested by the applicant company and then awarded in legal costs and expenses by the first-instance court. in a final judgment of 19 february 2010 the timiş county court, sitting in a different formation from that of 12 august 2009, allowed the request: it set aside the judgment of 12 august 2009 (see paragraph 10 above) and allowed the appeal lodged by the t.f.i. against the judgment of 16 february 2009 (see paragraph 8 above), which it partly amended. the county court held that the appellate court had not examined the arguments raised by the defendant in their appeal on points of law in relation to the manner in which the first instance court applied article 274 § 3 of the ccp (see paragraph 15 below); in particular, the first instance court had not allowed the parties to bring their arguments concerning the amount of the legal costs requested by the applicant company. such an omission was sufficient, in the county court’s view, to justify the quashing of the previous judgments. the county court then re-examined the amount paid by the applicant company in lawyer’s fees and considered that in relation to the lawyer’s input in the case, it was justified to reduce that amount from ron 9700 to ron 700. it also considered that the stamp duty and trial tax in the amount of 193 ron were not to be granted to the applicant company, in so far as this amount could be requested separately from the fiscal authorities, based on the law no. 146/1997 on stamp duty, as a consequence of the fact that the challenge to the enforcement had been allowed.

the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in kiev, ukraine. he was not wearing any distinctive clothing or insignia to designate him as a journalist. one of the police officers spotted him taking pictures and ordered him to switch off the camera. according to the applicant, he complied and no further order was given to him; he did not show any resistance to the police. in his observations before the court the applicant said that he had presented his press-card issued by the international federation of journalists, and explained his presence at the venue. despite several warnings, he refused, grabbed their uniforms, behaved defiantly and shouted. he was then taken to the police vehicle by force. according to the record, the applicant was not subjected to the procedure involving a personal search or an examination of his belongings. according to the government, when the applicant was arrested and held in the police station, he was in possession of an immigration card indicating “a private visit” to mr t. residing in moscow as the aim of his presence in russia, as well as photocopies of his ukrainian passport and shengen visa. the government pointed out, in this connection, that the administrative case file contained no photocopies of any document confirming the applicant’s status as a professional journalist. apparently, the applicant managed to contact a lawyer. in the applicant’s submission, the lawyer arrived at the police station at 9.15 a.m. but was not allowed to see him until 2 p.m. 16. at around that time, the applicant was allowed access to the administrative-offence record. despite repeated and lawful orders to cease unlawful actions, [the applicant] refused. physical force had to be used against him to make him get into the vehicle.” the record also had the following pre-typed line with added handwritten text:
“witnesses, attesting witnesses, victims: bo., [ at around 8.30 p.m. the applicant was brought before a justice of the peace. he was accused of disobeying two orders from the police: (i) to cease his participation in the non-authorised demonstration; and (ii) to get, “voluntarily”, into the police vehicle, as stated in the judgment of the justice of the peace. the applicant’s lawyer pointed out that the second record drawn up by the police was substantially different from the initial one. his efforts to have it admitted to the file, however, were unsuccessful. according to the government, the applicant made no request to have the arresting officers examined at the trial. the applicant was held in a police cell for a night and then transferred to a special detention facility to serve the sentence. if i did so unknowingly, i am sorry about that. on the same day i was sentenced to three days’ detention. i ask the appeal court, when examining my appeal, to grant it as regards my release. on 18 july 2006 the applicant was visited by an official from the ukrainian consulate and signed a document authorising the consul to represent him on appeal. the appeal court indicated that its decision was “subject to immediate enforcement”. the applicant sought a supervisory review of the judgments before the city court. he argued, inter alia, that he had been refused an opportunity to examine the arresting officers whose pre-trial reports had constituted the main adverse evidence. on 13 november 2006 the deputy president of the city court upheld the conviction in a summary manner.
on 28 february 1996 the applicants and the debtor (jsp “tara” cetinje) reached a court approved settlement before the cetinje municipal court, whereby the debtor undertook to pay the applicants specified amounts in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. the settlement became final on the same date. the debtor ultimately paid part of the amounts determined in the settlement. on 26 may 1997 the podgorica commercial court opened insolvency proceedings against the debtor. on 19 august 1997 the applicants submitted their respective claims based on the settlement. in the course of the insolvency proceedings the podgorica commercial court acknowledged the applicants’ claims. on 23 december 2009 the podgorica commercial court terminated (zaključio) the insolvency proceedings against the debtor, but continued the proceedings against the debtor’s estate. this decision was upheld by the appellate court on 9 april 2010. on 14 october 2010 the constitutional court dismissed the applicants’ constitutional appeal on procedural grounds. the court settlement in question remains partly unenforced to the present day. it transpires from the case file that at the time the court settlement was concluded and became final (see paragraphs 4 and 5 above) the debtor was a company predominantly comprised of state‑controlled capital. the government neither contested this nor provided any evidence to the contrary.
the applicant was born in 1992 and lives in tver. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. on 7 may 2009 the applicant and his classmate a. were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily injuries to a boy from their school. the applicant was initially released under parental supervision, whilst a. was remanded in custody. the following day they retracted their confessions. on 16 november 2009, after the investigator had reclassified their actions as a more serious offence, the zavolzhskiy district court in tver ordered the applicant’s placement in custody, citing the gravity of the charges and the fact that he had recanted. the district court interpreted the latter element as amounting to the risk of an obstruction of justice. on 11 december 2009 the tver regional court upheld the detention order on appeal, finding as follows:
“[the fact that the defendant] has a permanent place of residence, lives with his family, is studying in high school and does not have a criminal record does not provide a basis for rejecting unconditionally the investigator’s application [for a detention order] in the light of the extreme gravity of the charges.” on 12 january 2010 the district court extended the authorised detention period, pointing out that the applicant “had changed his attitude to the committed offence from an outright acknowledgement to a downright denial”. in the court’s opinion, that implied that the applicant might interfere with justice if released. the district court also added that the custodial measure was necessary “to secure the enforcement of the conviction”. on 3 february 2010 the regional court upheld the district court’s assessment on appeal, in particular its finding that a non-custodial measure would not be sufficient to secure the enforcement of the conviction. on 20 january 2010 the investigator in charge of the applicant’s case refused the parents’ request for leave to visit their son, reasoning as follows:
“the investigation appointed mr v. smirnov, the father of mr a. smirnov, as the legal representative of the underage defendant. however, the investigation considers that mr v. smirnov is using all means to interfere with the criminal proceedings because of his vested interests; he has not responded when summonsed by the investigator or court, and is causing all kinds of delays in the proceedings. the investigation considers that this kind of conduct on the part of mr v. smirnov may have a negative influence of the defendant mr a. smirnov, as well as interfering with the establishment of the truth in the criminal case.” on 25 january 2010 the supervising prosecutor rejected a complaint from the applicant’s father about the investigator’s decision, recalling that the granting of leave to visit a detainee was at the investigator’s discretion rather than being a legal obligation and that the arguments for refusing leave were “persuasive and well-justified”. on 3 february 2010 the district court issued a further extension order, holding that the applicant had been charged with a particularly serious offence and that the circumstances warranting the application of a custodial measure still obtained. on 19 february 2010 the regional court upheld the order on appeal. the final extension order of 11 march 2010 referred to the gravity of the charges against both co-defendants, without distinguishing between their individual situations. by a judgment of 25 march 2010, the regional court found the applicant and his co-defendant guilty of attempted murder and sentenced each of them to five years’ imprisonment. on 9 june 2010 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the conviction. between november 2009 and july 2010 the applicant’s parents visited him in prison a total of sixteen times. all visits were carried out under the supervision of a warden while the applicant was separated from his parents by a glass partition.
the applicants were born in 1987 and 1986 and live in gümüşhane and erzincan respectively. on 18 may 2007 the applicants participated in reading out a press statement in commemoration of i̇brahim kaypakkaya, the leader of the tkp/ml[1] (turkish communist party – marxist/leninist), who had died in 1973, allegedly under torture in police custody. on 7 january 2008 the erzurum public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against fifteen people, including the applicants, charging them with disseminating propaganda in favour of the tkp/ml, under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. according to the indictment, during the gathering, the second applicant had read out a press declaration containing statements praising the tkp/ml and i̇brahim kaypakkaya, and the following slogans had been chanted by the demonstrators: “i̇brahim is our leader”, “our struggle continues and shall continue”, “i̇brahim kaypakkaya is immortal”, “down with the usa” and “we will drown fascism in the blood it has shed”. the group had also carried a banner which read “i̇brahim kaypakkaya is immortal – partizan”[2]. on 31 march 2009 the erzurum assize court found the applicants guilty as charged and sentenced each of them to ten months’ imprisonment pursuant to section 7(2) of law no. in its judgment, the assize court held that the applicants had disseminated propaganda in favour of the tkp/ml, given that the second applicant had read out the press statement and the first applicant had chanted slogans. the court based its judgment on a report prepared by an expert regarding a police video-recording of the public gathering in question. taking into account the applicants’ good behaviour during the trial and the fact that they had no previous criminal convictions, the court suspended pronouncement of the applicants’ conviction on the condition that they did not commit another intentional offence for a period of five years, under article 231 of the code of criminal procedure (hükmün açıklanmasının geri bırakılması). the applicants filed an objection against the decision of 31 march 2009. in their petition, they stated that the first-instance court had erred in interpreting the facts and the law, and they asked to be acquitted of the charges against them. they further stated that their prosecution had constituted a breach of article 10 of the convention. on 20 july 2009 the diyarbakır assize court held that the application of article 231 of the code of criminal procedure in the case was in line with the domestic law, and rejected the applicants’ objection without examining the merits of the case. that decision was served on the applicants on 5 august 2009.
the applicant was born in 1983 and lives in krasnodar. the applicant had a press card issued to him as a photographer, stating that he was a “correspondent at agency.photographer.ru”. according to the applicant’s submissions, he also prepared various texts for publication in print and internet media outlets on an occasional basis. on 27 august 2009 they returned to russia, arriving on foot at the adler customs checkpoint. the laptop was his own property, however, he also used it for professional purposes. the applicant and d. were examined by officer k. in his report to his superior, drawn up at 10.40 a.m. on 27 august 2009, he stated that in view of the applicant’s answers to questions and because of his behaviour, neither of which have been specified to the court, there was a need to verify the information contained in the applicant’s customs declaration by way of an “inspection procedure” (see paragraph 31 below) in respect of the items in his bag and backpack and to “apply the measure for minimising risk as per profile no. i did not read any ‘correspondence’ (personal correspondence or other text material) from the laptop.” the folder contained seven subfolders and 180 files. the applicant made a note in the record, stating that the material had been copied onto rewritable dvd disks (thus technically allowing the data to be modified, including by way of adding data). the article, written by ms v., was published in the russian reporter magazine in june 2009 and was accompanied by photographs taken by the applicant. according to the applicant, the material that was copied included documents and text concerning two ethnic groups (the yazidis and the meskhetian turks), who were allegedly under pressure from the krasnodar regional administration. it appears that the data from the laptop was first copied to a mobile or external hard drive and then recopied to six dvds. according to the government, the information was then deleted from the external hard drive. the original data in the laptop was not deleted and remained intact. in november 2009 the expert organisation returned the dvds to the customs office, stating that it was not possible to carry out the examination, although it gave no reasons. in december 2009 a report was sought from another expert organisation. apparently, it concluded that the data contained no extremist material. according to the applicant, the dvds with his data were handed over to him in november 2011. by a judgment of 25 january 2010 the prikubanskiy district court of krasnodar dismissed his claims. 310 was not possible without actually reading someone’s correspondence and other personal information, thereby interfering with the constitutional right to the protection of the secrecy of correspondence and other communications. according to the applicant, the customs authority representative had refused at the hearing to explain the specific content of the risk profile concerning the applicant, referring to the fact that the information in question was classified and was for internal use only. this includes laptops, memory flash cards, photo-cameras, video-cameras, printed material and the like. article 14 of the code provides that all such goods should be subject to customs clearance and customs control. article 123 of the code provides that goods should be declared when being transferred across the customs border. by a letter of 16 july 2008 the federal customs authority listed the goods which are banned from russian territory ... by a letter of 3 may 2006 the authority listed the goods that must be declared to customs. article 358 of the code provides that customs checks are based on the principle of selectiveness and, as a rule, should be limited to such forms of control as are sufficient for ensuring compliance with customs legislation ... when selecting the form of control, the risk management approach is applied, which is based on the effective use of resources for preventing violations of the legislation ... risk is defined as a probability of non-compliance with customs legislation. when carrying out a customs check, the customs authority is allowed to take samples of goods which are needed for further assessment. when carrying out a customs check, the authority is allowed to use technical means to limit the time of such checks; the list and procedures for their use are defined in article 388 of the code and in customs authority order no. 310 of 23 march 1995 ... article 2 of the decree clearly requires the customs authority to ‘arrest and bring to liability persons who disseminate printed, cinematographic, audio-, photo- or video-materials which are aimed at being propaganda in favour of fascism, at inciting social, racial, ethnic or religious enmity; and to take measures for seizing printed material of that kind’ ...
article 383 of the code concerning the minimal amount of samples was complied with because the information taken for sampling was not homogenous. thus when the samples were taken, it was necessary to take the full amount of information from the device ...
in addition, it is noted that under article 10 of the customs code, information received by customs officials may be used exclusively for the purposes of customs legislation ...
customs officials are not authorised to disclose that information or transfer it to third persons, except as set down in the code or other legislation ...” 24.
since 2002, following their ancestors’ demise, the applicants have been the holders of the utile dominium (by way of sub-emphyteusis which expires in 2047) of a portion of land in zabbar, malta. the directum dominus (direct owner) is the state. the applicants’ ancestors acquired the utile dominium of the property also through inheritance from a certain x. who had held the property under title of temporary sub-emphyteusis of 150 years. on the said property there was a shop which was rented out to third parties as a snack bar. by a governor’s declaration of 7 may 1965 published in the government gazette on 14 may 1965 (no. m. (including the shop of an area of approximately 50 sq. however, in 1972 changes were made to the plan (pjan regolatur). specifically it was decided to reposition the road which had to be built on the part of the land on which the shop had stood. thus, it was decided that on that plot of land which adjoined another larger plot of land (not owned by the applicants), a new shop would be built at the government’s expense in order to serve the square and the civic centre, as well as government offices and for use as a bus terminus. the civic centre at that time hosted the zabbar local council, a social-security office, a police station, a post office, a snack bar, a butcher’s shop, a draper’s shop, a beauty parlour and a grocer’s shop. the remaining small area of land, belonging to the applicants’ ancestors, which had been taken but not used, was returned to them in 1988. extra-judicial requests to obtain the return of the property used for the purposes of the snack bar were to no avail. pending the constitutional-redress proceedings (below), on 13 april 2010 the commissioner of land (hereinafter “the commissioner”) extended the lease in favour of the third party until 31 january 2020, at a rent of approximately 2,100 euros (eur) per year. in 2010 the bus terminus was moved as a result of changes in the transport system. on 2 march 2010 the applicants instituted constitutional redress proceedings. they complained that they had suffered a breach of article 1 of protocol no. 1 to the convention, in so far as their land had not been taken in the public interest, and of article 6 of the convention, as well as the corresponding provisions of the constitution of malta. by a judgment of 26 june 2012 the civil court (first hall), in its constitutional jurisdiction, upheld the applicants’ claims. pursuant to the ordinance as amended, it was still for the commissioner to make an offer. it was open, however, for the receivers of the offer, if they disagreed, to institute proceedings to challenge the offer before the lab. the same applied concerning their complaint of a lack of public interest despite amendments to the law in 2009 (act xxv of 2009) ‑ which had introduced the possibility of challenging the public interest of an expropriation before the lab, within twenty-one days of the declaration – in the court’s view it was unlikely that an individual would be able to challenge a public interest which had not been mentioned in the declaration. it had solely and intrinsically served private interests, specifically those of the third parties who had been leasing the property merely for commercial purposes, irrespective of the fact that the snack bar had been regularly used by bus drivers. furthermore, the applicants had received no compensation in forty-five years, and the offer made to them in 2010 (solely after constitutional redress proceedings had been commenced) had been based on a valuation from 2005. the court annulled the governor’s declaration of 7 may 1965 and the president’s declaration of 6 october 2010 as well as any other action, affecting the property, taken by the defendant pending the proceedings. the defendants appealed, arguing that there was a public interest and challenging the award of compensation and the return order. by a judgment of 26 april 2013 the constitutional court allowed the appeal in part and quashed the first-instance judgment in part. in particular they had received no compensation whatsoever for the part of the property taken and not used, which had been returned to them only after twenty-three years, and in respect of the remaining part which was used, the applicants were still awaiting compensation. thus, without prejudice to any such claim for pecuniary compensation in respect of the property taken and the relative interest, the constitutional court awarded eur 10,000 in non‑pecuniary damages for the violation suffered, bearing in mind that the value of the property was eur 13,000, and it annulled the return order for the property. as the applicants refused to collect the award made by the constitutional court, in january 2014 the commissioner deposited the award in court by means of a schedule of deposit. on 3 september 2015 the government sent the applicants a letter reminding them to send evidence concerning their title in connection with the president’s declaration of 6 october 2010.
the applicant was born in 1984 and lives in gebze. the police initiated an investigation into the matter to find the perpetrators. on 20 august 2002 the applicant, a minor at the time, was brought to the police headquarters, where he was searched. following the search, he went through a medical examination. the report drawn up after that examination noted that he did not have any complaints and that there were no signs of injury on his body. the search records prepared by the police noted that the applicant was suspected of having committed the crime. at around 11 p.m. the applicant was brought to the police headquarters once again, together with some others. the applicant and the others were all released after their questioning. on 26 august 2002 the applicant turned eighteen years of age. on 20 september 2002 the applicant was questioned by the police once again. in the absence of a lawyer, he submitted that he had known h.a. as the grandmother of one of his friends and that when he had heard of the murder, he had speculated with his friends that she could have been killed for the jewellery she wore. subsequently, the applicant, other members of his family and his friend a.s. the medical report concerning the applicant noted no signs of injury. he went on to describe in detail how he had disposed of the body and showed the police the pushcart he had used to that effect. according to the police records bearing the applicant’s signature, the applicant did not benefit from the assistance of a lawyer during the reconstruction of events and was not informed of his rights to request legal assistance and to remain silent. on 13 october 2002, at the end of the applicant’s police custody, another medical report was drawn up, again indicating no signs of ill‑treatment on his body. he argued, however, that electric shocks had been administered to him through his penis and small toe during his time in police custody. he was subsequently placed in detention on remand. he requested that the appointed lawyer who had been present during his questioning by the public prosecutor and the investigating judge be heard as a witness. on 16 october 2003 the gebze assize court held that it lacked jurisdiction and forwarded the case to the kocaeli juvenile court as the applicant had been a minor at the time of the murder. during the course of the thirteen hearings before it, the assize court obtained a report from the istanbul forensics institute and heard all the police officers involved in the applicant’s questioning. nevertheless, it re-examined and accepted the applicant’s request to have the appointed lawyer heard. the court also heard a number of other witnesses, including his friend a.s., in his submissions before the juvenile court, the applicant maintained that he had not been assigned a lawyer while in police custody and claimed that he had been coerced into making a false confession although he had not committed the murder. on 31 may 2004 the juvenile court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to twenty-six years and eight months’ imprisonment. and the bank transcripts which rebutted his defence with regard to the money he had spent after the murder. reiterating his submissions with regard to his alleged ill-treatment, he maintained that he had not been assigned a lawyer while in police custody although he had requested one. on 27 july 2005 the juvenile court sentenced the applicant to a total of twenty-one years’ imprisonment. that judgment was upheld by the court of cassation on 19 july 2007.

the applicant company is a limited liability company and is the owner of the greek television channel alpha. on 24 january 2002, alpha broadcast a television show named “jungle” (ζούγκλα) in which three videos that had been filmed with a hidden camera were broadcast. the second video showed a meeting between a.c. and associates of the television host of “jungle”, m.t., during which the first video was shown to a.c. on 23 may 2002 the national radio and television council (εθνικό συμβούλιο ραδιοτηλεόρασης), following an invitation to the applicant company, held a hearing in which the applicant company was represented by its attorneys. they argued that such use had been justified owing to a.c. ’s being dismissed from the parliamentary group of the political party for which he had been elected as parliamentary deputy. they furthermore stressed that nobody would ever forbid journalists to report on a certain issue; however the means used raised an issue, as the use of hidden camera could be accepted only in respect of a national security issue or for the prevention of a serious crime or other similar situations. by its decision 214/162/23.05.2002, the national radio and television council ordered the applicant company to pay one hundred thousand (100,000) euros (eur) for each of the two television shows during which the above-mentioned videos were shown, as well as to broadcast on three days in a row on its main news show the content of that decision. on 10 june 2002 the decision of the national radio and television council was communicated to the minister of press and media, who, after examining its legality, issued decision no 3156/e/11.02.2003 confirming its content. on 23 january 2006 the president of the supreme administrative court referred the case to the plenary supreme administrative court owing to its high importance. 1213/2010, published on 16 april 2010 and finalised on 21 may 2010 (δημοσίευση και καθαρογραφή), the supreme administrative court dismissed the application for annulment. 59320/00, echr 2004‑vi; schüssel v. austria (dec.), 42409/98, 21 february 2002; and sciacca v. italy, no. it continued by noting that under article 15 of the constitution the state has the legal duty to exercise control over the radio and television in order to ensure respect for human values and that sanctions imposed by the national radio and television council served that purpose. the supreme administrative court laid down the conditions under which it is legitimate to broadcast an image that has been filmed with the method of hidden camera, by making a distinction between reporting on specific news, whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret means, and the broadcasting of the relevant, secretly recorded image. however, even when broadcasting of the news is considered a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information, this does not automatically render legitimate the broadcasting of the relevant, secretly recorded images, as that constitutes a much more intense [έντονος] limitation of the constitutionally protected right of that person to his own image than the simple transmission of news. the domestic court stressed that from the text of the decision and from the minutes of the meeting of the national radio and television council it derived that the sanction was imposed to the applicant company solely and exclusively on account of the broadcast of the images that had been recorded by hidden means and not on account of the transmission of the news, whose source had been the secretly recorded images. as far as the broadcasting of the images was concerned, the applicant company had not disputed that the images had been recorded by secret means and had not claimed that broadcasting of the news was absolutely impossible or extremely difficult without broadcasting the relevant images. for those reasons, the judges who supported this opinion considered that the application for annulment should be dismissed. in addition, there were two dissenting opinions. therefore, the application for annulment should have been allowed, given that the national radio and television council’s decision had been based solely on the fact that the image of a.c. lastly, according to the other dissenting opinion, no constitutional provision justified the absolute protection of an image (as was held by the majority). a person’s right to his own image was susceptible to limitations that varied according to that person’s position and the space in which the recording in question had taken place. for public figures, however, protection was less absolute. in particular, public figures, such as politicians, were exposed to publicity and sometimes they even pursued it. as a result, there was a legitimate expectation on the part of the media and of the public to impart and receive information regarding their public activities. for these persons, there was an absolute protection of their image in their private space and in public spaces in which they shared private or family moments. when, however, public figures were in public spaces but not under the conditions described above, or acted in a way that was of interest to the public (such as in cases in which they engaged in behaviour contrary to what their public role entailed or contrary to the image they projected towards the public), then the right to receive and impart information could justify the recording of that person without his consent and the broadcasting of the relevant images by the media.
the applicant was born in 1958 and lives in louvencourt. he was hired in 1976 by the french national railway company (société nationale des chemins de fer – “the sncf”), where he last worked as deputy head of the amiens regional surveillance unit. he stated that in 2007 he had complained to senior management about the conduct of one of his subordinates, who, he alleged, had used extreme language when addressing a colleague. the employee in question had then filed a complaint against him, following which the applicant had been charged with making false accusations. the applicant had subsequently been suspended from duty by the sncf on grounds of that charge. the proceedings were discontinued a few months later, whereupon the applicant notified his employers of his wish to be reinstated in his former post. he received a reply inviting him to consider appointment to another post, but maintained his original request. on the day of his reinstatement, on 17 march 2008, the applicant found that his work computer had been seized. after being summoned by his superiors, he was informed on 5 april 2008 that the hard disk on the computer had been analysed and that “address change certificates drawn up for third persons and bearing the lille general security service logo” had been found, as well as a large number of files containing pornographic images and films. it can be seen from the judgment of the amiens court of appeal of 15 december 2010 (see paragraphs 14-15 below) that the person who had replaced the applicant during his suspension from post had found “documents which had caught his attention” on the computer, and that he had alerted his superiors in march 2007 and january 2008. a request for a written explanation was sent to the applicant on 7 may 2008. he added that the files containing pornographic material had been sent to him by people he did not know, via the sncf’s intranet. the applicant was summoned to a disciplinary hearing, which took place on 21 may 2008. on 17 july 2008 the sncf regional director decided to dismiss the applicant from the service. his decision was worded as follows:
“ ... the analysis of the files stored on the hard disk of [the applicant’s] work computer, used for his professional duties, contained the following:
i) change of address certificate, signed in his name, certifying the transfer on 01/11/2003 of ms catherine [t.] to the lille general security service; the original certificate, sent to icf north-east enabled the notice period for vacating her flat to be shortened;
ii) change of address certificate, bearing the ministry of justice logo, in the name of m. [s.-j.], on 10 may 2010 the industrial tribunal held that the decision dismissing the applicant from the service had been justified and, accordingly, rejected his claims. on 15 december 2010 the amiens court of appeal upheld the substance of that judgment. the sncf explained, without being challenged, that the “d” drive was called “d:/data” by default and was traditionally used by staff to store their work documents. an employee cannot use an entire hard disk, which is supposed to record professional data, for his or her private use. in any event, the generic term “personal data” could have referred to work files being personally processed by the employee and did not therefore explicitly designate elements relating to his private life. the term can denote exchanges between colleagues at work or work documents kept as “bloopers” by the employee. the employer also rightly pointed out that the user’s charter provided that “private information [had to] be clearly identified as such (“private” option in the outlook criteria)” and that the same was true of the media receiving that information (“private” folder). the lower court was therefore correct in considering that the file had not been identified as personal. the court of appeal also held that the applicant’s dismissal from the service had not been disproportionate. it observed that both the sncf’s code of professional conduct and the internal rules provided that staff were required to use the computers provided to them for exclusively professional ends, with the occasional private use being merely tolerated. it found that the applicant had committed a “massive breach of those rules, going as far as using his work tools to produce a forged document”. in the court’s view, those acts had been particularly serious because, as an official responsible for general surveillance, he would have been expected to be of exemplary conduct. he submitted, in particular, that there had been a violation of article 8 of the convention. the social division of the court of cassation dismissed the appeal in a judgment of 4 july 2012. the court of appeal, which found that labelling the hard disk in the employee’s computer “d:/ personal data” could not enable him to use it for purely private purposes and prohibit access by the employer, drew the legitimate conclusion that the files in question, which had not been identified as “private” according to the recommendations of the it charter, could be lawfully opened by the employer.
the applicant was born in 1961 and lives in bijela, montenegro. on 1 march 2012 the herceg novi first instance court rendered a judgment in favour of the applicant and ordered the applicant’s employer “vektra boka” ad herceg novi (hereinafter “the debtor”) to carry out a re‑allocation of plots for the construction of apartments. this judgment became final on 21 december 2012. on 15 january 2013 the applicant requested enforcement of the above judgment and the herceg novi first instance court issued an enforcement order on 31 january 2013. on 12 june 2015 the commercial court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor. on 28 january 2016 the herceg novi first instance court transferred the case to the commercial court for further action. on 22 march 2016 the commercial court suspended (obustavio) the enforcement due to the opening of the insolvency proceedings, which decision became final on 11 may 2016. the judgement in question remains unenforced to the present day. on 8 february 2013 the applicant instituted administrative proceedings seeking, on the basis of the above judgment, the removal of competing titles from the land register. on 29 july 2015 the real estate directorate terminated (prekinuo) the administrative proceedings because the commercial court had commenced insolvency proceeding in respect of the debtor. on 7 september 2015 the applicant submitted an objection against the above decision. this objection was rejected as being out of time by the real estate directorate on 5 october 2015. the administrative proceedings are still pending. on an unspecified day in 2003, the applicant instituted separate civil proceedings against the debtor, as his former employer, seeking reinstatement and damages. following three remittals, on 3 march 2014 the herceg novi first instance court rendered a judgment in the applicant’s favour. on 22 september 2015 the high court upheld this judgment on the merits, but quashed it as regards the costs. on 31 october 2016 the herceg novi first instance court transferred the case to the commercial court for further action due to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor. on 22 february 2017 the commercial court ruled partly in favour of the applicant regarding the costs. the parties did not inform the court about when the commercial court’s decision became final and was served on the applicant.
the applicant was born in 1932 and lives in siġġiewi. the property was requisitioned in 1955 by means of a requisition order. the premises were then allocated to the san leonard band club in kirkop (hereinafter “the band club”). the owners of the property never recognised the tenant or accepted any rent from the club. according to a judgment of 1 february 1958 of the civil court (first hall) in its ordinary jurisdiction, the owners were entitled to do so because the tenement had not been leased as a dwelling, and thus greater risks were involved. in the years that followed rent was paid to the owners by the competent authority (then the director of social housing, today the housing authority). the annual rent payable amounted to 30 maltese lira (mtl – approximately 70 euros (eur)), less than eur 6 per month. the government did not refer to the different address, arguing as though the valuation referred to the property at issue in the present case. moreover, in their view the property was in a good state of repair and the alterations had increased its value. the government submitted that these were unsubstantiated allegations, which had not been proved before the domestic courts. the applicant and her brothers also owned a property (18 st. they also requested compensation for the damage allegedly sustained. in a judgment of 9 october 1991 the civil court (first hall) in its ordinary jurisdiction rejected the plaintiffs’ claim. the owners appealed against that decision. in a judgment of 30 december 1993 the court of appeal declared the requisition order null and void and ordered that the appellants be given possession of the premises within six months. in a judgment of 31 may 2005 the court of appeal rejected a request for a new trial submitted by the band club. this judgment was upheld by the court of appeal on 27 february 2009. the defendants, the director of social accommodation, the attorney general and the band club, argued that no such violations had occurred. moreover, the measure had not been proportionate. according to the court, the applicant had also suffered a violation of article 14, as only her property had been requisitioned for the use of the band club. in determining the amount of compensation, the court did not take into account the fact that the applicant or her ancestors had received rent, given that the amount was derisory. bearing in mind the values established by the applicant’s expert as to the rental value and sale value of the property, which was mtl 180,000 (approximately eur 420,000) (pg.12 of the judgment), as well as the length of time the requisition was and remained in place, the court awarded the applicant eur 60,000 in compensation (kumpens) for the requisition of the premises and the violations found, noting it was not awarding civil damages (danni ċivili) in this context. three quarters of the amount was to be paid by the director of social housing and one quarter by the band club. it further contested the order to vacate the property. the attorney general and the director of social accommodation also appealed, in particular in relation to the findings of a lack of public interest, a violation of article 14 and the redress awarded. by a judgment of 25 may 2012 the constitutional court upheld the first-instance judgment in part. 1 only in so far as the requisition had been disproportionate. as to the redress, the constitutional court revoked the order for the club to vacate the premises. considering that the violation of article 1 of protocol no. 1 was a consequence of the lack of a fair balance between the interests of the landlord and those of the tenant, and given that the validity of the lease was not at issue in the present case, it did not seem appropriate for it to evict the tenant; it sufficed that that unfair balance be redressed.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in bucharest. at the material time the applicant was the executive chair of the partidul verde ecological party, a political movement affiliated with the european green party. partidul verde had put up candidates for the 2008 general elections but failed to win any seats. he won about 60,000 votes, or some 0.6 % of the total validly cast votes. the 2008 general elections had been governed by law no. 35/2008 on elections to the chamber of deputies and the senate, amending law no. 67/2004 on local authority elections, law no. 215/2001 on local public authorities and law no. that amendment made it impossible for parties not represented in parliament, as well as independent candidates, to put up candidates for or stand in parliamentary by-elections. parliamentary by-elections were scheduled for 17 january 2010 in order to fill a vacant seat in a bucharest constituency. according to information available to the court, that seat had fallen vacant in october 2009. on 29 december 2009 the electoral board rejected the candidacy on the grounds that partidul verde was not represented in parliament. partidul verde, represented by the applicant, challenged that rejection before bucharest county court (“the county court”) and requested the acceptance of the applicant’s candidacy. the party added that, contrary to the recommendations of the european commission for democracy through law (“the venice commission”; see paragraphs 20 and 21 below), law no. 35/2008 had been amended less than one year before the by-elections. by interlocutory decision of 30 december 2009 the county court deferred its ruling so that the constitutional court could consider the objection of unconstitutionality. 61/2010 of 14 january 2010, the constitutional court dismissed the objection of unconstitutionality. having reiterated that parliament’s political structure was defined by general elections, the constitutional court rejected partidul verde’s arguments as follows:
“the [constitutional] court observes that the reason for the holding of the parliamentary by-elections was the fact that a parliamentary seat had fallen vacant. such by-elections are held in order to assign seats in parliament while simultaneously respecting the structure of parliament as it emerged from the latest general elections. in order to respect the sovereignty and the will of the electorate as expressed in the framework of general elections, it is necessary that the by-election stage, which is subsidiary and complementary to the general elections, should observe the electoral threshold criterion which allows political parties to be represented in parliament. the county court further noted that the elections had already been held and that the challenge had therefore become devoid of purpose. fresh parliamentary by-elections were scheduled for 25 april 2010 in bucharest to fill another vacant seat. the applicant stood as an independent candidate. his candidacy was rejected by the electoral board pursuant to section 48 (17) of law no. the applicant appealed to the county court against the rejection of his candidacy, and lodged a fresh objection of unconstitutionality. 61 of 14 january 2010 set out the reasons justifying, in the light of constitutional standards, the elimination of such parties from by-elections, as regards independent candidates no reason was given for subjecting them to the same legal treatment. thus the electoral threshold means that political parties must be representative, to some extent, of the electorate, as required by the sovereignty principle. ...
in conclusion, the electoral law may specify the conditions in which an individual may stand for election as an independent (financial deposit, a specific number of supporters, etc.), but it can in no way exclude from the electoral process, in the case of by-elections, the candidacy of a person [standing as an] independent candidate without thereby infringing the fundamental right enshrined in article 37 of the constitution – the right to be elected.” the applicant stood in the 2012 general elections and obtained a seat in the chamber of deputies for a four-year mandate.
on 25 april 1999 the applicant was arrested and placed in police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation and the murder of thirteen persons. on the same day, she underwent a medical examination. the doctor who examined the applicant noted no sign of injury on her body. on 26 april 1999 police officers at the istanbul security directorate took statements from the applicant in the absence of a lawyer. the applicant confessed that she was a member of the illegal organisation and admitted having planned an attack on a shopping centre and having acted as a lookout while other co-accused started a fire by throwing molotov cocktails at the shopping centre, killing thirteen persons in march 1999. on 27 april 1999 the applicant was required to confront with two other co-accused before the police, in the absence of a lawyer. according to the record of the confrontation she admitted having carried out the attack on the shopping centre with those two and another co-accused. on the same day an identification parade took place at the istanbul security directorate, in the absence of a lawyer, where one of the eyewitnesses of the incident identified the applicant in front of police officers and the public prosecutor at the state security court. on the same day the applicant was also required to participate in a reconstruction of the events (yer gösterme). according to the record drafted by police officers and signed by the applicant, the applicant described in detail what steps she had taken before the attack on the shopping centre and indicated how she had acted as a lookout while the other co-accused threw molotov cocktails in the shopping centre. on 30 april 1999 the applicant was seen by a doctor at the forensic medicine institution who noted in his report that the applicant bore no traces of ill-treatment. on the same day, the applicant was heard by the istanbul public prosecutor and by the investigating judge, still in the absence of a lawyer. in her statements before both the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, the applicant denied the accusations and maintained that her statements to the police had been given under duress. subsequently, the investigating judge ordered the applicant’s detention on remand. on 6 may 1999 the public prosecutor at the istanbul state security court filed an indictment with that court, and charged the applicant with carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory, pursuant to article 125 of the former criminal code. the state security courts were later abolished by law no. 5190 of 16 june 2004, and the case was transferred to the istanbul assize court. on 7 may 2007 relying on, inter alia, the applicant’s statements to the police, the istanbul assize court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced her to life imprisonment for membership of an illegal organisation and the murder of thirteen people. in delivering its judgment, the assize court further took into consideration several items of evidence, such as the applicant’s statements to the police, public prosecutor and investigating judge, video recordings and written records of the crime scene visits, autopsy reports, eyewitness identifications, and the statements given by some of the accused persons. on 7 may 2009 the court of cassation upheld the judgment of the first instance court.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in muş. on 19 april 2003 the applicant was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation. on 20 april 2003 the applicant’s statements were taken by the police in the absence of a lawyer. during the interrogation, the applicant gave a detailed account of his acts within the illegal organisation pkk (the kurdistan workers’ party). on 22 april 2003 the applicant was heard by the public prosecutor and the investigating judge at the istanbul state security court, again in the absence of a lawyer. in his statements before both the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, the applicant denied the accusations and maintained that his statements to the police had been given under duress. on the same day, upon the order of the investigating judge, the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention. on 6 may 2003 the public prosecutor at the istanbul state security court filed an indictment accusing the applicant of membership of an illegal terrorist organisation under article 168 of the former criminal code, law no. the state security courts were later abolished by law no. 5190 of 16 june 2004, and the case was transferred to the istanbul assize court. on 19 september 2006, relying on, inter alia, the applicant’s statements to the police, the istanbul assize court convicted the applicant under article 314 § 2 of the new turkish criminal code and sentenced him to six years and three months’ imprisonment. on 19 november 2007 the court of cassation quashed the judgment on procedural grounds. on 30 december 2008 the istanbul assize court convicted the applicant again under article 314 § 2 of the new turkish criminal code and sentenced him to six years and three months’ imprisonment. on 20 march 2012 the court of cassation upheld the judgment of the istanbul assize court.
she grew up in šiauliai, which in 2003, the time relevant in this case, had about 130,000 inhabitants. the applicant was distressed, did not sleep well and had a car accident. according to the applicant’s medical records and court decisions (also see paragraphs 29, 33 and 45 below), on the morning of 7 may 2003 she arrived for work as usual at the ministry of economy in vilnius. who was also a head of division at that hospital, and doctor a.g. the doctors indicated in her medical records that the applicant “did not object to being treated” at that hospital (also see paragraph 29 below). the applicant “was gradually adopting a critical attitude towards psychotic behaviour and also about ways to spend her free time. on 17 june 2003, while the applicant was still being held in vilnius psychiatric hospital, an episode of the srovės television programme was aired on the lnk national television channel. after such meditation violeta is today in a psychiatric hospital. journalist]: b. is a woman who has had a management job all her life. ... they are afraid to hurt violeta’s father. or, if [things] come to light, they portray it as completely innocent. they made statements about the destructive influence that, in their view, the ojas meditation centre had had on the applicant. the applicant concluded by noting that in july 2003 she had attended a session at the ojas meditation centre, and had finally been able to meditate and recover after nearly two months in vilnius psychiatric hospital in a hostile environment that had harmed her mind and body. in may 2006 the applicant sued vilnius psychiatric hospital for compensation for non-pecuniary damage. even then, a court order was needed within two days to keep the person in hospital. in that context, the court also had regard to the applicant’s explanation that because of the side effects of the medication (sleepiness, inability to concentrate) and the possibility of physical restraint (being tied down) in case of disobedience, she had not been able to express her disagreement about being treated at the hospital in writing. (b)  as to the applicant’s right to privacy 33. the mother also said she had contacted the ojas meditation centre in vilnius about her daughter, but had not received a constructive response. she had not known what diagnosis the psychiatric hospital had given the applicant and had only told the srovės journalists which hospital her daughter was in. the doctor testified that she had “not discussed [the applicant’s] health” with the journalists, only the ojas meditation centre and meditation as such. that conclusion was based on the applicant’s medical file, which contained the following records for 26 may and 20 and 23 june 2003: “ ... absence of a critical attitude towards attending [the ojas meditation] centre”; “during psycho-correction expressed opinion in categorical terms about attending the ojas centre, argues, that ‘it is a personal matter’”; “when efforts were made during psycho-correction to get the applicant to form a critical attitude (suformuoti kritiką) towards non-traditional religious beliefs, [the applicant] for a long time remained uncritical and also categorical”. (d)  as to the applicant’s remaining complaints 38. the vilnius regional court thus granted the applicant’s civil claim in full and awarded her 110,000 lithuanian litas (ltl, approximately 31,850 euros (eur)) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. had persistently asked about the meditation she practised and had spoken of it with contempt. the appellate court upheld the vilnius regional court’s finding that on the basis of her health on 7 may 2003 the applicant had been lawfully placed in vilnius psychiatric hospital. it was therefore clear that as of that date her treatment at the hospital and her presence there had been involuntary and also amounted to an unlawful deprivation of liberty. without a court order, the forced hospitalisation and forced treatment had to be discontinued. the court of appeal considered that the fact that the main character of the programme (laidos herojė) had studied in the united states was not sufficient to establish that the programme was about the applicant. on 17 june 2009 the applicant submitted an appeal on points of law. even though the osho teachings mentioned in the ojas meditation centre’s by-laws were called religious, meditation there was more based on esoteric doctrines of self-improvement than on a religious practice whose main feature was connecting with god, gods or other sacred forms.

the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in vilnius. had been a prominent lithuanian politician since the 1980s. the book contained the following statements (hereinafter “the disputed statements”), in which v.l.-ž. senasis [l.] ... pasakojo, kaip 1918 metais ... pilies bokšte kėlė vėliavą, ... kaip jiems po to teko nuo bolševikų bėgti į kauną, kaip pakeliui juos areštavo, tardė... (o kiek man žinoma, ir užverbavo).) on 21 october 2003 the prosecutor opened the investigation. they all stated that they did not have any information indicating that v.l.-ž. on 10 october 2005 the vilnius city first district court acquitted v.p. and the prosecutor all submitted appeals against that decision, and on 17 january 2006 the vilnius regional court quashed it. he considered that there was sufficient evidence to charge v.p. had been prominent politicians and public figures and therefore had to tolerate higher levels of criticism. at the court hearing on 9 december 2009, v.l. argued that the disputed statements amounted to statements of fact and not value judgments. in the civil proceedings up until his death. had submitted before (see paragraph 13 above). they also argued that an obligation to pay compensation for damage allegedly caused by a literary work was a personal obligation of the author and could not be transferred to his heirs. they furthermore submitted that the disputed statements had been based on their late father’s memories and subjective opinions, and so they should not be required to prove the truthfulness of those statements. on 23 december 2009 the vilnius regional court found in v.l. it stated that, in line with the domestic law, in order to uphold the claim, four circumstances had to be established: firstly, that certain statements had been disseminated; secondly, that those statements had concerned the claimant (v.l.) had to prove that the first three circumstances had existed, whereas the defendants (the applicant and her brothers) had to prove that the fourth circumstance had not (see paragraph 34 below). however, the parties disagreed as to whether they had amounted to statements of fact or to value judgments. accordingly, the court held that those statements should have had a sufficient factual basis. seeking to determine whether the disputed statements had been factually accurate, the vilnius regional court examined the evidence which had been collected in the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 8 above), as well as the sources indicated by v.p. as for the fourth statement (see paragraph 5 above), it considered that allegations of ejecting the pharmacy owners onto the streets and suing them for a wooden bench – an item of movable property of low value – had created the impression of v.l.-ž. as someone with low moral standards and a lack of respect for others, and that that statement had therefore been insulting as well, not only to v.l.-ž. accordingly, the court held that, since v.l. ’s claim for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage as time‑barred. the court of appeal also upheld the first‑instance court’s conclusion that those statements had been insulting to the honour and dignity of v.l.-ž. the applicant and her brothers submitted an appeal on points of law, presenting essentially the same arguments as before (see paragraphs 13 and 17 above). on 14 march 2011 the supreme court dismissed that appeal. it stated that the applicant and her brothers had accepted their father’s inheritance, which included certain rights to the book (see paragraph 14 above).

the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in muş. on 30 october 2001 the applicant was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the pkk (the kurdistan workers’ party). on 1 november 2001 the applicant’s statement was taken by the police in the absence of a lawyer. during his interrogation, he confessed being a member of the pkk and gave a detailed account of his acts within the illegal organisation. on 3 november 2001 the applicant was heard by the public prosecutor and the investigating judge at the istanbul state security court, again in the absence of a lawyer. in his statements before both the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, the applicant denied the accusations. on the same day, upon the order of the investigating judge, the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention. on 6 november 2001 the public prosecutor at the istanbul state security court filed an indictment with that court, charging the applicant under article 168 of the former criminal code, with membership of an illegal armed organisation. the state security courts were later abolished by law no. 5190 of 16 june 2004, and the case was transferred to the istanbul assize court. on 6 october 2006 the istanbul assize court, relying on, inter alia, the applicant’s statements to the police, convicted him of membership of an illegal organisation under article 314 § 2 of the new criminal code and sentenced him to seven years and six months’ imprisonment. on 15 december 2009 the court of cassation upheld the judgment of the first‑instance court.
the applicant was born in 1987 and is detained in tiszalök. the applicant declared that he had not been. after being transported back to budapest prison, the applicant underwent a medical examination before his readmission during which he claimed that he had been ill-treated by police officer a. certain injuries were noted on the applicant. a report was drawn up on the incident and photos were taken of the injuries. at the hospital he was examined in the presence of the police officer. the medical report noted bleeding on the lower lip, jaw sensitive to pressure, and bruises on the ribs, all likely to heal within eight days. the police report filed by a on 19 july 2012 stated that the applicant had not been ill-treated during questioning. none of the police officers had seen the applicant harming himself but a. had observed him biting his nails and lips. also, according to the report, the applicant had been left alone for a few minutes at the police station without constant surveillance. he asserted that he had been ill-treated during his interrogation. budapest prison initiated criminal proceedings on charges of forced interrogation. in the ensuing criminal investigation conducted by the central investigation office the applicant gave a testimony on 14 november 2012, stating that during his questioning he had refused to make a statement and as a consequence had been punched by one of the police officers several times on his head, neck and back. he had fallen against a chair and when he had tried to get up, he had been slapped four or five times in the face. on 24 july 2013 one of the prisoner escort officers, c was questioned, and recalled that the applicant had complained of ill-treatment upon his return to the prison facility, which had surprised him since he had previously asked the applicant whether he had any complaints and had seen no injuries on the applicant’s body. he also stated that he had noted the injuries on the applicant’s face following the medical examination at budapest prison. according to c, as a general practice, detainees had been transferred in a special prisoner transport vehicle where they had not been constantly monitored and would have had the opportunity to inflict injuries on themselves. on 25 july 2013 d, the other prisoner escort officer who accompanied the applicant to his interrogation, was also heard as a witness. he did not remember either the applicant or the circumstances of his transfer. therefore, in his estimation the applicant could not have shown any visible signs of injury when he was handed back from the interrogation. he could not give any details of the incident. on 5 december 2013 g, the guard on duty at budapest prison, was questioned as a witness; he could not remember either the applicant or anything else concerning his complaint. he nonetheless maintained that if he had seen injuries on the applicant as presented to him on a photo, he would surely have inquired about their origin. h stated that as a general practice detainees were under constant supervision while waiting for medical examinations, whereas i asserted that there were instances where detainees were left alone when placed in so‑called “healthcare waiting rooms”. neither of the witnesses knew with certainty whether this had been the case for the applicant. two of them could not recall anything about the incident and did not remember the applicant, mostly because they were responsible for a large number of cases. as a general rule, the witnesses explained that they would not admit a detainee into the prison if he showed signs of injuries. the prison doctor was also questioned the same day. the central investigation office commissioned a forensic expert opinion. referring to the witness testimonies and the location of the injuries, it suggested that the applicant could have inflicted them on himself. the applicant complained, seeking the continuation of the investigations.
the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in sestaci. in one of the letters, the vice-president of parliament expressed discontent that several police officers were being criminally prosecuted for allegedly ill-treating and unlawfully detaining suspects. in another letter it was stated that one of those police officers had previously been convicted of similar offences, but had been exempted from serving a sentence and had soon been re-employed by the ministry of internal affairs. subsequently, the newspaper published an article on the basis of the letters. he argued that, in any event, the letters could not be classified as secret under domestic law. on 30 march 2004 the applicant lodged an application with the court. against that background, it also found that the information disclosed by the applicant was of major public interest, because it concerned such issues as the separation of powers, improper conduct by a high-ranking politician, and the government’s attitude towards police brutality. lastly, the court noted that the applicant had acted in good faith and that the most severe sanction possible had been imposed on him. in view of all the considerations, the court came to the conclusion that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression, in particular his right to impart information, had not been “necessary in a democratic society”, and that there had been a breach of article 10 of the convention. he was successful, and on 28 may 2008 the supreme court of justice ordered his reinstatement. according to the applicant, on 29 may 2008 he had a meeting with the prosecutor general, who asked him to resign from his position. as the applicant refused, the prosecutor general told him that “he had enough wits to force him to do that”. he was told to go home and wait for his employment order. the government disputed the above submissions. according to the applicant, he was, however, not allocated an office and not given a badge to access the building. each morning he had to wait outside the building until one of his superiors allowed him to enter. since he had no office, he stayed in the library or in the press office. however, when other employees from the press office had to leave the office, he was locked outside it with the explanation that his superiors had not allowed him access to sensitive information. the government also disputed the above submissions. on 16 june 2008 the applicant was presented with a dismissal order, effective as of 10 june 2008. the dismissal was based on section 14(8) of the public service act. according to the order, the trade unions had consented to his dismissal on 6 june 2008. he presented details about his meeting with the prosecutor general of 29 may 2008 and about his discussion with him (see paragraph 13 above). he also stated that since his re-employment on 6 june 2008 he had not received a badge to access the building, had not been given an office, and had not been given any tasks. moreover, on the very day of his reinstatement, the prosecutor general had obtained the trade unions’ approval of his dismissal. it only submitted that labour-law provisions had been respected at the time the applicant had been dismissed. in particular, the court found that since the new prosecutor general had been appointed in 2007, he had the power to terminate the applicant’s employment on the basis of section 14(8) of the public service act. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the supreme court of justice in which he submitted, inter alia, that the prosecutor general’s office had failed to prove wrong his contentions about its failure to issue him with a badge or an office and to give him tasks. however, the appeal on points of law was dismissed on 29 april 2009. at the time of issuing the present judgment, the procedure for supervising the execution of the judgment of 12 february 2008 is still ongoing before the committee of ministers.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in zagreb. he was formerly a lawyer practising in zagreb. in the context of the use of secret surveillance measures in respect of a vice-president of the croatian privatisation fund (hrvatski fond za privatizaciju, hereinafter “the fund”), a legal entity established by the state and tasked with carrying out the privatisation of publicly owned property, the authorities intercepted and recorded a number of the applicant’s telephone conversations and messages. the secret surveillance was carried out on the basis of orders issued by an investigating judge of the zagreb county court (županijski sud u zagrebu). the reasoning of the relevant orders is outlined in the case of matanović v. croatia (no. on 16 june 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of corruption involving a number of officials of the fund and other individuals. following his arrest, an investigation was opened in the zagreb county court (see, for further details, matanović, cited above, §§ 15-28). on 12 february 2008, upon completion of the investigation, the state attorney’s office for the suppression of corruption and organised crime (ured za suzbijanje korupcije i organiziranog kriminaliteta – hereinafter: “the state attorney’s office”) indicted the applicant and nine other individuals in the zagreb county court on charges of bribe-taking, offering bribes, and abuse of power and authority. the applicant was indicted ‒ in his capacity as the lawyer acting for the vice-president of the fund ‒ for facilitating the receipt of a bribe of 150,000 euros (eur) for his client and aiding and abetting the abuse of power and authority by him. during the proceedings the applicant challenged the lawfulness of the secret surveillance orders, arguing that they lacked the requisite reasoning and had been issued contrary to the provisions of the relevant domestic law (see, for further details on the procedural actions taken, matanović, cited above, §§ 29-63). on 15 may 2009 the zagreb county court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment. it examined in detail and dismissed the applicant’s arguments regarding the unlawfulness of secret surveillance orders on the grounds that they had been issued by the relevant investigating judge in accordance with the law. the trial court also provided detailed reasoning why it considered that the available evidence provided a reliable basis for the applicant’s conviction. when convicting the applicant, the trial court had relied on the secret surveillance recordings, the statement of an informant, who had been questioned at the trial, the statements of other witnesses, and the evidentiary material available in the file. on 24 and 28 september 2009, the applicant both personally and through a lawyer lodged appeals against the first-instance judgment before the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske). in the appeals, the applicant argued that he had been unlawfully monitored and that his conviction had been based on evidence obtained unlawfully by the use of secret surveillance. he also extensively challenged the factual findings and conclusions of the first-instance court. on 17 february 2010 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal as unfounded, endorsing the reasoning of the first-instance judgment. on 22 april 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) alleging in particular that he had been placed under unlawful secret surveillance and that the evidence thereby obtained had been used in the criminal proceedings against him. he also extensively elaborated on the alleged deficiencies in the lower courts’ factual conclusions. on 21 february 2012 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s complaints as unfounded, endorsing the reasoning of the lower courts. it also stressed that the applicant had actively participated in the proceedings and that there had been no arbitrariness in the findings and decisions of the relevant courts. the decision of the constitutional court was served on the applicant’s representative on 23 february 2012.

“47. as for the issues that were at stake for the applicant, the court notes that following the traffic accident the applicant was seriously injured and received a disability degree. given that the applicant was a single mother and had a child to raise, the compensations for loss of earnings and for expenses sustained as a result of a poor state of her health were of undeniable importance for the applicant. the court therefore considers that what was at stake for the applicant called for an expeditious decision on her claims.” on 27 march 2007 the simferopolskiy district court found against the applicant. on 24 december 2007 the court of appeal of the autonomous republic of crimea quashed this decision and remitted the case to a first-instance court for fresh examination. on 23 april 2008 the supreme court of ukraine upheld the decision of the court of appeal. on 13 may 2009 the simferopolskiy district court partly found for the applicant. on 29 july 2009 the court of appeal of the autonomous republic of crimea quashed this decision and remitted the case to a first-instance court for fresh examination. on 15 october 2009 the supreme court of ukraine upheld the decision of the court of appeal. on 10 november 2009 the simferopolskiy district court left the applicant’s case without consideration because she had failed to appear in court without giving plausible reasons on 28 october 2009 and 10 november 2009. the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision stating that she had not been aware about the above-mentioned hearings. on 27 january 2010 the court of appeal of the autonomous republic of crimea rejected the applicant’s appeal. the court noted that the applicant had been duly notified about the date of the hearings. on 5 october 2011 the supreme court of ukraine upheld the decisions of the lower courts. a further attempt by the applicant to have the above decisions reviewed in the light of newly discovered circumstances was to no avail.
the applicant was born in nigeria in 1975 and lives in zölling. in nigeria, the applicant completed eleven years of schooling and subsequently held various jobs in lagos. in 1997 he arrived in germany, where he applied for asylum under a different identity. his application was finally rejected in july 1998. he left germany for italy with a german national with whom he had started a relationship. in january 1999 he moved on to spain, where he worked as a cook and waiter in various restaurants. on 21 october 2000 his daughter, from his above-mentioned relationship, was born. the applicant’s daughter is a german national. from the outset they had, and continue to have, joint custody. on 11 december 2000, the authority of the city of munich issued the applicant a residence permit based on family ties, valid until 1 december 2001. on 28 may 2002 the munich regional court sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment for drug trafficking on a large scale. it considered, in favour of the applicant, that this was his first criminal conviction, that the first delivery had failed (the drugs did not actually enter the distribution system), and that the applicant had been detained on remand since july 2001. on 3 july 2009 the applicant was released, after having served his entire sentence. he was placed under supervision of conduct (führungsaufsicht) until 3 july 2013. the applicant has not lived with his daughter and her mother since his release. since 2012 they have been living in different cities, with distances between their homes varying between thirty and seventy kilometres and the travelling time varying between forty minutes and one hour. the applicant sees his daughter on a regular basis and maintains close contact with her. it is not disputed between the parties that she spends every other weekend with him. he was sentenced to twenty, thirty and ninety day-fines, respectively. the authority examined whether the applicant enjoyed special protection against expulsion because he was the father of a german child. this decision became final on 1 december 2009. on 10 september 2009 the applicant applied for a residence permit based on family ties. the applicant could maintain contact with her through letters, telephone calls and occasional visits. he was responsible for the renewed separation and the purpose of the expulsion order had not yet been achieved. the purpose of section 10 § 3 of the residence act was to sanction abuse of the asylum procedure, but an abusive asylum application should not bear negative consequences where the foreigner had a claim, within the meaning of that provision, to a residence permit. under these circumstances, granting a residence permit on humanitarian grounds was to be considered. after the authority of the city of munich, on 12 june 2012, had ordered the applicant to present himself to the embassy of nigeria in germany so that a passport for the upcoming expulsion could be issued, the applicant refused to do so and filed an action against this order with the munich administrative court. if the applicant by then still has joint custody with the child’s mother, a residence permit on the grounds of family ties will be issued. in the light of this agreement, the applicant withdrew his action, and the proceedings before the munich administrative court were discontinued. as a result, the agreement concluded before that court became void.
the applicants alleged, before the domestic courts and before the court, that on 26 august 2002 police detained mr s. selami and took him from gostivar to skopje where he was severely beaten. mr s. selami sustained serious injuries to his head including a brain haemorrhage and fell into a coma. the police brought him to skopje hospital, where he underwent brain surgery. he was in a coma for two weeks and was connected to a ventilator for assisted breathing. by a letter of 29 august 2002, the ministry had informed them that mr s. selami had been admitted to skopje hospital. according to a medical certificate from tetovo medical centre issued on 29 january 2003 on the basis of the available medical evidence, mr s. selami was in a post-operative state (following medical trepanation of his skull and evacuation of the internal brain haemorrhage); parts of his skull and the tough brain membrane had been seriously damaged; he had suffered reduced mobility of all limbs, muscle hypotonia and neck and rib fractures. according to the report, those injuries had qualified as serious and had had permanent effects on the life and body of mr s. selami. as to the subsequent establishment of facts by the domestic civil courts, see paragraphs 15-18 below. the investigating judge specified that mr s. selami had been hospitalised and that the detention order would be enforced as soon as he was discharged from hospital. mr s. selami’s detention was extended on three occasions. the extension orders specified that he had been deprived of his liberty on 18 september 2002 and that he had been held under the detention order in skopje hospital until 18 october 2002. the remaining accused were acquitted (ослободени од обвинение). on 18 november 2003 mr s. selami contacted the ministry of justice with a view to securing an out-of-court settlement and payment of 16,170,000 macedonian denars (mkd – equivalent to 263,000 euros (eur)) in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused, so it was asserted, by the unlawful deprivation of his liberty and the serious injuries that he had sustained at the hands of the police on 26 august 2002. in support he submitted the medical certificate from tetovo medical centre (see paragraph 7 above). they reiterated that on 26 august 2002 mr s. selami had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty; that he had been taken to police stations where he had been beaten and physically ill-treated; and that the police had taken him to skopje hospital where he had undergone head surgery. on 19 september 2002 he had been transferred from the hospital to skopje detention facility in view of his detention on remand. both claims were joined and decided in a single set of proceedings. during the proceedings, the domestic courts commissioned two expert opinions and admitted into evidence extensive medical material issued by relevant medical institutions in switzerland concerning mr s. selami’s earlier injury while at work in that state. it dismissed the remaining part of mr s. selami’s claim. on the basis of the available medical evidence, the court established that in 1985, while at work in switzerland, mr s. selami had fallen and injured his spine and right leg, which had become dysfunctional. he had sustained serious head injuries, which had affected, though not permanently, the left side of his body and had provoked other negative psychological effects. relying on the statements of mr s. selami and the first and fourth applicants, the court established that in august 2002 the police had searched their house. they had asked mr s. selami to come with them to gostivar police station. there, he had been questioned in relation to an incident in which two policemen had been killed. he had denied having any connection to that incident. he had been taken by police car to skopje, where he had been placed in “a cellar or a garage” and beaten. both mr s. selami and the applicants appealed to the skopje court of appeal. the solicitor general also challenged the judgment. it overturned the lower court’s judgment and awarded mr s. selami the equivalent of eur 9,800 in respect of non-pecuniary damage due to his “unjustified detention between 19 september and 10 december 2002”. by a final decision of 31 october 2012, delivered by a notary public, the fourth applicant was declared the sole heir of mr s. selami’s inheritance, including the compensation awarded to him.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in nova kakhovka. in particular she had been involved in litigation with the local municipal utilities company. in 2007 the municipal utilities company instituted proceedings against the applicant, seeking recovery of utilities arrears. you have not even once protected my rights or the rights of the individuals i have been representing and helping ... previously i used not to challenge you but lately i have started to do so. you do not allow my challenges, arguing that my arguments against you are supposedly made up and subjective. the newspaper article says that this issue has attracted the attention of the presidential administration and the general prosecutor’s office. i know that the case in question was examined by the council of judges and by a parliamentary commission, before which you appeared, before your appointment. all the more so because i know from a court clerk that an instruction [has been given to] the nova kakhovka court to decide cases [in which i am involved] against me. you, by your decision, deprived me of that right. for me this is another signal: if the fate of that young man did not mean anything to you, then mine would mean even less. so it is not just that i have serious doubts about your impartiality; i know of no case where you have given a lawful decision. when you came to the nova kakhovka court, i told you that i had much hope in you – that you were a competent and good judge. judge [voice rising]: olena oleksandrivna, i am forced to interrupt you because you are making clearly false statements; this is grounds for drawing up a report of contempt of court! so please be balanced; you have just made so many false statements that are insulting the court. applicant: what i said ... [inaudible]
judge [voice rising]: please substantiate it, substantiate it with evidence – substantiate it! applicant: there is my complaint ... [inaudible]
judge [voice rising]: that complaint is just your subjective opinion! you prove that you haven’t done all of this! so please be balanced [inaudible] in [stating] your grounds for your challenge. the report stated that the applicant’s rights as a person accused of an administrative offence, as set out in article 268 of the code (see paragraph 25 below), had been explained to her and that her case would be examined on the same day. according to the applicant, the witness statements had not been in the file when it was transferred to judge b., who examined her contempt case; rather, they were obtained subsequently under judge b.’s direction. she also alleged that she had not been given access to the case file before the contempt hearing. on the same day judge b. held a hearing in the presence of the applicant. and s. (see paragraph 13 above), and the audio recording of the hearing (see paragraph 10 above). the applicant then spent five days in detention. on 2 july 2007 the first vice-president of the kherson regional court of appeal, acting on his own motion within the meaning of article 294 of the code (see paragraph 28 above), reviewed the case. the article entitled “father for son, brother for brother”, to which the applicant referred in her challenge of judge m. (see paragraph 10 above), was published in the delovye novosti newspaper on an unspecified date. it described a criminal case concerning a bar brawl in which a person had been killed and a certain g. charged with murder. it put forward a point of view according to which g. was innocent since he had not provoked the brawl but had simply been defending a friend whom the victim had supposedly humiliated. it also described g.’s father’s and brother’s efforts to defend him. the article reported that g’s conviction by judge m. had again been quashed on appeal and the case remitted for retrial before a different district court and that g.’s relatives had apparently made sure that the case would be under the supervision of the presidential administration and other high state bodies.
the applicant, is a french citizen, who was born in 1969 and lives in gaillard, france. moved to france and the couple lived together in the applicant’s flat in gaillard. on 18 october 2013 their son, l., was born. the applicant returned to their home on 27 december 2013. lodged a complaint against the applicant in toul. she alleged that the applicant had become hostile and sometimes aggressive towards her and constituted a danger to her and their son. left for hungary with l, without the prior knowledge or authorisation of the applicant. has lived with l. at her parents’ home in szombathely. initiated custody proceedings in respect of l. before the szombathely district court. the court ordered the provisional execution of the judgment. in a judgment of 22 july 2014, the chambery court of appeal granted k.b.v. had decided on the child’s place of residence without his approval. by a decision of 12 february 2015 the pest central district court dismissed the request under article 11 of the hague convention and article 11 of the brussels ii bis regulation. the budapest high court upheld the first-instance decision on 28 april 2015. the applicant lodged a petition for judicial review of this decision with the kúria. he argued that article 13 of the hague convention was applicable to exceptional circumstances only and that neither the child’s age nor his closer connection to his mother had any bearing on the matter and could not constitute a decisive element in the decision to refuse to order the child’s return to his habitual residence. he also maintained that his lack of contact with l. was due to k.b.v. on 27 august 2014 the district court discontinued the proceedings, regard being had to the judgments delivered by the french courts. this decision was overturned again by the high court on 5 march 2015 owing to procedural errors. on 22 april 2015 the applicant tried to abduct l., who was walking with his grandfather on the street. according to the high court, restricting the mother’s contact with l. to two hours every second week would have caused harm to l., especially since the applicant himself had stated that l. would be looked after by his sister. furthermore, the court found that no measures were being contemplated by the applicant to ensure the protection of the child after his return to france. on 8 december 2015 the applicant abducted l. from k.b.v., in the course of which he caused grievous bodily harm to her. on 10 december 2015 the szombathely district court issued an interim decision on the exercise of parental custody and access rights. it held that l. needed to have contact with his father and therefore ruled that the applicant could visit him for three hours every second weekend and could contact him via skype every other weekend. l. was placed in a childcare institution. the applicant was granted access rights, in accordance with the szombathely district court’s decision of 10 december 2015. l. was returned to hungary on 28 december 2015. the szombathely high court held that the judgment of the thonon-les-bains tribunal de grande instance, under which no rights at all were granted to the mother at all, was contrary to the public policy of hungary since it did not respect fundamental rights, and in particular the best interest of the child, and refused by a decision of 10 december 2015 to execute it.
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in stryzhavka. on 12 september 2006 the applicant submitted a written notice to the mayor of vinnytsia informing him that the chumatskyy shlyakh civic youth association (“the association”) registered in vinnytsia, of which he was chairman, intended to hold a picket (пікет) outside the vinnytsia regional authority (“the regional authority”) building. beginning of the picket: 14 september 2005 at 14:00. place: square in front of the [regional authority] building;
responsible person according to the decision of the association’s management: chumak s.v. [ chairman of the [association] chumak, sergiy viktorovych.” according to the government, the association’s officially registered chairman at the material time was a certain igor viktorovyh chumak. at the time of the relevant events the applicant was older. on 13 september 2006 the mayor’s office forwarded the applicant’s notice to the police, requesting that they maintain public order during the demonstration. on 14 september 2006 the association started the picket as intended. the statement of claim was supplemented with applications by v.ch. according to him, during the hearing he had unsuccessfully made several requests for the production of evidence. and the police officers present at the site of the picket be summoned for questioning; that the police authorities be asked whether any incidents of unlawful conduct by the picketers had been documented; and that the site be inspected in order to determine whether, in fact, the camping tents mounted by the picketers had obstructed the traffic or the passage of pedestrians. later on the same date, the district court allowed the claim, having decided that the case file contained sufficient evidence that the protesters had behaved inappropriately. in addition, the court has regard to the fact that in the notice of the event it is stated that it will be held indefinitely. also the number of protesters is not defined ... and it may gradually increase. accordingly, at any time during the picket of indeterminate length, it cannot be excluded that those taking part might repeatedly breach public order.” the court also noted that the picket “may potentially encroach upon the rights and freedoms of other local residents” and held as follows:
“[the court holds] to prohibit [the association] and other persons taking part in the action from organising and carrying out peaceful assemblies in the streets and squares of vinnytsia, [and] from installing small architectural edifices in vinnytsia; ... oblige them to dismantle the small architectural edifices installed in the square in front of the [administration’s] building ...
to allow immediate enforcement of the court ruling ...” 14. at 9 p.m. on 15 september 2006 the protesters were dispersed by the police. on 29 september 2006 the local registry office informed the applicant that v.ch. were not registered as residents at the addresses indicated by them in their complaints lodged with the police. on 8 october 2006 the applicant lodged an appeal against the court judgment of 15 september 2006, which he signed as the association’s chairman. he submitted that under article 182 of the caj, a plaintiff’s action could not be examined when it had been lodged out of time. in particular, there was no evidence whatsoever that the protesters had breached the law, apart from the complaints by v.ch. who had given false home addresses and thus could not be identified. the applicant further complained that the court had rejected his request that those individuals be located and summoned, and that the police officers present at the site of the picket also be summoned for questioning concerning the alleged breaches of the law by the protesters. he also regretted that the court had refused his requests that the relevant police reports documenting the purported breaches of the law (if any) be produced and an inspection of the picket site be carried out with a view to determining whether the tents erected by the activists could count as “architectural structures” and whether there had been any obstruction of traffic or pedestrians. at the same time, the court of appeal found that the sanction imposed on the protesters had been disproportionate. in particular, the constitution of ukraine generally allowed peaceful assemblies, which could therefore not be prohibited in a blanket manner. the court then rejected the applicant’s remaining arguments as unsubstantiated. on 1 april 2009 the higher administrative court of ukraine dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant.
the applicant was born in 1961 and lives in frankfurt am main. the arrest warrant was based on the risk of his absconding owing to the possible heavy sentence for the offences in question. he was also married to the co-accused, who, like him, was a national of the russian federation, and he did not have a legal residence or other significant ties to germany. on the same day, he was arrested and the district court ordered his detention on remand. on 19 december 2014 the frankfurt am main prosecution authorities brought criminal proceedings against the applicant, charging him with eight counts of aiding aggravated fraudulent conversion, one count of aiding aggravated corruption and fourteen counts of aiding aggravated tax evasion. on 26 january 2015 the darmstadt regional court sent the translation of the 280-page indictment to the applicant. on 6 march 2015 he responded to the indictment and asked the court not to open the main proceedings. on 18 march 2015 the prosecution authorities asked the regional court to amend the proceedings against the applicant, based on the results of the investigation obtained after the criminal proceedings had been brought. on 6 may 2015 the regional court decided to open the main proceedings, which commenced on 8 june 2015. on 14 july 2016 the regional court convicted the applicant on five counts each of aiding fraudulent conversion and tax evasion and sentenced him to four years and six months’ imprisonment. from 15 january 2014 onwards the applicant challenged the lawfulness of his remand detention before the frankfurt am main district court and the frankfurt am main regional court without success. it also ordered that the case file be re-submitted to it by 28 october 2014 at the latest for the next periodic review. on 5 september 2014 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the federal constitutional court against that decision. the court refused to accept it for adjudication, without providing reasons (no. 2 bvr 2050/14), a decision which was served on the applicant on 6 october 2014. subsequently, the applicant initiated another set of review proceedings before the district court and lodged a complaint of bias against the competent judge. on 10 november 2014 the court of appeal dismissed the objection and the appeal to be heard. the judges gave their statements on 27 november 2014 and 1 december 2014. the applicant then requested additional statements from them, which was not deemed to be necessary by the court of appeal on 11 december 2014. four days later the applicant lodged another complaint about bias, arguing that their statements in response to his first such complaint could not restore his confidence in their impartiality. the judges concerned again gave statements and the applicant’s counsel was given the opportunity to respond. on 30 december 2014 the court of appeal rejected the applicant’s first complaint of bias as ill-founded, finding that there were no indications that the judges concerned were partial, even assuming that they had made a procedural mistake in connection with requesting the case file, leading to a delay in deciding on his objection and appeal to be heard. on 8 january 2015 the applicant lodged an objection against that decision. on 22 january 2015 the court of appeal rejected the applicant’s second complaint of bias as ill-founded, also addressing his objection in its decision. on 10 march 2015 the applicant’s lawyer sent to the court of appeal two comprehensive submissions which he had made in the main proceedings before the regional court and asked the appeal court to take them into account when deciding on the continuation of the applicant’s remand detention. on 27 april 2015 the federal constitutional court refused to accept the complaint for adjudication without providing reasons (no. on 15 may 2015 the applicant was served with a decision by the frankfurt am main court of appeal, taken on 15 april 2015 and issued on 13 may 2015, ordering the continuation of his detention on remand. it found that the risk of his absconding continued to exist. the applicant’s continued detention on remand was, therefore, proportionate. the court did not address the duration of the review proceedings nor provide any reasons for it.
the applicant was born in 1983 and lives in mārupe. at the material time the applicant held a pilot licence and was undergoing aviation training. held 100% of the shares in the company (he was its sole owner) and he was also its sole board member. and maintained radio communication with the air traffic control service. he permanently lost the vision in his right eye and sustained other permanent damage to his health. he was not permitted to operate an aircraft independently and was required to undergo medical checks more often than other aviation specialists. the attempts to stabilise it were unsuccessful. nevertheless, on 16 august 2008 he had flown without sufficient qualifications. on 16 august 2008 a criminal investigation was opened into the aircraft accident. would at all times be accompanied by a more experienced instructor during the training flights. on 14 january 2010 the proceedings with regard to g.v. the material in the criminal case contained a letter from the taiib dated 20 october 2009 which stated, inter alia, that at the material time the legislative acts regulating aviation safety in latvia had not provided for a procedure setting out how to hand over an aircraft for a general aviation flight. during the investigation, an official of the civil aviation agency testified that in commercial aviation, the question of an operator’s responsibility with regard to the qualifications and rights of a pilot was sufficiently regulated, however this regulation did not apply to general aviation flights. on 24 may 2011 the prosecution indicted d.k. for negligence in the performance of his professional duties (section 197 of the criminal law) and violation of air traffic safety or operation regulations (section 257(2) of the criminal law). was responsible for the accident, and he could not envisage also being charged in criminal proceedings. with regard to negligence in the performance of his professional duties (see paragraph 44 below), the court deemed that neither the indictment nor the first-instance judgment had shown what professional duties in particular d.k. had violated and by what conduct in particular. the senate stated that the prosecution should not have relied on certain provisions of the commercial law, the civil law, the law on aviation and the convention on international civil aviation (hereinafter “the chicago convention”). only subsequent to the accident in question had recommendations been issued to the civil aviation agency on the preparation of statutes relevant to flight safety. on 14 may 2013 the riga regional court, acting as a court of first instance, dismissed the claim in full on the grounds that the defendants had not committed unlawful actions (prettiesiska darbība). had agreed to the pilot starting a “differences training programme” for the piper pa-31 aircraft with a flight instructor, o.g. taking into account that he was a pilot himself and that he had received information about the unfavourable weather conditions, he could have avoided any damage by choosing not to fly in such circumstances. it had been planned that the pilot would operate the aircraft with the flight instructor (see paragraph 33 above). in the light of sections 97 and 98 of the law on aviation, the owner of the aircraft was the company and not d.k. was the owner of the aircraft, therefore it was liable for loss caused by the source of dangerous activity. section 36 provided that the work of a civil aircraft flight crew should be managed by a pilot-in-command. in a judgment of 24 november 2010 in case no. 2.1.1.3 the pilot-in-command shall have responsibility of the operational control. ...”

according to a medical report issued on 29 june 2004 by the gaziantep university hospital, the applicant’s state of health required him to follow one diet for his diabetes and another one for his coronary disease, and to live in a well-ventilated environment free of tobacco smoke. on 30 april 2008 the applicant was placed in the erzurum h-type prison, where he remained until 6 march 2009, serving a term for terrorist offences. on 17 july 2008 the applicant was taken to the cardiology department of the atatürk university hospital in erzurum (“erzurum hospital”) for blood tests and an echocardiogram. a report drawn up on 24 july 2008 by the erzurum hospital’s health board pointed out that owing to his cardiac issues the applicant had to adhere to a special anti-cholesterol diet with high poultry meat and vegetable content and low levels of beef and saturated fats. the report mentioned that if the prison in which the applicant had been placed offered a wide choice of daily menus it would be unnecessary to transfer the applicant to another prison providing such facilities. it added that on the other hand, if the prison only offered one standard menu, the erzurum hospital’s health board would hold a further meeting in order to decide whether the applicant should be transferred to another prison, after ascertaining the view of a dietician on the cholesterol content of the standard menu. on an unspecified date the applicant, arguing that the meal served in prison was incompatible with his medically prescribed diet, asked the prison authorities to send samples to the ministry of justice and the human rights commission of the grande national assembly of turkey. on 24 october 2008 the prison disciplinary board rejected his request on the grounds that the foodstuffs would spoil very quickly, before reaching their destination. that board pointed out that the applicant could lodge a complaint by mail with the aforementioned institutions in order to inform them of his grievances concerning the meals served in prison. the applicant appealed against that decision. on 7 november 2008 the erzurum judge responsible for the execution of sentences (“the judge responsible for the execution of sentences”) dismissed the appeal. on 5 december 2008 the erzurum assize court (“the assize court”) upheld the dismissal decision given by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences. meanwhile, on 24 november 2008, the applicant had been taken to the emergency department of erzurum hospital complaining of chest pains. on 5 december 2008 he underwent an exercise electrocardiogram. on an unspecified date the applicant lodged a complaint with the judge responsible for the execution of sentences about the refusal by the prison authorities, despite his many requests, to provide him with meals compatible with his medically prescribed diet, which he said formed an integral part of his medical treatment. he also complained about his difficulties in obtaining medication. the applicant stated the following, inter alia:
“... my state of health [is poor]; the prison authorities informed me that i would be provided with meals compatible with my diet, but that has not happened; this can be noted from surveillance camera footage; i was not provided with the menu list when i wanted to submit it to the ministry for examination.” on 2 january 2009 the judge responsible for the execution of sentences allowed the applicant’s request. that judge referred in his decision to a document which the prison authorities had drawn up for the attention of the erzurum public prosecutor’s office, stating the following:
“... medically prescribed diets cannot be prepared in [our] prison’s kitchen; we can only cook unsalted and unspiced versions of the meals prepared for the other [prisoners]. extra potatoes, boiled eggs and tomatoes are sometimes provided.” the judge responsible for the execution of sentences pointed out that the prison had not indicated in that document whether or not the meals contained fats, which made it impossible to assess their cholesterol content. in view of the impossibility of ascertaining whether meals prepared in that manner were compatible with the medical prescriptions in question, he ordered that the standard menu should be examined by a dietician and, if that menu proved incompatible with the applicant’s diet, that the applicant should be provided with an appropriate menu. on 5 january 2009 the erzurum public prosecutor (“the prosecutor”) appealed against the decision of 2 january 2009. on 8 january 2009 the judge responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed that appeal. on the same day the prosecutor lodged a fresh appeal against the decision of 8 january 2009, this time with the assize court. he argued as follows: the meals were prepared in the prison kitchen; the daily allowance per prisoner, which totalled three turkish liras (try – about 1.40 euro at the material time), was only sufficient to prepare one type of meal per day, which meant that the prisoners could not be offered several types of menus; menus could not be prepared for the medically prescribed diets for a total of thirty-eight individuals detained in the same prison, and only an unsalted, fat-free and unspiced version of the standard menu was on offer. according to the prosecutor, the prison would only be able to improve its service in that respect if the amount of the daily allowance were increased. on 9 january 2009 the assize court followed the prosecutor’s reasoning and quashed the decisions given by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences on 2 and 8 january 2009. furthermore, according to the weekly lists of standard menus for the weeks of 24 february 2009 and 3 march 2009, the meals served to prisoners in the erzurum prison had mainly consisted of beef, fried food and starches: poultry meat had only been served once a week and the menus had comprised minimal fresh vegetables.
the applicant institute is a private institute that carries out research in the field of social sciences. the ministry announced that in 2004 it would finance 100,000 research hours, which were estimated to amount to 750,000,000 slovenian tolars (sit – approximately 3,130,000 euros (eur)). the research projects were to be evaluated under the rules on quality assessment and funding of the public research organisation programme. the applicant institute submitted a tender for research in the field of social sciences. subsequently, the ministry seems to have joined the proceedings for the two tenders, but no formal decision regarding the joinder appears to have been made. on 17 february 2004 the ministry decided that the applicant institute would not be awarded any funding. the applicant institute applied to the administrative court of the republic of slovenia (“the administrative court”), seeking the setting aside of the ministry’s decision. on 19 october 2009 the applicant institute lodged another action before the administrative court on account of the ministry’s failure to adopt a decision within the prescribed time-limit. on 30 march 2010 the ministry again decided that the applicant institute would not be awarded any funding. it explained that the institute’s research programme had been ranked fifth among the research programmes in the field of political sciences and that only four programmes in that group would receive funding. the ministry pointed out that it was presumed that no conflict of interests existed, even when evaluators worked in the same institution whose tenders they were evaluating and that this was a common european practice. it was further noted that evaluators had signed a declaration of confidentiality and an undertaking to withdraw in the event that a conflict of interests was found. it further urged the administrative court to decide that it would be awarded funding. the applicant institute expressly requested a hearing at which witnesses could be heard with regard to the alleged procedural errors in the evaluation of the programmes. additionally, it submitted a letter of 2 december 2003 which one of the witnesses, k., had sent to the minister of education, science and sport and several other addressees. in the letter k. notified them of problems he had detected in the tender proceedings in which he had participated as an evaluator. after the parties had exchanged a number of written submissions, the administrative court, without holding a hearing, dismissed the action. in its decision of 2 february 2011 the court gave an extensive account of the proceedings before the ministry and the submissions of both parties. the reasons for the decision were given on a single page. it considered, among other things, that the ministry had not acted unlawfully in joining the proceedings. it accepted the ministry’s submission that its decision had been dictated by the nature of the research and infrastructural programmes, taking into account the guidelines of the national research and development programme. the court also pointed out that the procedural rules for the evaluation of research programmes adopted by the national scientific and research council clearly defined the stages of the evaluation procedure, the participants in it and their tasks. regarding the alleged conflict of interests, the court stated that it agreed with the ministry as to why no such conflict existed and cited section 71(2) of the ada (see paragraph 23 below). no reasons were given for not holding a hearing. none of the evidence relied on by the applicant institute in their appeal (see paragraph 11 above) was acknowledged or referred to in the court’s reasoning. on 31 march 2011 the applicant institute lodged an appeal on points of law. it also argued that the administrative court had failed to address its allegations that errors had been made in the evaluation procedure, and complained that insufficient reasoning had been given for the decision. on 1 september 2011 the supreme court rejected the appeal as inadmissible. it reiterated that the witnesses it had proposed had not been heard and that no hearing had been held. on 19 november 2012 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant institute’s complaint, finding that it did not concern an important constitutional question or entail a violation of human rights with serious consequences for the applicant institute.
the applicant was born in 1979 and is detained in diyarbakır. on 23 december 2001 the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody on suspicion of being a member of hizbullah, an illegal organisation. during his detention in police custody, the applicant was allegedly subjected to ill-treatment by police officers. in particular, electric shocks were administered to his testicles. on 25 december 2001 the applicant was interrogated by the police in the absence of a lawyer. during his interrogation, he confessed in detail to his involvement in the activities of the illegal organisation and gave detailed information about the organisation and its members. on 26 december 2001 the applicant gave a statement to the public prosecutor in the absence of a lawyer in which he denied the statements he had given to the police. on the same day the applicant was brought before the investigating judge at the diyarbakır state security court, who questioned him in the absence of a lawyer. the applicant again denied his statements to the police. however, a medical report issued by bağlar health clinic dated the same day stated that there was no sign that he had been subjected to violence. at the end of the hearing, the court ordered that the applicant be placed in pre-trial detention. on 9 january 2002 the diyarbakır public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment, charging the applicant under article 146 of the former turkish criminal code with attempting to undermine the constitutional order of the state. during the hearing, the applicant repeated his allegations of having been subjected to ill-treatment in police custody and denied his statements to the police. he stated that electric shocks had been administered to his body through his testicles and that his testicles had been squeezed, which had caused serious harm. he attached a medical report dated 20 september 2002 from fırat university on the state of his testicles. the report stated that the applicant had a dilation of the veins in his left testicle of up to 2.6 mm, which had resulted in a varicocele. state security courts were abolished by law no. 5190 of 16 june 2004, published in the official gazette on 30 june 2004. the case against the applicant was transferred to the diyarbakır assize court. on 25 june 2004 the diyarbakır public prosecutor issued a decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the police officers on account of a lack of evidence. the courts ordered that he be kept in detention owing to the nature of the offence, the state of the evidence and the contents of the file. on 12 june 2008 the diyarbakır assize court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to life imprisonment. on 18 january 2010 the court of cassation quashed the decision for procedural reasons. on 2 april 2010 the applicant asked the diyarbakır assize court for his release pending trial. on 9 april 2010 the court dismissed his application for release on the grounds of the nature of the offence. 6008, which provided that juveniles could not be tried before assize courts, which had special jurisdiction to try a number of aggravated crimes enumerated under article 250 § 1 of the code of criminal procedure at the material time. the case was thus referred to the diyarbakır juvenile court. on 2 november 2010 the applicant was released pending trial. on 5 june 2012 the diyarbakır juvenile court found that, inter alia, on the basis of the applicant’s statements to the police, the applicant had committed the offence under article 146 of the former turkish criminal code and sentenced him to sixteen years and eight months’ imprisonment. on 17 june 2014 the court of cassation upheld the diyarbakır juvenile court’s judgment.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in yerevan. in 1983 and 1988 the applicant was found guilty of indecent acts with minors and sentenced to prison sentences. from 2001 the applicant lodged two civil claims against the state, seeking compensation for pecuniary damage sustained as a result of his two convictions. who had stopped the applicant’s car for a violation of traffic laws. on 16 april 2005 it was decided not to detain the applicant and to release him on a written undertaking not to leave his place of residence, on the grounds that he was a disabled person suffering from a number of diseases, had no previous convictions, had two children who were minors, as well as his wife and mother as dependants, and had a permanent place of residence. on 5 may 2005 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan, on the basis of an application by the investigator, changed the preventive measure in respect of the applicant from a written undertaking not to leave his place of residence to detention on remand for a period of two months. in the course of the investigation the applicant testified that v.s. and g.g. had demanded a bribe from him in order not to record a violation of the traffic laws and then subjected him to beatings when he refused. a forensic medical examination of the applicant was carried out, which found that he had suffered injuries, including concussion and a fractured cheek bone. on 10 june 2005 the applicant’s lawyer addressed a letter to the investigator, alleging that it had been the applicant who had been assaulted by v.s. and g.g rather than the other way around. the lawyer requested the investigator that such charges be brought. on 16 february 2006 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan acquitted the applicant, finding that he was not guilty of the imputed offence. had exceeded their authority by acting violently against the applicant, which had caused serious damage and grave consequences to the applicant and his family. the police officers had subjected the applicant to beatings, as a result of which the latter had sustained injuries, including a concussion and a fractured cheek bone. moreover, the grounds for his release on 20 june 2005 under a written undertaking were the same as those which had already been used on 16 april 2005 to justify his release under a written undertaking as opposed to placing him in pre-trial detention. on unspecified dates the prosecutor’s office and officers v.s. and g.g. on 14 november 2006 the criminal court of appeal dismissed the appeals and upheld the judgment of the district court, finding that the applicant had acted in necessary self-defence. however, it decided to annul the request made to the prosecutor general on the grounds that article 21 of the ccp prohibited the reopening of proceedings if there had been a decision of the prosecuting authority to discontinue the proceedings or not to carry out prosecution. which had never been annulled, hence article 21 excluded the possibility of prosecuting them. on 27 november 2007 the applicant lodged a complaint with the courts, seeking to annul the investigator’s decision of 21 june 2005 as it contradicted the findings reached by the courts in his trial when assessing the actions of the police officers. furthermore, the prosecuting authority was obliged by law to take measures to restore his rights of its own motion. the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision. on 19 may 2008 the criminal court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal, finding that article 21 § 5 of the ccp was not applicable to his case and holding that the applicant had failed to contest the investigator’s decision of 21 june 2005 within the time-limits prescribed by articles 21 and 290 of the ccp, as well as the time-limit for requesting a reopening of a case prescribed by article 426.3 of the ccp. on 8 april 2009 the court of cassation found that the applicant had failed to show that he had valid reasons for missing the prescribed one-month time‑limit and decided to refuse the examination of the applicant’s appeal on points of law. on 26 november 2007 the kentron and nork-marash district court decided to dismiss his claims. on 7 march 2008 the civil court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the judgment of the district court, finding that the applicant had already been compensated for pecuniary damage in relation to his convictions, while his new claims for pecuniary damages were unsubstantiated. on 29 july 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, which was declared inadmissible for lack of merit by the court of cassation on 28 october 2008. on 26 february 2009 the applicant lodged another civil claim against the state, seeking compensation for pecuniary damage suffered as a result of his ill-treatment, such as various medical costs. on 26 december 2011 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan examined the applicant’s claim. on 25 january 2012 the applicant lodged an appeal.
from 1 january 2001 the applicant concluded several consecutive fixed-duration contracts of employment with the company c.n.s. the contracts were for a continuous period which in total amounted to over seven years and seven months. on 5 june 2009 the applicant’s employer returned the applicant’s employment registration book to him, without any written or oral notification, showing that his employment had been terminated. on 20 july 2009 the applicant brought a civil action before the ivanić grad municipal court (općinski sud u ivanić gradu). he asked it to recognise that he had concluded an open-ended contract of employment, given that he had been in continuous employment with his employer for over three years, which was the time-limit for fixed-term employment contracts under the labour act. he also asked the municipal court to establish that his employment had not been terminated and to order his reinstatement. on 22 january 2010 the ivanić grad municipal court dismissed the applicant’s claim as time-barred. upon an appeal by the applicant, on 16 february 2011 the velika gorica county court (županijski sud u velikoj gorici) quashed the first‑instance decision and remitted the case for fresh consideration. it held that the first-instance court should have declared the applicant’s claims inadmissible as time-barred, without examining it on the merits. in the fresh proceedings, the ivanić grad municipal court on 6 may 2011 declared the applicant’s action inadmissible as having been lodged outside the prescribed time-limit. the first-instance court, relying on section 133 of the labour act, held that the applicant and his employer had concluded a fixed-term contract lasting until 31 may 2009 and that the applicant must have known that his contract would end on that day. he had not concluded a new contract of employment with his employer and he had therefore been obliged to lodge an application for the protection of his rights with his employer within the fifteen-day time-limit, starting from 1 june 2009. however, he had failed to do so and consequently his claim had been lodged out of time. rejecting the applicant’s argument, the first‑instance court also held that the defendant company had not been obliged to adopt a formal decision on terminating his employment or to send him any other kind of notification, given that he must have known that his contract would come to an end on 31 may 2009. on 12 may 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal with the velika gorica county court. on 26 july 2011 the velika gorica county court upheld the first‑instance decision. on 14 november 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (revizija) with the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske), which was dismissed as ill-founded on 25 september 2012. the supreme court also held that the applicant had failed to seek the protection of his rights in respect of his employer within the deadlines prescribed by section 133 of the labour act. accordingly, his claim had been lodged out of time. on 14 march 2013 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske). he complained that the courts had wrongly declared his claim inadmissible because it had been of a declaratory nature and as such had not been subject to deadlines. he relied on a decision by the velika gorica county court of 16 january 2013 in the case of a colleague of his, who for the same reasons as the applicant had also sought to have the court recognise that he had concluded an open-ended contract of employment. in that decision the velika gorica county court, in accordance with instructions given in the supreme court’s decision no. revr-1697/11 of 6 june 2012, had dismissed the defendant’s (the employer’s) objection that the claim was time-barred. namely, the supreme court had held that the claim had been of a declaratory nature and as such was not subject to deadlines. on 6 may 2013 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as manifestly ill-founded.
the applicant was born in 1934 and lives in stari mikanovci. the applicant was an employee of the state’s railway company, hrvatske željeznice. he suffered a work-related accident and became unable to work. on 5 may 1988 the vukovar municipal court (općinski sud u vukovaru) increased the above-mentioned monthly payments. on 24 december 1990 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against hrvatske željeznice, seeking that the above-mentioned monthly payments be increased on the grounds of changed circumstances. the defendant did not oppose an increase in the monthly payments, but disputed the amount requested. the vukovar municipal court commissioned a report from an accounting expert, and on 13 february 1991 the expert witness submitted his report. at a hearing held on 20 february 1991 the expert witness gave oral evidence. in the resumed proceedings, the first-instance court commissioned a report from an accounting expert and ordered the applicant to pay costs in advance in the sum of 696.55 croatian kunas (hrk). on 5 june 2003 the expert witness submitted his report and the defendant objected to the expert’s findings. on 15 october 2003 the expert witness submitted his observations in reply to the defendant’s objection. at a hearing on 28 november 2003 the court heard oral evidence from the expert witness. he stated that he could not precisely determine individual amounts until the croatian pension fund adjusted the applicant’s pension. on 22 december 2003, after the croatian pension fund had adjusted the applicant’s pension, the expert witness submitted an additional report. at a hearing held on 15 september 2005 the first-instance court commissioned a further report from an accounting expert, in accordance with the instruction given by the second-instance court. specifically, it ordered the expert witness, in calculating the monthly amount, to take into account the amount of 63.80 dinars which had already been awarded, as well as the fact that the defendant was 50% responsible for the damage at issue, and to establish whether the applicant had used his right to have his disability pension recalculated as an old-age pension when he had turned 60. meanwhile, the defendant split into four companies, and the first‑instance court ordered the applicant to correct his claim by accurately identifying the defendant. on 2 november 2007 the first-instance court declared the claim inadmissible, because it held that the applicant had failed to properly correct the claim. upon an appeal by the applicant, on 9 september 2008 the vukovar county court quashed the first-instance decision, because it held that the applicant had already identified the defendant. on 15 january 2009 and 3 february 2009 the applicant asked for an exemption from paying the costs of the expert witness, claiming that, given his financial situation, and the fact that his pension was hrk 2,313 per month and his wife was unemployed and without any income, he was unable to pay those costs without putting his own and his wife’s subsistence at risk. he submitted a certificate from the croatian pension fund concerning his pension and certificates demonstrating his and his wife’s income. he asked the court to allow his claim as specified in his submissions of 16 february 2007. neither party put forward any new evidence. the court set aside its decision of 22 december 2008 regarding a further report from an accounting expert, because the applicant had failed to pay for the costs, and concluded the hearing. on 16 february 2009, relying on the rules regulating the burden of proof, the first-instance court issued a judgment dismissing the applicant’s claim. it held that, owing to his failure to pay for the costs of the expert report, the court had not been able to establish the exact amount of the monthly payments. in its reasoning, the first-instance court stated that the vukovar county court, in its decision of 11 november 2008, had awarded the applicant hrk 20,000 for the violation of his right to a trial within a reasonable time, and that he could have paid for the costs of the expert witness with that money. the applicant lodged an appeal, claiming that the amount awarded to him for the violation of his right to a trial within a reasonable time had been paid to him on 13 march 2009, namely after the first-instance judgment had already been delivered. on 4 february 2010 the second-instance court upheld the first‑instance judgment. the applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court, and on 11 july 2012 the constitutional court declared it inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded.

“with regard to an action in tort based on the unlawful acts that were allegedly committed in tunisia by the defendants, to the claimant’s detriment, the swiss courts do not have territorial jurisdiction under international law to examine the complaint, given that the defendants are not domiciled or habitually resident in switzerland, and given also that no illegal act or detrimental outcome occurred in switzerland, pursuant to sections 2 and 129 of the ldip.” his appeal was rejected in a judgment of 15 september 2006. by a judgment of 22 may 2007, the reasoning of which was notified to the applicant on 7 september 2007, the federal supreme court dismissed the appeal. reiterating the reasoning in the first-instance judgment, the federal supreme court considered that the swiss courts did not in any event have territorial jurisdiction. 3.2 in this instance, the jurisdiction of the swiss authorities cannot be derived from the general rule concerning the international jurisdiction of the state of domicile of the defendant contained in section 2 of the ldip, since the respondents are not domiciled in switzerland. the application of this rule for assigning jurisdiction thus calls for three cumulative conditions to be met: firstly, the swiss authorities do not have jurisdiction under another provision; secondly, legal proceedings in another country are impossible or cannot reasonably be required; and, thirdly, the case in question has a sufficient connection with switzerland. in the present case, the first condition is indisputably fulfilled. however, section 3 lays down an exception to this principle. it is for the claimant or the appellant to demonstrate this impossibility. where there are several competing fora in switzerland, it is the first authority before which an action is brought that has jurisdiction. an interpretation which deviates from the literal meaning of a text expressed in clear terms is allowable only where there are objective reasons for considering that the text fails to convey the true meaning of the provision concerned. such reasons may derive from the drafting history, from the aim and sense of the provision concerned and from the structure and layout of the law. in this regard, the “cause” of the action is the basis of the claim [“base de la prétention”] (‘streitgrund” rather than “sachverhalt”), though it should be noted that the legal writers are in some disagreement as to the content and scope of that basis. in other words, it is the “cause” – which concerns the set of facts and the legal argumentation – rather than the person of the applicant which must have a sufficient connection with switzerland. in the present case, however, the claimant complains of acts of torture that were allegedly committed in tunisia, by tunisians resident in tunisia, against a tunisian residing in italy. section 8 provided for the establishment of specialised divisions in the courts of first instance, composed of judges who would receive special training in transitional justice. the commission was currently dealing with over 60,000 cases. according to the information received, it was foreseen that selected cases would be transmitted to the courts at a later stage in the investigation process. the applicant has not contested these submissions by the swiss government (see paragraphs 31-35 above).
the applicant company is a privately owned company registered in danilovgrad, montenegro. in july 2004 a call for tender for hotel “otrant” in montenegro was issued. the deadline for submitting bids was october 2004. together with three other companies, the applicant company took part in the tendering process. on 30 november 2004, however, it was informed that the tender was awarded to another bidder. on an unspecified date in december 2004, the applicant company objected to this decision. on 29 december 2004 the commercial court in podgorica (privredni sud u podgorici) rejected the applicant company’s objection. on 28 january 2006 the court of appeal quashed this decision and remitted the case to the first instance. on 15 june 2006 the commercial court ruled against the applicant company. this decision was served on the applicant company on 8 september 2009. on 26 march 2010 the court of appeal upheld the decision of the commercial court. the decision of the court of appeal was served on the applicant company’s lawyer on 27 april 2010. on 15 july 2010 the applicant company lodged an initiative urging the supreme public prosecutor’s office (vrhovno državno tužilaštvo) to file a request for the protection of legality (zahtjev za zaštitu zakonitosti), but this motion was rejected on 21 july 2010. on 30 july 2010 the applicant company lodged a constitutional appeal. on 14 october 2010 the constitutional court rejected this appeal as having been lodged out of time.
the applicants live in stobreč (application no. the legislation of the former yugoslavia, in particular section 29 of the 1980 basic property act (see paragraph 53 below), prohibited the acquisition of ownership of socially owned property[1] by adverse possession (dosjelost). given that the statutory period for acquiring ownership by adverse possession had elapsed, the applicants claimed to have acquired ownership of the land. their statement of claim (tužba) read as follows:
“plots of land nos. evidence: extract from the cadastre, testimony of the witness n.p., by a judgment of 20 september 2004 the municipal court ruled in favour of the applicants. consequently, in the applicants’ case that period had elapsed in 1932. the court] therefore considers that the period of 20 years is required and sufficient to acquire ownership of immovable property by adverse possession.” in a judgment of 17 may 2007 the split county court (županijski sud u splitu) reversed the first-instance judgment and dismissed the applicants’ action. the applicants then, on 23 july 2007, lodged a constitutional complaint against the second-instance judgment alleging infringements of their constitutional rights to equality before the law, equality before the courts and fair procedure. in the civil proceedings ... it was established that ... the complainants ... had been in continuous exclusive possession of the disputed property since at least 1912 and in good faith. in the examination of the constitutional complaint ... one has to take note of the fact that section 388(4) of the 1996 property act was invalidated by the constitutional court’s decision of [17 november 1999] ... [i]n that decision the constitutional court held that possessing socially owned property in the period before 8 october 1991 cannot be taken into account in calculating the time-limit for acquiring ownership by adverse possession. 866/35 (...) ...
evidence: [the three sale and purchase agreements between the plaintiffs and the above mentioned individuals]
the plaintiffs immediately, upon the conclusion of the above sale and purchase agreements entered into possession of all the immovable property listed above. they remained in possession of it until the present day. the respondent authority shall within 15 days, on pain of enforcement, provide the plaintiffs with the document containing clausula intabulandi necessary to record the right of ownership in the land register and delete that right as registered to date in the name of the respondent authority’s legal predecessor, the stobreč municipality. otherwise, this judgment shall replace [such document]. the relevant part of that judgment reads as follows:
“in the response to the action the respondent denied the claim because the property in question had been [in] social ownership and because, pursuant to the constitutional court’s decision invalidating section 388(4) of the [1996 property act], possessing socially owned property in the period before 8 october 1991 cannot be taken into account in calculating the time-limit for acquiring title to property by adverse possession. in a decision of 15 september 2011, the constitutional court dismissed their constitutional complaint and on 4 october 2011 it served its decision on their representative. given that the time-limit for acquiring ownership of property socially owned on 8 october 1991 did not run in the period between 6 april 1941 and 8 october 1991 (which view the constitutional court expressed in decision u‑iii‑1595/2006 of 5 february 2009), the court finds that the legal views expressed in the contested judgment of the county court are based on a constitutionally acceptable interpretation and application of the relevant substantive law.” 1 to the convention and article 14 of the convention. in the application form in the jakeljić case (no. 22768/12) the applicants also added:
“before that court the applicants’ representative had lodged the application in the ... [case of radomilja and others], which the court has registered under no. accordingly, the applicants could not have had legitimate expectations that the said provision would be applied in their case and that their claim to be declared the owners of the property in question would be granted (see radomilja and others, cited above, § 43, and jakeljić, cited above, § 37). ...
... in the trgo case, the applicant brought a civil action in 1997 to determine the right of ownership due to the expiry of the time-limit for adverse possession. (b)  the applicants’ observations in reply 36. “... the court has specified that the case of trgo v. croatia is relevant case-law [; this] case does not have the same factual and legal background as the present [one]. ...
besides, from the government submissions on the merits it follows that they do not comment on the fact ..., ... which is one of the grounds of this application, that in accordance with the [case-law of the] domestic courts the time-period necessary for acquiring ownership of immovable property in social ownership by adverse possession is 20 years, which has to elapse by 6 april 1941. ...
however, if the view that the [land in question] was socially-owned on 8 october 1991 is to be accepted, even though in the land register it was not registered as such in accordance with the [relevant regulations concerning registration of the property in the state and social ownership], then it was, in accordance with the cited statutory provisions, necessary to take into account the entire period of possession until the bringing of the civil action, except [the period] between 6 april 1941 and 8 october 1991. if that view is not to be accepted, they have definitely acquired ownership by taking into account the period after 8 october 1991 in which period they have retained uninterrupted peaceful possession of [the land in question] until the present day. in support of their arguments the government emphasised that in their reply the applicants admitted that section 388(4) of the 1996 property act (see paragraphs 56-57 below) as well as the constitutional court’s decision of 17 november 1999 (see paragraph 15 above) had no significance in their cases and expressly argued that the cases had a factual and legal background different from the trgo case (see radomilja and others, cited above, § 44, and jakeljić, cited above, § 38).
the applicant is an economics professor and a journalist in turkey. prior to the attempted military coup of 15 july 2016, he presented a political discussion programme on can erzincan tv, a television channel that was closed down following the adoption of legislative decree no. 668, issued on 27 july 2016 in connection with the state of emergency (see paragraphs 14-18 below). during the night of violence, more than 300 people were killed and more than 2,500 were injured. several criminal investigations were subsequently initiated by the appropriate prosecuting authorities in relation to suspected members of that organisation. on 21 july 2016 the turkish authorities gave notice to the secretary general of the council of europe of a derogation from the convention under article 15. the applicant remained in police custody for twelve days at the istanbul police anti-terrorist branch. during his first five days in custody, he was not permitted to speak to his lawyers. on 20 september 2016, while at the police station, the applicant stated that he was asserting his right to remain silent. regarding the bank account, some years previously he had taught for three months at a private university, which had asked him to open an account at the bank in question for payment of his wages. lastly, the one-dollar bill was of no special significance. onun ne zaman torbadan elini çıkaracağı, nasıl elini çıkaracağı belli değil”). in a decision of 10 october 2016 the istanbul 2nd magistrate’s court dismissed the objection. on various dates the applicant lodged further applications seeking his release pending trial. according to the documents produced by the parties, the applications were all rejected by the competent magistrates’ courts, for example on 10 and 24 november 2016 and 8 december 2016. he sought the applicant’s conviction for the offences with which he was charged. besides the evidence he had already submitted when the bill of indictment had been filed, the public prosecutor also produced messages sent by other suspected members of fetö/pdy via bylock, an encrypted messaging service allegedly used by members of that organisation. the criminal proceedings are still ongoing in the national courts. on 8 november 2016 the applicant lodged an individual application with the constitutional court. on 11 january 2018 the constitutional court gave a judgment (no. the constitutional court observed that, as well as having published the above-mentioned articles and made the statements in question, the applicant was accused of holding an account with bank asya, having avoided a criminal investigation through the connivance of members of the national police suspected of belonging to fetö/pdy, and having in his possession a united states one-dollar bill with an “f” serial number. however, having regard to the length of the applicant’s detention and the documents available to it, the constitutional court held that his complaint that he had been detained for political purposes, on grounds other than those provided for by the constitution, lacked a sufficient basis. as to the complaint of a lack of independence and impartiality on the part of the magistrates who had ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention, the constitutional court dismissed it as being manifestly ill-founded, on the grounds that the magistrates were appointed by the high council of judges and prosecutors and were entitled to the same constitutional safeguards as other judges. accordingly, it declared this complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded. the constitutional court noted that the applicant and his lawyer had been present at the hearing on 22 september 2016, following which the applicant had been placed in pre-trial detention. it observed that he had lodged an objection against his detention on 28 september 2016, that the objection had been dismissed on 10 october 2016 and that eighteen days had thus elapsed between his previous appearance in court and the dismissal of his objection. 6216 on the establishment and rules of procedure of the constitutional court (“law no. on 12 january 2018 the applicant lodged an objection with a view to securing his release, submitting a copy of the constitutional court’s judgment of 11 january 2018 as published on the court’s website. noting firstly that the examination of the merits of an individual application to the constitutional court against a judicial decision entailed determining whether there had been a violation of fundamental rights and what measures would be appropriate to put an end to the violation, and secondly that grounds of appeal on points of law could not be examined by the constitutional court in the context of an individual application, it found that the constitutional court did not have jurisdiction to assess the evidence in the case file. 2016/23672 was not in compliance with the law.
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in kharkiv, ukraine. on 29 december 2006 the leninskiy district court of dnepropetrovsk, ukraine, ordered to arrest and bring the applicant to the court in order to determine the preventive measure during the investigation of his alleged robbery. the applicant’s name was put on the international list of wanted persons. on 26 september 2007 the applicant was arrested in moscow. as the applicant was a russian national, he was released. on 14 october 2007 the ukrainian authorities sought the applicant’s extradition from russia in relation to the criminal proceedings against him. on 21 december 2007 the russian federal migration authority concluded that the applicant had fraudulently obtained his russian passport by falsifying a number of documents. they ordered to seize his passport and put his name on the federal wanted list. the applicant’s subsequent attempts to challenge the federal migration authority’s decision on his russian passport were unsuccessful. on 13 may 2008 the applicant was arrested. on 15 may 2008 a prosecutor authorised his detention considering that the decision of 29 december 2006 of the leninskiy district court of dnepropetrovsk had authorised the applicant’s “placement into custody”, as mentioned in article 61 § 1 of the minsk convention. on 24 june 2008 a district prosecutor decided that the applicant should be “placed in custody” considering that the decision of the leninskiy district court of dnepropetrovsk of 29 december 2006 authorised “placement into custody”, as required under article 466 § 2 of the russian code of criminal procedure (“the ccrp”). on several occasions the applicant unsuccessfully complained about his detention to the prosecuting authorities. on 4 september 2008 the perovskiy district court of moscow dismissed the applicant’s complaint considering that his arrest and detention in relation to the ukrainian extradition request had been and remained lawful. on 24 november 2008 the moscow city court upheld this decision of 4 september 2008 concluding that “matters relating to lawfulness and reasons for detention should be raised under another procedure prescribed by law”. on 3 october 2008 the russian prosecutor general’s office granted the extradition request. on 18 november 2008 the moscow city court confirmed the decision of 3 october 2008. on 29 january 2009 the supreme court of russia upheld the judgment of 18 november 2008 on appeal. on 20 may 2009 the applicant was transferred to the ukrainian authorities in the town of kharkov. on 26 may 2009 he was transferred to the town of dnepropetrovsk. on 6 june 2009 a ukrainian court refused to order the applicant’s detention pending the investigation.
the applicant was born in 1929 and lives in st petersburg. on 2 february 2001 the town court dismissed the claims. on 23 april 2001 this decision was upheld on appeal by the supreme court of the republic of sakha (yakutiya) (“the supreme court”). on 11 may 2005 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal and upheld the judgment of 2 february 2001. on 17 may 2006 the town court again dismissed the applicant’s claims. on 21 august 2006 the supreme court set aside the judgment of 17 may 2006 on appeal and remitted the case for a new examination, as the lower court had misapplied the national law. on 12 february 2007 the supreme court found the decision of 18 december 2006 to award the applicant money unlawful and unreasoned, quashed the decision and yet again remitted the case for a new examination. twice, on 26 april 2007 and 7 september 2007, the town court dismissed the applicant’s claims. each time, on 18 july 2007 and 19 may 2008, respectively, the judgment of the town court was set aside on appeal, and the case was remitted for a new examination. in the first set of the proceedings, the appellate court found the judgment unlawful, and requested to bring into the proceedings the municipality “nizhnekolymskiy rayon”. in the second set of the proceedings, the appellate court found that the applicant had not been duly summoned to the hearing, and that the municipality should have been joined to the proceedings as a defendant rather than a third party. it ordered the government of the republic of sakha (yakutiya) to pay the applicant rub 1,812,838.10 from the federal budget funds allocated for the housing subsidies for persons leaving the high north regions. on 17 november 2008 the judgment of 23 september 2008 was upheld on appeal by the supreme court. on 25 november 2010 the applicant requested the writ of execution in respect of the judgment of the town court of 23 september 2008. on 10 february 2010 a writ of execution was issued. on unspecified dates, the applicant submitted the writ of execution, first, to the department of the federal treasury and, second, to the ministry of finance of the republic of sakha (yakutiya). on 13 april and 8 june 2011 respectively the writ of execution was returned to the applicant as the debtor had no accounts at these bodies. on 30 august 2011 the decision of 29 july 2011 was set aside and the bailiffs’ service refused institution of enforcement proceedings with the reasoning that as the enforcement document required recovery of public budgetary funds, it could not be enforced by the bailiffs’ service. on 8 february 2012 the district court clarified the judgment of 23 september 2008. on an unspecified date the applicant on one more occasion sent the writ of execution to the department of the federal treasury. on 26 april 2012 the writ was returned to him for the debtor had no account at the treasury. on 10 july 2012 the bailiffs’ service received the writ of execution and opened the enforcement proceedings. on 10 september 2012 the enforcement proceedings were terminated for the debtor had no property that the debt could be recovered from. on the same date the bailiff responsible for the execution of the judgment issued an act establishing that there were grounds for returning the writ of execution to the creditor. according to this document, the debtor, the government of the republic of sakha (yakutiya), was a collective executive body, without the status of a legal entity or any property on their balance sheet. the judgment of 23 september 2008 remained unenforced. on 29 november 2010 the applicant lodged a claim under the compensation act (see the domestic law part below). he complained that the civil proceedings in his case against the government of the republic of sakha (yakutiya) had been unreasonably long, and asked for a compensation in that respect. on 20 december 2010 a judge of the supreme court of russia ordered that the application should be returned to the applicant with the reasoning that the proceedings complained of ended on 17 november 2008, i.e. before the entry into force of the compensation act. on 15 march 2011 the applicant’s special appeal against the above decision was dismissed by the supreme court of russia.
the applicant is a journalist who had been working since 2002 for the daily newspaper zaman, which was viewed as the principal publication medium of the “gülenist” network and was closed down following the adoption of legislative decree no. 668, issued on 27 july 2016 in connection with the state of emergency (see paragraphs 14-18 below). from 2001 onwards, he also lectured on comparative politics and turkish political history at a private university in istanbul. in the years leading up to the attempted military coup of 15 july 2016 the applicant had been known for his critical views on the serving government’s policies. during the night of violence, more than 300 people were killed and more than 2,500 were injured. several criminal investigations were subsequently initiated by the appropriate prosecuting authorities in relation to suspected members of that organisation. on 20 july 2016 the government declared a state of emergency for a period of three months as from 21 july 2016; the state of emergency was subsequently extended for further periods of three months by the council of ministers, chaired by the president, most recently with effect from 19 january 2018. on 21 july 2016 the turkish authorities gave notice to the secretary general of the council of europe of a derogation from the convention under article 15. during the questioning the applicant denied that he belonged to an illegal organisation. on the same day, several editors and columnists of the daily newspaper zaman, including the applicant, were brought before the istanbul 4th magistrate’s court. the magistrate questioned the applicant about his alleged acts and the accusations against him. at the end of the hearing, the magistrate, taking into account the contents of the articles written by the applicant – and finding that they had promoted the terrorist organisation in question, even after 17 december 2013 – ordered his pre-trial detention. he noted in that connection that although criminal proceedings had been instituted against e.d. ( on 5 august 2016 the applicant lodged an objection against the order for his pre-trial detention. in his view, the applicant’s articles accusing the president of turkey of being a dictator and calling for him to leave office had contributed to propaganda of that kind. on 8 september 2016 the applicant lodged an individual application with the constitutional court. on that account he asked the constitutional court to indicate an interim alternative measure to detention, thus allowing him to be released pending trial. in a decision of 26 october 2016 the constitutional court refused to apply an interim measure of that kind. it added that should there be a change in his health or the conditions of his detention, he would be entitled to make a further application for an interim measure to secure his release. on 11 january 2018 the constitutional court gave a judgment (no. however, he had maintained that it was unfair to accuse all members of the gülenist movement. it held that he had been expressing opinions on a topical issue that were similar to those of the opposition leaders. in the constitutional court’s view, the investigating authorities had been unable to demonstrate any factual basis that might indicate that the applicant had been acting in accordance with the aims of fetö/pdy. it observed, however, that if it were accepted that people could be placed in pre-trial detention without any strong evidence that they had committed an offence, the guarantees of the right to liberty and security would be meaningless. lastly, it found that it was clear that the applicant’s pre-trial detention could have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and of the press, in so far as it had not been based on any concrete evidence other than his articles (see paragraph 140 of the constitutional court’s judgment). the applicant did not submit a claim for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage. accordingly, the constitutional court made no award under that head. the constitutional court found no causal link between the violation established and the damage alleged on that account and dismissed the claim. as the applicant was still in pre-trial detention on the date of delivery of its judgment, the constitutional court decided to transmit the judgment to the istanbul 13th assize court so that it could take “the necessary action”. however, noting that the constitutional court’s judgments were final and binding on the assize court, he expressed the view that the applicant’s release should be ordered.
the applicant was born in 1945 and lives in naxxar. the applicant served as a member of parliament between 1976 and 1996, and he served as a government minister between 1987 and 1996. upon his retirement from parliament the applicant began writing weekly opinion columns in the newspaper maltatoday and another weekly paper. who chose to speak about a pending police investigation, about an anonymous email that i received and about a threatening letter that i received... this is a level which should not be acceptable in our country. and whoever is behind these stories – wherever he might be – and let me be clear – wherever he might be – he should be ashamed...ashamed! ...
yes i received an anonymous email...and i received threatening letters last november. today they were told by maltatoday...i can tell them myself...but when something illegal occurs, i go to the police. because what is illegal, i condemn it, and we as a party always condemned illegality. and [other purveyors of] this type of journalism, that when they saw [that] there is a police investigation, is it you, you decide what is illegal and what is not [?] words to that effect have been said by an employee of our party for weeks...at the centre...for weeks. the article started off by stating that an innocent email sent to the deputy leader of the mlp had been passed on to the police, who in turn had identified the sender and subsequently questioned him. replied that “he would not confirm nor deny” that he was aware of the case. on 13 may 2007 maltatoday published an opinion by the applicant entitled “policing one’s enemies”, prompted by the above-mentioned speech, in which the applicant queried the manner in which the two main political parties perceived the police force. the police force, i believe, is simply responsible for making sure that people obey the law, for protecting people and property and for arresting criminals. matters are even more worrying because when the police successfully traced the original writer and dispatcher of the e-mail, they impounded his computer and obliged him to go and sign daily at the police headquarters even though he was not accused of any crime. ...
“so what is the government doing about this? as well as the transcript of the deputy leader’s speech and copies of two articles, both entitled “email sent to deputy leader brings an admirer before the police” (one having been published online and one in print). had showed him a letter which the cop considered to be “injurious and full of threats” towards m.f.; whether he intended to initiate proceedings against the person who should result to be responsible, given that the prosecution of such a crime would require the injured party to lodge a complaint;
- the documents which had been passed on to the cop had in turn been passed on to the criminal investigation department (c.i.d.) concerning the case, which had not been given any particular priority on his part. the court referred to the cop’s witness testimony to explain the factual situation. - the court also referred to the statements made by the cop (see above). according to the applicant, from the speech delivered by m.f. publicly (at the labour centre in rabat), it transpired that there was a certain familiarity between him and the cop; indeed if that had not been so m.f. had thus exceeded the limits of just criticism. he argued, in substance, that his opinion piece had consisted of criticism, which was a legitimate manner of expressing an opinion about the work of a public figure and was allowed in a democratic society ‑ noting that the extensive protection given to such a public figure served to silence free expression. he further claimed that the ordinary courts had referred to insinuations and allegations which had not been made or implied by the applicant in his article, such as the statement by the court of magistrates to the effect that m.f. by a judgment of 30 march 2012 the civil court (first hall) in its constitutional competence dismissed the applicant’s claims. ’s actions, which had resulted in an individual being investigated and subsequently having his computer seized. in its view, even accepting that a public person was subject to greater limits of acceptable criticism, given the article at issue, the ordinary courts had not failed to strike a fair balance between the competing rights.
68125/14 (wetjen) are a mother and father and their son, born in 2011. 72204/15 (schott) are a mother and father and their three daughters, born in 1999, 2002 and 2004 respectively. all the applicants are members of the twelve tribes church (zwölf stämme) who lived in a community of around 100 members of the church in klosterzimmern. on 16 august 2013 the local youth office and the nördlingen family court received video footage from a television reporter showing ten different instances of corporal punishment in the community. the footage, filmed with a hidden camera, showed the caning of various children between the ages of three and twelve. none of the applicants was shown in the video footage. according to the television reporter, the person who carried out the punishment was not, in most cases, a parent of the child being punished. after receiving the video footage, the family court initiated a preliminary investigation and on 21 august 2013 heard six witnesses, all former members of the twelve tribes community. on 1 september 2013 the nördlingen family court, upon an application by the competent youth office, made an interlocutory order regarding all children in the twelve tribes community, including the applicant children. on 5 september 2013 the youth office took the community’s children into care. the applicant children were subsequently examined but no physical signs of abuse or beating were revealed. since the applicant j. wetjen was then only two years and five months old and was still being breastfed, he and his mother were housed together temporarily in a home under supervision. on 9 december 2013 j. wetjen was taken from his mother and placed in a foster family. the mother had been ordered to wean her son two months beforehand. however, since she refused, the son was taken from her by force. they refused to answer any questions about caning, but quoted passages from the bible, which justified such a practice. on 29 november 2013 the family court upheld its interlocutory order of 1 september 2013. the court based its assessment on the submissions of the parents, in which they had confirmed that they had disciplined their son. the court found that the statements by other children in parallel proceedings, the video footage and the statements of other witnesses confirmed that the disciplining of children in the community would include corporal punishment. therefore, it was necessary to take the son out of the community as the option which least infringed the family’s rights, but which ensured that he would not be caned or harmed in any other way. it held that even if the parents might be able to resist pressure from the community, they would not be able to ensure that other community members would not cane the child when supervising him. the court also initiated the main custody proceedings and commissioned a psychologist’s expert opinion on the family. on 5 march 2014 the munich court of appeal upheld the family court’s decision in essence. the family court examined the applicant children on 9 october 2013. all three daughters stated that they would like to return to their parents and the community. the oldest daughter confirmed that her two sisters had been caned and that she herself had been caned when she was younger. the applicant parents were examined on 15 november 2013. on 30 november 2013 the family court revoked its interlocutory order of 1 september 2013 concerning the parents’ right to decide on the oldest daughter’s place of residence and health, but upheld the rest of the decision. the appeal by the applicants in application no. 68125/14 was declared inadmissible by the court of appeal on 4 june 2014 for being belated.
11308/16 (tlapak) are a mother and father. their two daughters a. and b. were born on 7 october 2009 and their son g. was born on 23 may 2013. a second community with around 100 members was located in the nearby village of klosterzimmern. furthermore, statements by a former member of the community were published, confirming that children had been punished with rods. on 3 september 2013 the ansbach family court, upon an application by the competent youth office, made an interlocutory order regarding all children in the twelve tribes community in wörnitz, including the applicants’ children. the applicants’ children were subsequently examined but no physical signs of abuse or beating were revealed. j. tlapak was subsequently placed in a foster family. as he was still being breastfed, his mother was permitted daily visits to give him milk. their aunt’s family was approved as fosterers and they were then placed with them. since g. pingen was then only one year and four months old and was also still being breastfed, he and his mother were placed together in a foster family. on 13 september 2013 the ansbach family court heard the applicants and on 23 september 2013 it upheld its order of 3 september 2013 in an interim decision. this, the expert concluded, would significantly jeopardise the son’s development and result in psychological problems. consequently, less intrusive measures could not be considered sufficient. on 4 august 2014, the family court forwarded the privately commissioned expert opinion to the court-appointed expert, who responded to the criticism and gave details of his methodology in a letter of 15 august 2014. however, the applicants and the youth office did not agree on a settlement owing in particular to a disagreement about the son attending a state school and play therapy. the youth office considered those aspects as essential and declined the partial settlement proposed by the applicants. based, in particular, on the court‑commissioned expert opinion and the statements by the applicants during the court proceedings, the court concluded that there was a high, concrete probability that the son would be subjected to corporal punishment using physical objects over the course of several years. the court also held that the risk to the child could not be averted using less drastic measures. in regard to the fact that the applicants had withdrawn their consent to being examined by the court-appointed expert after the expert opinion had already been submitted, both for themselves and their child, the court held that this did not render the expert’s report unusable in the proceedings. allowing parents to reject expert opinions they disagreed with by retrospectively withdrawing consent to an examination would prevent any effective protection of children in family court proceedings. the court of appeal, after hearing the applicants, their son, the son’s guardian ad litem, a representative of the youth office, the court‑appointed expert and the expert commissioned by the applicants, dismissed the applicants’ appeal on 26 may 2015. the court emphasised that not all individual violations of the right to a non-violent upbringing under article 1631 § 2 of the civil code (see paragraph 54 below) could justify a withdrawal of parental authority. it was of no relevance whether or not lasting physical injuries occurred. he expected that such methods would likely result in psychological issues. in a hearing of 29 september 2014 the parties discussed an agreement between the applicants and the youth office, with the aim of returning the daughters to the applicants and protecting all three children. the severe interference with the applicants’ right to a family under article 6 of the basic law (see paragraph 53 below) by separating them from their children was nonetheless not only justified but also proportionate since the risk to the children could not be averted using milder means. the applicants subsequently appealed against the decision of the family court and applied for an interim measure to suspend the order to hand their son over to the youth office. the court was convinced that the applicants would continue to use corporal punishment on their children in the future since that parenting method was already firmly established and was based on religious beliefs from which the applicants had not fundamentally distanced themselves. their statements had shown that they, in essence, continued to approve of corporal punishment and considered it an appropriate parenting method. in the court’s opinion, the applicants were only prepared to refrain temporarily from corporal punishment.
at the time of the events he was a district police officer in the kalyninskyy district police in horlivka. as of february 2014, he has been serving a prison sentence in menska prison no. she lives in horlivka with her mother, the third applicant, who was born in 1951. the first applicant expressed wish to pursue his mother’s complaints on her behalf. at the night from 18 to 19 june 2008, shortly after midnight, the second applicant had a conflict with a police officer, m., who was a colleague of her husband. having turned, she saw m., whom she knew. m. threatened him in a rude manner with dismissal. however, eventually she specified that m. had not been strangling the second applicant, but had simply held her and not let her leave. they met two colleagues of m. and stopped to talk with them. however, having approached her, he realised that he had been mistaken. he recognised the second applicant and apologised for his mistake. as regards the fact that the plastic bag that she had had in her hands had been torn, he explained it by her intense gesticulating. she was diagnosed with several bruises on her neck and situational neurosis. the second applicant contested that submission. those injuries, assessed as insignificant, had resulted from “contact with blunt objects” at the time indicated by the second applicant. on 9 october 2008 a forensic medical expert examination report was issued. she stated that he had been living separately from her for about two years and that she was not aware of his whereabouts. on 25 march 2009 the first applicant complained to the pgo that his numerous requests for the kalyninskyy prosecutor to withdraw had been ignored. it was also noted in the arrest report that the first applicant was suspected of offences under articles 364 § 3 (abuse of power or office by a law-enforcement official), 366 § 1 (forgery in office) and 368 § 2 (bribe-taking) of the criminal code. on 21 july 2009 the donetsk regional court of appeal (“the court of appeal”) quashed the ruling of 3 july 2009 and released the first applicant subject to an undertaking not to leave the town. on 12 september 2008 the investigator applied to the kalyninskyy court for authorisation to search the second applicant’s registered residence (the flat of the third applicant). the text of the application was identical to that submitted on 10 september 2008 (see paragraph 59 above). as she and her husband refused to cooperate, the police left. as indicated in the search report, it lasted from 5.20 p.m. to 7.04 p.m. the police seized a number of documents related to the first applicant’s work. furthermore, they seized a mobile telephone, which did not have a sim card, together with its box. lastly, they found and seized a package appearing to contain cannabis. according to the third applicant, it had been planted by the police. on 7 october 2008 the kalyninskyy court allowed another application to search the first applicant’s registered residence (the flat of the fourth applicant) given that the investigator had information that the first applicant might be hiding there. the third and fourth applicants also complained many times to the prosecution authorities of the unlawfulness of the searches. on 5 june 2006 a local heating company initiated civil proceedings against the first and fourth applicants, who had their registered domicile at the same address, for debt recovery.
the applicant was born in 1965 and is currently detained in czarne prison in poland. on 24 january 2011 the court imposed four sentences ranging from six months’ to two years’ imprisonment, to run concurrently from 5 september 2010. he stated that the cells were cold and lacked adequate light. furthermore, there were no toilets in the cells. the government submitted that the applicant had been detained from 14 september 2010 until his release on 18 may 2012 in three different parts of nicosia central prisons. between 14 september 2010 and 24 january 2011 he had been detained in block 5, which accommodated remand prisoners. following his conviction and sentence he had been transferred to block 2b, where he had been detained between 24 january 2011 and 5 october 2011. on the latter date he had been placed in block 2a, where he had been detained until his release on 18 may 2012. however, they submitted that no records were kept in relation to occupancy of particular cells in the blocks. (a)  block 5: 14 september 2010-24 january 2011 11. block 5 included block 5a, which had twenty-three double occupancy cells of the same size as block 5, accommodating forty-three remand prisoners. it was almost certain that during his detention in block 5 the applicant had shared a cell with another inmate and that therefore he had had 3.10 sq. at the time the applicant had been detained there block 2b had not yet been renovated. m, which accommodated five to seven detainees, and a common room which had been made into a dormitory for between twenty and fifty inmates. block 2b had six toilets and six showers. based on the daily occupancy records for the relevant period, the number of inmates in the block varied from 80 to 124 per day. the government stated that it was possible that the applicant had spent time in all the different types of cells in this block during his detention. m of personal space; in the larger cell he would have had from approximately 2.8 to 3.9 sq. m of personal space, depending on the number of inmates detained there with him. (c)  block 2a: 5 october 2011-18 may 2012 14. there were six toilets, six showers and three urinals. (d)  additional information regarding the general conditions in the blocks 15. the various parts of the prison were equipped with a central heating system which covered all the blocks and cells. the central air conditioning system which functioned in the summer months was in the corridors and there were individual electrical fans in the cells. all the cells had properly insulated windows, which provided natural light and ventilation. following the 2012 report of the european committee for the prevention of torture (“cpt”) on its visit to cyprus from 12 to 19 may 2008, the prison administration discontinued the practice of switching off cell bells during the night, hence detainees had access to the toilets during those hours (see paragraphs 26-27 and 30 below). the administration of the prison had issued order no. 32/2008 concerning prisoners having access to the toilet facilities whenever necessary. a violation of the order constituted a disciplinary offence. according to a letter by the prison director dated 27 february 2014, records were not kept of when cells were opened for toilet visits during the night, that is between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. however, a detainee could leave his cell for up to three toilet visits during that period.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in moscow. he is a former fsb (russian security service) officer. on 13 september 2004 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the applicant’s conviction on appeal. ik-13 in nizhniy tagil, sverdlovsk region, located approximately 1,800 km away from his family home in moscow. the government did not submit a copy of this decision. the court heard a representative of the prison administration and the prosecutor, who considered the applicant’s release on parole to be possible. the prosecutor did not appeal and on 29 august 2005 the relevant decision became final. on 30 august 2005 the applicant was released. the court relied on the relevant provision of the rules of criminal procedure which provided for such reinstatement if there had been a delay of at least five days before a party to the proceedings had received a copy of the impugned decision. on 18 september 2005 a group of police officers broke arrested the applicant in his flat in moscow. on 21 september 2005 the applicant was transported back to correctional settlement facility no. ik-13 and was placed in a disciplinary cell. on 24 november 2005 the district court re-examined the applicant’s application for parole and dismissed it. on 15 march 2006 the regional court upheld the decision of 24 november 2005 on appeal. he was released from the facility on 30 august 2005. on 30 september 2005 he was transferred to one of the dormitories. m and was equipped with four sleeping places. the cell was equipped with both natural and artificial ventilation. he was allowed two hours’ exercise per day in a specially designated area. the metal bars on the windows did not prevent daylight from entering the cell. the electric light in the cell was on constantly and at night low-voltage bulbs were used to maintain lighting. there was a tank with boiled potable water. the distance between the toilet and the dining table/nearest sleeping place was at least 1.5 m. hygiene and food provision both met the statutory standards. 8 measured 2.5 m by 3.5 m and housed between 3 and 7 inmates. a large part of the cell was occupied by a cupboard where mattresses and pillows were stored during the daytime. the cell was infested with mice and woodlice. in the summer, the cell was very hot and humid and the ventilation did not work. food was of very poor quality and scarce. the daily outdoor exercise lasted between fifteen and forty minutes. he further informed the applicant that, following a report by the prosecutor, the administration had made the necessary arrangements to set up a proper quarantine area in the facility.
the applicant, mr sergey marksovich dudin, is a russian national, who was born in 1962 and lives in parfino, novgorod region. he is represented before the court by mr k. v. pakin, a lawyer practising in velikiy novgorod. the facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. on 23 july 2007 the applicant was apprehended by police at the cargo terminal “shushary” in saint petersburg under suspicion of robbery. later that day he was transferred to krestsy, novgorod region. on 25 july 2007 the krestetskiy district court of novgorod region (the district court) ordered pre-trial detention of the applicant. subsequently the period of the applicant’s detention was extended on 20 september and 2 november 2007. in the order of 2 november 2007 the district court authorised extension of the applicant’s detention “until and including 24 december 2007”. on 11 december 2007 the district court scheduled a preliminary hearing for the applicant’s trial in order to decide on his further detention. the relevant section of the operative part of the decision read as follows:
“[the court] ordered
to schedule a preliminary hearing in the criminal case of mr dudin ... on 25 december 2007 at 10.00 a.m. ...
to transfer [from the detention facility] the accused mr dudin for the hearing at the set date and time. to keep the measure of mr dudin’s restraint – pre-trial detention – unchanged.” on 25 december 2007 between 10.00 a.m. and 11.00 a.m. the district court held a preliminary hearing ordering the criminal case to be send to trial and the applicant’s further detention. during the hearing the applicant and his representative raised the objection regarding unlawfulness of the applicant’s detention between 24 december 2007 and the time of the hearing, but the district court dismissed it without advancing any specific reasons in this regard. on 21 february 2008 the novgorod regional court upheld the lower court’s decision. on 27 may 2008 the district court convicted the applicant of aggravated robbery and sentenced to six years’ imprisonment. on 10 july 2008 the conviction was upheld on appeal by the novgorod regional court and the period of the applicant’s pre-trial detention between 23 june 2007 and the day of conviction was fully counted towards execution of his sentence. on 2 march 2011 the applicant was released before serving his full sentence on probation. the applicant lodged a civil action against the ministry of finance of the russian federation seeking non-pecuniary damages for his allegedly unlawful detention without a court order between 24 and 25 december 2007. on 24 april 2008 the novgorodskiy town court of novgorod region found that between midnight 24 december 2007 and 11.00 a.m. on 25 december 2007 the applicant’s detention was unlawful and violated his rights under article 22 of the russian constitution and article 5 § 1 of the convention. the applicant was awarded non-pecuniary damages of 2000 russian roubles (50 euros). during the hearings the representative of the ministry of finance acknowledged that the applicant’s detention during the abovementioned period was not secured by a court order. the representative of the ministry of the interior (intervening in the proceedings) admitted that the authorisation for the detention expired on 24 december 2007. the representative of the regional prosecutor’s office (also intervening in the proceedings) maintained that the applicant’s detention was lawful, but stated that any detention without a court order would be unlawful. on 11 june 2008 the novgorod regional court annulled the lower court’s judgment on appeal and adopted a new judgment dismissing the applicant’s claims. the regional court argued that while the order of 2 november 2007 set the period of detention “until and including 24 december 2007”, the decision of 11 december 2007 to schedule a preliminary hearing to 25 december 2007 essentially ordered the detention until that date, because it left it “unchanged” (see paragraph 6 above).
the applicant was born in 1977 and lived in naberezhniye chelny, tatarstan republic, before his conviction of an unrelated criminal offence. on 7 april 2008 the applicant notified the executive committee of naberezhniye chelny of his intention to hold a public event in the form of a hunger strike in front of the local prosecutor’s office beginning from 21 april 2008. on the same day the applicant was informed that his notice did not comply with the requirements of the law. on 16 april 2008 the applicant lodged an addendum to his notice in which he indicated the place, the timing and the goal of the planned event as well as the information about its organiser. he also asked to ensure the protection of a tent (to be positioned near the prosecutor’s office) from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. daily and the twenty-four-hour presence of an ambulance at the venue of the event. on 17 april 2008 the head of the public relations department of the local executive committee informed the applicant that his planned public event amounted to a “picket” within the meaning of the public events act (hereinafter “pea”). in breach of the pea the notice about the event did not contain information about the number of participants or arrangements to be made for preventing disorder and providing medical aid during the event. the applicant was required to align his notice with the pea in that connection but, according to the government, he failed to do so. according to the applicant, on 22 april 2008 he started to hold a solo demonstration at noon and continued it until 4 p.m., when he was arrested by the police. according to the government, on 22 april 2008 at 3.15 p.m. the applicant set up on the lawn in front of the prosecutor’s office a tent and a poster reading “hunger strike. he gathered passers-by and voiced his claims to them. at 3.40 p.m. a police officer drew up a record of an administrative offence allegedly committed by the applicant. the case file was then submitted to a justice of the peace, who adjourned the hearing so that the applicant could retain a counsel. it is unclear whether the applicant was arrested by the police or otherwise deprived of his liberty at any moment prior to appearing before the justice of the peace. the police ordered him to terminate this allegedly unlawful public event, but he refused. they compiled an administrative offence record, stating that the applicant had committed an offence under article 19.3 § 1 of the cao; they also compiled an administrative arrest record (протокол административного задержания). on 24 april 2008 the justice of the peace of the 8th court circuit of naberezhniye chelny found the applicant guilty under article 20.2 § 1 of the cao and imposed a fine of 1,000 russian roubles ((rub), equivalent to 27 euros (eur) at the time). the court noted that the applicant had intended to hold a non-stop hunger-strike making use of posters for an indefinite period of time; on 22 april 2008 he had held an unlawful picket by way of setting up a tent and a poster reading “hunger strike. call for signatures” as well as by gathering passers-by and “campaigning” among them. in breach of the pea he had failed to specify his arrangements for preventing disorder or providing medical aid during the event. moreover, the applicant had intended to hold a twenty-four-hour picket in breach of the pea’s ban on public events between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. the court concluded that the applicant breached the procedure for the organisation of his public event. the applicant appealed to the naberezhniye chelny town court. by a decision of 7 may 2008 the town court upheld the judgment of the justice of the peace. in separate proceedings, on 7 may 2008 the justice of the peace of the 1st court circuit of naberezhniye chelny found the applicant guilty under article 19.3 § 1 of the cao. the court sentenced him to seven days of administrative detention. the applicant’s detention from 9 p.m. on 22 april to 3.35 p.m. on 24 april 2008 counted towards his sentence of administrative detention. the applicant appealed against the judgment to the naberezhniye chelny town court. on 8 may 2008 the town court upheld the judgment in a summary manner. on 3 june 2008 the applicant lodged a supervisory-review appeal against the judgment of 7 may 2008. on 8 july 2008 the deputy president of the supreme court of the tatarstan republic dismissed it, fully endorsing the findings of the lower courts.
the applicant was born in 1944 and lives in viana do castelo (portugal). the applicant is a lawyer by training and an auditor by profession. from 1993 onwards, he was no longer authorised to practise as a lawyer. this decision was published in the official gazette in june 2000. when the applicant ceased his activity as an auditor in april 2016, he continued to be suspended from the bar council’s roll until at least the end of 2016 as the result of a disciplinary sanction imposed on him for having practised as a lawyer while not being authorised to do so. on 28 february 2008, in the context of a set of civil proceedings in which he was nevertheless acting as a lawyer, the applicant criticised the decisions taken by the judge hearing the case, saying that they were not worthy of a judge and that a judge could not lie or omit the truth in the exercise of his functions. he also sought leave to replace his officially appointed defence counsel and represent himself. the court held that under the provisions of portuguese law, in particular article 32 of the constitution and articles 64 § 3 and 287 § 4 of the ccp (see paragraphs 28, 33 and 40 below), the defendant had the right to be represented by independent counsel, a right which would not be made effective if self-representation were to be allowed. on 21 december 2010 the coimbra court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. it considered the appeal to be admissible despite the fact that it had been lodged by the applicant in person, as it concerned the very issue whether the applicant, as the defendant, was entitled to conduct his own defence. it required that the defendant be assisted by defence counsel at the hearing before the investigating judge and at the trial in all cases where the proceedings concerned could give rise to a custodial sentence or a public-safety detention order. this reflected the premise that the accused would be better defended when the defence was conducted by a legal professional trained in advocacy. the latter, unencumbered by the emotional burden weighing on a defendant, could provide a lucid, dispassionate and effective defence. the law on criminal procedure was thus intended not to place limits on the defence’s action, but to support the proper defence of the accused. on 11 may 2012 the constitutional court decided that it was not necessary to adjudicate on the constitutional appeal lodged by the applicant in person, in which he had complained about the lower courts’ refusal to grant him leave to represent himself. the constitutional court found that the appeal had been neither signed nor endorsed by court-appointed defence counsel. the applicant failed to attend the hearing, at which his court-appointed counsel was present. on 12 december 2013 the baixo-vouga criminal court, following a hearing which the applicant again did not attend but at which his court‑ appointed defence lawyer was present, found the applicant guilty of aggravated insult (see paragraph 50 below) and ordered him to pay 140 day‑fines of nine euros (eur) each as well as the costs of the proceedings. the applicant, who at no point requested legal aid to cover the cost of his trial, court-appointed counsel or counsel of his own choosing, was ordered, in particular, to pay costs amounting to eur 150 for his representation by court-appointed counsel. he did not pay these costs and the execution of the cost order was later discontinued for lack of assets which could be seized. it confirmed that, as had previously been decided in a final decision, the applicant, as the defendant, did not have the right to represent himself in the proceedings. by an order dated 18 november 2014 the porto court of appeal, acting through its president, dismissed a complaint lodged by the applicant in person against the order of the baixo-vouga criminal court. it stressed that, as had also been argued by the general council of the bar association in opinion no. e-21/97 (see paragraphs 59-60 below), the provision of a criminal defence constituted a public-order interest. this was also clearly the case at the trial, taking into account, for example, the places to be occupied in the courtroom, the wearing of a gown and the cross-examination of witnesses. the court of appeal noted that the constitutional court had repeatedly confirmed, in particular in judgments nos. likewise, this approach was not in breach of the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr) or of the convention. in portugal, the accused had an array of procedural rights which went beyond the minimum standards guaranteed by these international instruments. the court of appeal explained that portuguese law on criminal procedure granted accused persons ample opportunity to defend themselves in person. according to the material before the court, the applicant did not call into question the qualifications or quality of the court-appointed lawyer at any stage in the proceedings before the domestic courts.
the applicant was born in 1963 and currently lives in alexandria (egypt). on 15 february 2010, while crossing the border between serbia and croatia with his wife, the applicant was caught by the croatian customs authorities carrying the sum of 563,300 euros (eur) which he had failed to declare, contrary to the law. the customs authorities immediately seized the eur 560,000. on the same day the customs authorities instituted administrative‑offence proceedings (prekršajni postupak) against the applicant before the financial inspectorate of the ministry of finance (ministarstvo financija, financijski inspektorat – “the ministry”) for failing to declare eur 560,000 – a sum exceeding eur 10,000 – an administrative offence defined in section 40(1) of the foreign currency act and section 74 of the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism act. in his defence, the applicant explained that he and his wife had been visiting her daughter in serbia who had recently had a serious attack of epilepsy, and submitted documentary evidence suggesting that his wife’s daughter did indeed suffer from epilepsy. the money he had been carrying originated from: (a) a company called sci (société civile immobilière) m. registered in france, of which he was the director and the only member, from whose account he had withdrawn eur 326,008.03 with a view to starting another business; and (b) the sale of their house in france (the remaining amount). the applicant submitted relevant documents as evidence of those transactions. he also explained that he had not wished to deposit the money in a bank account because, in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, he had been afraid that his bank would go bankrupt and that he would lose most of that money, given that the french state only guaranteed up to eur 50,000 of bank deposits. during the proceedings the ministry requested information from the relevant authorities in serbia, france and italy. while the italian authorities did not reply at all, the serbian authorities informed the ministry that neither the applicant nor his wife had been recorded in their register of suspicious transactions, and the french authorities only confirmed the authenticity of the transactions on which the applicant relied to prove the origin of the money he had been carrying. by a decision of 9 july 2010 the ministry found the applicant guilty of having committed the administrative offence in question and fined him 5,000 croatian kunas (hrk). at the same time, the ministry imposed a protective measure (zaštitna mjera) confiscating eur 318,500 under section 69(2) of the foreign currency act. the ministry held that the origin of the money which the applicant had failed to declare was irrelevant in relation to the commission of the offence of which he had been convicted or the imposition of the fine. however, that consideration was relevant in relation to the imposition of the protective measure of confiscation. in particular, the ministry decided not to confiscate eur 241,500 of the money which the applicant had not declared, because it found that this sum did indeed originate from the sale of his house in france. as regards the remaining eur 318,500 (of the eur 560,000 which had been seized), the ministry held that this sum was part of the funds which the applicant had withdrawn from his company’s bank account (eur 326,008.03) on 20 january 2010 (see paragraph 11 above). the ministry further held that: (a)  since there was no evidence that the applicant had borrowed that money from his company, by carrying it across border he had disposed of it as if it had belonged to him, which amounted to misappropriation of the company’s funds, an offence punishable in every country; and (b)  he had failed to pay the relevant taxes in france on that amount. it therefore decided to confiscate that sum. by a decision of 17 september 2010 the high court for administrative offences (visoki prekršajni sud republike hrvatske) dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the ministry’s decision, endorsing the reasons given therein. the applicant then, on 17 december 2010, lodged a constitutional complaint, alleging, inter alia, a violation of his constitutionally protected right of ownership. by a decision of 17 november 2011 the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible and served its decision on his representative on 2 december 2012. it found that, even though the applicant had relied on the relevant articles of the constitution in his constitutional complaint, he had not substantiated his complaint by any constitutional-law arguments, but had merely repeated the arguments raised in the proceedings before the ministry and the high court for administrative offences. therefore, the constitutional court had been unable to examine the merits of his constitutional complaint. the relevant domestic and international law and practice is summarised in the case of boljević v. croatia, no. under french law, a société civile immobilière (sci) is a civil (non‑commercial) company constituted for the ownership and management of real estate (articles 1845 to 1870-1 of the french civil code). it is a legal entity, meaning it has a legal personality distinct from that of its members. the members are, however, liable for the debts of the company without limitation, meaning that they may be liable in relation to their personal assets (article 1857 of the french civil code).
the applicant was born in 1953 and lives in yerevan. on 10 january 2005 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan ordered a search of the applicant’s apartment. on 20 june 2005 the applicant was formally charged under article 213 § 2 (1) and (2) of the cc with performing usury as a profession which resulted in dire financial consequences for the injured parties. on the same day the investigator decided, as a preventive measure, to have the applicant give a written undertaking not to leave his place of residence. on 23 june 2005 the investigator decided to confiscate for security the applicant’s property. on 10 august 2005 the investigator sent the bill of indictment to the kentron and nork-marash district prosecutor (“the prosecutor”) for approval but on 15 august 2005 the prosecutor refused to approve it and returned the case to the investigator for further investigation. on the same day this case was merged with the case on usury. on 8 and 29 december 2005 respectively the investigator ordered forensic handwriting examinations to be conducted. the results of these examinations were received on 13 and 20 january 2006 respectively. on 7 march 2006 the investigator decided to amend the applicant’s charges and to bring new charges against him under article 178 §§ 2 (2) and 3 (1), article 182 § 3 (2), article 213 § 2 (1) and (2), and article 349 § 1 of the cc on account of fraud in large and particularly large amounts, extortion in particularly large amounts, usury performed as a profession which resulted in dire financial consequences for the injured parties, and forgery of evidence. on the same date the investigator lodged an application with the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan, seeking to have the applicant detained for a period of two months, which was rejected by the district court. however, upon an appeal by the prosecutor, on 28 march 2006 the court of appeal overturned the district court’s decision and ordered the applicant’s detention for a period of two months. on 29 and 30 march and 13 april 2006 the investigator lodged applications with the district court for a search warrant and to confiscate information covered by bank secrecy. these applications were granted on 29 and 31 march and 13 april 2006. on 14 july 2006 the supervising prosecutor approved the bill of indictment and the case was sent to the district court, which took it over on 24 july 2006. by the district court’s decision of 18 august 2006 the case was set for trial. in addition, on ten occasions the hearings were adjourned because of applications by the prosecutor or on the court’s own motion, and on nine occasions because the applicant’s applications were granted. on three occasions the court decided to have the absent witnesses and/or victims brought by force to the hearing. on 9 july 2007 the district court granted an application by the applicant’s counsel to have him released on bail. on 15 october 2007 the powers of the judge in charge of the applicant’s case were suspended. on 1 november 2007 another judge took over the case and the examination of the case started anew. between 21 november 2007 and 23 december 2010, the court held forty hearings which were adjourned because of the absence of the applicant or his lawyer or because of applications lodged by them. on five occasions the court decided to have the absent witnesses and victims brought by force to the hearing. on 28 august 2009 and 12 october 2010 respectively the prosecutor decided to amend the charges and/or to bring new charges against the applicant. in march and june 2010 the district court partially granted or refused applications, introduced by the applicant and one of the victims, requesting that it order a forensic examination. it appears that during the proceedings the district court examined forty-seven witnesses, about thirty pieces of documentary evidence and five expert opinions, one of which was ordered by the district court. the applicant and the prosecutor appealed against this judgment. on 3 october 2011 the criminal court of appeal rejected the appeals and upheld the district court’s judgment. the applicant’s counsel lodged an appeal on points of law. on 21 november 2011 the court of cassation declared the appeal inadmissible for lack of merit.
the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in bijela (montenegro). on 29 september 1992, the applicant’s father-in-law, vu.z., for the exchange of his house in dubrovnik for a house in trebinje (bosnia and herzegovina). died on an unknown date between 2001 and 2002. on 14 august 2002 the applicant’s husband m.z., from herceg novi (montenegro), brought a civil action in the dubrovnik municipal court (općinski sud u dubrovniku) against f.o. seeking to have the contract for the exchange of the houses declared null and void and to obtain the possession of the house in dubrovnik. had not had the necessary authorisation to sign such a contract. indicated the value of the subject matter of the dispute (vrijednost predmeta spora) at 10,000 croatian kunas (hrk) (approximately eur 1,300 at the time). on 16 august 2002 the dubrovnik municipal court (hereafter: “the municipal court”) invited m.z. a first hearing in the case was held on 3 march 2003. to provide documents attesting to his standing as heir of vu.z. who would instruct a lawyer in croatia to represent him. a lawyer practising in dubrovnik (who is also representing the applicant in the current proceedings before the court). on the basis that there were no grounds for declaring the contract null and void. explained that following the termination of the hearing he would no longer represent m.z., in the second document he explained that the value of the subject matter of the dispute had been set too low, and indicated the new value of the subject matter of the dispute at hrk 105,000 (approximately eur 14,160 at the time). the respondents also opposed the request for an injunction. finally, they objected to the change of the value of the subject matter of the dispute, arguing that it had been increased only in order to enable the claimant to lodge an appeal on points of law. after hearing the parties’ pleas, the municipal court questioned the respondents as witnesses. at a hearing on 13 september 2005 the municipal court examined the materials available in the file, following which it concluded the hearing. ’s claim and the request for an injunction. it found that despite repeated attempts to summon m.z. to the hearing, he had failed to appear without providing any valid reasons. was to bear all the litigation costs, including the expenses of the opposing parties, in the amount of hrk 25,931.10 (approximately eur 3,480 at the time). on 12 december 2005 the first-instance court ordered m.z. only a court may set the value of the subject matter of the dispute, ex officio or if an objection is raised by the respondent, if it establishes that the value indicated in the civil action is too high or too low, by the latest at the preparatory hearing or, if no preparatory hearing has been held, at the main hearing before the examination of the merits. however, the claimant did not amend the claim at the same time. it follows that the relevant value of the subject matter of the dispute is the one indicated by the claimant in the civil action, namely 10,000 croatian kunas, because the claimant was not allowed to change the indicated value if he did not amend his claim at the same time.” by a decision of 10 november 2011 the constitutional court summarily declared a constitutional complaint by the applicant, complaining, inter alia, of a lack of access to the supreme court, inadmissible on the grounds that the case raised no constitutional issues.
the applicant is a legal entity, a local community of the christian baptist church in the republic of poland operating on the basis of the act of 30 june 1995 on relations between the republic of poland and the christian baptist church act (ustawa o stosunku państwa polskiego do kościola chrześcijan baptystów w rp – hereinafter “the 1995 act”) with its seat in wrocław. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. the case concerns a property with a four-storey building and another building dedicated to sacral purposes in wrocław. before world war ii the property was used by the baptist commune belonging to the bund evangelisch-freikirchlicher gemeinden in deutschland operating on the territory of the german reich. in 1956 the applicant church lodged a request to be registered in the land and mortgage register as the owner of the property and the request was granted. the property was registered under the number 945. on 23 april 1959 the minister of the economy announced a new interpretation of section 2 (4) of the 1946 decree. on 23 june 1959 the district residential buildings board for wrocław-krzyki (dzielnicowy zarząd budynków mieszkalnych) decided that all kinds of property which were subject to the church’s management were to pass into the ownership of the state and ordered that the applicant church transfer the property in question to the state. the order did not concern the part of the property which was dedicated exclusively to sacral purposes. on 19 august 1966 a new land-register entry 35905 was opened for the property no. the land-register entry 945 was however not closed. in 1968 the property was registered under the land-register number 35905 was given a new plot number 9 and its area was recalculated. it appears that the plot number 9 constituted only a part of the previous property number 1077/42 and comprised only the building dedicated to sacral purposes. the remaining part of the original property number 1077/42, which comprised the four-storey building, was given new plot numbers 39 and 33/5. it measured 0.325 ha and a new land-register entry 63650 was opened for it. the present application concerns the right to the property referred to above in paragraph 14. it relied on the newly enacted 1995 act (see paragraphs 47-50 below). on 12 september 1996 the wrocław governor refused to issue a decision which would confirm that the property in question belonged to the applicant church. after remittal of the case, on 24 march 1999, the governor of lower silesia (wojewoda dolnośląski) asked the wrocław commune whether there was any property available which could be granted to the applicant church in return for the property in question. it appears that the governor’s letter was left without reply. on 21 july 2000 the applicant church asked the governor to issue a decision in its case, pointing out that the time-limits laid down in the code of administrative proceedings had been exceeded. on 30 april 2001 the governor stayed the proceedings. the minister found, among other things, that the governor had had no right to question the validity of the entry in the land register. on 23 february 2003 the applicant church complained to the governor about the delay in the proceedings. on 8 february 2007 the governor’s office gave a procedural decision in which it held that owing to the particularly complicated nature of the case, the decision on the merits could not be issued within the statutory time-limits and set a new deadline for decision of 30 june 2007. the governor relied on the amended 1995 act and found that the applicant church had failed to satisfy the requirements laid down in section 4 of the act, namely that it could not be a legal successor of the church which had not operated on the territory of poland before 1 september 1939. on 11 july 2007 the applicant church appealed. on 11 march 2008 the applicant church lodged a complaint with the warsaw regional administrative court. on 12 september 2008 the warsaw regional administrative court dismissed the applicant church’s complaint. on 13 october 2009 the supreme administrative court dismissed the applicant church’s complaint.
the applicant was born in 1973 and lives in varna. the applicant and his wife divorced on 21 august 2006 pursuant to a court-approved agreement between the two of them. under the terms of this agreement, the applicant undertook to pay child support to the two children born during the marriage and agreed to his wife’s keeping his family name after the divorce. subsequently, the applicant learned that his former wife had conceived their second child, born in 2003, as a result of a relationship with another man during her marriage to the applicant. the applicant underwent a dna test to determine whether he was the father of the younger child. the dna test ‒ the result of which the applicant received on 15 january 2007 ‒ established that he was not the biological father of the second child. the results of this dna test were never considered by a court. shortly thereafter, in february 2007, the applicant brought a civil claim in court, seeking to contest his paternity of the child in question. on 1 march 2007 the varna regional court dismissed his request, finding that it was time-barred due to the expiry – in 2004 – of the year-long limitation period counting from the child’s birth or from learning thereof (see the section “relevant domestic law and practice” below”). this finding was confirmed by two higher judicial instances, the final decision being pronounced by the supreme court of cassation on 19 september 2007. the applicant brought subsequent proceedings in which he sought to stop paying child support to the second child. on 20 may 2008 his claim was rejected by the varna district court, which found that it had not been proven that the applicant was not the child’s father, given that he had not rebutted the legal presumption under article 32 (1) of the family code 1985 (“the 1985 code”).
the applicant was born in 1983 and lives in stara zagora. on 18 august 2002 the police conducted a search of the applicant’s home in stara zagora and discovered a certain quantity of cannabis. the applicant was arrested and placed in pre-trial detention on 30 august 2002. criminal proceedings were brought against him. by judgment of 22 may 2003 the stara zagora regional court found the applicant guilty of the unlawful possession of 14.44 grams of cannabis and sentenced him to three-and-a-half years’ imprisonment. the applicant was released on 7 april 2004, having spent one year, seven months and eight days in pre-trial detention. by judgment of 25 may 2004 the supreme court of cassation upheld the judgment of the court of appeal. on 23 september 2004 the applicant filed with the sofia city court an action for damages based on section 2(6) of the law on state responsibility for damages against the stara zagora regional court, the plovdiv court of appeal, the supreme court of cassation and the public prosecutor’s office. he claimed 11,500 bulgarian lev (bgl) in respect of the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage which he had sustained. an initial hearing was held on 30 november 2004 before the sofia city court. at the hearing on 11 october 2005 the representative of the plovdiv court of appeal, judge n.d., he emphasised that the applicant’s action for damages should be dismissed on account of that fresh conviction. pursuant to article 182 paragraph 1 (g) of the 1952 code of civil procedure (cpc), the court allowed that request on the grounds that the outcome of the second set of criminal proceedings might prove decisive for the outcome of the compensation proceedings. following an appeal lodged by the applicant, the civil compensation proceedings resumed in january 2006. by judgment of 24 october 2006 the sofia city court dismissed the applicant’s claims. the applicant appealed to the sofia court of appeal. it further noted that the criminal courts had also deduced from the combined sentence the period of one year seven months which the applicant had spent in pre-trial detention during the first set of criminal proceedings, and found that therefore the length of the applicant’s detention had not exceeded the sentence imposed on him. an appeal on points of law lay against that judgment, but the applicant did not avail himself of that option. that request was dismissed by the trial court as ill-founded, on the following grounds: “as regards the formal indictment presented, there is information to the effect that that indictment was received in the sofia city court on 29 september 2004, and there is no information to suggest that civil proceedings have been formally commenced by the court of first instance”. nevertheless, the president of the trial court, who was also acting as judge rapporteur, decided to withdraw from the case on the grounds that he had sat on the trial bench which had previously convicted the applicant (see paragraphs 6-13 above). in his written observations of 21 october and 8 november 2004 in reply to the indictment, the applicant repeated his argument concerning the alleged bias on the part of all the regional court judges and requested their collective withdrawal and the assignment of the case to another court. the regional court examined the criminal case of drug-trafficking between 10 january and 3 october 2005. it gathered material evidence and heard a number of experts and prosecution and defence witnesses. the court refused to summon two defence witnesses and to put specific questions to the prosecution witnesses as being irrelevant to the establishment of the facts. on 17 october 2005 the applicant appealed to the plovdiv court of appeal against the regional court’s judgment. the plovdiv court of appeal examined the criminal case in a public hearing held on 23 january 2005. that court heard a witness and accepted new written evidence presented by the defence. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. by judgment of 16 november 2006 the supreme court of cassation set aside the 25 january 2006 judgment of the plovdiv court of appeal, reduced the applicant’s sentence to three years’ imprisonment, combined the latter with the sentence imposed during the first set of criminal proceedings and deducted the period spent in pre-trial detention during the first set of criminal proceedings. accordingly, the applicant only had in fact to serve a seventeen-month prison sentence.
the applicants were born in 1985, 1988 and 1984 respectively. the first and second applicants live in moscow. the third applicant lived in the moscow region and died there on 10 december 2007. at 3.30 p.m. on the same day the local prosecutor’s office opened criminal proceedings against the applicants. their unlawful actions had been interrupted by the police. during the hearings on the same day - which lasted from 11.30 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. for the first applicant, from 9.40 a.m. to 10.25 a.m. for the second applicant and from 10.30 a.m. to 11.25 a.m. for the third applicant – the judge heard the prosecutor, the applicants and their counsel. she also read the prosecutor’s applications for remand. no other documents were examined at the hearings. on the same day, 13 march 2007, the odintsovo town court ordered that the applicants be remanded in custody. on the same day the applicants prepared their preliminary appeal submissions against the detention orders and asked the detention facility administration to dispatch them. it follows from a document issued by the detention facility administration that the first applicant’s submissions were dispatched on 14 march 2007. however, the submissions by the second and third applicants were not dispatched until 23 march 2007. on 20 march 2007 counsel for the applicants lodged additional appeal submissions. on the same day counsel asked for permission to study the case-file. their request was however rejected because the case file had been taken by the judge who was currently on leave. on 27 march 2007 counsel for the applicants complained before the odintsovo town court that the investigators had denied them access to the case file and had refused to give them copies of, in particular, the prosecutor’s applications for remand and of the detention orders. on 29 march 2007 the second applicant received a copy of his detention order. however, it was not until 6 april 2007 that counsel were ultimately granted access to the case file. on 9 april 2007 counsel lodged additional appeal submissions in which they complained about the belated access to the case file. the evidence showing the existence of the risks of absconding, reoffending or interfering with the investigation to which the town court had referred in its detention orders had not been examined during the hearings and the applicants had not been given an opportunity to challenge it. they also complained that the investigator who had lodged the application for remand had acted outside his competence and that the detention orders had been issued more than forty-eight hours after the arrest. moreover, the applicants’ arrest had been unlawful because the arrest records had been drawn with several hours’ delay. finally, the applicants asked to be brought to the courtroom for the appeal hearing. on 11 april 2007 the moscow regional court held an appeal hearing. it found that the detention orders had been based on insufficient reasons. there was no evidence that they had threatened witnesses or had attempted to destroy evidence. by letter dated 18 april 2007 the president of the moscow regional court informed them that under the domestic law copies were to be sent by post to the detention facility, which had been done on 12 april 2007. copies of the detention orders could not be given to counsel. the appeal decisions were received by the detention facility on 13 april 2007. on the same day the applicants were released.
the applicants were born in 1965 and 1966 respectively and live in moscow. the applicant, who was one of the indirect beneficial owners of a company, arranged for it to be sold to another company. on 1 october 2013 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of fraud through the execution of a sham sales contract. it was alleged, in particular, that the company purchasing the applicant’s company also belonged to the applicant and the price it paid had been unrealistically low. on 3 october 2013 the taganskiy district court of moscow (“the taganskiy district court”) held a hearing to determine a preventive measure in respect of the applicant. the latter argued that he should not be detained by reliance on article 108 § 1.1 of the code of criminal procedure (“the ccrp”), which prohibits the remanding in custody of people suspected or accused of offences committed within the sphere of their business activities. the taganskiy district court dismissed that argument in the following terms:
“... [the applicant] is suspected of having committed a serious offence aimed at making a profit which was unconnected to any business activity and had been organised by a group of people; [the offence being] punishable with up to ten years’ imprisonment, some of the accomplices have not yet been identified and arrested.” on 21 october 2013 the moscow city court upheld the detention order. on 28 november 2013 and 27 january 2014 the taganskiy district court extended the applicant’s detention, repeating its previous findings. on 27 december 2013 and 18 april 2014 respectively the moscow city court upheld the above detention extensions on appeal. on 28 march 2014 the ostankinskiy district court of moscow (“the ostankinskiy district court”) further extended the applicant’s detention. as regards article 108 § 1.1 of the ccrp, the district court stated as follows:
“the court dismisses the arguments of the defence and of [the applicant] himself that the offence of which he is accused was committed within the sphere of his business activity because, according to the current bill of indictment, he is accused of having committed an offence motivated by profit with the aim of misappropriating another’s property by way of deception or abuse of trust, using an organised group, and on a particularly large scale. the court therefore concludes that the offence imputed to [the applicant] was not connected to the carrying out of a business activity, which is an independent activity undertaken at one’s own risk with the aim of obtaining regular revenues from the use of possessions, the sale of goods, or the performance of works or services by people registered in such a capacity in accordance with the law.” on 14 may 2014 the moscow city court upheld on appeal the detention extension order of 28 march 2014. it held that the first-instance court had examined and dismissed with proper substantiation the applicant’s argument that his alleged offence had been committed within the sphere of his business activity. on 10 april 2015 the moscow city court granted bail to the applicant. upon deposit of the bail sum on 17 april 2015 the applicant was released. on 15 september 2014 a criminal investigation was opened into the misappropriation of the funds of an insolvent bank. on 23 september 2014 the applicant, who owned the bank, was arrested on suspicion of having transferred money out of the bank’s account by acquiring unsecured promissory notes. on 25 september 2014 the tverskoy district court of moscow (“the tverskoy district court”) authorised the applicant’s detention. the applicant argued that he should not be detained, inter alia, because he was suspected of an offence committed within the sphere of his business activity. the tverskoy district court rejected the argument as follows:
“... the court takes the view that, as can be seen from the evidence in the case, the method and circumstances described in the decision to initiate the criminal investigation, and the actions of [the applicant] in misappropriating the funds in this case are not related to [a business] activity as defined in article 2 § 1 of the civil code of the russian federation”. on 10 november 2014 the moscow city court upheld the detention order on appeal. the moscow city court dismissed the applicant’s argument that his alleged offences had been committed within the sphere of his business activity. in particular, the moscow city court held as follows:
“... the action of committing an offence by using another’s funds and taking on obligations to the bank’s clients without any intention to comply with them, cannot be considered to be a business activity.”

the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in stavropol. the applicant is the founder, sole owner and director of a limited liability company, akvilon (общество с ограниченной ответственностью «аквилон»). the two men made an oral agreement with the company to pay 55,000 russian roubles (rub – approximately 2,000 euros (eur)) in cash immediately upon receipt of the sugar. on the same date mr v., the applicant’s husband and a deputy director of akvilon, transferred the sugar to mr p. and mr pr., who then left under the pretext that they had to fetch more cash in order to be able to pay. later that day, the investigator in charge found the five tonnes of sugar in garages belonging to mr p. and mr pr., in the amounts of 1.5 tonnes and 3.5 tonnes respectively. who had promised to deliver the money to akvilon and had then disappeared. the investigator acknowledged mr p. and mr pr. as witnesses in the case and, without formally attaching the sugar, left it with them for safe storage. and to deposit it with a neutral person for safe storage. on 15 january 2002 the order was executed and the attached sugar was included in the list of exhibits in the case. by a decision of 22 february 2002 the investigator, mr s., declared mr v., who acted as a representative of the akvilon company, a civil claimant in the criminal case. in late 2002 the criminal case was transferred to another investigator. the decisions stated that the investigation had established that, despite their written undertakings to store the sugar, mr p. and mr pr. had sold it to third persons in december 2001. it is unclear what happened to the sugar thereafter. the two men had then delivered the stipulated amount in cash to a certain ms ya., who had negotiated the deal between them and akvilon and had disappeared once in receipt of the money. on 6 march 2007 a deputy prosecutor of the stavropolskiy region ordered that akvilon again be granted the status of victim of a crime. attempted to pursue the proceedings any further. as regards mr p.’s claim, after several rounds of proceedings, the town court granted it in a judgment of 21 may 2004. the judgment was not appealed against, and no enforcement proceedings were ever instituted. in letters sent to the applicant in the period of 2002-04, the nevinnomyssk prosecutor’s office and the main investigating division of the department of the interior of the stavropol region stated, inter alia, that the investigator, mr s., had indeed breached certain requirements of the criminal procedure legislation. they went on to say that he had been subjected to disciplinary sanctions in that connection, but that there were no grounds to bring criminal proceedings against him. between april and july 2004 the nevinnomyssk prosecutor’s office took a number of similar decisions to dispense with criminal proceedings against mr s. they stated, in essence, that although formally there were elements of an offence punishable under article 293 of the russian criminal code (professional negligence) in mr s.’s actions, that article provided for criminal liability only if the damage caused by such negligence attained a minimum of rub 100,000, whereas the pecuniary damage alleged by akvilon had been lower than that amount. the company complained that the negligent actions on the part of the investigator, mr s., during the investigation into the incident of 30 november 2001 had resulted in the loss of five tonnes of sugar belonging to the company. it also sought compensation for damage to its business reputation. it noted that it had not been proven that the investigator, mr s., had been negligent in performing his duties, given that it had been decided to dispense with criminal proceedings against him in that connection, and that therefore there was no causal link between his actions and the pecuniary damage alleged by the claimant company. on 19 may 2005 the supreme commercial court of russia refused leave to apply for a supervisory review of the case.
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in sovetskaya gavan, khabarovsk region. on 22 october 2009 the applicant was arrested and brought to the khabarovsk administrative detention centre where he stayed until 27 november 2009. since 22 october 2009 he had been detained with more than 12 inmates in the cell no. 9 designed for 12 persons and had to take turns to sleep. a month after he had been transferred to another cell with the area of 6 square meters which he had shared with another inmate. the detention centre had no shower facilities or a place for outdoor walks. the applicant’s cell was cold and damp, iron banks were not covered by mattresses. toilets were not separated from the living area, and the persons using them were in full view of others. food supply was inadequate, the applicant was served meals only once a day and had no drinking water from within the cell. the government submitted that the khabarovsk administrative detention centre comprised two cells: no. 5 with the area of 14.6 square meters for 3 inmates and no. 6 with the area of 18 square meters for 4 inmates. there was no overcrowding; the toilet had been separate by a shoulder length fence. the detainees may take a shower once a week. the temperature was 23oc, there were kettles with boiled water in the cells. on 26 october 2009 the applicant’s wife, mrs liu, sought to visit the applicant but was refused. on 6 and 10 november 2009 the applicant’s wife filed complaints with the khabarovsk prosecutor’s office stating that she had not been allowed to see the applicant. in august 2010 the applicant brought a civil claim for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage, stating that the conditions of his detention had been inhuman and degrading, and that the prohibition on family visits was unlawful. on 9 february 2011 the industrialnyy district court of khabarovsk dismissed his claim. relying on the statements of a representative of the detention centre, the court held that the internal rules of the administrative detention centres approved by the decree of the ministry of defence of russia of 6 june 2000 no. 605 dsp (“the rules”) did not make provision for family visits, and that the applicant’s right to family life had not been breached as he had met his wife during court hearings. on 18 may 2011 the khabarovsk regional court upheld the above decision on appeal.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in moscow. on 10 november 2009 the applicant gave birth to a son, i., whose father was e., her partner. following their separation in november 2010, the applicant and e. agreed that i. would live with the applicant and e. would visit him regularly. she submitted that i. had lived with her from birth until his removal by his father the previous october. his mother lives in moscow and does not participate in his upbringing. the boy is very attached to the father and receives a lot of attention, tenderness and care. e. had financially supported them and had visited them regularly. on 17 april 2014 the district court dismissed the applicant’s application for a residence order in her favour. it held that a residence order in respect of i. should be granted to his father, even though he had not requested it. however, the court may go beyond those claims in cases provided for by the federal law. the report of the childcare authority of grozny no. ... the plenary ruling stresses, in particular, that the better financial or living conditions of one of the parents cannot, in themselves, constitute a decisive reason for granting this parent’s application for a residence order in his [or her] favour. the better financial and living conditions of one of the parents (the claimant has a higher income and owns residential property in moscow) cannot constitute a decisive reason for making a residence order in her favour and for rejecting the other parent’s claim, because there are other factors. this age is most difficult, and requires special attention from the mother. because of her work, she does not have enough time to devote to her children. it has been established that the defendant occupies a managerial position at work. his income allows him to create comfortable financial and living conditions. the childcare authorities’ report indicates that the child is attached to his father. her elder daughter was healthy and self-reliant and did not require any special attention. her daughter would therefore not hinder her ability to take care of i.; on the contrary, she was of great help. the applicant had placed i. in a nursery school to give him a pre-school education and to further his social adaptation. neither her working schedule nor that of e. had been examined. lastly, the applicant complained that e. was preventing her from seeing her son. by a letter of 12 september 2014, the head of the childcare authority of grozny informed the applicant that the childcare official who had issued the report of 15 april 2014 had been disciplined. relying, in particular, on the childcare authorities’ report of 15 april 2014, the judge found that it was in i.’s interests to live with his father. on 5 december 2014 e. died in a car accident. i continued to live with his paternal grandmother a. 25. on 31 july 2015 the town court granted her application. on 24 november 2015 the town court issued a writ of execution. on the next day the enforcement proceedings were closed.
the bektashi order has existed and practised its religion in the respondent state for many centuries. at the request of the applicant association, on 1 march 1999 the ministry issued a certificate (потврда) attesting that on 17 february 1993 the applicant association (under the name “islamic bektashi community” in tetovo) had submitted an “application for registration” (барање за регистрација) and other relevant documents. it came into operation on 1 may 2008 (section 36). it also provided that the commission would transfer all documents regarding the existing religious entities recorded in its register to the registration court. all religious organisations registered by the commission up until 1998 could retain their existing legal personality and status. on 10 june 2008 the applicant association, represented by a local lawyer, requested information from the commission about its status. on 4 june 2009 the applicant association requested, under section 35 of the 2007 act, that the registration court recognise its continuing legal status and record it in the court register. on 2 october 2009 the registration court dismissed the applicant association’s request. that requirement concerned only registered religious organisations and not entities which were listed by the commission. it also enclosed several documents, including a description of the doctrinal sources. the applicant association submitted the requested documents. on 20 december 2010 the court refused to register the applicant association on the following grounds: (a) the name “bektashi” had already been used by another religious entity registered in the court register; (b) the doctrinal sources were the same as the doctrinal sources of another already registered religious entity; and (c) the applicant association had not submitted proof of ownership of the “arabati baba” site in tetovo, indicated as its headquarters in the application for registration. the applicant association appealed against this decision and asked the court of appeal to hold a public hearing. furthermore, there was no statutory provision under which an application for registration could be refused owing to lack of proof of ownership of the headquarters of a religious community. on 27 may 2011 the registration court again refused to register the applicant association as its intended name contained the term “bektashi”, which had already been used by another religious entity, namely the “ehlibeyt bektashi religious group of macedonia” registered in the court register on 10 september 2010. according to islamic teaching, ali was his son-in-law and a member of the family (or ehlibeyt), the fourth elected caliph who ruled the islamic state, and haji bektash veli was the founder of the bektashi order of islam and one of the prominent islamic philosophers. in other words, the doctrinal sources of [the applicant association] are not at all different from the doctrinal sources of the ... islamic religious community ...
in the court’s opinion, the doctrinal sources are to be regarded as official insignia of a church, religious community or group within the meaning of section 10(1) of the 2007 act. it argued that there was no other religious entity registered under the same name. as regards the doctrinal sources, it argued that they could not be regarded as official insignia within the meaning of section 10(1) of the 2007 act. doctrinal sources could be identical for multiple religious entities (as the bible was common for orthodox christians and catholics, and the koran was common for the islamic religious community, the bektashi order and shia or sunni muslims). they were of an ideological nature and were not constant, nor could they be interpreted in that way. official insignia concerned symbols (crosses, crescents, graphic symbols), a flag or a totem that represented something. in this connection, it stated that the interpretation which the court had given regarding its doctrinal sources, namely that they were identical to the doctrinal sources of all islamic teaching, was wrong. nor had it been given the opportunity to present its views at a public hearing. in this connection, it requested that the court of appeal hold a public hearing. lastly, it complained that the refusal of registration was discriminatory. on 20 february 2012 the applicant association and the second applicant (and two other individuals) lodged a constitutional appeal with the constitutional court complaining that they had been discriminated against contrary to article 110 § 3 of the constitution. they participate in public life, communicate with state bodies, and participate in religious gatherings and conferences. hence, equating the complainant [the applicant association] with another already registered religious entity can mislead the public, that is, it can confuse believers, which is at the same time itself a violation of their religious beliefs. ... each religious entity, church, religious community or group has the right to be distinct and be recognised in public by its identity.
the applicant was born in 1981 and lives in dubrovnik. according to the government, the applicant resisted arrest and the police had to apply force in order to be able to bring him to the police station. the applicant was taken to the police station immediately after his arrest. the applicant had resisted arrest and they had had to apply force in order to bring him to the police station. had applied the “elbow-lock” technique and leaned him forwards in order to restrain him. by the time they had parked in front of the police station, one handcuff had come loose, so l.d. then the applicant had been seated in a room and had ceased to resist, so the police officers had stopped using force and removed his other handcuff. lastly, it was noted that during the application of coercive measures the applicant and s.d. on the same day a shift manager of the criminal police department noted in a report that the applicant had actively resisted arrest and that s.d., in the report on his questioning it was noted that the applicant had been advised of his right to remain silent and to hire a lawyer of his own choosing who could be present during the questioning. in this connection it was noted that the applicant had declined to hire a lawyer. on 22 october 2010 at 12 p.m. the applicant was brought for questioning before an investigating judge of the dubrovnik county court. on 2 december 2010 the investigation was extended to encompass a third person, v.v. on 4 january 2011 the dubrovnik county state attorney’s office (županijsko državno odvjetništvo u dubrovniku) indicted the applicant, d.š., on 3 may 2011 a hearing was held before the dubrovnik county court, which the applicant and his lawyer attended. at a hearing held on 20 june 2011, which the applicant and his lawyer attended, the dubrovnik country court (“the trial court”) established the identity of the defendants and the charges brought against them. he asked to give his defence at the end of the trial. he also proposed that the trial court hear the applicant’s sister and examine the power of attorney by which she had hired a lawyer to represent the applicant during the time that the investigating judge was questioning him. explained that this proposed evidence was relevant for the establishing of the conduct of the police against the applicant. the trial court then heard the applicant. he alleged that after he had been brought to the police station he had been physically and psychologically ill-treated and had been coerced to into giving such a statement to the investigating judge. however, when the police had started questioning him about d.š. he alleged that he had been beaten by police officers l.d., the trial court dismissed these requests, considering such evidence to be unnecessary. in this respect it noted that the applicant had told the investigating judge that he had been ill‑treated by the police only during his arrest, and not during his stay in the police station. in his appeal he stated that he had not resisted his arrest and had not sustained injuries during his arrest. therefore, he could have had no reason to resist the police only a few minutes beforehand. he should have been given a milder sanction. on 29 february 2012 the supreme court upheld the applicant’s conviction but reduced his sentence to one year’s imprisonment. on 7 november 2013 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as ill-founded.

the applicants were born in 1984 and 1979 respectively and live in moscow. on 14 december 2012 the state duma adopted at first reading a draft law which, in particular, prohibited adoption of children of russian nationality by us citizens. on 17 december 2012 the official daily newspaper rossiyskaya gazeta announced that the second reading was scheduled for 19 december 2012. according to the applicants, they read on various online social networks that many people intended to stage solo “pickets” (одиночные пикеты) on 19 december 2012 in front of the state duma to express their opposition to the draft law. the format of solo “pickets” was chosen because there was no longer time to observe the minimum statutory three‑day notification period for other types of (group) events. the applicants decided to hold their own solo “pickets” and at around 9 a.m. positioned themselves, holding banners, in the vicinity of the state duma at some distance from other protesters (see also lashmankin and others v. russia, nos. 57818/09 and 14 others, §§ 206-15, 7 february 2017). according to the applicants, they were arrested by the police several minutes later and brought to a police station. at 10.30 a.m. the police drew up a record of the administrative escorting (протокол административного доставления) in respect of each applicant. a record of administrative arrest (протокол административного задержания), drawn up at the same time, stated that the applicants had arrived at the police station at 10.30 a.m. the first applicant, mr tsukanov, made a handwritten note on his arrest record that he had been actually apprehended at 9.20 a.m. the second applicant, mr torchinskiy, made a handwritten note on his escorting record that he had been actually apprehended at 9.30 a.m. 10. at the police station both applicants were accused of organising and holding a group public event without prior notification, in breach of article 20.2 § 2 of the code of administrative offences (hereinafter, “cao”). the administrative offence records indicate that the offences were committed at 10 a.m. the first applicant made a handwritten note that he came to the event venue at 9 a.m. and was arrested at 9.20 a.m. 11. the first applicant was released at 1.20 p.m. the second applicant was released at 1.10 p.m. 12. on 15 january 2013 the justice of the peace of the 369th court circuit of the tverskoy district of moscow found the second applicant guilty under article 20.2 § 2 of the cao and sentenced him to a fine of 20,000 russian roubles (rub), (about 495 euros (eur) at the time). the justice of the peace found it established, on the basis of the records and testimony of police officers, that the applicant had taken part in a “picket” involving fifty people. that “picket” was unlawful because no notification had been submitted by the organisers as required by the public events act (hereinafter “pea”). the applicant had waved a banner, thereby attracting the attention of passers-by and journalists assembled for the occasion. he had not complied with the police order to stop picketing. on 6 february 2013 the justice of the peace of the 369th court circuit of the tverskoy district of moscow found the first applicant guilty under article 20.2 § 2 of the cao and sentenced him to a fine of rub 20,000 (about eur 495 at the time), with the reasoning identical to that in the judgment of 15 january 2013. the justice of the peace also relied on police reports and testimony of a police officer who had apprehended the first applicant at the venue of the public event. both applicants appealed, insisting that each of them had held a solo demonstration which did not require prior notification of the authorities. the first applicant also pointed out that he had been arrested earlier than indicated in the arrest record. on 13 february and 11 march 2013 the tverskoy district court of moscow upheld the judgments concerning the second and the first applicant respectively. the second applicant applied for review of the court decisions under article 30.12 of the cao. on 28 june 2013 the deputy president of the moscow city court partly allowed his complaint and changed the classification of the administrative charge against him. the second applicant was found guilty of the breach of the established procedure for the conduct of public events committed by a participant, an offence punishable under article 20.2 § 5 of the cao. his fine was reduced to rub 10,000 (about eur 233 at the time).

the applicants were members of the national bolsheviks party. they waved placards with “putin, resign!” (« written on them through the window and distributed leaflets with a printed address to the president that listed ten aspects in which he failed to respect the russian constitution, and a call for his resignation. the intruders stayed in the office for one hour and a half until the police broke through the door and arrested them. on 16 december 2004 the khamovnicheskiy district court of moscow ordered the applicants’ custody. they had locked themselves in and blocked the door with a heavy safe. on 30 june 2005 the tverskoy district court held a preliminary hearing. hearings were held on 11, 14, 27 and 29 july, 1, 3, 10, 12, 15, 19, 22, 23, 29 and 31 august, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 23, 27 and 30 september, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 17 and 24 october and 15, 16, 17, 18, 21 and 22 november 2005. hearings often continued until late in the evening. according to the applicants, the fast pace of the trial, coupled with the remand centre regulations prohibiting visits on weekends and allowing counsel to see no more than one client per day, prevented them from having a sufficient number of consultations with their counsel. they complained that they were tired because on the hearing days they had to get up early. they also often left the detention facility before breakfast and returned after supper. they did not therefore receive regular food. nor could they have a walk in the exercise yard. finally, they did not have sufficient time for meetings with counsel or relatives. the court rejected their requests and continued to schedule hearings almost every day. on 19 september 2005 counsel unsuccessfully complained, relying on article 6 § 3 (b) of the convention, that because of the frequent hearings they did not have sufficient time to meet with the defendants and prepare their defence. while in the courtroom the defendants were held in four metal cages. counsel tables were placed at a distance of about 1.5 to 2 m from the cages. police guards were stationed between the cages and the counsel tables. the applicants submitted a courtroom plan and photographs confirming that arrangement. during the trial the applicants and their co-defendants stated that they had taken part in a peaceful protest against president putin’s politics. they had come to the president’s administration to meet the officials and hand over a petition that listed the president’s ten failures to comply with the constitution and contained a call for his resignation. they had chanted slogans and distributed leaflets thereby expressing their opinion about important political issues. they denied destroying any furniture or offering resistance to the police. they had resisted the attempts to force the door. after the door had been forced, the witnesses had seen that the furniture in the office had been damaged. they also asked that the questioning be continued in camera, given that confidential information was to be discussed. in any event, the questions put by the defence were irrelevant. on 8 december 2005 the tverskoy district court found the applicants and their co-defendants guilty of participation in mass disorders.
the applicant was born in 1955 and lives in lunel. the applicant, a lawyer at the montpellier bar since 1978, acted for m.b., who was a civil party in the context of a judicial investigation opened in nîmes following the death of his minor son. in an indictment and partial discharge order of 26 june 2007 the investigating judge committed f.c. for trial before the gard assize court on a charge of manslaughter. ’s colleagues for trial before the assize court for having lied in their statements to him, given under oath. on 26 november 2007 the investigation division of the nîmes court of appeal upheld the order but ordered that the two gendarmes charged with giving false testimony stand trial before the nîmes criminal court rather than the assize court. the advocate-general requested a five-year prison term for the accused. some of the coverage was streamed live on the internet. asked by one journalist whether it was a “licence to kill”, he replied as follows:
“well, i’m not sure you can say that. people are living in tower blocks cut off from city centres. for some, prosecution ends in conviction while others are acquitted. the entire social system needs to be revamped: we’ve turned into a real american-style society which is on the brink of civil war.” when asked by an rtl journalist “but weren’t you expecting this verdict? with a white – all-white – jury on which not all communities are represented, combined with, let’s face it, a very weak prosecution and a trial that was conducted in an extremely biased fashion, the door was wide open for an acquittal, it’s no surprise.” on 1 december 2009, after the chairman of the bar had found that the applicant’s remarks were not offensive and did not go beyond the bounds of free criticism of a court decision, the principal public prosecutor informed him of his decision to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the applicant under article 188 of the decree of 27 november 1991 on the organisation of the legal profession (see paragraph 29 above). on 11 january 2010 the applicant gave evidence to the rapporteur of the montpellier bar council. in particular, he stressed the need to put his remarks in context, as this was a sensitive case that had led to rioting in the working-class district where the victim had lived. he added that he had not targeted the assize court, the prosecution or the defence. in parallel, in a judgment of 1 march 2010, the nîmes criminal court sentenced the other two gendarmes to a one-month suspended term of imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 euros (eur) for giving false testimony under oath. on 2 april 2010 the applicant was summoned to appear before the disciplinary board on the basis of article 183 of the above-mentioned decree of 27 november 1991 (see paragraph 29 below), “for having, in the public lobby outside the courtroom of the nîmes court of appeal, seriously breached the essential ethical principles of the legal profession, and specifically those of discretion and moderation, by publicly making the following comments accusing the court and jury of racist and xenophobic bias”. reiterating his statements, the applicant relied in particular on article 10 of the convention, arguing that his remarks had been made in the context of the defence of his client’s interests as a civil party and within the ten-day period during which the principal public prosecutor could appeal against the acquittal. on 11 june 2010 the disciplinary board delivered its decision. the disciplinary board stressed that the statements had been devoid of personal animosity and had reflected “ideas, opinions and information apt to contribute to a discussion or debate of public interest ... as part of a broader commentary on the decision of the assize court ...”; this came “within the scope of protection of the right to freedom of expression under article 10 of the convention”. the principal public prosecutor appealed against the disciplinary board’s decision. he requested that the applicant be barred from practising for three to six months. his role as a lawyer had not ended with the delivery of the verdict, since it was up to the principal public prosecutor to decide whether to lodge an appeal. the court of appeal went on to find that, since all the members of the jury were french citizens, references to the colour of their skin did not relate to their social background or nationality but rather to their racial background. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. secondly, having stated explicitly that, outside the courtroom, lawyers were not protected by the immunity conferred by section 41 of the law of 29 july 1881, the court of appeal found that the impugned remarks had racial connotations casting aspersions and suspicion on the integrity of the jurors and thus amounted to a breach of the duties of moderation and discretion.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in baku. the applicant is a well-known civil society activist and human rights defender. the applicant has actively taken part in election observation in azerbaijan. he was also the chairman and one of the co-founders of the election monitoring centre (seçkilərin monitorinqi mərkəzi), a non‑governmental organisation specialising in the monitoring of elections which was established on 19 february 2006. following numerous attempts to acquire status as a legal entity under domestic law, the election monitoring centre was finally registered by the ministry of justice on 1 february 2008. however, a few months later, in may 2008, the domestic courts ordered its dissolution at the request of the same ministry. the domestic proceedings relating to the registration and dissolution of the election monitoring centre are the subject of an application pending before the court (see application no. the domestic authorities’ refusal to register the centre is the subject of another application pending before the court (see application no. the applicant has been involved in the preparation of various reports relating to the organisation of elections and general human rights situation in azerbaijan. in particular, he has been a speaker at council of europe events and has cooperated with un institutions. the description of the charges consisted of a single sentence which was one page long. on the same day the prosecutor lodged a request with the nasimi district court seeking the applicant’s detention pending trial. the prosecutor justified his request by citing the gravity of the charges against the applicant, the fact that he did not live at the address where he was officially registered as a resident, and that there was a risk of his absconding from the investigation and obstructing the investigation’s functioning by influencing other participants in the criminal proceedings. in particular, the fact that the applicant had studied abroad, had frequently travelled to foreign countries, and was in constant contact with people living abroad constituted grounds for believing there was a risk of his absconding from the investigation. on 23 december 2013 the baku court of appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that the first-instance court’s decision was lawful. in particular, he had cooperated with the investigation all along and, although he often travelled abroad, he had never intended to abscond from the investigation. on 26 december 2013 the applicant appealed against this decision, reiterating his previous complaints. on 30 december 2013 the baku court of appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the nasimi district court’s decision of 25 december 2013, relying essentially on the same reasoning. the appellate court provided the same reasoning as the first-instance court. on 19 march 2014 the prosecutor general’s office charged the applicant under articles 179.3.2 (high-level embezzlement) and 313 (forgery in public office) of the criminal code, in addition to the original charges under articles 192.2.2, 213.1 and 308.2 of the criminal code. on 31 march 2014 the applicant again lodged a request with the court, asking the substitution of his detention pending trial with either house arrest or release on bail. in support of his request, he reiterated his previous arguments. on 1 april 2014 the nasimi district court dismissed the request. in the meantime, on 5 april 2014 the applicant’s case was sent to the baku court of serious crimes for trial. on 26 may 2014 the baku court of serious crimes found the applicant guilty on all counts and sentenced him to five and a half years’ imprisonment. it was further upheld on 26 august 2015 by the supreme court. following a presidentially decreed pardon on 17 march 2016, the applicant was released from serving the remainder of his sentence. the applicant’s arrest and institution of criminal proceedings against him attracted significant public and media interest both inside the country and internationally. they stated that they had met him on several occasions during their fact-finding visits to baku and at the parliamentary assembly in strasbourg, pointing out that “this decision on pre-trial detention may raise suspicions about politically-motivated justice which we denounced in our recent report on the honouring of obligations and commitments by azerbaijan”. mammadli should be released immediately”.

“what they claim is extremely unfair. no other ngo shares the monitor’s position. we, in our report, may not have fully documented everything, but no one can claim that greece is an entirely patriarchic country and that nothing has been done all these years.” on 1 april 2007 the same newspaper published a reply sent by the applicant, as executive director of greek helsinki monitor, to e.t. on 1 june 2007 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor at the athens first-instance court. following an urgent preliminary inquiry, to which e.t. was requested to provide a statement as a suspect in the case, on 10 january 2008 the public prosecutor at the athens court of first instance dismissed the applicant’s criminal complaint and filed (αρχειοθέτησε) it away, in accordance with article 47 of the code of criminal procedure. in particular, the prosecutor considered that the above-mentioned statements made within the context of the interview, did not constitute facts but value judgments and in any event, they did not overcome the necessary threshold of similar exchanges between various bodies. the prosecutor also added that greek helsinki monitor had used the same expression, that is to say it had described statements included in reports prepared by the greek government as “false”, in various press releases, in a much more heated tone. on 17 june 2008 her appeal was dismissed by the athens council of magistrate judges. the new hearing date before the three-member athens magistrates’ court was set for 18 september 2008. on that date, at the beginning of the hearing of the case, e.t. on 28 november 2008 the operative part of the judgment was corrected and on 6 april 2009, the case file was transmitted to the prosecution service at the athens court of appeal, marked as extremely urgent. the new hearing date was set for 13 may 2009. 4044/09 postponed the hearing until 5 october 2009, citing a material witness’s absence as the reason. on 5 october 2009 the case was not heard because the courts had not been sitting owing to the parliamentary elections that had taken place the previous day. had been elected as a deputy in the parliamentary elections of 4 october 2009. as the acts for which she was accused had not taken place in the course of her parliamentary activities. 11801/04, 16 november 2006) and syngelidis v. greece (no. 1656/2010 by which it suspended the criminal proceedings against e.t. in respect of article 62 of the constitution and the applicant’s objection, the domestic court held the following:

the applicants were born in 1955 and 1962, respectively, and live in baku and absheron, respectively. the applicants are well-known civil society activists and lawyers specialising in the field of the protection of human rights. the transcript of the meeting, which was one page long, reads as follows:
“after giving the information about annagi hajibeyli [the first applicant] to the members of the presidium, a.t. moreover, numerous persons, who were entitled to be co-founders of the aba, were unlawfully not allowed to attend the constituent assembly. member of the presidium [...]: one minute. but why do you want to become a member of it? that is why i applied for admission to this bar association. please wait for the issuance of the decision. mr aliyev, you brought an action in court against the aba. we would like to know your opinion in this respect. [the second applicant]: i am still of the same opinion. i have a great respect for mr aliyev as a person and lawyer. [the second applicant]: whom have i insulted? you write that advocates are acting as intermediaries (vasitəçiliklə məşğuldurlar). [the second applicant]: what does that mean? in your law, the right of legal counsels to bring an action against the aba is provided for. in any event, what difference does being a legal counsel make? you are a legal counsel; how can you speak like that? on 21 february 2006 the first applicant brought an action in the nasimi district court alleging that the presidium’s decision of 27 january 2006 had been unlawful. it appears from the transcript of the nasimi district court’s hearing held on 7 february 2007, which was submitted to the court by the first applicant, that the representative of the aba at the hearing, i.k., on 9 february 2007 the nasimi district court delivered its judgment on the merits. on 16 march 2007 the first applicant appealed against that judgment, alleging a violation of his rights, as protected under articles 6, 10, 11 and 14 of the convention and article 1 of protocol no. on 6 june 2007 the court of appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the first-instance court’s judgment. again stated at the hearing that the members of the presidium had considered that the first applicant should not be admitted to the aba because of his stance on the functioning of the aba. you [the first applicant] have the transcript (stenoqram). on 11 august 2009 the nasimi district court delivered its judgment on the merits, dismissing both the claims of the second applicant and those of the aba. in particular, he pointed out that he had not been admitted to the aba because of his statements and articles about the poor state of the legal profession in the country. in support of his appeal, the second applicant relied on the document entitled “extract from the record of meeting no. 27 dated 19 november 2005 of the presidium” (see paragraph 14 above) and the annex thereto. the files relating to the present two applications were also seized in their entirety.
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in apeldoorn. it sentenced him to a partially suspended term of 40 months’ imprisonment. both the applicant and the prosecution appealed against the regional court’s judgment. it sentenced him to 40 months’ imprisonment less the time spent in pre-trial detention. based on the evidence submitted, the court of appeal found established that the applicant and his co-perpetrators had, for purposes of financial gain, between 10 november 2006 and 17 january 2007 facilitated the unauthorised residence of a total of 20 iraqi migrants in the netherlands, germany and denmark. submitting that article 197a of the criminal code had been amended in order to implement the directive, the applicant argued that the notion of the facilitation of unauthorised “residence” within the meaning of article 197a § 2 should be understood as entailing a long-term stay, to be distinguished from “transit” or “entry” as defined in the first paragraph of article 197a, which had been added to article 197a when the directive was implemented. in his advisory opinion of 10 december 2013, the advocate general (advocaat-generaal) to the supreme court expressed his view that the applicant’s appeal should be dismissed with the exception of the first of the grounds of the appeal, which pertained to the length of the proceedings: the duration of the cassation proceedings had exceeded a reasonable time within the meaning of article 6 § 1 of the convention, for which a reduction of sentence was to be applied. the advocate general thus concluded that the applicant’s complaint in this matter should be dismissed. on 4 march 2014 the supreme court gave its judgment, which read:
“[the applicant’s counsel] have submitted written grounds of appeal. that document is annexed to this judgment, of which it is a component part. the advocate general [...] has advised that the impugned judgment be quashed − but only as regards the prison sentence imposed, reducing it due to the violation of the right to adjudication within a reasonable time − and that the remainder of the appeal be dismissed. counsel [for the applicant] have submitted a written reply.” section 80a of the judiciary (organisation) act entered into force on 1 july 2012. the appeal in cassation shall be considered and determined by three members of a multi-judge chamber (meervoudige kamer), one of whom shall act as president.” the bill is intended to enable the supreme court to concentrate on its core tasks as a court of cassation. the establishment of quality requirements for counsel is aimed at ensuring that cassation appeals are accompanied by statements of grounds of appeal that are of decent quality. section 81 of the judiciary (organisation) act has in recent years played an important part in keeping the workload of the supreme court manageable. the supreme court now applies this provision in approximately half of its cases. however, the limits of its application are discernible. moreover, section 81 is applied only at the end of cassation proceedings and, (invariably, in civil and criminal cases) after an advisory opinion from the procurator general. the freedom of parties to lodge cassation appeals remains unimpaired. what is new is the latitude given to the supreme court to declare an appeal inadmissible on the (substantive) finding that the grounds of appeal submitted do not justify a detailed review in cassation proceedings (geen nadere beoordeling in cassatie rechtvaardigen). in that case, counsel for the person by whom or on whose behalf the appeal has been lodged may respond in writing to that point of view within a period of two weeks thereafter.” in its judgment of 26 may 2015 (ecli:nl:hr:2015:1332) the supreme court explained its practice as regards the application of sections 80a and 81 of the judiciary (organisation) act in relation to a request for referral to the cjeu made in that case. a judgment in which the appeal in cassation is declared inadmissible or dismissed by application of and with reference to section 80a or 81 of the judiciary (organisation) act contains an abridged reasoning of that decision. the judgment also implies that the case in question concerns one of the situations where there is no need for such referral of preliminary questions, namely when the preliminary question raised is not relevant for the resolution of the dispute or can be answered in the light of the case-law of the court of justice [of the european union] or that no reasonable doubt exists as to the manner in which the question concerning the rules of community law was to be resolved.” the jurisdiction of the court to give a preliminary ruling on the interpretation or validity of eu law is exercised exclusively on the initiative of the national courts and tribunals, whether or not the parties to the main proceedings have expressed the wish that a question be referred to the court. in this connection, it is necessary to define the meaning for the purposes of community law of the expression ‘where any such question is raised’ in order to determine the circumstances in which a national court or tribunal against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law is obliged to bring a matter before the court of justice. in the case of györgy katz v. istván roland sós (c-404/07, ecli:eu:c:2008:553), the cjeu delivered its judgment on 9 october 2008 which, as far as relevant to the present case, reads:
“37. [...] it is for the national court, not the parties to the main proceedings, to bring a matter before the court of justice.
the applicant was born in 1938 and lives in kaunas. in october 1991 the applicant asked the authorities to establish that her father had had 7.06 hectares of land in kaunas region before nationalisation. it was indicated in her request that she and her sister would accept land in another location. it appears that the applicant and her sister agreed that the applicant had a right to have her property rights to 3.40 hectares of their father’s land restored. the applicant specified that monetary compensation should be paid in a “convertible currency at market prices”. she stated that she had to be paid compensation at market prices and in accordance with the land value map for 2009. the applicant was asked to inform the authorities about her decision before 18 october 2010. she alleged that the plot of land of 0.1124 hectares which had been returned to her (see paragraph 17 above) had electricity and gas equipment installed on it (see paragraph 20 above), and that she was prevented from using it. moreover, the applicant had claimed that she was not able to use the land, more specifically, to construct buildings on it, but she needed to have a detailed plan of the land prepared in order to start any construction on the land, which she had not done. the applicant’s claim was thus dismissed. the applicant appealed, and on 18 december 2012 the supreme administrative court upheld the first-instance decision. moreover, the state was not obliged to restore her property rights to land with no restrictions regarding its use. if the family was provided with a plot of land before 15 march 1992, no other member of that family could acquire another plot of land for construction of an individual home without participating in an auction. had been provided with a plot of land of 0.06 hectares for construction of an individual home in 1992. in 1993 she had purchased that plot from the state. she asked the court to oblige the authorities to restore her property rights within one month of the court decision becoming final, or to pay her fair monetary compensation, calculated in accordance with the land value map for 2013. the court stated that the national authorities had taken various steps: they had provided data about unoccupied land and had asked the applicant to decide how she wished her property rights to be restored. the applicant’s requests submitted to the authorities for compensation “in a convertible currency at world market prices” and for compensation at market prices in accordance with the land value map for 2009 (see paragraphs 11, 12, 16, 19 and 22 above) could not constitute a proper way of expressing her decision, because such methods of compensation had not been defined in the domestic law. on 24 february 2015 the kaunas regional administrative court held that on 9 october 1991 the applicant had submitted a request to have her property rights to 7.06 hectares of her father’s land restored (see paragraph 5 above). the court further held that the authorities had examined numerous complaints submitted by the applicant and her son. the restitution process was carried out by the national land service and its territorial divisions. if no method was chosen, property rights were restored by means of monetary compensation. the court further held that the actions of the national land service had been lawful, considering that the applicant’s requests had not been possible under domestic law. in february 2015 the applicant sent a letter to the authorities stating that she had expressed her decision on the method of restitution in 1991 when she had asked for the return of her father’s land in natura. she also stated that she was not going to change her mind and would require her father’s land to be returned to her. the applicant replied to this letter in april 2015 and accused the authorities of unlawfully expropriating property. the kaunas land reform division had then asked the kaunas municipal administration to prepare land plans. two plots of land had been returned to the applicant in natura in 2009. the applicant lodged a claim with the domestic court, asking it to annul the decision of the national land service of 6 december 2016 by which her property rights to 2.5469 hectares of land had been restored and it had been decided that she would receive monetary compensation of eur 9,359 (see paragraph 39 above). in october 2017 the authorities asked the applicant to provide them with her account number so they could pay her the monetary compensation of eur 9,359.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in istanbul. in august 2003 the applicant’s company published a book entitled patika – gerilla anıları iv (“the path – guerrilla memoirs iv”, hereinafter “the book”). the editor of the book was a certain b.k. the authors of the memoirs described their lives in the pkk camps, in rural areas in both turkey and iraq, armed clashes with the turkish security forces, and their ideology and opinions regarding the situation in turkey. in september 2003 the public prosecutor attached to the istanbul state security court launched an investigation into the book. on the same day a single judge at the istanbul state security court made an interim order for the seizure of copies of the book. the judge considered that the passages referred to by the public prosecutor incited the use of methods of violence and terror, and thus constituted propaganda in favour of the pkk. on 10 october 2003 an application by the applicant to set aside the order of 30 september 2003 was rejected. on 14 october 2003 the istanbul public prosecutor filed an indictment with the istanbul state security court, charging the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. the public prosecutor cited a number of passages from pages 7, 19, 23, 81, 106-114, 139, 147, 152, 157-177, 203, 273, 277, 317, 321, and claimed that in those passages members of the pkk were depicted as heroes, and their acts and activities were praised. on 26 march 2004 the istanbul state security court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment and a fine. 5187) which had entered into force on 26 june 2004. it then remitted the case file to the istanbul assize court, since, in the meantime, state security courts had been abolished. on 5 july 2006 the beyoğlu criminal court also ruled that it lacked jurisdiction. on 19 october 2006 the court of cassation decided that the istanbul assize court had jurisdiction over the case and sent the case file to that court. on 29 june 2007 the istanbul assize court once again convicted the applicant as charged. the court sentenced him to ten months’ imprisonment and a fine of 416 turkish liras (try). in its judgment, the court held:
“on the basis of the examination of the book in its entirety, it has been observed that the book depicts the activities of members of the pkk-kadek, the terrorist organisation, and their so-called impressions of the clashes between them and members of the security forces. the book consists of different chapters written by different people. they did not know us as members of the pkk, and we were not established there. if we went there as the pkk, we could not win their hearts. some people told us that they had never heard of our organisation, and they thought that we were a very good one. some had difficulties, as they suspected us to be the pkk. that day i forgot about my sleeplessness. i did not think about my tiredness, hunger or thirst as much as i had done before. ‘... [he asked] “my friend, is this your first [armed] clash?” as a result, the court found that the book did not have any literary value. according to the assize court, the publisher had not aimed to publish a book of memoirs, but had had the intention of disseminating propaganda inciting the terrorist organisation and its militants to violence or other methods of terrorism. on 2 february 2010 the court of cassation quashed the judgment. 3713 and article 75 of the criminal code.
the applicants are russian nationals who were born in 1952 and 1954 respectively and live in the town of belomorsk in the republic of karelia. on 1 december 2005 the applicants’ son, mr m. lozovoy, was killed in st petersburg. criminal proceedings were instituted against a mr o. on a charge of murder. on 18 january 2006 ms l., an investigator of the primorskiy district prosecutor’s office in st petersburg, asked the head of the primorskiy district police to identify relatives of the deceased; to establish their place of residence and to summon them to the prosecutor’s office for the purpose of granting them victim status in the criminal case. a week later the applicants’ son was buried under his full name in st petersburg. a record in a cemetery registration log indicated that the body had been unclaimed. on 30 january 2006 the investigator, having concluded that it was impossible to identify relatives of the deceased, assigned the status of victim in the criminal case to a representative of the municipal authorities. the following day police officials informed the investigator that operative measures undertaken by them to identify mr m. lozovoy’s relatives had not produced any results. on 2 february 2006 the applicants contacted ms l. and informed her of their intention to come to st petersburg to take part in the criminal proceedings. despite that notification by the applicants, five days later ms l. sent the criminal case file to the primorskiy district court for trial. sometime later the applicants were invited to take part in the criminal proceedings in the capacity of victims. on 14 february 2006 the applicants were allowed to exhume their son’s remains. two days later they buried him in belomorsk. on 6 june 2006 the primorskiy district court found mr o. guilty of having murdered the applicants’ son and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment. 137755; the material in the above-mentioned criminal case file contains a copy of [the applicants’ son’s] passport; and so forth). it follows that the victims’ rights envisaged by the law in force were substantially violated in the course of the preliminary investigation. relying on article 29 § 4 of the russian code of criminal procedure, [the court] rules:
-          that the violations of criminal procedural law committed during the preliminary investigation in the criminal case should be brought to the attention of the primorskiy district prosecutor in st petersburg;
-          that the primorskiy district court of st petersburg should be informed of the measures taken no later than a month after receipt of the present decision.” in 2007 the applicants lodged an action against the prosecutor general’s office and the ministry of finance, seeking compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. relying on the primorskiy district court’s interim decision of 6 june 2006, the applicants argued that as a result of the investigator’s failure to promptly notify them of their son’s death, they had sustained pecuniary damage, having been forced to pay for the exhumation and transport of their son’s remains from st petersburg to belomorsk. in addition, they had suffered non-pecuniary damage as they had been unaware of their son’s whereabouts for a long time and had been forced to initiate a search for him; they had been unable to properly say “goodbye” to their son and to provide him with a decent burial; they had been forced to go through a two-week bureaucratic procedure to obtain permission to exhume their son’s remains; and subsequently, after the exhumation, they had been forced to identify his disfigured remains. on 5 february 2008 the tverskoy district court of moscow dismissed the claim, having found that the investigator had not committed any unlawful actions and there had been no final decision by any domestic court establishing otherwise. on 20 may 2008 the moscow city court upheld the judgment, endorsing the district court’s reasoning.

the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in kranj. hence, each user could access all files made available for sharing by other users of the network and download them for his or her use. on 26 november 2007 the kranj district prosecutor requested that a judicial investigation be opened against the applicant. he also argued that the isp had unlawfully, without a judicial warrant, passed his data, including his address, to the police. that information concerned the traffic data and should therefore not have been obtained without a judicial warrant. on 21 march 2008 an interlocutory panel of the court rejected the appeal finding that, although counsel had argued that the identity of the user of the ip address had been obtained unlawfully, he had not requested that certain documents be excluded from the file. on 5 december 2008 the kranj district court found the applicant guilty of the criminal offence with which he had been charged. the applicant was sentenced to a suspended prison term of eight months with a probation period of two years. both the applicant and the district state prosecutor appealed against the first-instance judgment. the applicant challenged the facts as established by the district court. the applicant’s appeal was dismissed as unfounded. on 20 january 2011 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law, reasoning that given the general accessibility of websites and the fact that the swiss police could check the exchanges in the p2p network simply by monitoring the users sharing certain contents, that is without any particular intervention in internet traffic, such communication could not be considered private and thus protected by article 37 of the constitution. the information commissioner was of the view that the reason for obtaining the identity of an individual user of electronic communication was precisely that he or she communicated by means of more or less publicly accessible websites. the information commissioner also highlighted that the provisions of the electronic communications act in force at the material time required a court order regarding all data related to electronic communications, irrespective of whether they related to traffic or identification data. the constitutional court’s decision was adopted by seven votes to two. the most relevant parts of the constitutional court’s decision are as follows (as translated into english on the constitutional court’s website):
“review of the objections regarding access to the complainant’s ip address by the swiss police 11. in accordance with this view, in decision no. up-106/05, dated 2 october 2008 (official gazette rs, no. it entails individuals’ legitimate expectation that the state will leave them alone also in their communication through modern communication channels and that they do not necessary have to defend themselves for what they do, say, write or think. traffic data signifies any data processed for the transmission of communications in an electronic communications network or for the billing thereof. such entails that the ip address is a traffic datum. the complainant in the case at issue communicated with other users of the razorback network by using the emule application to exchange various files, including those that contained child pornography. with regard to the general anonymity of internet users and also the content of the files, the constitutional court has no doubt that the complainant expected that his communications would remain private, and he also certainly expected that his identity would not be disclosed. the question therefore is whether such expectation of privacy was legitimate. ...
review of the objections regarding access to data on the user of a certain ip address 16. the main issue for the constitutional court at this point is therefore whether obtaining the data regarding the identity of the user of a determined ip address falls within the framework of communication privacy. judge sovdat agreed with the information commissioner that the police had been interested not in the ownership of the device but in “the identity of the person communicating and precisely because he had been communicating”. moreover, section 107 of the eca provided that the secrecy of communication could be interfered with only on the basis of a decision by a competent authority. otherwise, the legislation would be contradictory. this is because only the two data jointly communicate how the internet was used in a non-anonymised way, i.e. regarding internet use in connection with an identified person.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in istanbul. at the material time, the applicant was a civil servant in the metropolitan municipality of istanbul and a member of the local branch of the tümbel-sen trade union, which is affiliated to the kesk (kamu emekçileri sendikaları konfederasyonu – the confederation of public employees’ trade unions). in april 2008 two of the largest trade unions, namely the di̇sk (devrimci i̇şçi sendikaları konfederasyonu – confederation of revolutionary workers’ trade unions) and the kesk (kamu emekçileri sendikaları konfederasyonu – confederation of public employees’ trade unions) announced that they were planning a large scale demonstration in istanbul for 1 may 2008 and that their members would be gathering to celebrate the labour day and to commemorate their friends who had lost their lives during the demonstrations of 1 may 1977. in may 2008 the applicant was informed that a disciplinary investigation had been initiated against him for being absent without leave on 1 may 2008 and he was asked to submit his defence submissions. the applicant explained that he had participated in a demonstration organised by his trade union on that day to celebrate international labour day. subsequently, the applicant was given a warning as a disciplinary sanction owing to his being absent without leave on 1 may 2008 pursuant to section 125 of the civil servants act (law no. on 13 may 2008 the applicant objected to the decision and requested its annulment. on 16 may 2008 the disciplinary board of the istanbul municipality dismissed the applicant’s objection, finding that the contested decision was in accordance with the law and that there were no grounds to annul it.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in istanbul. he was the owner and the editor-in-chief of a publishing house, namely aram basım ve yayıncılık, at the time of the events giving rise to the present application. in june 2001 and march 2003 the applicant’s company published two books entitled dağlarda yaşamın dili (“the language of life in the mountains”) and tufanda 33 gün (“33 days in the deluge”), respectively. on 29 august 2001 the public prosecutor attached to the istanbul state security court filed an indictment with the istanbul state security court charging the applicant with aiding and abetting the pkk, an illegal armed organisation, under article 169 of the former criminal code, on account of the publication of the book entitled the language of life in the mountains. on 24 july 2002 the istanbul state security court convicted the applicant as charged. on 1 may 2003 the court of cassation, on appeal, upheld the judgment of 24 july 2002. on 23 september 2003 the public prosecutor attached to the istanbul state security court requested that the court revise its judgment of 24 july 2002 since article 169 of the former criminal code had been amended on 7 august 2003. the istanbul state security court accepted that request. 5190 of 16 june 2004, state security courts were abolished. the case against the applicant concerning the book entitled the language of life in the mountains was transferred to the istanbul assize court. on 16 august 2003 the public prosecutor attached to the istanbul state security court filed an indictment with the istanbul state security court charging the applicant with aiding and abetting the pkk under article 169 of the former criminal code on account of the publication of the book entitled 33 days in the deluge. according to the indictment, on pages 129, 130 and 135 the struggle of the pkk and its leader, abdullah öcalan, was praised and the applicant had therefore aided the pkk through the medium of the press. on 30 april 2007 the istanbul assize court decided to join the proceedings concerning the language of life in the mountains and 33 days in the deluge. on 7 december 2007 the istanbul assize court convicted the applicant under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. 3713) for disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk twice, because he had published two books, and sentenced him to a total of twenty months’ imprisonment. with regard to the publication of 33 days in the deluge, the assize court considered that on pages 129, 130 and 135 the pkk and its leader, abdullah öcalan, were praised and the offence of dissemination of propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation had therefore been committed. the assize court furthermore found that the book allowed for the transmission of the opinions of the pkk to the public and was aimed at bringing more sympathisers into that organisation. on 25 june 2009 the court of cassation quashed the judgment of 7 december 2007, holding that the first-instance court should not have joined the two cases, since the case concerning the language of life in the mountains was a re-qualification of the applicant’s previous final conviction (uyarlama yargılaması). on 7 december 2009 the istanbul assize court convicted the applicant once again under section 7(2) of law no. 3713 on account of the publication of the language of life in the mountains and sentenced him to a fine. on 3 june 2013 the court of cassation quashed the first-instance judgment. on 13 november 2013 the istanbul assize court decided to suspend the execution of the sentence pronounced in its judgment of 7 december 2009. in the meantime, the istanbul assize court resumed the trial concerning the publication of 33 days in the deluge following the court of cassation’s decision of 25 june 2009. on 21 october 2009 the istanbul assize court convicted the applicant under section 7(2) of law no. 3713 for disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk on account of the publication of 33 days in the deluge and sentenced him to ten months’ imprisonment. in its judgment, the assize court reiterated that on pages 129, 130 and 135 the pkk and its leader, abdullah öcalan, were praised and the offence of dissemination of propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation had therefore been committed. the court held that the turns of phrase used on those pages were not protected by article 10 of the convention and constituted an abuse of the right to freedom of expression. the assize court further found that the book permitted the opinions of the pkk to be transmitted to the public and was aimed at bringing more sympathisers into that organisation and thus at destroying the unitary nature of the state of the republic of turkey. on 15 february 2012 the court of cassation decided to discontinue the proceedings concerning the publication of 33 days in the deluge, holding that the prosecution was time-barred.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in novska. he also stated that he had attempted to travel to germany but had not had a valid visa and had thus been refused entry. at the time he was waiting for a visa for belgium. the report also indicated that according to the available information the applicant had secured a temporary residence permit from the authorities in kosovo until july 1989. as his temporary residence permit issued by the authorities in kosovo had expired, he had been instructed to regularise his status. the permit was valid until 31 december 1992. on 2 november 1992 the ministry instructed the novska police that they had failed to provide a report concerning the applicant’s personal circumstances and information on his residence in croatia. in his interview, the applicant explained that he had albanian nationality as he had been a refugee from that country. during the war he had worked as a car mechanic for the police and the army. he was not married and did not have children. he had a sister living in germany and one living in belgium. he was asking for croatian citizenship in order to obtain legal certainty of his position. he stressed that he was ready to renounce his current citizenship and that he had nowhere to go back to in kosovo. he was also granted a driving licence on 14 april 1994 valid until 19 november 2027. in february 1995 the intelligence agency informed the novska police that there was no bar to the applicant’s acquiring croatian citizenship. on 28 march 1995 the novska police informed the ministry that the applicant had had a registered residence in croatia since september 1993 (see paragraph 27 above). he also stressed that he was in employment and that he possessed an identity card and a driving licence issued by the novska police. in these circumstances, the administrative court considered that no available evidence suggested that the applicant had had an uninterrupted registered residence in novska for a period of more than five years as required by section 8(1)(3) of the croatian citizenship act. on 13 november 2001 the applicant asked the ministry to grant him a permanent residence permit. a report on the applicant’s personal circumstances prepared by the novska police on 24 april 2002 indicated that the applicant was a national of the federal republic of yugoslavia (serbia and montenegro – hereinafter “the fry”). he had therefore been unable to obtain a certificate of renunciation of albanian citizenship within the relevant period of two years. he wanted to stay in novska because there he knew a lot of people and would be able to make a living there. meanwhile, the applicant obtained a note from m.r., he explained that he just wanted to regularise his status in croatia. in the period between 1981 and 1991 and that during the war in croatia he had worked for z.a. his parents had died and the only close relative he had was a sister living in belgium, with whom he had lost contact. on 30 january 2015 the ministry dismissed the applicant’s appeal. he contended that he had been a national of the sfry and that he had had a registered residence in novska since he had arrived there in 1979, which had been erased at a later stage. it referred to the same reasons as cited above. the applicant further stressed that in his contacts with the police concerning the regularisation of his residence status, the police officers had always suggested that he had been an albanian national.
in 2006 the applicant moved to norway after marrying c, an iraqi national who had come to norway in 1999. on 7 april 2009 the emergency unit at the child welfare authorities in f. municipality received a request to assist the police with an incident in which the applicant and c were having a heated argument in the presence of their child. the applicant and a were taken to a crisis centre. the next day, on 11 april, the applicant was admitted to hospital with pain and bleeding. on 17 july 2009 the applicant and a moved back in with c. the child welfare authorities closed the case, but reopened it after the applicant’s lawyer raised concerns (“bekymringsmelding”) and stated that mother and child still had great need of the authorities’ help. c had been banned from visiting her at the hospital. the board considered the case at a meeting from 8 to 10 march 2011. on 22 october 2012 the high court rejected the appeal. on 29 november 2013 the board appointed b.s., he submitted a report on 31 january 2014 (see paragraph 53 below). after the presentation of the evidence, the high court is in no doubt that the father is violent and represents a threat to the mother. ... however, the high court had stated in its judgment that the question of contact for the applicant could be seen in a different light if c were expelled from the country. he had no plans to return to norway, and he planned to settle permanently in iraq. the father had last been in norway during the criminal proceedings against him in september 2013. if he returns to [norway], he must expect to be arrested to serve the prison term he was sentenced to for the abduction. [ based on what is known about the mother from before, [i am] highly uncertain whether the mother would keep her and her children’s identities secret from the father’s family in the event that she was given a new identity and a secret address. based on the presentation of evidence, the board agreed with the expert that his concerns regarding the risk had not been assuaged during the hearing before the board. however, she did not know his whereabouts. when the children were younger, the applicant had repeatedly demonstrated that she was unable to protect herself and the children from c. she had moved back to c several times, despite having reported him to the police for violence against both herself and the children. a disliked events involving big crowds, such as end-of-term events. the expert witness in this case has stated that, in his general experience, a foster home relationship is not the preferable option for the long-term placement of children who go to the foster home before forming an attachment to a biological parent; in such cases, adoption is in the child’s best interests. the board observed that the child welfare authorities had not proposed that there be an order on contact visits following the children’s adoption, because of the security situation, and the applicant had argued that failing to ask the foster parents whether they would consent to her having contact constituted a procedural error. he delivered an updated report on 14 august 2014. there was no doubt that c had committed serious violence against the applicant in the presence of the girls on a number of occasions. the abduction that their own father had put them through must have been a very frightening experience for them, one whose after-effects they were still struggling with. the abduction had resulted in broken relationships with their emergency foster parents when the girls had been placed in new emergency foster homes. b is in a new clingy period, triggered by the foster parents being away from her for a few nights some months ago. the children are young and cannot make contact with the mother or father themselves. however, one should not underestimate the will the father has demonstrated to get his children back. this applies regardless of where and how contact sessions are held.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in rijeka. at that time she had twenty-four years and ten months of service (radni staž) recorded in her “employment book” (radna knjižica). the medical documents from various dates show her continuous incapacity of working. on 5 november 1996 the regional office of the croatian employment bureau in rijeka (hrvatski zavod za zapošljavanje, područna služba u rijeci, hereinafter “the rijeka employment bureau”) granted the applicant unemployment benefits in the amount of 410.89 croatian kunas (hrk – about 55 euros (eur)) for 468 days, starting from 11 december 1995. there was no appeal, so that decision became final. she submitted a medical certificate that she had been ill and thus temporarily incapable of working. she was to receive hrk 441 (about eur 59) per month. in december 1997 two additional pensionable years of service (staž osiguranja) were entered into the applicant’s employment book. however, that did not mean that the applicant was actually employed, but only that contributions for her pension and invalidity insurance had been paid. such contributions are regularly paid by employers. however, since the applicant was not employed, these contributions were paid by the croatian employment bureau. she argued that she had the right to unemployment benefits until she retired. however, that body dismissed both her appeals as unfounded on 11 may 2001 and 15 may 2001. she claimed that she had twenty-seven years of service, and as such was entitled to unemployment benefits until she was next employed or until she retired. on 22 september 2004 the administrative court dismissed the claim concerning the decision of 11 may 2001 upholding the decision of 27 march 2001 (see paragraph 10 above) as ill-founded, endorsing the arguments and conclusions of the lower bodies. it instructed the parties to seek relief in civil proceedings before a competent municipal court. on 25 march 2005 the rijeka employment bureau contacted the applicant by letter, proposing to reach an out-of-court settlement within fifteen days regarding the repayment of the unemployment benefits which she had received between 9 june 1998 and 27 march 2001, in total hrk 19,451.69. the applicant replied that she was in poor health, unemployed and without any income, and that in these circumstances she could not accept the obligation to repay the money sought. it was dismissed on 29 june 2009 and this decision was upheld on appeal on 10 july 2009 as well as by the high administrative court on 5 july 2012. she also submitted medical documentation demonstrating her fragile state of health, numerous health problems caused by her difficult personal situation due to long-term unemployment, the poverty in which she and her family lived, and her inability to work. both the applicant and the rijeka employment bureau lodged appeals against the first‑instance judgment. it held that the applicant was obliged to return the amount in dispute in view of the fact that a legal basis for the unemployment benefits had ceased to exist on 10 june 1998. the applicant then lodged both an appeal on points of law and a constitutional complaint. on 28 april 2010 the supreme court declared her appeal on points of law inadmissible. the applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint against that decision. meanwhile, on 5 december 2012 the applicant had replied to the rijeka employment bureau’s letter offering her an out-of-court settlement for the amount owed to be reimbursed in sixty instalments. she asked the rijeka employment bureau for debt relief. by a conclusion (zaključak) of 30 september 2013 the rijeka municipal court informed the rijeka employment bureau about the financial agency’s letter and ordered it to give the court information about the applicant’s bank account or make a further proposal. by a decision taken on 8 december 2014 the rijeka municipal court declared the application of 22 october 2013 inadmissible on the basis that it was premature, since changing the object of enforcement is not possible before a writ of execution becomes final. the enforcement proceedings are still ongoing.
the applicant was born in 1987 and lives in łomża. on 7 august 2010 the applicant had a motorcycle accident in which he broke his right arm and right thigh. between 13 and 22 december 2010 the applicant underwent an arthroscopy on his right knee. between 25 january and 15 february 2011 the applicant underwent rehabilitation treatment in łomża regional hospital and during this stay no dysfunction was diagnosed in his right foot. subsequently, between 28 march and 26 july 2011, he was detained in białystok remand centre. while in prison, he was examined three times (on 1 and 18 april and on 13 may 2011) by an orthopaedist, who observed that the applicant required physical therapy in the light of a limitation of his knee-joint movement, the atrophy of a thigh muscle, and an injury to a peroneal nerve. on 11 april 2011 the applicant was examined by a neurologist who likewise found atrophy of the thigh muscle and impaired bending of the right foot, which he attributed to an injury to the peroneal nerve. the applicant never received any physical therapy during his imprisonment, instead being offered only nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines. on an unspecified date, but not later than 27 march 2012, the applicant brought a civil action against the state treasury/białystok remand centre for infringement of his personal rights, claiming that the prison healthcare system had failed to provide him with appropriate medical care during his detention and, moreover, that the cells had not met the minimum spatial requirement of 3 square metres per person and had been mouldy and infested with insects. he requested 200,000 polish zlotys (pln) in compensation, the equivalent of approximately 48,300 euros (eur). on 27 march 2012 the białystok regional court (sąd okręgowy) exempted the applicant from the court fees. on 20 january 2014 the białystok regional court granted the applicant pln 23,000 (approximately eur 5,550) and dismissed the remainder of his action. the court held, particularly on the basis of the medical expert opinion, that the applicant had had a motorcycle accident and had required physical therapy as recommended by the prison orthopaedist. however, he had not been given any, either in prison or outside, which had resulted in a deterioration of his health. the court established that, due to the lack of physical therapy, the applicant had suffered atrophy of the thigh muscle and foot drop affecting his right foot. the court compared this finding with the fact that upon his arrival the applicant had not been suffering from foot drop, the pain in his knee had not been severe, and his right leg muscles had been working more effectively. the court emphasised that the applicant had not been offered proper treatment despite a worsening of his symptoms. these changes in his physical condition would not have been irreversible, but the break in the therapy had entailed a prolonged rehabilitation process. the court stated that the rehabilitation process for the applicant would be long and arduous, a situation which could have been avoided had the defendant acted appropriately. the court held that the applicant had suffered physical pain of significant seriousness, which, in turn, had had negative psychological consequences. the court therefore found the applicant’s claim for compensation for lack of adequate medical care partly justified. the claim concerning the alleged overcrowding and inadequate sanitary conditions was dismissed in full. the court also ordered the applicant to reimburse pln 3,186 (eur 766) for the costs of the defendant’s legal representation and pln 10,932 (eur 2,628) in court fees (in total: pln 14,118 (eur 3,394)). the applicant did not lodge an appeal against the first-instance judgment. following the defendant’s appeal against the judgment, on 12 september 2014 the białystok court of appeal (sąd apelacyjny) amended the judgment, reduced the compensation granted to the applicant to pln 13,000 (eur 3,095), and upheld the first-instance court’s findings of fact and law. the applicant was not ordered to pay the court fees for the proceedings before that court. this court pointed out that in the experts’ opinions it was not specified, even approximately, what the effects of the negligence might be, how much longer the rehabilitation process would take, or how much stronger the pain had become in comparison to pain experienced previously by the applicant.
on an unspecified date, he contracted non‑reversible ischemia, which resulted in septic gangrene and the subsequent amputation of his right leg at the hip. the applicant also claims to be a drug user. on 1 may 2013 the applicant was arrested and then detained in omonoia police station. on 7 may 2013 the public prosecutor ordered his pre-trial detention in korydallos prison on the basis of decision no. 3386/2010 of the three-member court of appeal for felonies (τριμελές εφετείο κακουργημάτων) but he could not be admitted there as the prison was overcrowded. the applicant submitted that the conditions of his detention in omonoia police station, where he had remained for a period of twenty‑seven days, had been very poor. m, which had held between seventeen and thirty detainees, and sometimes even more. the ventilation system had been dirty and inadequate. for a certain period, both male and female prisoners had been held in the cell until a certain organisation filed a complaint and the women were moved elsewhere. the food quality had been poor and he had drunk water directly from the sinks in the toilet area, without any glasses or cups. there had been no outdoor exercise or other occupational activities and, owing to the lack of space within the cell and his disability, the applicant had spent all day sitting on the cement bench. he had not had any access to a telephone or to any form of recreational activity such as television or radio. on 28 may 2013 the applicant was transferred to korydallos prison, where he was initially admitted to the prison hospital for two days. the applicant submitted that he had been asked to sign a declaration that he wished to stop his pharmaceutical treatment, but in fact he had never been provided with any. it was not adapted to his needs and its shape had made it very difficult for him to use, having only one limb. the applicant argued that his medical situation had required him to be detained in a hospital; however, this had not been arranged, apart from the two days he had spent in the prison hospital upon his transfer to korydallos. on 30 december 2013 the applicant was transferred to larissa prison, where he remained until 25 november 2014. the cell had been filthy and insufficiently lit and ventilated. the toilet had been similar to the one in korydallos prison. the applicant submitted that he had not received appropriate medical treatment, that he had not been regularly monitored by a doctor, and that at no time had he been admitted to a hospital with access to nursing staff who would have taken appropriate measures to ensure that his needs were met. omonoia police station had had five beds, all of which had pillows, mattresses and bed linen. the cell had been regularly cleaned and was intended for short-term detention only. 3, because it was situated on the ground floor. the wing had had a common room measuring 140 sq. m with plastic tables and a kitchen at the detainees’ disposal. additionally, the government adduced examples of weekly menus during the applicant’s incarceration and pointed out that the ward had had access to a yard. to demonstrate this point, the government submitted examples of the various meals offered. there had been two psychologists at the prison who could be consulted at either the doctors’ initiative or the detainees’ request. the applicant had been provided with hygiene products, clothes, shoes and a card for making telephone calls. lastly, the applicant had benefited from a beneficial calculation of the days served, owing to his disability.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in vsesvyatskaya. at the material time the applicant was a journalist at a lithuanian weekly publication. he, himself, prepared each issue of the newsletter at his home address by typing it up on his personal computer, and then had it printed out and reproduced in multiple copies. the exact number of copies of each issue is unknown. his life was an example of how one should fight against russia. his life and death are a guarantee that damned imperial russia will be destroyed and the chechens and all other peoples oppressed by it will finally obtain freedom. in an article headlined “‘chechen syndrome’ inside out” (“чеченский синдром навыворот”), the applicant wrote:
“... most importantly, we realised with our hearts and skin that freedom is, indeed, the most precious thing that a man has, the most precious treasure, the only thing worth dying for. he went on as follows:
“... in supporting chechnya at war, demonstrating our solidarity with basayev, openly supporting movsar barayev in moscow on the days of the ‘nord-ost’ [theatre siege], we crossed a line, a certain border, past which all connections to our past and the environment and people among which we had been born and grown up and lived broke down; we had trustingly considered ourselves to be part of them, until we read on a foreign, enemy website, and saw with our own eyes, all the awful details of the atrocities committed by [our] people in a tiny neighbouring mountain country. hence, the rubicon has been crossed, the choice has been made and there is no room to back off – we no longer have any other family than all peoples oppressed by ‘our’ empire, than partisans fighting to be freed from its yoke, than famous warlords like basayev and political parties which claim monetary compensation [from russia] for their occupation and return of the territories russia has annexed ...” 22. in an article entitled “no comments” the applicant stated:
“... putin’s cheap propaganda can jabber as long as it wishes that maskhadov is a bandit and that he is responsible for the ‘nord-ost’ [theatre siege] and the recent explosions in tushino[7]. lawful elections of the president of the cri under the constitution of the cri of 1992 will only be possible when the cri army, headed by commander-in-chief maskhadov, defeats occupying russia’s illegal armed groups of the ministry of defence, the ministry of the interior and the federal security service, and chucks them out of the territory of independent ichkeriya ...” 25. if we live up to it, we will be its witnesses and it would be good to become its punishing sword. ... we remember and grieve for all those killed and tortured by ‘our’ empire, hated by us. we also don’t consider it possible to preserve the contemporary russian federation as an integral state. he fought the bloody rusnya[11] as long as he could”. пустят ли россию на летнюю олимпиаду в афинах?”) when will the chechen people be freed and rehabilitated?” ( когда будет освобожден и реабилитирован чеченский народ?) 2 (40) and 3 (41) of the radikalnaya politika newsletter and informed people interested in it about the forthcoming issues, how to subscribe and other ways to financially support the newsletter, of which he was the editor-in-chief. in a report of 13 april 2004 the expert stated, in particular, that the impugned texts contained negative emotional assessments of russia’s servicemen; of people of russian ethnicity; and of orthodox believers. the expert confirmed his conclusions made in the report. more specifically, the district court observed that in various issues of his newsletter the applicant had represented the conflict in the chechen republic as a war between two states – chechnya and russia; had approved of terrorist attacks carried out in russia, and of the actions of criminals and terrorists aimed at the extermination of the russian people as a nation. 1 (27) (see paragraph 16 above) and in issue no. the court corroborated these findings with reference to relevant texts published in issue no. in support of its relevant findings, the district court also relied on an extract published in issue 2 (40) (see paragraph 29 above). however, in the court’s words, “the content of the article [did] not correspond to its title, because it concern[ed] an isolated case (a statement that “jesus christ was crucified not by jews but by chechens”, contained in a booklet called “foundations of the orthodox faith”); this isolated case [was] generalised from and represented as a typical situation of orthodox believers by virtue of using the impugned heading”. the court did not specify which particular articles in the above-mentioned issues contained those characteristics and assessments. the trial court noted, with reference to the expert report of 13 april 2004, that the language used by the applicant in the impugned texts enabled the court to conclude that the applicant’s actions had constituted criminal offences and that he had clearly abused his right to freedom of expression secured by the russian constitution. as regards the punishment to be imposed on the applicant, the district court had regard to the state of his health and the fact that he had no criminal record, had positive references and had a dependant mother. on 23 may 2007 the moscow city court upheld the applicant’s conviction on appeal.

the municipal authorities reclaimed the flats, and the applicants’ title to the real property in question was annulled. in 1977 a number of flats in a residential building located at 15-3 ulitsa tsyurupy, moscow, were assigned by the city of moscow to the ministry of communications. the flats were used as temporary housing for foreign specialists seconded to the ministry. in 1991 the flats were transferred to the rostelekom open joint stock company, the ministry’s successor. on 18 february 2009 the flats were transferred from rostelekom to the city of moscow. it appears that the flats remained vacant. in 2008-2009 a group of people, including a police officer, a lawyer, a notary and several rostelekom employees, forged documents pertaining to three flats located at 15-3 ulitsa tsyurupy, moscow, showing that the flats were owned by private individuals and, following their deaths, were inherited by their “heirs”. the relevant property deeds were forged by notary k. and then registered by the city registration department. then the “heirs” sold the flats to private parties. subsequently the flats were bought by the applicants. each transaction with the flats was reviewed and approved by the city registration department. on 8 august 2012 a criminal investigation was opened into the city’s loss of title to the flats. on 7 december 2012 the housing department of the city of moscow (the “housing department”) was recognised as a victim of the crime. on 9 december 2013 the perovskiy district court of moscow found nine defendants, including several rostelekom employees, guilty of fraud. the court established, inter alia, that the defendants had forged the documents and had had unlawfully registered the flats as private property to the detriment of the city of moscow. on 11 march 2014 the moscow city court upheld the judgment of 9 december 2013 on appeal. according to the government, notary k. was also found guilty of fraud and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. in 2014 the housing department brought civil actions seeking restitution of the flats. the cheremushkinskiy district court of moscow granted the housing department’s claims. the court invalidated the transactions in respect of the flats and the applicants’ title to the flats and ordered their eviction. the court applied the domestic law provisions which allowed the owner to recover its property from a bona fide purchaser if the said property left the owner’s possession against its will. the court considered that the city of moscow had not had intent to divest itself of the flats and had a right to recover the stolen flats from the applicants. the moscow city court upheld the judgments of the district court on appeal. 4919/16), the city court discerned no evidence in the material of the case file that would substantiate her claim that she had bought the flat in good faith. the city court took into account that she had bought the flat a month and a half after the previous transaction and that the purchase price of the flat had been obviously lower than its market value. in the city court’s view, ms titova, if having acted with due care and diligence, should have had doubts as to the legitimacy of seller’s title and sale of the flat. subsequently, the city court refused to grant the applicants leave to bring a cassation appeal against the judgments in their respective cases. according to the government, the applicants were not evicted and continue to reside in the flats. the details pertaining to each case are summed up in appendix ii below.

the first applicant, unifaun theatre productions limited, is a limited liability company which produces theatrical performances in maltese theatres. in october 2008, the first applicant, via the second applicant, decided to produce the play stitching for the theatre audiences in malta, and proceeded to obtain the necessary performance licence from the author and his agent. on 23 december 2008 the first applicant lodged an application with the board for film and stage classification (“the board”), in order for a rating certificate to be issued in terms of the stage regulations (see relevant domestic law). the relevant fee was paid and a clean copy of the script submitted. the latter names added by means of an asterisk). no reasons were provided by the chairperson. by means of a letter of 29 january 2009 the board informed the first applicant, via the latter’s legal counsel, that the original decision was reconfirmed. on 31 january 2009 another letter was sent to the first applicant by the chairperson. rehearsals for the production carried on unabated. according to the applicants around two hundred persons watched the rehearsals and none of them found the play objectionable. an educator, child psychologist and actress, k.d. ultimately they decide to have the child but they decide to do so in order to save their relationship, one might say for somewhat impure motives, they feel that having this child will keep them together. they come back together again sometime later, maybe a year later and meet and for them their relationship is not quite finished and they come back together in their grief because they are the only other people who understand the depths of their grief. he says that it is the first time that he masturbated which would imply that it is reasonably early. will the text lose by the director leaving it out? ) p.m., a consultant psychiatrist, stated that in his opinion the play was a love story which unfortunately turned very badly. she considered that it was a sensitive play that called for a mature audience. the priest (who saw the rehearsal but did not read the script) considered that he would have classified it for wise adults (bil-għaqal). when one was ready to study illnesses and the suffering of people who were going through pain one must be democratic and tolerant and give society the chance to understand those not living normally. who saw the rehearsal but did not read the script) testified that most of the dialogue was between two people who had certain hang-ups and inter personal problems, and who in a quest to get closer, nearly started a competition between them as to who was the more outrageous. nevertheless, in his view, at some point one could tell that they were flirting with each other despite them being outrageous. she also testified that no pornography was used as props. while shock was a legitimate theatrical weapon and may be used repeatedly, one could not offend other people’s sensibilities. a psychologist and member of the board) found the script barely credible in so far as it was unlikely that a person would go through so many situations one after the other. thus, in his view those parts had to be deleted from the play. in his view, if one were to make the appropriate deletions to the script, there would be nearly nothing left, and he could not find anything positive about it. she considered that the play in its entirety, and not one scene here and there, was objectionable and offensive. as to the constitutional and conventional complaint raised by the applicants, the constitutional court held that the existence of the board did not breach any of the applicants’ rights, and indeed the applicants had not impugned the law establishing the board. referring to the court’s case-law, in particular, otto‑preminger‑institut v. austria (§ 47) it recalled that those who chose to exercise the freedom to manifest their religion, “must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith. in any event it considered that adults, who could chose to watch the play in such a case, would also be deserving of protection, and thus limitations could also be necessary in such cases.
the applicant was born in 1958 and lives in grozny, chechen republic. according to the applicant, on 7 february 1999 the administrative authorities of the leninskiy district of grozny provided her with a housing allocation order no. 842 entitling her to occupy a one‑room municipal flat in grozny. in 2005 the applicant was registered as living in that flat. in 2007 the authorities decided to conduct an examination of all allocation orders granting occupation of municipal accommodation. the applicant’s housing allocation order dated 7 february 1999 appeared suspicious to the authorities and they commissioned an expert to verify its authenticity. the expert concluded that the allocation order was a forged document. upon receipt of this information the administration of grozny brought court proceedings against the applicant seeking to declare the allocation order of 7 february 1999 null and void and to evict her from the flat in question. she submitted that the administration had issued her with the housing allocation order because she had been on the housing list and she was subsequently registered as living in that flat. she had not been aware of the fact that the order had not been printed in the printing office. the administration of the leninskiy district of grozny asked to grant the claims submitted by the administration of grozny. the administration could not say whether the order had been in fact delivered to the applicant, since the archives had not been preserved. however, according to the civil servants of the administration, commissions on allocation of housing had been meeting once a month. that would mean that 842 orders were issued from the beginning of 1999 until 7 february 1999. on 24 february 2009 the leninskiy district court of grozny (“the district court”) declared the housing allocation order of 7 february 1999 null and void and issued an order to evict the applicant. in particular, the district court held as follows:

...

the applicants were or are still detained in korydallos prison hospital (“the prison hospital”). they all suffer from hiv infection, apart from the third applicant who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 4322/2015, having served one third of his sentence. he was released after having made use of the remedy provided for by article 110a of the criminal code. the fifth applicant, theodoros iliopoulos, was detained in the prison hospital from 8 january 2013 until 2 june 2015, the date on which he was released following use of the remedy provided for by section 12 of law no. the seventh applicant, davit khutsishvili, was detained in the prison hospital from 1 july 2014 until 27 october 2016. he was still in detention when the parties submitted their observations. he was again detained in the prison hospital from 22 january 2016, and was still in detention there when the parties submitted their observations. the sixteenth applicant, dimitrios samlidis, was detained in the prison hospital from 8 july 2014 until 26 february 2015, when he was released, after having made use of the remedy provided for by article 110a of the criminal code. the applicants submitted that the prison hospital had been overcrowded which, in addition to causing poor sanitary conditions, had resulted in the deterioration of their already fragile health. m and which had been occupied by twelve detainees on average for the period between 2013 and 2015. in particular, bunk beds were not used in the prison hospital and extra furniture, such as medical equipment, was required; therefore half the area of each ward had been occupied by furniture, which had resulted in them having a personal space in which they could move freely of below 2 sq. the above-mentioned conditions had led them to receiving inadequate health care. there had been a high risk of infection with contagious diseases as there had not been effective separation of detainees according to the disease from which they had suffered. meals had been insufficient and of poor quality and the absence of recreational activities had affected their psychological health. central heating had been inadequate and collection of rubbish, especially in the kitchens, had not been sufficient, creating hygiene problems and resulting in bad smells and the presence of pests. in particular, during the period 2013-14 only one general practitioner had been available to the hospital. 2776/1999), to which they have not received any reply to date. specifically as regards the applicants, some of them had been detained in wards 7 and 8 on the first floor of the hospital and some others in wards 1, 2 and 3 on the second floor. m each, and each of them hosted eight to thirteen detainees. detainees who required more intense or specialised care were referred to public hospitals, a procedure which was used for the third, fourth, ninth, fifteenth and seventeenth applicants. they were examined regularly by doctors and they were submitted often to general and specialised laboratory examinations. wards were sufficiently ventilated and heated and had adequate natural light via six large windows. hot water was ensured by solar water heaters and by boilers which operated for four hours per day. wards were regularly cleaned by cleaning crews consisting of detainees and disinfected by specialist companies. all wards and corridors had rubbish bins which were emptied regularly. according to the government, detainees were not obliged to spend all day in the wards; on the contrary, they could move along the corridors and spend time in the yard. 4322/2015, which provided for early release schemes. in addition, new and updated medical equipment was procured and medical-staff numbers had been reinforced by the recruitment of three new doctors of various specialties. the government specified that all the above-mentioned improvements had made the prison hospital a detention facility significantly different to the image given in the greek ombudsman’s (συνήγορος του πολίτη) report, which had been prepared on the basis of a visit in february 2012, that is to say on a date that had no relevance to the present case.
the applicant, mr steingrim wolland, was born in 1961 and lives in oslo, norway. documents were put in sealed bags instead of being searched for evidence by the police. the police also collected a hard disk and a laptop. the third party had no objections as to how the police had proceeded. mirror copies (speilkopier) of the hard disk and laptop were taken; the hard disk and laptop were returned to the applicant two days later. on 3 may 2010, at the prosecuting authority’s office, the applicant went through the paper documents that had been collected and sorted out those which he considered to be covered by legal professional privilege. this material was stored separately and placed under seal. by a letter of 16 february 2011 the applicant’s lawyer disputed the lawfulness of what he categorised as the “seizure” (“beslag”), arguing that there had been no reasonable grounds for suspicion against the applicant and requested that the city court quash the “seizure” decision and order that the collected material be returned to him. in response to the letter from the applicant’s lawyer of 16 february 2011 (see paragraph 12 above), the city court wrote a letter of 11 may 2011, pointing out that the procedure applicable to material allegedly covered by legal professional privilege had been set out by the supreme court (høyesterett) in its decision of 3 march 2011, reported in norsk retstidende (rt.) 2011 page 296 (see paragraphs 38-39 below). the city court would obtain the views of the parties in a hearing before making a formal decision as to whether to authorise the search of the prosecution. its decision would be amenable to appeal. the city court also informed the parties that it was about to complete this task, having examined each document. the high court also noted that the code of criminal procedure contained several provisions conferring on the accused a right to judicial review in respect of enforcement measures taken in the form of search and seizure, inter alia could a decision by a court to the effect that documents were to be handed over to the prosecution authorities after perusal of the documents in accordance with article 204 (see paragraph 37 below) – which was what the city court was doing at the time – be appealed against. the existence of such reasons could be examined again but then only in connection with, for instance, future investigative measures where the latter were required. on 25 january 2012 the city court held a hearing (see paragraph 14 above) on the issue of which materials could be sent to the prosecuting authority for it to search. in a decision of 11 may 2012, it ruled that 1,264 documents collected from the data carriers could be handed over. on 4 september 2012 the high court dismissed the prosecuting authority’s appeal and rejected the applicant’s appeal except for one issue relating to a bank account transcript. on 22 may 2013 the supreme court rejected an appeal by the applicant against the high court’s decision. it referred, inter alia, to the general obligation to ensure progress in investigations, as reflected in article 226 of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 37 below). unlike the high court, however, the supreme court did not for that reason find that the copies should necessarily be returned to the applicant. the material could be deleted by the court or the data carrier could be handed over to the applicant. in a letter of 25 june 2014 the high court set out its views on the matter. this made it difficult to see why the applicant should have legal standing to require that the courts examine his application. moreover, the court assumed that the applicant could obtain a review of his convention claims in other ways. the case as concerned the mirror copies was ultimately dismissed on 22 august 2014. there is no information about the applicant having appealed against this decision. this judgment became final when the supreme court’s appeal committee refused leave to appeal on 18 october 2013. the charges concerning forgery of documents (ibid.) were dropped on 16 february 2011 and the remainder on 21 august 2013.
the applicants were born in 1966, 1971, 1993 and 1996 respectively. the second applicant is the former spouse of the first applicant and the third and the fourth applicants are their children. the first, the third and the fourth applicants live in lviv. the second applicant had his registered residence in lviv as at the time when the application was lodged; his current whereabouts are not known. in august 2001 the second applicant, a military officer at the material time, was provided with a two-room flat for himself and his family in an accommodation hall owned by the lviv military academy. subsequently all four applicants obtained residence registration with the local authority as tenants of that flat. since 2001 (and as at the time of the observations exchanges between the parties), the household was paying the relevant maintenance charges and other tenancy-related fees, which were calculated on the premise that the flat was occupied by four persons. on 28 november 2003 the second applicant was dismissed from military service on grounds of redundancy. the dismissal order stipulated that he was eligible for priority allocation of social housing from the waiting list managed by the ministry of defence. in 2005 the first and the second applicant divorced and the first applicant and her children were placed on the waiting list for social housing managed by the municipal authority. in august 2011 the lviv garrison military prosecutor instituted eviction proceedings against the applicants. he referred, essentially, to the fact that the accommodation hall belonged to the military academy and was designed for the temporary housing of military personnel. meanwhile, none of the applicants had any connection to the military or the military academy, which owned the building. on 15 november 2012 the frankivskyy district court in lviv dismissed the prosecutor’s claim. it found that the applicants had lawfully obtained the tenancy in connection with the second applicant’s previous military service. regard being had to the applicable legal provisions concerning the social protection of former military officers and their families, they could not be evicted from the accommodation hall without first being provided with other housing. in addition to that, the fourth applicant had still been a minor at the material time, and further legislation applicable to the protection of minors warranted the protection of her housing rights. following an appeal by the prosecutor, on 17 september 2013 the lviv regional court of appeal quashed this judgment and ordered the applicants’ eviction. it found that they had settled in the disputed premises without the building owner having taken a formal decision authorising their occupancy and without an occupancy order (“ордер”), having been issued in their favour. accordingly, the applicants’ occupancy was unlawful ab initio. the applicants lodged a cassation appeal against this judgment. they noted, in particular, that the disputed housing had been their only home for more than ten years and that their eviction would render them homeless. they also submitted that their income level was not sufficient for them to acquire housing at their own expense and that they did not have any family members in lviv who could offer shelter to them. their residence was duly registered and they had been dutifully paying all the applicable fees connected with their occupancy of the flat. the fact that the building owner had failed to comply with certain formalities connected with regularising their occupancy was not their fault. in addition, evicting them on this basis should have become time-barred in 2004 (three years after they had moved into the flat). lastly, the applicants referred to the judgment of the european court of human rights in the case of kryvitska and kryvitskyy v. ukraine (no. on 20 november 2013 the higher specialised court of ukraine dismissed the applicants’ cassation appeal. subsequently, enforcement proceedings were instituted with a view to evicting the applicants. the parties have not informed the court whether the eviction order has been enforced.
the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in tirana. on an unspecified date criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant and two other co-accused on account of premeditated murder. the applicant was subsequently arrested by the authorities. on 21 july 1998 the applicant addressed a letter (kërkesë) to the kavaja district court (“the district court”) and the kavaja district prosecutor (“the district prosecutor”), stating that he had engaged a., a lawyer, to represent him before the district prosecutor during the investigation and during the trial proceedings. it appears that the applicant wrote this letter while he was in detention. on 1 november 1999 the district court found the applicant not guilty and ordered his release. he had attended the trial and had been defended by a., his chosen lawyer. the two other co-accused were convicted and sentenced. on an unspecified date the two other co-accused and the prosecutor appealed against the district court’s decision of 1 november 1999. on an unspecified date the applicant left albania. it appears that the applicant was not informed of the appeals of the two other co-accused and the prosecutor, but apparently a. was so informed. the applicant was represented by a. in his absence. on 21 april 2000 the supreme court rejected the applicant’s appeal lodged by a. against the durrës court of appeal decision of 28  february 2000. on 26 december 2000, during the retrial proceedings, the district  court convicted the applicant in absentia of premeditated murder and sentenced him to twenty-three years’ imprisonment. the applicant was represented by lawyer a. (see paragraph 9), the decision stating that a. had been appointed by the court. on 10 september 2001 and 14 december 2001 the court of appeal and the supreme court, respectively, upheld the decision of 26 december 2000. the applicant had been represented in those proceedings by a new, court-appointed lawyer. on 14 april 2004 the applicant’s mother hired another lawyer, k., to make an application for review. it appears from the supreme court’s decision of 9 july 2010 (see paragraph 18 below) and the constitutional court’s decision of 25 february 2011 (see paragraph 21 below) that an application for review was rejected by the supreme court. there is no copy of the said supreme court decision in the case file. on 8 july 2005 the applicant was informed of his conviction in  absentia by his family members. he lodged an application for leave to appeal out of time against the decision of 26 december 2000, arguing that he had never been informed of his conviction in absentia as he had been living abroad. the applicant was represented by k. as his counsel. on 4 november 2005, 29 september 2006 and 9 july 2010 respectively, the district court and the court of appeal dismissed, and the supreme court rejected, his application. the domestic courts held that the applicant should have known of the proceedings as he had been represented by a lawyer of his own choosing, a., who had been informed of the prosecutor’s appeal, and as his mother had appointed a lawyer to make an application for review. they also held that the case had already been examined at all instances and that their decisions were still in effect. who had been a member of the district court’s bench that had delivered the judgment of 26 december 2000, also sat in the district court’s bench of 4 november 2005 that dismissed the applicant’s application. on an unspecified date the applicant, represented by his lawyer, lodged a constitutional complaint in respect of the alleged unfairness of the proceedings in absentia and the lack of impartiality of the district court and the court of appeal. on 16 march 2011 the applicant’s lawyer was informed of the constitutional court’s decision of 25 february 2011 to dismiss the applicant’s constitutional appeal. it did not examine the applicant’s claim about the impartiality of the district court and the court of appeal
the united civil aviation trade union (“the first applicant”) is a trade union registered in budapest. mr a. csorba (“the second applicant”) is a hungarian national who was born in 1970 and lives in vecsés. he is the president of the united civil aviation trade union. on 12 october 2012 the second applicant applied to the budapest police department for authorisation to hold a demonstration on the road leading to budapest ferenc liszt international airport. he stated that the demonstration would be held on the hard shoulder of the road, which was not ordinarily used for traffic. the declared objectives of the demonstration were, inter alia, to draw the public’s attention to the precarious financial situation in which the employees of the airport would find themselves if salary cuts envisaged by the company managing the airport were carried out. the event was scheduled to be held between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. on 17 october 2012. the second applicant also specified that it was expected that about fifty to 100 persons would participate in the event and that it was intended that speeches would be given and that an open letter would be read out. on 14 october 2012 the budapest police department registered the application and informed the second applicant that, in order to clarify details regarding the programme of the demonstration and the number of police officers that would be required to secure the event, it was necessary to schedule a meeting with the organisers. the second applicant and the vice-president of the united civil aviation trade union met with the representatives of the monor police department on the same day. the representative of the police department suggested that the demonstration be held at another location, since the planned venue would endanger traffic. the second applicant assured the police that the demonstrators would respect traffic rules, would only occupy the part of the road not used for traffic and would distribute flyers to car passengers, and that the organisers would call off or halt the demonstration if it was not in compliance with the relevant legal provisions. on 14 october 2012 the monor police department forbade the demonstration. it was of the view that the planned demonstration would endanger traffic and would render the airport inaccessible, infringing passengers’ right to leave the country. in any event, the demonstration would breach the traffic code, since those parts of the road not used for traffic were not supposed to be accessed by pedestrians or be used for parking. on 17 october 2012 the applicants requested judicial review of the decision, relying on their right to freedom of expression and to freedom of assembly. they argued that a demonstration could only be forbidden on the grounds of a need to ensure traffic safety if there were no alternative means of access to the airport. in their view the demonstration would not constitute any greater hindrance to traffic than would roadworks. by a decision of 19 october 2012 the budapest surroundings high court (budapest környéki törvényszék) dismissed their complaint, endorsing in essence the police department’s reasoning (see paragraph 9 above).
the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in nova gorica. the applicant was working as a cleaning lady when she allegedly developed serious medical complications in her left wrist, which could only partly have been addressed by surgery. this resulted in her using predominantly her right arm, which in turn resulted in the overburdening of that arm, giving rise to a number of medical problems. because of these medical issues she was found, in 2006, to be incapable of further work and officially recognised as having a partial disability. on 30 december 2011 the applicant applied to the pensions and disability insurance institute of the republic of slovenia (“the institute”) for a disability allowance in respect of a physical impairment (nadomestilo za invalidnost – hereinafter “disability allowance”). the commission – composed of an occupational medicine specialist, an orthopaedic specialist and a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician – based its opinion on an examination of the medical records submitted by the applicant and a clinical examination of the applicant. on 15 may 2012 the second-instance disability commission of the institute, located in ljubljana, composed of an occupational medicine specialist and an orthopaedic specialist, examined the applicant’s medical file and again issued a report to the effect that no physical impairment stipulated in the list could be found. on 7 june 2012 the central office of the institute, referring to the conclusions of the second-instance disability commission, dismissed the applicant’s appeal. a copy of the second-instance disability commission’s opinion was attached to the decision. she argued that because of the incapacity of her arms the functioning of her body was inhibited and greater efforts were required to satisfy her daily needs. she also argued that the opposing party should have more seriously examined all her medical problems. in her view her physical impairment amounted to at least 50% incapacity; however, the exact degree could only be determined by a medical expert. she accordingly proposed that a medical expert be appointed. on 6 september 2013 the ljubljana labour and social court, sitting in a single-judge formation, dismissed the applicant’s application for a disability allowance. after taking into account the documents in the file and the hearing of the applicant, the court found that the institute had correctly established the facts. referring to the findings of the disability commissions and its own direct observation of the applicant at the hearing, it concluded that the impairment to the applicant’s health did not amount to a physical impairment within the meaning of the law. on 17 october 2013 the applicant lodged an appeal against the first-instance court’s finding. on 6 february 2014 the higher labour and social court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, finding that the facts had been sufficiently established and the substantive law applied correctly. the higher labour and social court further found the following:
“a court in a judicial social dispute ... assesses the correctness and lawfulness of the impugned administrative decisions [in question] and having regard to the dispute of the full jurisdiction [the court] when quashing [the administrative decisions] alone decides on the merits. moreover, the question of whether a particular condition amounted to an impairment was different to the question of whether it amounted to a disability. the applicant lodged an application for leave to appeal on points of law. she argued that her right to a fair trial had not been respected because the court had refused to appoint a medical expert and had assessed the applicant’s condition itself, despite lacking the necessary medical knowledge. she had thereby been deprived of her only possibility to challenge the institute’s decisions. she moreover argued that the first-instance court should not have based its decision on the list. on 10 june 2014 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s application, holding that there were no grounds for allowing an appeal on points of law. on 21 july 2014 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint. she further argued that she could not have explained all her medical issues at the hearing and that the court had not been in a position to assess the flexibility of her arms. her only way of effectively challenging the institute’s decision would have been by way of appointing an independent medical expert; as had been proved in the past, independent medical experts had often reached findings contrary to those of disability commissions. she invoked article 22 (equal protection of rights) and article 23 (the right to judicial protection) of the constitution. she also reiterated her complaint about the reliance on the list.
he is currently serving a prison sentence. on 9 july 2002, following proceedings in absentia, the gjirokastër district court convicted the applicant of attempted armed robbery, negligent homicide and premeditated murder in relation to another criminal offence, and sentenced him to twenty-five years’ imprisonment. three other co‑defendants, whose requests for the use of the summary procedure had been granted, were also found guilty. the applicant was represented by a court-appointed lawyer. on 7 october 2002, following an appeal by the three other defendants, the gjirokastër court of appeal upheld the decision in the applicant’s absence. on 10 october 2007, upon the applicant’s extradition to albania, the district court accepted his application for leave to appeal out of time. the district court stated in its reasoning that the postal service had noted that the applicant was living in italy and that as a consequence he had not been aware of his conviction. on an unspecified date in october 2007 the applicant lodged his appeal. in the first place, he requested that his case be re-examined separately from that of his co-defendants on the grounds that he had not sought the use of the summary procedure. he relied on the supreme court’s unifying decision no. 2 of 29 january 2003 (see paragraph 16 below). secondly, he requested that a fresh examination of the evidence be conducted in his presence and that a number of witnesses be questioned. thirdly, he maintained that the authorities had failed to inform him about the judicial proceedings before the first-instance court. on 17 december 2007 the gjirokastër court of appeal upheld the applicant’s conviction in absentia. the court ruled that the applicant had not put forward new evidence to change the outcome of those proceedings. his request had been directed against the probative value of evidence which had already been examined and decided upon. in upholding the conviction, the court relied on forensic evidence produced in 1997 and 1999 and on witness statements made in 2001 and 2002. the court further stated that the applicant had been duly informed as the authorities had issued a public notice. it finally noted that the summary procedure had been applied equally to all the defendants in accordance with the supreme court’s unifying decision of 29 january 2003 (see “relevant domestic case law below”). separating the cases could not be considered as the district court had not decided on that issue. on an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal against the court of appeal’s decision. he complained of a breach of his right to have witnesses questioned and evidence re-examined. he stressed the fact that in his appeal to the court of appeal he had asked for evidence to be obtained, including an identification parade, the questioning of a fourth person who had been present at the events, a face-to face confrontation between himself and the other co-defendants and so on. it had not been possible for him to obtain that evidence himself, only the courts or the prosecutor could have done that. the applicant also maintained the other complaints he had raised in his court of appeal case. on 5 march 2010 the supreme court dismissed the appeal, finding that it lacked any grounds of appeal as prescribed by law. on 21 february 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal with the constitutional court. on 9 may 2011 the applicant’s lawyer was notified of the constitutional court’s decision that his appeal was inadmissible.
the applicant was born in qesarat, tepelenë, in 1977. he is currently serving a prison sentence. on 14 january and 10 november 2005, following proceedings in absentia, the gjirokastër district court and the court of appeal, respectively, convicted the applicant of attempted theft resulting in death in collusion with others and sentenced him to seventeen years’ imprisonment. that decision became final on 9 february 2007 after the supreme court dismissed an appeal by the applicant’s lawyer. it appears that the applicant was represented by a lawyer appointed by his family throughout the court proceedings. it appears that on 30 march 2007 the applicant was extradited from greece to albania. on 3 may 2007 the gjirokastër district court allowed a request by the applicant to appeal out of time and he lodged an appeal against his conviction in absentia. on 12 november 2007 the gjirokaster court of appeal while requalifying the charges against the applicant on the basis of the evidence obtained during the proceedings in absentia, upheld the applicant’s conviction, ruling that it had become res judicata. by a final decision of 7 october 2009 the supreme court upheld the applicant’s conviction as decided in the gjirokastër district court’s decision of 2005, ruling that it had become res judicata and that the facts and law in the case had been examined previously. it further noted that leave to appeal out of time should not have been granted as the case had become res  judicata. on 21 february 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal with the constitutional court against the supreme court’s decision, complaining, inter alia, about the fact that the domestic courts had not given him the possibility of a fresh factual and legal determination of the criminal charge. on 9 may 2011 the applicant’s lawyer was notified of the constitutional court’s decision to dismiss his appeal.
the first applicant was born in 1947 and lives in dolyna, a city in the ivano-frankivsk region. the applicant obtained a property certificate in respect of that land on 13 august 2007. the second applicant was born in 1939 and lives in ternopil. in november 2004 he inherited it from her. he obtained a property certificate on 22 july 2008. the land is rented by a limited liability company. the courts could shorten this period if there was a valid reason for such a decision. 720/95 of 8 august 1995 provided for a programme of gradual reform of the caes through the issuance to their current and former members of shares of land, that is to say land entitlements in the form of shares of the whole land mass of the cae expressed as a number of hectares but without a specific physical location or defined boundaries. some 107,000 shares were sold or otherwise disposed of by their new owners, which, according to parliament, showed that they had not been adequately informed about the land reform and their rights and duties.[2]
parliament observed that, due to a lack of funding, the cabinet of ministers was only planning to complete the share conversion and titling work by 2006, which made it impossible to introduce the land sales market from 1 january 2005, as the land code provided at the time (see paragraph 19 below). date of the law

the law extending the moratorium instructed the cabinet of ministers to produce the draft cala and submit it to parliament by 01/03/2016
lifting the moratorium in times of war and economic crisis would be a threat to national and food security and the threat of a loss of land, as an important national resource. currently the transitional provisions state that those restrictions are to remain effective until the entry into force of the circulation of agricultural land act (“the cala”), but in any case at least until 1 january 2019. article 14 § 2 guarantees the right to land ownership and provides that land ownership may be acquired and exercised by citizens, legal entities and the state in accordance with the law. the right to private property shall be inviolable...” 26. article 130 provides that land zoned for commercial agricultural production can only be acquired by a ukrainian national with sufficient educational qualifications or experience to engage in agricultural production or by a ukrainian legal entity which has agriculture listed in its articles of association among the types of business it can engage in. section 19 of the land lease act provides that for the main categories of agricultural land, the term of lease cannot be less than seven years and, for any lease, cannot exceed fifty years. on 31 may 2002, in his annual address to parliament on the state of the nation, the president of ukraine stressed the need to create the structure for an efficient and transparent land market by 2005, when the moratorium would expire. steps in order to introduce a regulated land market had to be taken urgently.[19] 40. the bill also contained a number of other rules aimed at safeguarding the efficient use of agricultural land. but how can we resolve this problem, my dear legislators? until now, ukrainians have been deprived of that right. for now, unfortunately, it has been formed by the populists. i am not going to put pressure on parliament to adopt the land reform, i will not do it. but i am asking you to make a resolution, for now at least a silent one, in your minds, in favour of such a reform. the 2017 plan stated that the draft cala would be submitted to parliament in the second quarter of 2017. however, it appears that no such bill has been introduced.[24] 44. it appears from the material available to the court on the legislation of member states of the council of europe that none of the thirty‑two member states surveyed has a general ban on the sale or any other form of alienation of agricultural land. in another example, in norway a typical condition on which authorisation is granted may be that the buyer must move onto the land and live on it for five years. some states, such as estonia, poland and sweden, generally authorise only individuals, and not legal entities, to acquire agricultural land of a certain size and subject acquisition by legal entities to additional conditions, such as the need to obtain a permit. however, these restrictions are subject to exceptions, notably in cases of inheritance and where more liberal rules are provided by international agreements.
the first applicant was born in 1958 and lives in prague. on 17 october 2003 he married b., a ukrainian national, in prague. b. continued to live with the child at a different address in prague. by the decision of the prague 10 district court adopted on 6 november 2008, which was upheld on appeal on 19 may 2009, the first applicant and b. were granted alternating custody of the second applicant (with a change of parent each week). on 27 june 2009 b. took the second applicant at her residence pursuant to the above alternating custody scheme. without the consent of the first applicant, she moved to ukraine with the second applicant and settled in demeshkivtsi, ivano-frankivsk region. the child was to be returned by b. whilst accompanied by the first applicant. on october 2010 b. lodged an appeal on points of law. on 28 june 2011 that decision was upheld on appeal. the court noted that the judgment of 2 july 2010 ordering the return of the child had not been enforced, and found that the child had in the meantime settled in a new environment in ukraine. in that regard the court referred to the psychological and pedagogical report which concluded that the child was attached to his mother and that discussion about his father caused him feelings of fear. it also examined reports by the local childcare authorities suggesting that the child should live with his mother. on 6 march 2014 the ivano-frankivsk regional court of appeal upheld the decision of the first-instance court, finding that the child had settled in a new environment since his arrival in 2009 and that b. was entitled to bring that action in order to ensure the best interests of the child. the first applicant did not appeal on points of law against that decision. on 27 september 2010 the bailiffs of the halych district department of justice started proceedings to enforce the judgment ordering the return of the child and contacted the parties to that effect. for that reason, on 6 october 2010 she was ordered to pay a fine of 170 ukrainian hryvnias (uah)[1]. two days later, she was ordered to pay a further fine of uah 340[2]. on 3 november 2010 the halych district court of ivano-frankivsk region dismissed the bailiffs’ request to put the child on the search list. 7 in kalush after receiving information that the second applicant was a pupil there. b. initially agreed to move to the czech republic and settle there and to bring the second applicant to live with her. several days later b. informed the other parties that she had changed her mind. as b. and the child could not be found at their residence and the child’s whereabouts were unknown, the bailiffs requested that the court put the child on the search list and place him temporarily in care. on 23 august 2011 the halych district court granted the requests. however, when the bailiffs attempted to enter the house on 28 november 2011, b. refused to open the door. as b. and the child were not present at their address when the bailiffs made further visits, the bailiffs applied to the court to have them put on the search list and to have the child placed in temporary care. the court also examined submissions from the local childcare authorities to that effect. on 26 march 2012 the bailiffs discovered that the child – who by now was almost eight years old − had stopped attending school and was being instructed at home by a teacher from the kalush school. it found that the judgment of 2 july 2010 to return the child to czech republic did not include the requirement to remove the child from b., who was “the debtor” in the enforcement proceedings. the court held that the bailiffs had the power to impose fines on b. and to request other measures of legal liability. on 22 august 2014 the ivano-frankivsk town court reversed the bailiff’s decision as unfounded.
the applicant was born in 1972 and is currently detained at the corradino correctional facility, paola. on 11 december 2010 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having murdered his former partner. on 13 december 2010 he was charged before the court of magistrates, as a court of criminal inquiry, with inter alia, wilful homicide. apart from the hearings related to the bail applications and other specific requests, fourteen hearings were held where scores of witnesses gave evidence and another six hearings were held where nothing happened and the case was adjourned. by a judgment of 23 november 2012 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s appeal and confirmed the appealed judgment. after the applicant had been held in custody for the maximum period of detention allowed by law, he became entitled to bail in accordance with article 575(6)(a)(iii) of the criminal code (see relevant domestic law). in the event of any bail condition being breached, the entire amount of eur 40,000 would be forfeited in favour of the state. he complained that although he had been in detention for twenty-two months, and was entitled to bail, he had nevertheless remained in detention since he (and his family) could not afford to pay such an excessive amount by way of deposit. on 10 october 2012 the attorney general objected to the applicant’s new request, noting that the applicant was not reliable, and that his inability to pay the deposit showed that he would be unable to pay the personal guarantee if he were to breach his conditions. moreover, the family of the victim, particularly her daughter, lived in fear of the applicant. by a decree of 18 october 2012, having seen the request and the reply submitted by the attorney general, the court rejected the applicant’s request. on 4 december 2012 the applicant filed another application requesting the court to reduce the amount that he had to deposit. on 29 january 2013 the applicant filed yet another application requesting that the amount of deposit be reduced. on 5 february 2013 the applicant filed a note reiterating his request. by a decree of 5 february 2013 the court, having considered the parties submissions, as well as its decree of 7 december 2012, was of the view that it should not alter the considerations made in the latter decision. it, thus, rejected the applicant’s request. he referred to a property the relatives had inherited which they were willing to put forward as a guarantee instead of the deposit. on 2 august 2013 the court accepted that the applicant’s mother stand as surety by means of a hypothec on the above-mentioned property which she owned together with other relatives. subsequently on 6 august 2013 the applicant having signed a personal guarantee of eur 25,000 and his mother having effected the relevant hypothec as guarantee, the applicant was released from custody after thirty-two months of pre-trial detention. it held that when a court accepted that an applicant had to be granted bail, that court had to establish the proper conditions which the applicant had to satisfy to be released and yet appear for court proceedings. if the guarantees included the deposit of a sum of money, such pecuniary condition had to be considered by reference to the person of the accused and his means as well as his relation with the person who would act as his surety. the court noted that the applicant did not satisfy this obligation. it was his duty to provide the courts with information on his income, savings and list his assets. in the court’s view, in the present case, bearing in mind the seriousness of the crime and the potential punishment, the applicant had not brought enough evidence before the courts of criminal justice to substantiate his claim that those courts had imposed excessive conditions (including that referring to the amount of deposit). indeed even though the collection of evidence had come to an end, one had to guarantee that the evidence remained intact and thus relevant guarantees were necessary. although the applicant relied on the court’s judgment of iwanczuk (cited above), where a violation had been found on the basis that it took four months for the polish authorities to adjust the conditions for bail, the constitutional court held that (even if this were the case), the applicant – who was legally represented ‑ had not explored all avenues to satisfy the courts with an adequate guarantee for the observance of the conditions of bail. the fact that the applicant had at times worked and had a salary or wage made the need to provide information to the court on his means more relevant. the constitutional court considered that although the law also referred to the financial situation of the person accused, this factor was not to be taken in isolation – it was for the court fixing the amount of deposit to consider all the factors taken together and not separately. further bail requests were lodged and rejected until 26 january 2015 when a bill of indictment was issued against the applicant. on 16 june 2015 the criminal court was informed that a plea bargain had been concluded between the applicant and the prosecution.
the applicant was born in 1982 and lives in koper. after going missing on 4 november 2007, x was found dead near the local komen-branik road, close to the town of komen, on the morning of 5 november 2007. he had been repeatedly stabbed and cut with a knife and then run over by a car. the police were called to the scene, as were the district state prosecutor and the duty investigating judge. on examining the crime scene, x’s mobile telephone was found in his car. furthermore, having been informed that x’s mobile telephone had been found, the district state prosecutor requested the duty investigating judge to order the s company – the mobile network operator in question – to produce records of telephone calls made and text messages sent from the telephone. on the same day (5 november 2007) the investigating judge of the koper district court issued an order for a search of x’s home and ordered the s company to provide data concerning communication undertaken via x’s mobile telephone. on 7 november 2007 the investigating judge issued an order that the m company – a mobile network operator – provide data concerning the applicant’s mobile telephone record. the m company provided a disk containing the requested data on the same day. in the course of the preliminary inquiry, the investigating judge ordered a post-mortem examination of x, a dna analysis and a comparison of biological traces found on the applicant’s clothes and other objects seized during the home search with those found on x’s body. she also ordered a medical examination of the applicant with a view to establishing any injuries. the applicant, represented by counsel, was heard on 8 november 2017 and was subsequently detained on remand. on 16 november 2007 the investigating judge opened a judicial criminal investigation against the applicant in respect of the criminal offence of aggravated murder. she, inter alia: ordered that a reconstruction be carried out at the crime scene; appointed a psychiatrist and a psychologist to examine the applicant and prepare opinions; ordered forensic experts in vehicle science and car crash investigations to prepare reports on specific aspects of the case; and again ordered that the m company and the s company provide traffic data relating to x’s and the applicant’s telephones. on 24 december 2007 the state prosecutor filed an indictment for aggravated murder against the applicant, alleging that he had killed x by stabbing him thirteen times and cutting him at least nine times on his head, neck, chest and other parts of the body and running over him in his car. following his unsuccessful objection to the indictment, the applicant was put on trial for aggravated murder. a number of hearings were held at which witnesses, experts and evidentiary material were examined and various expert reports ordered and subsequently read out. on 10 june 2008 the koper district court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to thirteen years in prison. the case was remitted to the koper district court for fresh examination. on 4 september 2009 the koper district court convicted the applicant for the aggravated murder of x and sentenced him to twelve years’ imprisonment. - in view of the foregoing conclusion that the examination of the applicant’s telephone could have not been admitted to the file, the court refused as unnecessary a request by the applicant for the examination of the officers who had seized the applicant’s telephone (see paragraph 20 above). - as regards the exclusion of evidence (see paragraph 20 above) the court explained that the applicant had become a subject of investigation following the examination of the data in x’s telephone, which had not interfered with the applicant’s rights under article 37 of the constitution (see paragraph 32 below). in addition, the court noted that the results of this examination had not been included in the file and had not been relied on by the court. on 9 november 2009 the applicant appealed, complaining, inter alia, that the judgment had violated his defence rights. thus, in his view, the impugned judgment should not have concluded that the examination of his telephone had had insignificant evidentiary value. on 22 december 2011 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law. however, in the supreme court’s view, the information on whether the text message with sexual content had been sent from the applicant’s telephone would have inevitably been discovered, either (i) by means of a simple call to the number from which the message had been sent, (ii) by checking the applicant’s telephone’s sim card (for which, in the supreme court’s view, no court order would have been necessary), or (iii) on the basis of a court order, which had in point of fact later been issued. the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint, reiterating the allegations made in his previous appeals. with regard to the supreme court’s finding that the evidence in question would have been inevitably discovered, the applicant argued that the domestic law contained a strict rule requiring the exclusion of all evidence obtained by means violating human rights (“the domestic exclusionary rule”). he furthermore argued that there had been a violation of article 29 (see paragraph 32 below) of the constitution because the first-instance court refused to obtain from the police their notes on the examination of his telephone.
he is currently serving a prison sentence. in 1998 the applicant was implicated in the commission of the criminal offence of setting up and being a member of an armed gang and of other criminal offences. on 4 february 1999 the prosecutor charged him with the offences of membership of an armed gang, attempted intentional murder and other crimes. the notification of the prosecutor’s charges was acknowledged by the applicant’s officially appointed lawyer. it appears that throughout the investigation proceedings the applicant was represented by an officially appointed lawyer. on 12 february 1999 the elbasan district court ordered the applicant’s arrest. however, the order could not be enforced as the applicant could not be traced. on 19 february 1999 the elbasan district court declared the applicant a fugitive from justice after unsuccessful attempts to locate him. the decision stated that it was impossible to find him as it appeared that he had escaped to an unknown destination (këto kërkime nuk kanë bërë të mundur kapjen e të pandehurit pasi ai rezulton të ketë ikur në drejtim të paditur). on an unspecified date the prosecutor decided to commit the applicant for trial. on 28 may 1999 the supreme court transferred the case for examination to the durrës district court. on 2 june 1999 the applicant’s father appointed a lawyer to represent the applicant before the domestic courts. the trial proceedings against the applicant were conducted in absentia and he was represented by a lawyer appointed by his family in accordance with article 48 § 3 of the code of criminal procedure (“ccp”). on 15 february 2000 the durrës district court convicted the applicant in absentia of establishing and participating in an armed gang and attempted intentional murder. he was sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment. the decision was based on evidence from documents and witness testimony. the applicant’s family-appointed lawyer and the other co-accused appealed against the conviction to the durrës court of appeal (“the court of appeal”). on 19 april 2000 the court of appeal declined to examine the applicant’s appeal on the grounds that the applicant’s family had not given any express authority to the lawyer for such a procedure. however, the court of appeal examined the applicant’s case as part of its overall examination, having regard to the appeals of the other defendants. it convicted the applicant of the same offences as before and sentenced him to thirteen years’ imprisonment. on 7 december 2000 the supreme court dismissed appeals by the applicant and other co-accused against the court of appeal’s decision of 19 april 2000. on 16 september 2005 the applicant was arrested by the czech authorities on the basis of an arrest warrant issued by albania. on 25 january 2006 the applicant was extradited to albania. on 1 march 2006 the applicant was officially informed of his conviction in absentia. on 13 september 2007 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal against the conviction in absentia. on 24 october 2007 the constitutional court, sitting in camera, declared the appeal time-barred as the two-year time-limit had started to run on 7 december 2000. the constitutional court’s reasoning stated that throughout the proceedings the applicant had been represented by a court‑appointed lawyer or a family-appointed lawyer and that accordingly he had had the opportunity to become acquainted with the proceedings brought against him.
the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in osijek. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. on 6 november 2000, in inheritance proceedings following the applicant’s grandmother’s death, the applicant’s relative, m.j., and the applicant’s father were declared the beneficiaries in respect of a house, which was not registered in the land register, by a decision of the zabok municipal court (općinski sud u zaboku). brought a civil action against the applicant in the zabok municipal court (općinski sud u zaboku) asking that court to recognise his ownership of a share of half of an inherited piece of property and to order the applicant to allow him to register his ownership in the land register. he set the value of the dispute (vrijednost predmeta spora) at 110,000 croatian kunas (hrk). in the proceedings before the first-instance court, on 5 november 2007 the applicant contested the value of the dispute and suggested that it be set at hrk 300,000. at the hearing held on 23 january 2008 the applicant, inter alia, withdrew her objection to the value of the dispute as indicated by the claimant, and stated that she agreed with it. in its judgment of 25 april 2008 the zabok municipal court accepted m.j. the applicant lodged an appeal with the zlatar county court (županijski sud u zlataru) and on 16 september 2009 the second-instance court dismissed her appeal as ill-founded, upholding the first-instance judgment. on 24 november 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske), challenging the lower courts’ judgments. on 27 may 2010 the supreme court declared the applicant’s appeal on points of law inadmissible ratione valoris. ’s civil action as being composed of two separate claims arising from different factual and legal bases - the first one for recognition of ownership, and the second for obtaining an order securing the registration of his ownership in the land register (hereinafter “the issuance of a clausula intabulandi”). the supreme court thus halved the value of the dispute and held that the value of each claim did not reach the necessary ratione valoris threshold of hrk 100,001 (approximately 13,300 euros (eur)) for an appeal on points of law to be admissible. the relevant part of this decision reads as follows:
“the claimant in his civil action indicated the value of the dispute as hrk 110,000. pursuant to section 37(2) of the cpa [(civil procedure act)], if the claims in the civil action arise from a variety of grounds, or different claimants put forward individual claims or individual claims are raised against several defendants, the value of the dispute must be established in accordance with the value of each individual claim. in the instant case the claimant made two non-monetary claims, one concerning property rights - for recognition of ownership -, and a claim under the law on obligations - for the issuance of a clausula intabulandi , namely for obtaining an order securing registration of his ownership in the land register. therefore, the value of the dispute has to be established in relation to the value of the dispute of each claim. consequently, the value of the dispute of each claim ... has to be established by dividing the indicated unique value of the dispute by [these] two [claims]. given that the claimant indicated the [unique] value of the dispute as hrk 110,000, and that this amount should be divided by [the number of the claims], the value of the dispute of each claim does not exceed the amount of 100,000. it follows that an appeal on points of law by the defendant is inadmissible.” the applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske), arguing that m.j. ’s action had two aspects which could not be separated, and that the supreme court’s decision finding that the case concerned two separate claims had therefore been arbitrary and had violated her right to a fair hearing, in particular her right of access to the supreme court, as guaranteed under article 29 of the constitution. on 17 february 2011 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint. it held that the applicant in her constitutional complaint “did not demonstrate that the supreme court had failed to respect the provisions of the constitution concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely that it had applied relevant law in an arbitrary manner” and that therefore “the present case did not raise a constitutional issue.” its decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 3 march 2011.
the applicant was born in 1968 and is detained in rezina. the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment on an unknown date some 10 years prior to the relevant events and is serving his sentence in prison no. on 16 march 2011 the prison administration found a mobile phone in his cell. since this is an object possession of which is prohibited by prison rules, on 23 march 2011 the prison administration sanctioned him with a reprimand. on 26 july 2011 the prison board decided that the applicant was always to be handcuffed when moving outside his cell. an extract from the decision of the prison board issued to the applicant noted that the prison board had “examined [the applicant]” and had decided to apply handcuffs. no further reasons were given and the length of the period for which the measure was to apply was not specified. it appears from the applicant’s submissions that the measure was revoked at an extraordinary meeting of the prison board five months after it was imposed. on 28 july 2011 the applicant asked the prison administration on what grounds the prison board had decided that he should be handcuffed. 4 of the prisons department (see paragraph 17 below). in a letter dated 26 september 2011 the prisons department informed the applicant, in response to his request, that the use of handcuffs and other restraints was prescribed by the regulation concerning the serving of sentences, adopted by government decision no. 583 of 26 may 2006 (“the regulation” – see paragraphs 14 and 16 below). also on 26 september 2011 the applicant challenged the prison board’s decision before the investigating judge, arguing that he had been sanctioned twice for the same offence, contrary to the express legal requirements, and that he had not been informed of the reasons for the decision to handcuff him. he noted that handcuffing was a sanction and relied on the reply of the prisons department (see the preceding paragraph) in arguing that that sanction could only be applied on the basis of the regulation and not some secret order. the prosecutor, who also participated in the hearing, added that the sanction had been necessary in order to prevent the applicant posing any danger to other detainees. on 25 november 2011 the rezina district court dismissed the applicant’s complaint as unfounded. it found that the measure in question had been applied lawfully and in order to prevent the applicant posing any danger to other detainees. the applicant attempted to have the decision quashed by using an extraordinary remedy, but on 3 october 2012 the supreme court of justice refused his request. under article 593 of the regulation concerning the serving of sentences, adopted by government decision no. 583 of 26 may 2006 (“the regulation”), only one sanction may be applied in respect of a disciplinary offence. under article 95 of the regulation, as modified on 26 september 2008, persons serving life imprisonment shall be handcuffed when moving outside their cells if it is established during the last evaluation that the absence of such a measure will pose an immediate danger to other detainees, prison staff or other persons. evaluations of this kind shall be carried out at least once every six months. under article 219 of the regulation, a detainee may be handcuffed if (i) he or she physically resists prison staff or “is infuriated” (until he or she calms down), (ii) he or she refuses to move under escort, (iii) there are grounds for believing that there is a risk of the detainee escaping, (iv) he or she attempts suicide or self-mutilation, or attacks other detainees (until the detainee calms down), or (v) during the escorting of a detainee after his or her escape and subsequent apprehension. 4 of the prisons department adopted on 13 january 2009 provides, in section 39/1, that the prison board may decide on whether there is any need to handcuff a person sentenced to imprisonment for life or whether to remove handcuffs from such a person, depending on the degree of danger posed by him or her. 68.3 instruments of restraint shall not be applied for any longer time than is strictly necessary. the relevant parts of the 25th general report (april 2016) of the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (cpt/inf (2016) 10) provide as follows:
“the basic objectives and principles for the treatment of life-sentenced prisoners 74. in the cpt’s view, the objectives and principles for the treatment of life-sentenced prisoners enunciated by the committee of ministers in recommendation rec (2003) 23 on the management by prison administrations of life sentence and other long-term prisoners remains the most pertinent and comprehensive reference document for this group of prisoners. in summary, these principles are:
...
- the normalisation principle: life-sentenced prisoners should, like all prisoners, be subject only to the restrictions that are necessary for their safe and orderly confinement;
...
conclusion 81. the cpt calls upon member states to review their treatment of life-sentenced prisoners to ensure that this is in accordance with their individual risk they present, both in custody and to the outside community, and not simply in response to the sentence which has been imposed on them. in particular, steps should be taken by the member states concerned to abolish the legal obligation of keeping life-sentenced prisoners separate from other (long-term) sentenced prisoners and to put an end to the systematic use of security measures such as handcuffs inside the prison.”
the applicant was born in 1986 and lives in kostino, kirov region. 74568/12, §§ 7-65, 5 january 2016) and yaroslav belousov v. russia (nos. 2653/13 and 60980/14, §§ 7-33, 4 october 2016). the event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at bolotnaya square, which was supposed to end at 7.30 p.m. the march was peaceful and held without any disruptions, but when the marchers arrived at bolotnaya square it turned out that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue, allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting. to control the crowd the police cordon forced the protestors to remain within the barriers. there were numerous clashes between the police and protesters. it took them about two hours to clear the protestors from the square. on the same day the moscow city department of the investigative committee of the russian federation opened criminal proceedings to investigate suspected acts of mass disorder and violence against the police (articles 212 § 2 and 318 § 1 of the criminal code). on 18 may 2012 the file was transferred to the headquarters of the investigative committee for further investigation. on 28 may 2012 an investigation was also launched into the criminal offence of organising acts of mass disorder (article 212 § 1 of the criminal code). the two criminal cases were joined on the same day. he was arrested on the date indicated below and charged with participation in mass disorder. the applicant was detained and tried on those charges but subsequently exempted from liability under the amnesty act. the applicant’s complaints concerning the grounds and the length of his detention on remand, the poor conditions of detention and the lack of medical assistance in the remand prison were examined in the case kovyazin and others v. russia (nos. 13008/13 and 2 others, 17 september 2015). on 4 may 2012 he received an assignment from the newspaper chief editor to attend the “march of millions” on 6 may 2012 at bolotnaya square and to take a video footage of the event. according to the applicant, on 6 may 2012 he arrived at bolotnaya square, filmed the event and did not take part in any disorder or clashes with the police. after the events in question the applicant continued to live at his usual address and to work for the newspaper. on 5 september 2012 the applicant was arrested and charged under article 212 § 2 of the criminal code (participation in mass disorder accompanied by violence). on 7 september 2012 the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention where he remained one year and three months. it was found to be unjustified by the court in the case of kovyazin and others (cited above, §§ 79-93). on 24 may 2013 the applicant’s criminal case was transferred to the zamoskvoretskiy district court of moscow for the determination of criminal charges. on 6 june 2013 court proceedings began in hearing room no. 338 at the moscow city court, moving at the end of july to hearing room no. the defendants, including the applicant, were held in glass cabins in both hearing rooms. from mid-september 2013 to the end of 2013 the hearings continued at the nikulinskiy district court of moscow in hearing room no. it was equipped with metal cages, in which nine defendants, including the applicant, sat during the hearings. for a detailed description of the conditions in those hearing rooms see yaroslav belousov (cited above, §§ 74-77). on 18 december 2013 the state duma passed the amnesty act, which exempted persons suspected and accused of criminal offences under article 212 §§ 2 and 3 of the criminal code from criminal liability. on the same day the zamoskvoretskiy district court granted the request and released him from detention.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in diyarbakır. police officers, who had started taking security measures to stop and apprehend the two persons outside the mosque in question, received information at around 2.30 p.m. on 28 may 2004 that a red motorbike with two persons on it had been observed and was on its way towards the mosque. the police officers gave chase in police cars and “küçük şiyar”, who was sitting on the back of the motorbike, drew his pistol and pointed it at a police car. küçük şiyar” stood up and fired at the police officers. the police officers returned fire and “küçük şiyar” fell to the ground. when the police officers realised that he was injured, they called an ambulance and sent him to hospital. when the four police officers searched a bag they noticed on the motorbike they found a hand grenade. according to the report, the pistol, the hand grenade and the motorbike were then taken away by the four officers in order not to hinder the flow of traffic and to prevent panic among the public, as the incident had occurred on a busy street. moreover, on the same evening a certain m.k., who was suspected of having provided logistical support to the two men, was also arrested. his body was transferred to the forensic medicine institute in order that a post-mortem examination could be carried out. in their reply of 3 june 2004 the police informed the prosecutor that the clothes had not been “handed over to the police headquarters”. the body of his son was released to the applicant the same day. on 16 june 2004 the prosecutor asked the adana police headquarters to provide the names of the police officers who had been involved in the shooting incident on 28 may 2004 and to ensure their attendance in his office for questioning. the prosecutor was subsequently provided with the forensic reports summarised above (see paragraphs 14 and 18). on 6 july 2004 the prosecutor questioned t.s., one of the police officers who had been at the hospital when the applicant’s son had been taken there. upon realising that the person had been injured, he and his colleagues had called an ambulance and transferred that person to hospital. had been arrested at the place of the incident or that he had been ill-treated. on 13 july 2004 the applicant joined the criminal investigation as an intervener. during the hearing held on 21 december 2004 the applicant, with the assistance of the lawyers representing him, submitted his written observations to the trial court. moreover, although according to the report prepared by those police officers both pistols, the hand grenades and the motorbike had been taken away by them before the arrival of the crime-scene officers, according to the crime‑scene officers’ report the motorbike had still been at the scene on their arrival (see paragraph 12 above). moreover, the forensic report pertaining to the examination of the swab samples allegedly taken from the hands of his son had not mentioned his son’s name but the name of i̇.t. at the time he had thought that they were about to be robbed and had panicked. according to the report, there was a bullet entry hole under his left armpit and a bullet exit hole in the right scapula. the police officer who had told the prosecutor on 7 july 2004 that şiyar perinçek’s clothes had been taken away from the hospital by his colleague, d.a.y. ( had changed his story to protect his fellow colleagues. and his colleagues for obstructing the course of justice. in his submissions to the trial court the prosecutor also argued that the defendant police officer had acted in self-defence. he submitted that the clothes his son had been wearing had been taken away by police officers with a view to hiding the fact that they had shot his son at close range.
the applicants were born in 1963 and 1965 respectively and live in i̇zmir. their respective children, sibel sartık and nergiz özer, aged 24 and 15 respectively, were killed by soldiers on 19 january 2005 in south-east turkey. during the same incident the soldiers also killed three other young people, aged 13, 16 and 22 (see gülbahar özer and others v. turkey, no. the bodies of those three individuals were subsequently handed over to their families, who buried them in diyarbakır. the applicants took the bodies from the morgue in order to take them to the city of siirt, where they wanted to bury them and where their graves had already been prepared with the help of the municipal officials. on the same date the governor of siirt issued a decision stating that crowds had gathered at the cemetery in siirt and had attacked the municipal workers who were preparing the graves. subsequently, the incidents at the cemetery had escalated and turned into “unlawful demonstrations”. the soldiers told the applicants that, in accordance with the decision taken by the siirt governor, the bodies would be buried in two other villages. the applicants told the soldiers that they had no connection with the two villages in question which, in any event, had been evacuated by soldiers in the 1990s. they stated that they wanted to bury their children side by side in their family cemetery in siirt. despite their objections, the bodies of the two children were confiscated and taken away by the soldiers. this request was refused but the governor amended his decision so that the applicants’ children could be buried in the same cemetery in the town of eruh, instead of being buried in two separate villages as he had previously ordered. they also requested that the administrative court issue an interim measure allowing them to exhume the bodies before they decomposed, and to bury them in a cemetery of their choice. the applicants agreed, in particular, that it was important and necessary to maintain public order. however, they argued that the governor’s decision had completely disregarded the moral values of their society and had aroused anger. when the security forces responded to those attacks heavy handedly, scores of people had been injured and more than a hundred people had been arrested. all of that unrest had been caused by the governor’s unlawful decision. no such incidents had taken place during the burial of the three other individuals who had been killed at the same time as their children. in their complaint the applicants also referred to their rights under articles 8 and 9 of the convention. on 30 march 2006 the diyarbakır administrative court rejected the case. it noted that the governor’s decision had been based on section 11/c of the law on the administration of provinces, which provided that the governor had a duty to maintain peace and public order in the province under his responsibility. the decision had been taken because the people who had gathered at the cemetery in siirt and who were waiting for the bodies to arrive had thrown stones at municipal workers and members of the security forces. the decision to bury the bodies in the town of eruh had therefore been taken with a view to maintaining public order. the applicants appealed against the decision and maintained that the incidents at the cemetery referred to by the administrative court had only occurred after the crowds had found out about the authorities’ refusal to allow them to bury their children in siirt. they repeated their argument that the three others killed by the soldiers at the same time as their children had been buried by their families in diyarbakır without incident. the applicants also reiterated their request for an interim measure. the request for an interim measure was rejected by the supreme administrative court on 13 december 2006. in a decision of 24 october 2008 the supreme administrative court also rejected the appeal lodged by the applicants against the decision of the diyarbakır administrative court. in reaching its conclusion the supreme administrative court stated that the incidents at the siirt cemetery had begun when the people who had gathered there had insisted that the applicants’ two children be buried next to the graves of members of the pkk. the decision of the supreme administrative court was communicated to the applicants on 19 march 2009.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in trinca. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. he has a hostile relationship with them and all of his former in-laws. on 30 may 2005 he wrote to the prosecutor general’s office, listing the many complaints that he had previously lodged with various authorities (including the police) of having been ill-treated by his ex-wife and children, the destruction of his property by them, and the failure of the local police to react in any manner. he explained that he had been again struck by his son. on 26 june 2006 the edineț prosecutor’s office informed the applicant that it had decided not to initiate an investigation into the alleged attack by his son (d.v.). he lodged a further complaint on 19 september 2006, but was subsequently informed that it had been decided not to initiate a criminal investigation. on 27 december 2006 the applicant’s ex-wife and children allegedly assaulted him at their home. according to the applicant, he called the police immediately after the incident and was told that they did not deal with such matters. with the results of that examination he went to a medical expert on 29 december 2006. according to a medical report dated 29 december 2006 the applicant sustained a fracture of the upper third of the radial bone in his left elbow, as confirmed also by the x-ray images. the injury was considered to be of medium severity and requiring more than twenty-one days of treatment. on 12 january 2007 he was informed that it had been decided not to initiate a criminal investigation. on the same day a new medical report was drawn up which confirmed the previous report’s findings. he had not seen any injury or sign of pain on his hand. another witness stated that he had seen the applicant cutting wood on 12 january 2007 at the local priest’s house, while three other persons were taking a rest. on 10 april 2007 t., the doctor who had seen the applicant on 28 december 2006 (see paragraph 14 above), was questioned as a witness and declared that he had seen a contusion on his body and another contusion on the left elbow, but had not identified any broken bones. t. himself did not see in the x-ray any sign of such trauma. on 2 may 2007 the prosecutor ordered another medical report to be prepared by a medical commission, because the applicant’s wife disagreed with the results of the first two reports and argued that he had been fit after the alleged assault. on 20 september 2007 the applicant was questioned by the investigator, who proposed that he submit the x-ray images taken on 28 december 2006 for examination by the medical commission. lastly, the applicant had refused to submit his x-ray results, thus preventing the medical commission from drawing up its report. on 10 april 2008 a higher-ranking prosecutor annulled the decision of 19 march 2008 as premature and taken without the origin of the applicant’s injury having been established. on 23 june 2008 the investigating judge of the edineț district court annulled that decision. lastly, the applicant had not been informed that he could submit the x-ray results directly to the centre. on 21 november 2008 the prosecutor again discontinued the investigation, essentially for the same reasons as those for which he had discontinued it earlier. he also found that the investigative actions had been “extremely superficial” and had had a “tendentious, unilateral character”. the commission also concluded that this type of injury could have been caused in the manner described by the applicant, but could also have been self-inflicted. that decision was confirmed by a higher-ranking prosecutor on 17 december 2010. the applicant submitted similar medical reports, dated 13 september and 12 november 2007, which recorded various excoriations and bruises. each time he explained that he had been beaten by his ex-wife and children.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in zagreb. in the former yugoslav socialist regime all employees contributed to housing funds. the funds thus obtained were used, inter alia, to build blocks of flats. the flats were distributed to employees, who acquired protected tenancies in respect of them and other already existing socially owned flats. each publicly owned company drew up a list of persons to be granted specially protected tenancies. when a person on such a list was granted a specially protected tenancy, his or her housing needs were considered to have been met and his or her name would be removed from the list. the applicant was employed by a socially owned company, s. all employees of s. paid contributions to a housing fund in the amount of 3% of their monthly salaries. however, since that decision was not yet final, company s. entered into an agreement with the applicant on 7 december 1988 giving her the right to move into the flat with her family and to care for that flat. the applicant moved into the flat and has been living there ever since. the decision to grant the applicant a specially protected tenancy was challenged by three other employees and quashed by the zagreb basic court of associated labour (osnovni sud udruženog rada u zagrebu). on 27 march 1990 the housing committee of company s. drew up a priority list for the distribution of flats. on 23 april 1990 the company’s workers’ council approved the priority list. on the basis of that list she was entitled to have a decision allocating a flat to her issued. on 27 april 1992 the flats of the company s. were transferred for management to the zagreb municipality. on 9 and 15 may 1990, respectively, two other employees of company s. brought an action before the competent court, seeking to have the priority list declared null and void. competence in the matter was subsequently transferred to the zagreb municipal court, which on 3 february 1999 dismissed the claims on the merits since there was no possibility under the relevant law to bring such an action at all. a civil action could be brought to challenge the decision on allocation of a flat but not to challenge a priority list. meanwhile, on 3 june 1991 parliament had enacted the protected tenancies (sale to occupier) act (zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo), which abolished the specially protected tenancies and regulated the sale of socially owned flats previously let under a specially protected tenancy. on 29 november 1995 the applicant asked the zagreb municipality as the owner of the flat to conclude a contract for the sale of the flat with herself as the buyer. the zagreb municipality did not take any decision within the prescribed time-limit of sixty days. on an unspecified date in 2005 the applicant re-submitted to the zagreb municipality her request to purchase the flat she occupied. the request was refused on 6 july 2005 because she had not been granted a specially protected tenancy in respect of that flat. the judgment was upheld by the zagreb county court on 8 april 2008. in a subsequent constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant, she complained that her right to equality before the law, her right to an appeal as well as her right to a fair trial had been violated. she argued that she had been the first on a priority list drawn up by company s. for the distribution of flats. however, once those proceedings had ended, all of the conditions for recognition of her specially protected tenancy of the flat at issue had been met. the one-year validity of the priority list was to be counted from the date of its being confirmed, which in the applicant’s case had occurred when the national courts had dismissed all the objections concerning that list. she also relied on some other decisions of the constitutional court whereby it had granted protection to persons in situations comparable to her own. on 11 may 2012 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint on the grounds that the findings of the lower courts that she had not acquired a specially protected tenancy of the flat at issue had been correct. it further held that the decisions the applicant had relied on concerned persons who had had specially protected tenancies which they had subsequently lost.
the applicants were born in 1975 and 1976 and live in cahul and cetireni respectively. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 8 situated in the town of tighina (bender), in the transdniestrian region of the republic of moldova. 8 is under the exclusive control of the moldovan authorities. by october 2003 some 236 people were detained there; some of them, such as the applicants, were ill with tuberculosis. 8 from the electricity, water and heating supplies. 8, some 236 healthy detainees, including the applicants, remained in the prison after that date. the “mrt” authorities insisted that the prison needed to be closed down. he was released on parole on 14 april 2005. mr mihăilă (the second applicant) was transferred to another prison on 1 march 2004 and was released on parole on 28 march 2005. on 12 august 2003 the bender prosecutor’s office replied in general terms, describing the difficult situation with regard to prison no. 8 and the unsuccessful negotiations with the local authorities. 8 informed the court that, owing to insufficient access to water and electricity, detainees in his institution could not receive appropriate medical assistance or food of a sufficient standard, or maintain proper hygiene. according to the moldovan government, on 18 november 2003 the bender prosecutor’s office contacted the “mrt” authorities with a view to prosecuting those responsible for disconnecting prison no. the detainees had authorised the organisation to act on their behalf. on 19 may 2004 the supreme court of justice rejected the request and left the case with the bender district court. the claimants (the detainees) and their representatives were not consulted. on 28 december 2004 the bender district court declined to examine the claim because it did not satisfy legal requirements. on 1 february 2005 the bender court of appeal set aside that decision. after february 2005 many of the 141 detainees who were plaintiffs in the above-mentioned civil action were transferred to other prisons in various parts of the country, which made it more difficult for the chdom to obtain confirmation of each individual’s power of attorney, as requested by the bender district court. on 13 november 2007 the bender court of appeal decided that the case should be examined by the anenii-noi district court. it found in particular that there was a lack of valid powers of attorney in favour of the chdom. on 6 march 2008 the chdom lodged a reformulated court action in accordance with the legal requirements. the same thing occurred on 29 october 2008. none of the complaints made to the state authorities had resulted in an improvement in the conditions of detention until much later, as established in 2008. the court found that, despite the applicants’ representatives’ actions contributing to the overall length of the proceedings (twenty-six out of the sixty-seven months), a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time had taken place, requiring additional compensation which it set at mdl 6,000 (approximately eur 358 at the time). the moldovan government submitted a long list of actions concerning their efforts to assert their sovereignty over the “mrt” territory and ensure that human rights were observed in the region. they also submitted copies of documents concerning prison no. 8 in tighina/bender specifically, raising in particular the issue of the prison being disconnected from utilities within the framework of the “5+2” negotiations process (between the osce, russia, ukraine, the european union and the usa, in addition to moldova and the “mrt”) and with various international organisations. relevant reports of inter-governmental and non‑governmental organisations 37.
the list of applicants and the relevant details of the applications are set out in the appended table. on 5 april 2004 the vyborgskiy district court of st petersburg (“the vyborgskiy district court”) declared the applicant legally incapable in her absence. the applicant submitted that she had only learnt about that judgment on 19 april 2004. she lodged her appeal twice, accompanied by requests that the court reset the time-limit for lodging the appeals. on 11 october 2004 the vyborgskiy district court rejected the applicant’s latest request that the court examine her appeal. after an initial refusal, on 24 september 2009 the st petersburg city court quashed the judgment of 5 april 2004 and remitted the applicant’s case for a fresh examination. the applicant thus regained her legal capacity. on 7 march 2008 an emergency doctor was called to attend to the applicant and found that she required hospitalisation. four days later his status as a legal guardian was cancelled and transferred to the hospital. on 31 march 2008 the hospital, in that capacity, agreed to the applicant’s involuntary confinement. the lawyer supported his complaint with a copy of the power of attorney that the applicant had issued to him on 21 june 2005 for her application to the court. it relied on the applicant’s medical history since 2001 and her state of health leading to her hospitalisation in 2008. on the same day the primorskiy district court held a hearing concerning the applicant’s involuntary treatment in the psychiatric hospital. the applicant was absent from the courtroom during that presentation, but her state-appointed lawyer, ms l., was present. after the presentation the applicant was brought into the courtroom and was informed about her rights. she then said that she wanted to go home and did not wish to continue her treatment. the judge did not ask her any other questions. on 25 may 2009 the applicant met her lawyer. on 8 june 2009 the applicant asked the court to reset the time-limit for lodging an appeal against the judgment of 10 march 2009. on 17 march 2011 the st petersburg city court dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant, having fully endorsed the petrodvortsovyy district court’s reasoning. however, on 6 august 2013 the petrodvortsovyy district court confirmed its previous decision stripping the applicant of her full capacity, having stated that the amendment to the law had not yet entered into force. on 28 november 2013 the st petersburg city court upheld the judgment on appeal. the judgment of 29 june 2009 was not appealed against and it therefore became final. in october 2012 the applicant sought the restoration of his legal capacity. on 14 february 2013 the koptevskiy district court reset the time-limit for lodging an appeal. having found that in 2003 the dmitrovskiy district court had examined the applicant’s case in his absence despite the lack of any information on the applicant’s ability to attend, the moscow regional court quashed the judgment of 7 august 2003. it then proceeded to re-examine the merits of the case. the applicant, who was being treated in a psycho-neurological facility at the time, did not attend the hearing. the applicant allegedly only learned about that judgment in 2013. she asked the court to reset the time-limit for lodging an appeal in view of the lack of notification about the proceedings and her absence from the hearing.
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in senica. the court held that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence with which he was charged, that the offence had been committed in an organised way, and that therefore there was a risk that he could put pressure on witnesses, contact other perpetrators and tamper with evidence. the court relied on the testimony of p.p., who allegedly had been warned by one of the applicant’s accomplices about instructions from the applicant not to cooperate with the police. on 6 december 2006 a police investigator charged the applicant and fifteen other people with establishing, masterminding and supporting a criminal group. the applicant was also charged with aggravated coercion, extortion, and causing bodily harm. on 16 march 2007 the special court extended the applicant’s detention until 3 october 2007. on 17 april 2007 the police investigator charged the applicant with another count of extortion. it relied on the testimony of several witnesses who were afraid to testify against him. the court took into account the complexity of the criminal investigation, finding that there had been no undue delays. on 17 march 2008 the applicant’s detention was extended until 7 july 2008. the special court added that his detention assisted the investigation, since the victims were willing to testify, but still not all of the members of the criminal group had been identified. on 26 march 2008 the supreme court dismissed an interlocutory appeal by the applicant. the bill of indictment concerned sixteen criminal acts, eighteen defendants and fourteen victims. all the crimes were qualified as particularly serious crimes. the sums extorted ranged from 10,000 to 33,000 euros (eur). on 25 june 2008 the special court examined the grounds for the applicant’s detention and ruled that he should remain in detention. on 16 july 2009 the special court dismissed another application by the applicant for release. it held that several witnesses were afraid to testify against him in his presence and had thus been heard in his absence. in particular, one witness had been contacted and threatened by unknown persons in an attempt to get him to change his testimony. the court limited the grounds for his detention to the risk of his reoffending, because the trial court had already heard all witnesses. he remained in detention pending the outcome of an appeal. on 13 september 2010 a request for release lodged by the applicant was dismissed by the special court. on 10 august 2010 the applicant filed a constitutional complaint (ústavná sťažnosť) against the supreme court’s decision of 10 june 2010 to dismiss his interlocutory appeal (see paragraph 21 above). at the same time, it dismissed the rest of the complaint as manifestly ill-founded. it held that the supreme court, in its decision of 10 june 2010, had failed to respond to all of the applicant’s arguments. although the supreme court had examined in detail the applicant’s arguments regarding the grounds for his detention, it had failed to respond to his other arguments, such as one about the impartiality and independence of the tribunal reviewing his detention, and another about alleged shortcomings in his representation during the judicial review, and thus the court had breached article 5 § 4 of the convention. it did not order his release, since the applicant had been convicted in the meantime and had started to serve a prison term. the hearings were scheduled on a monthly or near monthly basis. on 15 december 2008 the presiding judge of the special court fined two of the applicant’s defence lawyers: one for failing to appear at three court hearings, and the other for obstructing justice.
the applicants were born in 1935, 1945 and 1956 respectively and live in ploieşti. in 1975 a group of engineers patented an invention concerning a method for separating hydrocarbon. the first applicant is one of the inventors. the second and third applicants are heirs of the other members of the group. in a decision of 24 june 2002 the braşov county court allowed in part the action lodged by the applicants against company r., and ordered the latter to pay to the first applicant 2,284,679,617 romanian lei (rol), an amount representing compensation for the use, between 1985 and 1988, of the invention patented in 1975. the second and third applicants appealed, and in a decision of 8 november 2002 the braşov court of appeal also awarded them compensation – rol 2,230,620,676 to the second applicant and rol 1,669,759,157 to the third applicant. on 10 march 2004 the applicants and company r. signed an agreement for the payment of the compensation awarded by the court. between 2 and 21 april 2004 the company paid about 20% of the amounts granted. on 5 may 2005 the high court of cassation and justice took note of the terms of the agreement of 10 march 2004 and concluded that company r. had withdrawn its appeal on points of law against the decision of 8 november 2002 (see paragraph 7 above), which thus became final. meanwhile, on 31 march 2004 company r. had sought its judicial reorganisation under a procedure provided for by law no. 64/1995 on judicial reorganisation and bankruptcy. on 28 april 2004 the bacău county court allowed the application, started the reorganisation proceedings and nominated a judicial administrator. the applicants lodged an objection to the register of claims, asking to be recognised as priority creditors (creditori privilegiaţi). eleven other creditors also lodged objections against the records in the register of claims. meanwhile, on 24 november 2004 the judicial administrator had submitted a reorganisation plan to a vote by the creditors. in an interlocutory judgment of 8 december 2004 the bacău county court validated the plan after examining the objections raised by the unsecured creditors (creditori chirografari). in 2006 company r. paid its debts in accordance with the plan. on 11 october 2007 the braşov county court held a hearing on the objections to the register of claims lodged by the applicants. the first applicant was present at the hearing to represent both himself and the other applicants. the county court gave the parties until 18 october 2007 to submit written observations. on that date, in the applicants’ absence, it adjourned delivery of the judgment to 1 november 2007. the county court gave its judgment on 1 november 2007; it found against the applicants. on 23 january 2008, in accordance with the rules on notification in relation to court documents in insolvency proceedings (see paragraph 20 below), the judgment of 1 november 2007 was published in the bulletin of insolvency proceedings (buletinul procedurilor de insolvenţă, “the bulletin”). on an unspecified date the applicants enquired about the judgment’s date of delivery and asked the county court to provide them with a copy of the judgment, which was sent to them on 31 january 2008; they received it on 4 february 2008. on 13 february 2008 they lodged an appeal by post. before the braşov court of appeal, the applicants argued that, as they had not had access to the bulletin, they had not been able to know on which date the judgment had been published. in a final decision of 17 april 2008 the court of appeal dismissed that argument and concluded that the appeal had been made out of time, as it had been lodged more than ten days after 23 january 2008, the date on which the braşov county court’s judgment had been published (see paragraph 15 above). relying on the constitutional court’s decision no. 1137 of 4 december 2007 (see paragraph 21 below), the court of appeal considered that the notification procedure via the bulletin had offered sufficient safeguards to the participants in the proceedings, and had been justified by the nature of the insolvency procedure. on 21 june 2010 the county court closed the insolvency proceedings and noted that company r. had complied with all the obligations set out in the reorganisation plan (see paragraph 13 above), and thus it no longer had any debts.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in chișinău. the applicant is the chief executive officer of a large moldovan company specialised in the importation of medical equipement. on 8 april 2015 he was arrested by the national anti-corruption center (nac) in connection with a crimial investigation opened in november 2014. he was charged with bribery in the context of public auctions. searches were conducted at the applicant’s home and at the headquarters of his company and numerous documents, computers and mobile phones were seized by the investigators. more than twenty persons were accused in the same criminal case. among them were the former minister of health and hospital directors. many of them were apprehended and later released by the nac or by the courts. as of july 2015, the applicant was the only accused who was kept in custody. after arrest the applicant was placed in the nac detention facility. between 8 april and 8 october 2015 the applicant was detained in custody. the need for the applicant’s detention was justified by the prosecutors in the following way: that the applicant could abscond; he could influence witnesses; he could collude with other co-accused persons; and because the offence imputed to him was sanctioned with imprisonment of up to ten years. he also argued that he had a family, children, a permanent employment and a permanent abode. on 10 april 2015 the buiucani district court issued a detention order for a period of thirty days arguing that the applicant did not produce guarantees in favour of an undertaking not to hinder the good unfolding of the investigation if no detention was applied. the applicant’s appeal was rejected by the court of appeal on 14 may 2015. by decisions dated 1 and 26 june, 21 july 2015 and 15 august 2015 the buiucani district court prolonged the applicant’s detention for twenty‑five days each time. the court relied on similar reasons as before. on 15 and 29 september 2015 the buiucani district court prolonged again the applicant’s detention by twenty and eight days, respectively. the court did not state what that evidence was. however, when examining the appeal against the second decision, the same panel of judges considered that the risk of the applicant’s absconding was no longer justified and that there were no new reasons to consider necessary the applicant’s continued detention. therefore, the court of appeal ordered the applicant’s house arrest. however, the prison administration refused to follow the doctors’ prescription. several hours later, on 10 april 2015 between 3 and 4 a.m. the applicant started experiencing again pain and asked for an ambulance to be called. at 10.10 a.m. an ambulance was called again for the applicant. hospitalisation was again prescribed, but the prison administration refused to follow the doctors’ prescription. the doctors diagnosed again “lumbar radiculopathy” and discopathie with a possible lesion of the nerve. only after that, the prison administration allowed the applicant’s transfer to a hospital. he remained in hospital until 21 april 2015, when he was moved to a prison hospital. they recommended him surgical removal of his gall bladder within maximum seven days. he had high fever and presented a swelling.
the applicants were born in 1939 and 1944 respectively and live in dumbrăvița, timiș county. the facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, refer to the same context and domestic criminal proceedings as those described in association “21 december 1989” and others v. romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 may 2011) and şandru and others v. romania (no. between 17 and 28 december 1989 many people, including the applicants’ son, participated in anti-communism demonstrations in timișoara, bucharest and other cities in romania. the applicants’ son was killed by gunfire on 23 december 1989 in timișoara. in 1990 the military prosecutor’s office opened several investigations into the december 1989 armed crackdown on the anti-communism demonstrations. a main criminal investigation concerning the use of violence against civilians in bucharest and other cities was also registered with the highest prosecutor’s office – the military prosecutors section − under no. in cases concerning the events in timișoara, a separate investigation was carried out under file no. 11/p/1996, culminating in the referral to court and subsequent conviction of senior military officers by a decision of the high court of cassation and justice of 3 april 2007, which became final on 15 october 2008. as is apparent from the documents submitted by the parties, the death of the applicants’ son did not form part of this investigation, but in the court proceedings the first applicant nonetheless lodged a civil claim regarding his son’s death during the december 1989 events. the court dismissed it on the grounds that he had failed to submit documents substantiating this claim. as acknowledged by the government, both applicants are parties in the main criminal investigation file. on 26 june 2013 they brought civil claims before the prosecutor requesting the right to participate, being civil parties in this file. the applicants had first made statements and raised civil claims in criminal investigation files other than file no. 97/p/1990 (current number 11/p/2014) on 11 january 1990 and 1 march 2000. the parties did not inform the court whether these files had been joined to the main criminal investigation (see paragraph 8 above). the most important steps taken by the prosecutors in the main criminal investigation are summarised in association “21 december 1989” and others (cited above, §§ 12-41) and anamaria‑loredana orășanu and others v. romania ([committee] nos. 43629/13 and 74 others, §§ 10‑11, 7 november 2017). on 14 october 2015 the prosecutor’s office closed the main investigation, finding that the offences of homicide and instigation to homicide of which the applicants’ son had been a victim had become statute‑barred. although the parties have not communicated any information regarding the lodging of an appeal against this decision, it is apparent from the prosecutor’s office website that it was subsequently quashed and to date the main criminal investigation is still ongoing (see anamaria‑loredana orășanu and others, cited above, § 11).

(ii)  constable a.p in his statement of 29 august 2011 stated that he could not remember what type of wounds the applicant had had on his face or whether his clothes had been torn. - the applicant had stated that they had taken everything from him in the car yet according to the evidence given by constable p.p. ’s statement that he had not hit the applicant. on 13 february 2012 the attorney general concluded that although a certain degree of force had been used against the applicant, this had been necessary under the circumstances in order to prevent him from fleeing arrest. by a letter dated 7 march 2012 to the attorney general, the applicant’s lawyer expressed his disappointment concerning the conclusions of the investigation and pointed out that no explanation had been given, at least in respect of the ill-treatment the applicant had been subjected to at the police station while handcuffed and as a result of which he had ended up in hospital. she had seen a big bruise on his left shoulder and other bruises on his body. the doctor had informed her that there had been nothing wrong with the applicant and that he had been responsible only               for examining the applicant’s pancreas. denied the occurrence of a discussion between him and the investigator a.s. had failed to ask the officers about the applicant’s injuries and how they had happened; nor had he asked constable p.p., he had therefore withheld important evidence. furthermore, the canadian consul in her statement had described injuries which had not corresponded to those in the medical report of dr y.i., this, in combination with the fact that it had not been clarified which of the officers had allegedly ill-treated him, led to the conclusion that it was extremely difficult to establish the commission of any offences by any of the officers.
the applicants were born in 1979 and 2007 respectively and live in i̇zmir. on 25 october 2008, as the first applicant was driving in i̇zmir with his wife and one year-old daughter in the back seat, he lost control of his car when the road curved into a sharp bend. as a result, the car dropped into an empty concrete canal running along the right-hand side of the road, some five to six metres below the level of the road. the first applicant’s wife, yeşim çakır, lost her life at the spot and his daughter (the second applicant) was slightly injured. the report specified that the crash barrier at that particular spot had been damaged prior to the accident. after the accident the first applicant was taken to a police station to give a statement. he told the police that as he had been approaching the sharp bend, he had felt his car skidding to the left. however, since the barrier had been damaged prior to the incident, it had not stopped the car and, therefore, the car had dropped down into the empty canal. on the same date, the police also took a statement from m.s, an eyewitness. told the police that as he had been driving down the opposite side of the road, he had seen the first applicant’s car suddenly swerve to the right, after which it had hit the crash barrier on its right-hand side and had dropped down the side of the road. later the same day the i̇zmir public prosecutor questioned the first applicant in connection with the accident. the first applicant admitted before the public prosecutor that he had lost control of the car as he had been taking the bend. he said that, for a reason unknown to him, his car had skidded. he claimed that the road had not been wet, but there had been some slippery substance on it, like sand. he did not ask the court to carry out an additional investigation into the incident, but stated that the fatal accident had taken place as the crash barrier alongside the road, which was supposed to have been able to stop the car, had been badly damaged. that judgment, which was not appealed against by the first applicant, became final on 23 december 2008. on 2 march 2009 the first applicant applied for compensation from the general directorate of highways (“the general directorate”) and the municipality of i̇zmir (“the municipality”) in connection with the road traffic accident that had claimed his wife’s life. according to him, it was evident from the traffic accident report that the crash barrier at the site of the incident had been damaged prior to the incident, which suggested that other road accidents had taken place at that same spot. had the barrier been repaired prior to the accident, it would most probably have prevented the car, which had been travelling within the legal speed limit, from dropping down into the canal, in which case his wife would possibly not have sustained fatal injuries. both the general directorate and the municipality denied responsibility for the maintenance of the crash barrier at issue. on 20 may 2009 the applicants brought an action for compensation before the i̇zmir administrative court against the municipality alone, arguing that the latter had been responsible for yeşim çakır’s death on account of its failure to repair the crash barrier in a timely manner, as well as the possible structural problems with the road. the applicants submitted to the administrative court as evidence the expert report ordered by the i̇zmir magistrates’ court (see paragraph 15 above). they requested an expert examination on that matter. on 16 april 2010 the applicants once again requested an expert examination of the road in order to establish any structural problems that may have triggered the accident. they also asked the administrative court to find out how many accidents had happened on that road in the past. it appears that the administrative court did not obtain the information requested by the applicants. relying mainly on the findings in the traffic accident report and the statements of the first applicant, on 27 may 2010 the i̇zmir administrative court found that the first applicant bore sole responsibility for the accident in question, as he had lost control of his car while taking the bend, despite a sign warning of the sharp bend ahead. the applicants appealed against that judgment. they also argued that although the roadside barrier had been damaged to the point of completely losing its protective capacities, the administrative court had not taken that factor into account in assessing the municipality’s responsibility for the accident. on 25 january 2011 the supreme administrative court upheld the judgment of the i̇zmir administrative court.
the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in novocheboksarsk. the facts of the applicant’s ill-treatment in police custody were established in a judgment of the novocheboksarsk town court of the chuvash republic (“the town court”) of 22 august 2008 and upheld on 11 november 2008 by the supreme court of the chuvash republic. on 10 april 2007 the applicant was stopped by police officers on a street near his home and taken to district police station no. 1 of novocheboksarsk to have his identity checked. at the police station a district police officer (участковый уполномоченный милиции), officer m. from the novocheboksarsk town police station, who wore a police uniform, threatened the applicant by saying that a criminal case against him would be opened, grabbed him by his clothing, violently pushed him backwards against a wall several times and punched his left ear. according to a forensic medical expert’s report, the applicant had a traumatic rupture of the left eardrum with a haemorrhage, which caused a short-term – lasting between six and twenty-one days – health disorder. accordingly, this qualified as “insignificant” health damage. officer m. was convicted under article 286 § 3 (a) of the criminal code (abuse of power with the use of violence) and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment and a two‑year ban on exercising official power. in january 2009 the applicant brought a civil claim in the amount of 312,487 russian roubles (rub) against the ministry of finance of the chuvash republic in respect of non-pecuniary damage. he argued, inter alia, that his ill‑treatment by the police had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment proscribed by article 3 of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms (“the convention”), and that, in accordance with the plenary supreme court resolution no. 5 of 10 october 2003, the domestic courts were to apply the convention in accordance with the case-law of the european court of human rights (“the court”). he also argued that, in calculating the amount of compensation due in respect of non‑pecuniary damage for a violation of the convention, the domestic courts therefore had to take into account the sums awarded by the court under article 41 of the convention in similar cases. he stated that his claim had been calculated based on the sum awarded by the court in the case of ribitsch, in which a violation of article 3 of the convention had been found on account of inhuman and degrading treatment in police custody (see ribitsch v. austria, 4 december 1995, series a no. on 6 april 2009 the town court allowed the applicant’s civil claim in part. it noted that, under article 61 § 4 of the code of civil procedure, a judgment in a criminal case which had become enforceable was binding on a court examining the civil-law consequences of the acts of a person against whom the judgment had been delivered, in so far as it established whether those acts had taken place and whether they had been committed by that person. article 53 of the constitution and articles 151 and 1069 of the civil code provided for state liability for harm caused to individuals by state agents. relying on articles 1099-1101 of the civil code of the russian federation and section 8 of the plenary supreme court resolution no. 10 of 20 december 1994, the town court held that rub 20,000 would be just and reasonable satisfaction for the applicant’s mental suffering as a result of his ill-treatment by the police officer, treatment which had undermined his honour and dignity and caused him insignificant health damage. the applicant appealed against the judgment. on 6 may 2009 the supreme court of the chuvash republic upheld the judgment on appeal, fully endorsing the town court’s calculation of the amount of compensation in respect of non‑pecuniary damage. it disagreed with the applicant that, in determining the amount of compensation for non‑pecuniary damage, the domestic courts had to be guided by the amounts of such compensation awarded by the court in similar cases, stating as follows:
“indeed, in accordance with article 15 § 4 of the constitution of the russian federation, commonly recognised principles and norms of international law and international agreements of the russian federation are an integral part of [the russian federation’s] legal system. however, this does not mean that the amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damage determined by the european court of human rights in a specific case has a binding effect on national courts examining other cases where a violation of similar norms and principles can be found. the determination of the amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damage in specific cases is the prerogative of national courts examining such cases.”
the applicant is a roman catholic community in bosnia and herzegovina, based in sarajevo. by decision of 9 may 2003, which became final and binding on 4 september 2003, the human rights chamber for bosnia and herzegovina (“the chamber”) found that the federation of bosnia and herzegovina (an entity of bosnia and herzegovina) had discriminated against the applicant in its enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion guaranteed by article 9 of the convention. in order to remedy the situation it ordered the federation of bosnia and herzegovina to ensure the relocation of public schools housed in the archdiocese high school building in travnik, and to reinstate the applicant in the premises within one year. the chamber rejected a request by the applicant for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages. by an agreement of 21 may 2004, the federation of bosnia and herzegovina undertook to reinstate the applicant in the impugned premises by 1 july 2006. shortly thereafter, the travnik municipal council adopted the implementing decisions, and also one of the public schools was moved from the premises. on 23 june 2010 the travnik municipal council issued a writ of execution (rješenje o izvršenju). on 5 october 2011 the travnik cantonal court quashed that decision and remitted the case for reconsideration. on 17 october 2011 the travnik municipal court held that it lacked jurisdiction to deal with the case. on 16 may 2012 the travnik cantonal court quashed that decision and remitted the case for reconsideration. on 3 july 2012 the travnik municipal court held that the decisions of the chamber were not subject to enforcement proceedings. on 12 july 2012 the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision. at the date of the latest information available to the court (28 august 2017), the travnik cantonal court had not yet ruled on the matter. on 30 october 2012 the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina determined that the federation of bosnia and herzegovina had not yet fully enforced the decision of 9 may 2003. on 17 february 2017 the applicant initiated civil proceedings against the public school remaining in its premises, requesting its relocation, as well as damages for the use of the premises for the period between 1 february 2014 and 1 june 2017. on 14 july 2017 the municipal court in travnik rendered a judgment in the applicant’s favour, rewarding in full its claims finally specified in the proceedings, namely 270,360 convertible marks (bam)[1] for pecuniary damages and 6,713 bam for costs and expenses. the municipal court also ordered the respondent to vacate the applicant’s premises within 30 days from receiving the judgment. on 20 december 2017 the cantonal court in novi travnik upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. at the date of the latest information available to the court (20 february 2018), the central bosnia canton submitted a revision petition to the supreme court of the federation of bosnia and herzegovina against the final judgment in these proceedings. it also appears that the public school has still not been relocated.
the facts, as submitted by the parties, are similar to those in association “21 december 1989” and others v. romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, § 12-41, 24 may 2011). the applicants or their close relatives participated in demonstrations and were injured or killed by gunfire during the events of december 1989 in bucharest, brașov and vișina which led to the fall of the communist regime. in 1990 the military prosecutor’s offices from several cities opened criminal investigations into the use of violence against the demonstrators, including the applicants’ injury or their close relatives’ death during these events. the main criminal investigation was recorded in file no. in a number of cases the prosecutor decided between 1991 and 1996 not to open an investigation or to discontinue the proceedings. these cases were further examined in the main criminal investigation file irrespective of a formal decision ordering re-opening, applicants being questioned by the prosecutor and raising civil claims, according to the circumstances of each case. the most important procedural steps were described in association “21 december 1989” and others (cited above, §§ 12-41), and also in ecaterina mirea and others v. romania (nos. 43626/13 and 69 others, §§ 6-15, 12 april 2016). subsequent relevant domestic decisions are shown below. on 14 october 2015 the military prosecutor’s office closed the main investigation, finding that the complaints were partly statute-barred, partly subject to an amnesty, and partly ill-founded. it also found that some of the occurrences could not be classified as offences and some were res judicatae (see anamaria-loredana orășanu and others v. romania [committee], no. the decision of 14 october 2015 was annulled by a prosecutor general’s decision of 5 april 2016, confirmed by the high court of cassation and justice on 13 june 2016. it was noted that the investigation in file no. 11/p/2014 was incomplete and that the facts could not be established based on the evidence gathered up to that date. on 1 november 2016 the military prosecutor ordered the initiation in rem of a criminal investigation for the offence of crimes against humanity in respect of the same circumstances of fact. up to february 2017 further steps were taken in gathering information from domestic authorities, the prosecutor’s office contacting 211 civil parties, questioning members of the political party which took over the presidency at the time of events, planning the hearing of military officers and other participants in the events, verifying the activity of the relevant military units and the audio/video recordings broadcast by radio and television. at the date of the latest information available to the court (submitted by the parties on 13 april 2017 and 19 may 2017), the criminal investigation was still ongoing.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in tbilisi. on 24 october 2000 the tbilisi court of appeal convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to nine years’ imprisonment. his initial term of imprisonment was consequently extended by one year. on 6 january 2006 the applicant was placed in tbilisi prison no. 7”) to serve the sentences referred to in paragraphs 7-8 above. the search was filmed by a cameraman from the prison service (“the video recording”). it later became apparent that the bed in question belonged to the applicant. the applicant was never presented with the written record on the discovery of the knife and thus did not sign the document. on 11 august 2006 the applicant was charged with possessing an item prohibited under the prison regulations (the offence proscribed by article 378 § 2 of the criminal code), and on 4 september 2006 the prosecutor sent the case to the tbilisi city court for trial. that information was essential for the purposes of assessing whether or not the search had been conducted in a manner involving an abuse of his rights. in reply to the applicant’s application, the prosecutor argued that examining the cellmates would not be justified, given that all of them were serving criminal sentences. having heard the parties’ pleadings, the tbilisi city court decided by its ruling of 12 february 2007 to refuse the applicant’s application for the cellmates to be examined as unsubstantiated. that inconsistency was seized upon by the applicant before the trial court. the video recording was shown during the trial on 23 february 2007. the applicant objected that the recording did not necessarily establish that the knife had fallen from his mattress (the recording is described in more detail in paragraphs 25-26 below). notably, he argued that, even assuming that the knife had indeed been found in his bed by the prison officers, that fact did not necessarily mean that he had owned it; the prohibited item could have been discreetly planted in his bed by a cellmate or cellmates the moment the prison officers entered the cell with the intention of conducting a search. he was sentenced to three years in prison. in particular, in his complaint about the lower court’s refusal to examine his cellmates, he asked the tbilisi court of appeal to do so. as regards the applicant’s procedural application for summonsing his cellmates as witnesses, the appellate court rejected it as unsubstantiated. in one of the scenes, the officers took the mattress, whose cover seemed to be intact, from the metal bed frame in the cell. suddenly, there was a sound of metal hitting the floor, and an officer picked up an object, which resembled a small penknife. according to the medical documents available in the case file, on 7 november 2007 the applicant complained for the first time to the prison administration of a high fever and a dry cough. on 10 november he was transferred to the prison hospital. the applicant was occasionally coughing up blood. having regard to the medical opinion of 13 november 2007, a panel of doctors of the prison hospital elaborated a treatment plan for the applicant’s tb and hcv. he was prescribed daily doses of conventional antibiotics such as isoniazid (300 mg), ethambutol (1,100 mg), rifampicin, pyrazinamide (1,600 mg) and streptomycin (1,000 mg). 7, where he continued his course of antibiotics under the supervision of a doctor of that prison for an additional five months. subsequently, on 5 december 2008 and 11 february 2010, the applicant repeatedly underwent additional medical check-ups, which included the relevant laboratory tests and x-ray examinations, the results of which excluded any signs of a recurrence of the tuberculosis. he was extensively informed by the doctors of the possible strong neurological side-effects of the prescribed drugs. he wrote a note to that effect, which was dated 2 june 2010.
the applicant was born in 1942 and lives in batelov. in 1965 he had a sexual relationship with a woman who gave birth to a daughter, z., on 2 march 1966. as the applicant denied that he was the father, z.’s legal guardian brought proceedings on her behalf in the jihlava district court (okresní soud) for a declaration of paternity. after giving birth to z., but before initiating the aforementioned proceedings, the mother married another man. on 23 april 1970 the district court found that the applicant was z.’s father and ordered him to contribute to her maintenance. the court reached its finding after hearing evidence from several witnesses. it also had regard to documentary evidence and took into consideration the results of a blood test known as a “bio-hereditary test” (dědicko-biologická zkouška). in addition, it established that the applicant had had intercourse with the mother sometime between 300 and 180 days before z.’s birth. in such cases, a presumption of paternity arose under article 54 of the family code, unless there were clear grounds to rebut the presumption. another man had also had intercourse with the mother at the crucial time, however, the blood test established that he was not the father. the applicant lodged an appeal with the brno regional court (krajský soud) and requested another expert opinion. the regional court denied the request because the facts had been proved to a sufficient degree. it eventually upheld the judgment of the district court on 2 june 1970, which became final on 10 june 1970. in 2011 the applicant requested that the prosecutor general (nejvyšší státní zástupce) challenge his paternity in court. by a letter of 21 june 2011 he was informed that the requirements of article 62 of the family code to initiate such proceedings had not been met. z., by that time an adult, did not want to challenge paternity, it was not in her interests and the applicant had not produced any expert evidence credibly disproving it. on 29 february 2012 the applicant and z. underwent a dna examination. the resulting report of 19 april 2012 unequivocally confirmed that the applicant was not z.’s father. on 9 may 2012 the applicant submitted a new request to the prosecutor general to challenge his paternity in court. on 12 september 2012 the prosecutor general informed the applicant that the determination of his paternity had been decided by the jihlava district court under article 54 of the family code and that therefore the prosecution service could not initiate proceedings under article 62 and 62a of the family code. the prosecutor general only had that specific competence as regards statutory presumptions of paternity under articles 51 § 1 and 52 of the family code. when paternity had been established by a judicial declaration under article 54 of that code and the judgment had come into legal force, as in the applicant’s case, the law did not provide for any possibility to challenge it. relying on his rights under article 6 § 1 of the convention, the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint (ústavní stížnost) against the prosecutor general’s decision of 12 september 2012. he maintained that he had proved that he was not z.’s biological father and requested that the constitutional court (ústavní soud) order the prosecutor general to initiate proceedings and challenge his paternity. he also argued that articles 61 § 1 and 62 § 1 of the family code were unconstitutional. on 13 december 2012 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. it noted that his paternity had been established by a judicial decision which had come into legal force and stated, inter alia, that the competence of the prosecutor general could only apply if all the legal requirements had been fulfilled, which was not, however, the applicant’s case.
the applicants’ years of birth and home addresses are listed in the appendix. they are board members of the civic movement nida, a non-governmental organisation established by a group of young people in february 2011. nida is governed by a board of members composed of seven people. the first, second and fourth applicants are also co-founders. in january and march 2013 a number of peaceful demonstrations were held in baku in protest against the death of soldiers in the azerbaijani army in non-combat situations. the demonstrations were organised through social media and the applicants and other members of nida actively participated in organising and conducting them. were arrested by agents of the ministry of national security (“the mns”). domestic proceedings concerning the arrest and pre-trial detention of s.n. had been arrested for planning to incite violence and civil unrest during the unlawful demonstration scheduled for 10 march 2013. as narcotic substances had been found in their flats. it further stated that nineteen molotov cocktails had been found in b.g. were submitted for an expert examination, which began on 12 march 2013. the description of the charges consisted of a single sentence half a page long. it appears from the transcripts of the court hearings before the nasimi district court available in the case file that the applicants denied the charges against them, stating that their arrest was related to their social and political engagement. the first applicant also submitted that he had never been informed of any decision of the investigator charging him with a criminal offence until his arrest on 14 march 2013. on 27 april 2013 the nasimi district court dismissed the request, finding it unfounded. he complained, in particular, that there was no evidence that he had committed a criminal offence and that the first-instance court had failed to justify the extension of his detention pending trial. no further extension decisions were included in the case file. on 24 june 2013 the nasimi district court extended the second applicant’s detention pending trial by three months, until 1 october 2013. on 17 july 2013 the nasimi district court dismissed the request, finding that the grounds for his pre-trial detention had not changed. on 25 july 2013 the baku court of appeal upheld the first-instance court’s decision. on 17 september 2013 the prosecutor lodged a request with the court asking for an extension of the second applicant’s pre-trial detention for a period of two months. the government did not make a copy of the appeal available to the court. on 30 july 2013 the third applicant again lodged a request with the nasimi district court asking to be put under house arrest in place of pre-trial detention. on 17 april 2013 the nasimi district court dismissed the request. the court substantiated the need for the extension by the complexity of the case, the need for additional time to carry out further investigative measures and the possibility of the fourth applicant’s absconding or influencing persons participating in the criminal proceedings. on 25 june 2013 the fourth applicant appealed against that decision, reiterating that there was no evidence that he had committed a criminal offence and that the first-instance court had failed to justify his continued detention. the government did not make a copy of the request available to the court. on 15 october 2015 the supreme court upheld the appellate court’s judgment in respect of the second and fourth applicants. in the meantime, on 29 december 2014 the second and third applicants were released from serving the remainder of their sentence after being pardoned by a presidential decree.
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in kumanovo. the applicant had been in pre-trial detention since 21 october 2008 in connection with proceedings (кок бр. at the same time the investigating judge ordered that the applicant be held in pre-trial detention for thirty days, starting from 25 december 2009. 15/2005 – “the act”), namely a risk of absconding, reoffending and interfering with the investigation. as to the risk of absconding and reoffending, the judge relied on the gravity of the charges, the potential penalty, the circumstances under which the alleged offences had been committed and the links between the suspects. the applicant lodged an appeal, arguing that he had already been held in detention in relation to the other set of criminal proceedings and the reasons provided by the investigating judge were not relevant and sufficient to justify another detention order. as to the risk of the applicant’s absconding, the panel, in addition to the gravity of the charges and the potential penalty, took into account his previous history of being in “conflict with the law” (и претходно доаѓал во судир со законот) and the fact that there were parallel criminal proceedings against him for similar criminal offences. the panel based its decision on the same reasons as before. it further held that there was a risk of interference with the investigation in view of the fact that some of the witnesses and suspects who were still at large had not yet been examined. the applicant was charged with money laundering, abuse of office and extortion. on 24 march 2010 a three-judge panel ordered another thirty-day extension of the pre-trial detention of the applicant and other accused. on 12 april 2010 the court of appeal partially overturned the panel’s decision in relation to its reliance on the possibility of reoffending. three-judge panels ordered further extensions of the pre-trial detention of the applicant and the other co-accused on 23 april, 19 may, 21 june, 22 july, 20 august, 20 september, 20 october, 18 november, 17 december 2010 and 17 january 2011. the risk of flight is further supported by the financial circumstances of the [accused] ... [the applicant] ... has been in conflict with the law ... the panel has taken into consideration the fact that the accused have families and children, and that [the applicant] has immovable property in his name, but it considers that the accused’s family and material situation are insufficient guarantees of their presence at trial ...” 17. the panels had referred to his family situation and possessions, without providing an explanation for why they considered that those circumstances were not sufficient to guarantee his presence at trial. meanwhile, the applicant made several unsuccessful applications for release on bail. on 3 june 2010 the court of appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the panel’s decision. it also took note of the fact that the applicant had been convicted at first-instance in a separate set of criminal proceedings on similar charges. on 23 july 2010 the applicant again applied for release on bail because his wife had had an operation and was unable to take care of their children. as security, he offered immovable property owned by third persons (accompanied by written statements by the owners certified by a notary public), whose value was estimated at eur 1,230,614. furthermore, another person offered to make a court deposit of eur 100,000. on 6 august 2010 a three-judge panel refused the applicant’s request, finding that the nature and the amount of bail offered by the applicant did not offer sufficient guarantees for his presence during the proceedings. on 25 october 2010 the applicant again applied for release on bail. on 10 november 2010 a three-judge panel once again refused his bail application, relying on the gravity of the charges and the potential penalty. the fact that the applicant had a family and possessions in the respondent state could not provide sufficient guarantees of his presence during the proceedings. lastly, the applicant was advised that he could lodge an appeal against the decision with the court of appeal. the applicant appealed against the panel’s decision. on 6 december 2010 the skopje court of appeal upheld his appeal and overturned the panel’s decision. it further ordered that the applicant be put under house arrest. the court also decided that he should remain in custody until the judgment had become final.
the applicants were born in 1965 and 1964 respectively and live in plovdiv. on 14 march 1998 a 26-year-old woman, s.d., underwent a medical examination, which revealed several bruises on her head, neck, arms and knees. with whom he had previously had an intimate relationship, and that she had accepted the invitation. while mr momin had gone out to buy coffee nearby. on 10 march 1999 the prosecutor in charge of the investigation returned the file to the investigator for further inquiries. to carry out a number of additional investigative measures himself. on 19 december 2000 at 9.40 a.m., in the presence of the prosecutor i.p., altered her previous statement and reiterated her original version of the events, according to which she had been kidnapped, taken captive and raped by the two applicants. in particular, she stated that mr dimitrov had picked her up from her home on the morning of 13 march 1998 and had forced her into a taxi where mr momin was sitting inside. both applicants appeared to have consumed alcohol. then she had had non-consensual sex twice with mr dimitrov and once with mr momin. added that she had cancer, but was feeling well. on the grounds that this was a non-compulsory investigative measure which, moreover, was not necessary for the establishment of the facts of the case at hand. held her captive, issued death threats against her and raped her. the plovdiv district court examined the criminal case between 14 january 2004 and 21 february 2007. ’s statement of 19 december 2000 in evidence. the record of the questioning was accordingly read out in court. the court also heard evidence from the two applicants, the three police officers who had attended to s.d. in addition, it heard the opinion of a medical expert on the nature and origin of the injuries found on s.d. it based that conclusion in particular on the two defendants’ statements, part of s.d. the applicants, represented by lawyers of their choosing, challenged the evidence against them, including the admissibility and credibility of the victim’s statement of 19 december 2000, and sought their acquittal. mr dimitrov was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment and mr momin to five and a half years’ imprisonment. mr dimitrov, who had the keys, had opened the door and let mr momin in first, before pushing s.d. they had carried on threatening her, holding her down and beating her, and in that way had forced her to have sex with each of them. she had confided in her relatives, who had persuaded her to alert the police. during the subsequent investigation, s.d. ’s statement of 19 december 2000, the statements by the three police officers who had attended to her at the police station the day after the events and had carried out the initial investigative steps, the statement by s.d. it found that her alteration of her version of events in the course of the investigation had been due to the pressure exerted on her by the applicants and people close to them. on 19 december 2000 had not been violated.
the applicant company is engaged in the cultivation of mussels in castlemaine harbour in co. kerry, one of several sites in ireland where this commercial activity is exercised. the competent authority in this respect is the minister for agriculture, food and the marine (hereinafter “the minister”, and “the department” for the corresponding government department). a sea-fishing boat licence is required, and the boat used must be entered in the register of fishing boats. in 1993, the competent authorities published a notice in the national press announcing the intention to classify twelve sites, including castlemaine harbour, as a special protection area (spa) within the meaning of the domestic legislation transposing council directive 79/409/eec of 2 april 1979 on the conservation of wild birds (“the birds directive”, oj 1979 l 103, p. 1). the harbour’s spa classification took effect in 1994. the applicant company continued its activities each year, obtaining the necessary licences and permits. ... [r]egarding the aquaculture programmes, the commission relies, essentially, on the review of the aquaculture licensing system in ireland carried out in 2000 by birdwatch ireland as the basis for its view that ireland has systematically failed to carry out a proper assessment of those projects situated in spas or likely to have effects on spas, contrary to article 6(3) and (4) of the habitats directive. the following month the applicant company was issued an authorisation to fish for mussel seed in the harbour, with a starting date of 23 august 2008. within one month of the judgment being handed down, bim prepared a paper in january 2008 on the distribution of bi-valve (dredge) fisheries with the potential to lead to disturbance or significant disturbance of habitat, including the fishing of mussels. in early september 2008, the marine institute submitted to the department a finalised study entitled “fisheries in natura 2000”. the same month, the npws warned that in the absence of sufficient funding and staff it could not provide the necessary assurances to the commission. the commission agreed that, on the basis of this interim assessment, fishing could be allowed in the harbour for 2008 only, on condition that ireland submit more detailed assessment procedures with a view to allowing fishing there in future. this was one of multiple assessments which the respondent state had to undertake in light of the cjeu judgment. on 1 september 2011 the applicant company set the action down for trial and certified it ready for hearing. this resulted in an award of 275,000 euros for its losses over the two years in question. it awarded the other local company 125,000 euros. on 21 july 2014 the state certified that the appeal was ready for hearing. ... 10.10  next, reliance is placed on the fact that, as found by the trial judge, the ongoing activities of [the applicant company] were carried out to the knowledge of the minister and on the basis of annual legal measures put in place by the minister which facilitated the so-called opening of the harbour. however ... the fact that there may have been an error in the past cannot create a legitimate expectation that that error will be continued into the future. 10.11  while there undoubtedly was significant expenditure, and while the incurrence of expenditure on foot of a representation may form part of the court’s assessment in determining whether it would be appropriate to allow a public authority to resile from a representation made, expenditure will not be relevant if there was no legitimate expectation in the first place. macmenamin j observed that strong policy considerations arose in the case. it was unclear at what point in time the minister had acted wrongfully in relation to the plaintiffs. it was not just and reasonable to impose liability in the circumstances of the case. macmenamin j also pointed out that the tort as found in the judgment under appeal did not derive from a francovich breach of eu law (c-6/90 and c‑9/90, eu:c:1991:428) but rather from the damage allegedly caused by the implementation of eu law after a breach thereof was identified by the cjeu. he then referred to the primary legislation governing fishing, the main objective of which was the conservation and rational management of the national fish reserves. yet it was hard to argue that castlemaine harbour was more deserving than the other locations. the concept of operational negligence had not yet been accepted as part of domestic law. it did not touch upon the allocation of resources or the making of statutory decisions. what over-arching public duty would have been in any way impaired by the collection of such data? finally, he did not agree with the majority that the applicant company’s business would have been interrupted in any event if the habitats directive had been correctly implemented at an earlier point in time.
the list of applicants is set out in the appended tables. the applicants were employees of a municipal education institution. on 13 june 2001 they brought proceedings before the kolomna town court of the moscow region (“the town court”) against their employer and the town administration seeking recovery of unpaid wages and taxes to various social funds. on 13 july 2004 the kolomna town court issued a first-instance judgment on the merits of the case. on 22 september 2004 the moscow regional court quashed the judgment on appeal and remitted the case for a fresh examination. on 7 july 2005 the town court granted the applicants’ claims awarding each of them a certain amount against their employer (see appendix i). the judgment was upheld on appeal by the moscow regional court on 28 september 2005. between 26 june 2001 and 7 july 2005 the court hearings were adjourned twenty-five times due to the respondents’ or one of the respondents’ failure to appear, eighteen times on the claimants’ request and eleven times pursuant the requests by the defendants; four times the first‑instance court adjourned the case as the respondent authorities had been requested to submit additional documents. moreover, on 11 june 2002 the proceedings were suspended pursuant to a decision by the domestic court on account of the claimants’ alleged failure to appear; on 4 february 2003 that decision was quashed by the appeal court, due to the first-instance court’s failure to notify the applicants of the hearing date. thus, the period attributable to the authorities amounts to over one year. on an unspecified date in 2005 the employer institution was liquidated. on 18 october 2005 the relevant record was made into the state register of legal entities. according to the government’s submissions of 19 july 2011, on 30 june 2006 the judgment of 7 july 2005 was partially enforced in respect of certain applicants, as specified in appendix i.
the first applicant was born in 1915 and lived in vilnius. the ministry of environment, which was a third party in the proceedings, asked the court to allow the prosecutor’s claim. ’s property rights to 0.187 hectares of land, as well as the applicants’ rights to that part of the plot. the prosecutor lodged an appeal against that decision and submitted that when determining the area covered by forest, the court should have relied on the data provided by the state forest management service and not the real estate register. the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law. had been confirmed by the data in the register of forests. on 6 april 2010 the court of appeal dismissed the appeals submitted by the applicants and the vca and upheld the decision of the first-instance court in its entirety. on 9 july 2010 the supreme court refused to accept it for examination on the grounds that it raised no important legal issues. copies of the vca’s and the applicants’ letters have not been submitted to the court. ’s property rights to 1.98 hectares of land, he had retained the right to have those property rights restored. on 14 december 2012 the nls approved the list of candidates to receive plots of land in several areas around vilnius. on 31 december 2012 the nls held a meeting in which candidates were offered plots in the relevant areas. on 21 august 2014 the nls adopted a land plan of the aforementioned areas around vilnius, as well as the list of individuals who would be allocated plots in those areas. the applicants were included in the list and were entitled to receive four plots of land, measuring a total of 0.4035 hectares. on 7 october 2015 the first applicant died. joint ownership of 0.52 hectares of agricultural land and 2.12 hectares of forest in vaidotai. the prosecutor submitted that the forest was situated in a city (see paragraph 10 above) and was thus considered a forest of national importance which could only be owned by the state (see paragraphs 86, 88 and 89 below). the applicant disputed the prosecutor’s claim. it argued that at the time when the vca had adopted the decision to give the forest to the applicant and g.d., on 13 december 2010 the nls informed the applicant that, in accordance with the law, her property rights could be restored by assigning her a plot of land equal in value to the land held previously or by providing securities, but that there was no possibility of her receiving a plot of land for the construction of an individual home in a city. on 23 july 2012 the nls sent a letter to the applicant confirming that, after the courts had annulled her property rights to one hectare of land (see paragraph 41 above), she had retained the right to have those property rights restored. it is unclear whether the applicant replied to that letter or submitted any requests concerning the form of restoration of her property rights. on 15 december 2008 the prosecutor lodged a claim with the vilnius regional court, seeking to have the applicant’s property rights to 0.15 of the 2.67 hectares given to her annulled (see paragraph 62 above). she submitted that there had not been any forest on the land before its nationalisation, and if a forest had grown there afterwards, that should not preclude the restoration of her property rights. in the relevant part also had to be annulled. the court of appeal further observed that even though the unlawful restoration of property rights had been the result of a decision adopted by the vca, under the law it was not possible to order the vca, and not the applicant, to return the money paid for the plot in question to j.s. ( if she could not be given such a plot, she wished to receive compensation of ltl 49,500. the applicant was included in that list as a candidate to receive 0.15 hectares of land. on 27 april 2016 the nls sent a letter to the applicant inviting her to attend a meeting of candidates on 18 may 2016 in which she would be offered a plot. it is unclear whether the applicant took part in that meeting.
the first applicant is a russian national who was born in 1951 and lives in volzhskiy, in the volgograd region. in march 1994 she was granted russian citizenship and the russian embassy in bishkek put a stamp in her soviet passport to this effect. on 14 july 2001 she obtained a new russian “internal passport” (a citizen’s identity document for use inside russia). on 11 april 2006 an official from the fms seized her russian passport, which was later destroyed. the fms referred to a report of 26 january 2006 on a check carried out by the agencies of the interior, according to which the first applicant had never properly acquired russian citizenship and therefore had no right to be in possession of a russian passport. furthermore, according to a letter of 18 october 2015 from the russian embassy in kyrgyzstan, it had no records on her obtaining russian citizenship either. accordingly, she had been issued with a russian passport erroneously in 2001. on 20 march 2007 the fms issued report no. the decision was subsequently quashed by means of supervisory review and the case was remitted for fresh examination. however, the fms did not set aside the decision to seize the first applicant’s passport, and a new passport was not issued to her either. the first applicant again instituted court proceedings, this time for a finding that the seizure of her passport had been unlawful. according to the second applicant, between 1987 and 2010 he lived in the rostov region. initially, he had a soviet union passport issued on 21 december 1981 by the chkhorozkuskiy department of the interior of the republic of georgia. 1 of taganrog, in the rostov region, issued the second applicant with a russian passport. on 29 january 2010 ... a request was sent to [the fms of the rostov region] to confirm that [the second applicant] had russian citizenship. it appears to be impossible to question [v.] concerning the circumstances of the issue of the russian passport [to the second applicant], since she is absent from her place of residence. accordingly, [v.] ... issued [the second applicant] with a russian passport in the absence of documents confirming that he was a russian citizen, and without checking the documents presented for the issue (exchange) of the passport, in breach [of the rules] then in force. the above circumstances allow the supposition that [v.] might have had an interest in issuing [the second applicant] with a russian passport in breach of the established rules, which constitutes an offence punishable under article 286 of the criminal code. furthermore, it may be conjectured that [the second applicant] presented a passport [issued in 1981] which contained wrong information to the effect that he had russian citizenship. the second applicant received a verbal refusal to issue him with a new passport. on 13 august 2010 the residential registration department of the leninskiy district of rostov-on-don provided the second applicant with a certificate confirming that he was not registered in the leninskiy district and there was no information about him in the archives either. the second applicant] was invited to familiarise himself with that decision. [ in 2004 the fms issued instructions for checks to be carried out only in respect of individuals who had applied to exchange their passports. [ in particular, it had not been confirmed that he had been living in russia on 6 february 1992. the court further dismissed the second applicant’s argument that the fact that he had been using the previously issued russian passport for eight years constituted a valid reason to exchange the passport. the court likewise dismissed his argument that he had not violated any laws or regulations in 2002, when he had been issued with the russian passport. the court found that his passport was invalid regardless. on 6 december 2010 the kostroma regional court upheld the decision. the appeal court noted, in particular, that the certificate issued by the rostov region fms on 30 june 2010 showed that a russian passport had been issued to the second applicant on the basis of a certificate of 23 december 1998 issued by the department of the interior of the leninskiy district of rostov-on-don confirming that he was a russian citizen in accordance with section 13(1) of the 1991 law on citizenship of the russian federation. on 25 march 2013, following the entry into force of law no.
in 2005 the applicant, an information technology specialist, moved from kazakhstan to the krasnodar region in russia to live with his parents and brother, o.z., he resided there on the basis of visas and temporary residence permits. in january 2007, the applicant married ms m.k., a russian national, with whom he had a son in june 2009. on 23 december 2008 the kazakh authorities provided the applicant, upon his request, with an official statement certifying that he had no criminal record in kazakhstan. the applicant had requested the document with view to applying for russian nationality through the simplified procedure for spouses of russian nationals. in may 2009 the krasnodar fms rejected the application, referring to information provided by the federal security service (федеральная служба безопасности (фсб)) (hereinafter “the fsb”) that the applicant posed a threat to russia’s national security. on 13 august 2009 the fsb informed the applicant about a decision it had made on the undesirability of his presence (residence) in russia and on prohibiting him from re-entering the country until july 2014 (hereinafter “the exclusion order”). he was not provided with the reasons for the decision, its date or number. in particular, the applicant stated that he was ethnically russian, had no connection with kazakhstan and that his wife and child, as well as his brother and parents, were russian nationals residing in russia. on 24 march 2010 the regional court examined the applicant’s appeal in camera. in 2006, the kazakh authorities had pardoned the applicant and his criminal record had been expunged. he pointed out that he was an ethnic russian, that he did not speak kazakh, had no family in that country, and that he had neither a place to live in kazakhstan nor the financial means to move there with his wife and infant son. referring to the case of liu v. russia (no. from the documents submitted to the court, it is unclear whether the fsb presented the regional court with any evidence concerning the applicant’s case, other than its letter to the applicant of 13 august 2009 (see paragraph 10 above) and copies of the relevant legal provisions governing the activities of the fsb and the applicable immigration regulations. he has never committed any crime, either in russia or kazakhstan. his character has been described in positive terms. he does not have a place to live in kazakhstan. he is ethnically russian and wants to work and live in russia. there is no evidence of any alleged criminal activities ...
... the fsb decided on the undesirability of mr zezev’s presence (residence) in russia and on prohibiting his re-entry into the country until july 2014. the application of such preventive measures is within the federal security service’s scope of discretion. he pointed out that the fsb had not furnished any evidence to the court of alleged activities by him that posed a threat to national security. the applicant further stated that even though he was a kazakh national he was an ethnic russian, did not speak kazakh, and had nowhere to live in kazakhstan as his parents had also moved to russia in 2005. it appears from the case file that the sanction was not enforced as, according to the applicant, he informed the local authorities that he had an application pending before the court. in may 2011 the applicant and his wife had another child. then the police detained him on the spot and took him to the court. on 26 december 2013 the applicant was deported from russia. on an unspecified date in february 2014 the applicant attempted to re-enter russia but was informed at the border that he was banned from entering until 31 july 2014. according to the government, the applicant neither applied for a temporary residence permit nor sought russian nationality between 2014 and 2016. as of october 2016 the criminal proceedings against the applicant were still pending.
the applicant was born in 1971 and lives in prague. in 2004 the applicant arrived in russia, where in 2005 she married mr i.p., a russian citizen, with whom in 2009 she had a daughter, also a russian national. the applicant and her family lived in st petersburg. the applicant lived in russia on the basis of regularly extended residence permits. on 15 october 2013 the applicant applied for russian citizenship. on 21 july 2014 the fms revoked the applicant’s residence permit, referring to the fsb’s recommendation. the decision stated, in particular, that in view of information received from the fsb, the applicant’s residence permit must be revoked under section 9(1)(1) of the federal law on the legal status of foreigners in the russian federation (hereinafter “the foreigners act”), which provided that a resident permit issued to a foreign national should be revoked if he or she advocated a radical change in the constitutional order of the russian federation or otherwise posed a threat to the security of the russian federation or its citizens. on 5 august 2014 the applicant was informed by fms that this revocation decision had been taken. 114-fz of 15 august 1996, as amended on 1 april 2014, “the entry procedure act”). on 23 august 2014 the applicant and her daughter left russia. on 6 august 2014 the applicant complained before the frunzenskiy district court of st petersburg (hereinafter “the district court”), alleging that the decision to annul her residence permit had been groundless. it had violated her right to respect for her family life, as it had compelled her to leave russia where her husband and minor child were living. the applicant urged the district court to stay the enforcement of the decision until her complaint had been examined. on 8 august 2014 the district court refused to stay the enforcement of the decision. on 14 august 2014 the applicant’s counsel asked the district court to request a copy of the fsb report of 18 march 2014 (see paragraph 9 above) on which the decision to revoke the residence permit had been based. as to whether the measure amounted to an interference with the applicant’s family life, the court noted that it was open to the applicant to obtain a visa so that she could come to russia to visit her family. lastly, he argued that the district court had failed to properly examine the interference with the applicant’s family life and to balance the interests at stake. on 12 november 2014 the city court upheld the decision of 19 august 2014, stating that the district court had duly examined the necessary legal basis for the measure and that its decision had been lawful and reasonable. he asked the courts to get hold of a full copy of the fsb report and other relevant documents in order to examine them at a hearing. on 10 november 2014 the complaint was forwarded to the city court, as the domestic regulations stipulated that the courts at regional level were to examine cases involving state secrets. on 18 december 2014 the city court examined the complaint in camera. it held that the fsb report and the recommendation had been issued in accordance with the statutory procedure and that they had therefore been lawful. in its decision, the court stated, in particular:
“... the allegations of the applicant’s representatives concerning the failure of the representatives of the federal security service to submit proof showing the necessity to send the impugned letter [recommending that the residence permit be revoked] to the federal migration service are unsubstantiated, as the federal security service’s information note on ms gaspar as presented to the court does not contain any such information.” he alleged, in particular, that the city court had rejected the complaint without having properly examined its subject matter, as a full copy of the fsb report and other documents on which the revocation had been based had not been furnished at the hearing. in a separate request, he asked the supreme court to retrieve a full copy of the report and the relevant documents. prior to the hearing, the applicant’s counsel had signed a confidentiality undertaking not to disclose the information examined in the course of the hearing. the supreme court perused it and found it lawful. it further held that the information contained in the report was a state secret and that it could not be disclosed. the [lower] court concluded correctly that the guarantees provided to the applicant by the russian legislation and international laws had been respected in full.

the applicant was born in 1971 and is serving a prison sentence in vilnius. was allocated social housing; she had no property of her own. the psychiatrists recommended that the children not be questioned further [during those criminal proceedings] in order to avoid the applicant exerting an influence on the children’s testimony, bearing in mind the fact that – while visiting the children in the children’s home – he had already asked them not to recount his actions. had exerted any influence on the children’s testimony. having noted that the applicant had three prior convictions, the records of which had not yet expired, the court found him guilty and sentenced him to deprivation of liberty for ten months. was informed that she had an obligation to bring her sons for questioning and that she had a right to be present during that questioning. those people agreed that the boys would be questioned and that a video and audio recording would be made. the boys described the details of how the applicant had sexually abused them in 2009. on 20 march 2012 the applicant lodged a written request for the prosecutor to stage a confrontation between him and the two children. the applicant emphasised that the case-file material in respect of the previous criminal case also contained the records of the questioning of his children, and that from that material it was plain that v.k. once the criminal file was transferred to the kaunas regional court, the applicant – during a hearing of 17 september 2012 – complained that the prosecutor had ignored his numerous requests, including a request for him to ensure that v.k. she could not be reached by telephone either. who had seen his family in 2009, be summoned and examined. however, the trial court acquitted the applicant of crimes listed under articles 153 and 309 § 4 of the criminal code because the applicant had denied committing those crimes and it was impossible to establish from the children’s testimony which pornographic films the applicant had shown to the children and when he had shown them. ’s place of work and the conclusions reached by the children’s rights ombudsman (see paragraph 29 above). the prosecutor noted that since the applicant had provided documents regarding v.k. however, the court of appeal refused each and every one of them. had to be examined (see paragraph 43 above), but had later backtracked on that issue. having discussed the issue, the court of appeal decided that the proceedings could continue without v.k. for questioning, she could not be located. had been influenced by their mother, v.k., on 15 january and on 26 february 2014, the applicant lodged two appeals on points of law, which he drafted himself. had never been examined in the courtroom. started civil court proceedings, asking that the applicant be required to pay child support in respect of her two children, ro.k. testified that the applicant had taken care of both children. would not visit her children in the children’s home – she “was not interested in their lives (nesidomi jų gyvenimu)” and was hiding her place of residence. the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention in kaunas. on 6 april 2012 the prosecutor ordered the pre-trial investigator to look into the matter, and the investigator returned that item to the applicant on 20 april 2012. accordingly, if the applicant had had problems with his vision, he could have asked the authorities to have his eyesight checked, an opportunity of which he had not availed himself. he submitted, inter alia, that the pre-trial detention facility in kaunas had not had an eye doctor on its staff, and that therefore he had had no opportunity to obtain spectacles in detention.
the applicant company was set up in 1998 as a limited liability company. its founders and sole shareholders were ms zhaneta pavlovska and mr rasko pavlovski. it traded in scrap metal and for that purpose it purchased waste aluminium, copper, iron and other metals, processed them and then offered the product for sale. the applicant was registered for the purposes of the value added tax act (the “vat act”) and declared vat on all invoices issued. vat was also declared on all incoming invoices. until the subsequent events, the applicant company had been submitting regular tax returns to the tax authorities, notifying the state of its vat calculations, payments and deductions. on 22 september 2009 the internal revenues office, regional directorate – skopje (управа за јавни приходи, регионална дирекција скопје – “the iro”) issued an order to audit the applicant company for the purposes of vat. the audit took place over several days during the months of october and november 2009 and took into account the period between 1 january 2005 and 30 june 2009. on 6 november 2009 a tax assessment was compiled by the iro. that finding was based on earlier audits of those companies, which remained without further specification. the audit further established that some of the invoices did not contain the addresses of the suppliers. relying on the tax assessment conducted earlier, on 20 november 2009 the iro issued two decisions in respect of erroneous calculation of vat, ordering the applicant company to pay an additional 3,827,546.00 macedonian denars (mkd, around 62,000 euros (eur)) in vat. an appeal lodged against those decisions had no suspensive effect. the applicant company lodged an appeal with the minister of finance against the decisions of 9 december 2009. on 22 march 2010 the applicant company received a written reprimand from the iro. the reprimand stipulated the full amount, including interest, to be paid by the applicant company. it amounted to mkd 6,059,124 (around eur 100,000). on 23 april 2010 the applicant company lodged an administrative action with the administrative court (управен суд). on 29 april 2010 the iro blocked the applicant company’s bank account pursuant to the payment decisions. on 26 may 2011 the ministry of finance again dismissed the appeal of the applicant company, reiterating the findings from the audit. on 22 july 2011 the applicant company lodged another administrative action. on 1 march 2013 the administrative court dismissed the action. the relevant part of the judgment reads:
“... the cumulative conditions to obtain a deduction ... were not met. specifically, the income of the applicant company was created by companies which failed to meet their legal obligations in relation to the payment of vat ...
in the deliberations the court took into account the claims by the appellant that it was wrongfully deprived of the right to claim vat deductions because the errors found in the tax assessment had pertained to other [companies] ... these claims were rejected by the court ... inter alia taking into account that it is in the interests of every taxpayer to know and be aware of those with whom they engage in business.” on 2 february 2017 the applicant company was removed from the register of companies and ceased to exist. the applicant company’s bank account remained blocked by the iro until 10 april 2017, when it was closed. on 9 december 2011 the prosecution for organised crime (основно јавно обвинителство за гонење на организиран криминал и корупција) filed an indictment against several individuals for criminal enterprise, abuse of office and tax evasion. the indictment encompassed the individuals responsible for several, but not all, of the applicant company’s suppliers. the supplier companies as legal entities were not directly indicted. the domestic courts found the accused guilty of the offences by a judgment of 29 march 2013, which became final on 9 january 2014.

“the information [was] wrong, unfounded. [ worked at the bank and worked in accordance with [its] budget. there were no public statements; maybe there were other [people] who [provided more information to the press].” nra had published a series of articles about the money spent on the pre-election advertising of the latvia’s first party, linking the source of these funds to krājbanka and its former president, a.l. by name, surname or his position when giving the information to the journalists. it was the nra journalists who had linked the applicant’s report with the allegations of wrongdoing by a.l. having examined the testimony of [the nra journalists], the appellate court found that the false information provided by the applicant had related not to krājbanka’s management, as the applicant indicated, but specifically to a.l., the latter, however, still remained obliged to publish the retracted information.

the applicant was born in 1982 and lives in bern, switzerland. at the time of the events giving rise to the present application, he was the editor‑in-chief of ülkede özgür gündem, a daily newspaper published in turkey. on 6 july 2004 an article written by mr b.g. entitled “analysing the kurdish dynamic correctly” was published in ülkede özgür gündem. stated his views on the role of abdullah öcalan, the leader of the pkk (an illegal armed organisation), a number of organisations associated with the pkk in regional and international politics and political developments in turkey. next to the article a photograph of abdullah öcalan shaking hands with a group of armed men was published. on 8 july 2004 the public prosecutor at the istanbul assize court filed a bill of indictment, charging the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of the kongra-gel[1] under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. 3713) on account of the article published on 6 july 2004. in the indictment, the public prosecutor quoted the following passage from the article:
“... abdullah öcalan, who has contributed to the essential dynamic of the kurdish movement and the hpg[2], the pja[3] and the kongra-gel, organisations which have acted as military, political and ideological leaders and which have represented his leadership,... [must be well understood]”. the public prosecutor stated that a photograph of abdullah öcalan in which he was standing in a rural area holding a weapon had been published in the newspaper, next to the article. the public prosecutor considered as a result that the applicant had disseminated propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation inciting others to violence or other methods of terrorism. subsequently, criminal proceedings were launched against the applicant before the istanbul assize court. during the proceedings the applicant maintained that the article in question had been a news article and had not contained propaganda inciting to violence. on 24 may 2005 the istanbul assize court convicted the applicant of disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk/kongra-gel under section 7(2) of law no. 3713 and sentenced him to six months’ imprisonment and a fine. in its judgment, the istanbul assize court held that the content of the article and the publication of abdullah öcalan’s photograph amounted to dissemination of propaganda in favour of the pkk/kongra-gel. in his appeal petition, referring to a number of the court’s judgments, the applicant claimed that he had not had the intention of disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation and that his criminal conviction had been in breach of articles 6 and 10 of the convention as he had been exercising his right to impart information. he also noted that the first-instance court had failed to examine the article in its entirety. on 16 may 2006 the principal public prosecutor at the court of cassation returned the case file to the first-instance court and requested that the latter revise its judgment in the light of the recent legislative amendments. on 28 september 2006 the istanbul assize court once again convicted the applicant under section 7(2) of law no. 3713, with the same reasoning that it had adopted on 24 may 2005. the court sentenced the applicant to a fine of 1,802 turkish liras (try). on 18 november 2009 the court of cassation upheld the judgment of 28 september 2006. according to a document dated 15 january 2010, signed by the president of the istanbul assize court and the istanbul public prosecutor, the applicant was required to pay the fine of try 1,802.
the applicants were born in 1987 and 1985, respectively, and live in the hozat district of tunceli. on 5 april 2007 the applicants attended a concert performed by a band called “grup yorum” in hozat. during the concert they chanted certain slogans, such as “revolutionary prisoners are immortal” (“devrimci tutsaklar ölümsüzdür”), “revolutionary prisoners are our honour” (“devrimci tutsaklar onurumuzdur”). on 17 october 2007 the malatya public prosecutor filed an indictment with the malatya assize court charging the applicants with disseminating propaganda in favour of the “dhkp/c” (revolutionary people’s liberation party/front), an illegal armed organisation, under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. the public prosecutor noted that the first applicant had chanted the slogan “revolutionary prisoners are our honour” (“devrimci tutsaklar onurumuzdur”) during the concert. as regards the second applicant, the public prosecutor alleged that he had chanted the following slogans during the same concert: “mahir, hüseyin, ulaş; fight until emancipation”[1] (“mahir, hüseyin, ulaş; kurtuluşa kadar savaş”); “martyrs of the revolution are immortal” (“devrim şehitleri ölümsüzdür”); “revolutionary prisoners are our honour”, “victory on mountains, emancipation at the front; long live victory, long live resistance” (“dağlarda zafer, cephede kurtuluş; yaşasın zafer, yaşasın direniş”). during the criminal proceedings against them, the applicants stated that they had attended the concert of 5 april 2007 and had sung along with the musicians but had not chanted the slogans noted in the indictment. on 6 march 2008 the malatya assize court convicted the applicants as charged and sentenced them to ten months’ imprisonment each. in its judgment, the assize court considered it established, on the basis of a police video recording of the concert of 5 april 2007, a report on the video recording, the indictment, the applicants’ defence submissions and the public prosecutor’s observations on the merits of the case, that the applicants had chanted the slogans noted in the indictment. the court considered that the concert in question had become a propaganda activity in favour of the dhkp/c and that the applicants had chanted slogans that were used by that organisation. the malatya assize court concluded that the applicants had committed the offence of dissemination of propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation. on 4 july 2011 the court of cassation upheld the first-instance court’s judgment. on 13 and 14 september 2011 the applicants were informed that they had to start serving their prison sentences within ten days. according to the applicants’ submissions, which were not contested by the government, upon receipt of the summons to serve the prison sentences, both applicants duly served them.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in ankara. at the relevant time he was a professor of translation in the faculty of science and literature of the university of mersin (“the faculty”). on an unspecified date the applicant was invited to istanbul to take part in a television programme that was due to be broadcast live on a public channel on saturday 31 march 2001. the programme consisted of a debate on the topic of “the cultural structure of the european union and the traditional structure of turkey – comparing identities and modes of behaviour – likely problems and suggested solutions”. on 27 march 2001 the applicant informed the director of the translation course that he had been invited to take part in the above-mentioned programme. in his letter he also expressed doubts as to whether there was a link between the applicant’s specialist field and the subject of the programme and whether the applicant’s invitation to take part in a personal capacity was in keeping with the university’s principles. on 30 march 2001 the dean of the faculty informed the director of the translation course that it had been decided that the applicant’s participation in the programme in question was not appropriate. the applicant was informed of the dean’s decision the same day. on 31 march 2001 the applicant nevertheless took part in the programme in istanbul. in letters dated 2 and 5 april 2001 to the dean of the faculty, the applicant asked why his participation in the broadcast of 31 march 2001 had not been considered appropriate in spite of his past work on the subject covered by the programme. he added that it would have harmed his professional standing and reputation for reliability if he had withdrawn from the programme at short notice when he had already agreed to take part. he also maintained that he had been entitled to take part in the event, citing his academic freedom in that regard. in a letter to the applicant dated 9 april 2001 the dean of the faculty replied that the applicant had not been entitled to take part in the event without the authorities’ permission. he added that the director of the translation course had expressed misgivings as to whether the applicant was sufficiently familiar with the topic of the programme of 31 march 2001, and that the view of the course director had been taken into account in the decision to refuse authorisation. on 26 june 2001 the commission of inquiry published its report. as to the applicant’s participation in the broadcast of 14 april 2001, the commission noted that the dean of the faculty had authorised the applicant to attend an academic gathering to be held from 11 to 13 april 2001 in istanbul, and that this authorisation had not covered 14 april 2001. the commission considered in that regard that not even research professors should take part in programmes of this type without supervision or authorisation, and that universities had to uphold academic ethics. it went on to find that the applicant’s participation in two television programmes in istanbul on 31 march and 14 april 2001, without authorisation from his university, amounted to leaving his city of residence without authorisation, an offence punishable under regulation 8(g) of the disciplinary regulations for managers, lecturers and officials in higher education institutions (“the disciplinary regulations”). it therefore proposed, by way of a penalty, that the applicant’s salary be reduced by one-eighth, under regulation 4(d) of the above-mentioned regulations. on 20 july 2001 the applicant applied to the university vice‑chancellor for reconsideration of that decision and requested that the sanction be lifted. on 8 august 2001 the vice-chancellor decided to lift the sanction of a reduction in salary and to impose a less severe penalty on the applicant, in the form of a reprimand under regulation 16 of the disciplinary regulations. on 25 october 2001 the applicant applied for judicial review of that decision. he also argued that regulation 8(g) of the disciplinary regulations was liable to be wrongfully applied by managers and that the perimeter of a city no longer had the same significance in view of modern means of transport and communication. lastly, he argued that the programme of 14 april 2001 had been a follow-up to the conference of 11 to 13 april 2001, which he had been authorised to attend, and that the people invited to appear on the programme had been participants in the conference. the court noted in that regard that it was beyond dispute that, on 31 march 2001, the applicant had left his city of residence despite the refusal of his request to take part in the television programme in question. the court considered that the applicant’s remaining arguments gave no reason to suppose that the decision to impose a sanction had been defective. on 8 august 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. he complained, in particular, that the administrative court’s examination of his claims had been inadequate. on 31 october 2005 the supreme administrative court dismissed the appeal and upheld the administrative court’s judgment. it found that the reasoning of the decision had been in conformity with the procedure and the law and that there were no grounds for quashing the decision.
the applicants were born in 1974, 1978 and 1980 respectively. the applicants all went to cyprus for employment purposes. the first applicant arrived in cyprus on 20 april 2001 in order to take up employment as a domestic worker. the residence permit stated that it could be revoked at any time with fourteen days’ prior notice to the holder. the first time, he stayed in his home country for about eleven months, and the second time, he stayed for just over a month. she was granted a temporary residence permit until 16 september 2008. she also needed time to obtain travel documents for their daughter. the second applicant arrived in cyprus on 5 february 2010 and was granted a temporary residence permit until 4 may 2010. the third applicant submitted that he had applied for a renewal of his permit. they got out of the car and saw people holding swords and iron rods. fearing for their lives, they abandoned the car and ran in different directions. the second applicant was injured during the clashes: his index finger was cut off and his middle finger injured. according to the first applicant, on the morning of 7 january 2011 six people who had taken part in the clash attacked his residence and threatened to kill him if he went to the police. however, half an hour later, when he went to the police station to report the incident, he was arrested and detained on suspicion of being involved in the clashes. according to the third applicant, he was also passing by that area with his car and stopped to see what was going on, but, fearing for his life, he ran away and left his car behind. he informed his employer and the latter informed the police about the clash. on 7 january 2011 the third applicant went to lakatamia police station and was arrested and detained on suspicion of being involved in the clashes. the police carried out an investigation into the events. they examined and collected evidence found in the area (including the first and third applicants’ cars). on 8 january 2011 the nicosia district court convened at nicosia general hospital. the nicosia crime investigation department informed the attorney general that that there was sufficient evidence against all the nine individuals arrested, including the applicants, in relation to the offence of taking part in a fight in a public place contrary to section 89 of the criminal code, but not as regards the remaining offences, which were more serious. the third applicant had also committed the offence of staying in cyprus unlawfully, as his temporary resident permit had expired on 12 february 2009. at the suggestion of the police, the attorney general decided not to prosecute the applicants, but to deport them instead. 105), on the grounds that their conduct had posed a danger to the public order of the republic. consequently, their temporary resident permits had been revoked and deportation and detention orders had been issued against them. the government submitted that the applicants’ case had then been reviewed by the minister of the interior, who had noted their lawyer’s objection, read the administrative file and maintained the decision to deport the applicants. the first and third applicants were deported on 19 january 2011 and the second applicant was deported on 21 january 2011. on 3 december 2012 she lodged an asylum application, which was dismissed on 31 january 2013. she returned to cyprus that same month with a new passport with different identity details, and was granted a residence and employment permit until 15 november 2016. no further details have been given by the government in this respect.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in kilis. on 17 october 1999 the applicant sat an examination in order to become a civil servant. she was successful in the examination and on an unspecified date she was informed by the state personnel department attached to the prime minister’s office that she had been appointed to the post of security officer in the kilis branch of tedaş (türkiye elektrik dağıtım a.ş. – on an unspecified date tedaş informed the applicant that she would not be appointed to the post in question as she did not fulfil the requirements of “being a man” and “having completed military service”. on 4 september 2000 the applicant lodged an action against tedaş with the gaziantep administrative court requesting the annulment of the decision of the kilis branch of tedaş not to appoint her to the post in question and a stay of execution of this decision. on 9 may 2001 the gaziantep administrative court ordered the stay of execution of tedaş’s decision not to appoint the applicant as a security officer. the court considered that “being a male” was not a requirement for the post. on 23 july 2001 the applicant was offered a contract by the kilis branch of tedaş subject to a probationary period of six months. on an unspecified date the applicant took up her duties. on 4 october 2001 the gaziantep administrative court annulled the decision of the kilis branch of tedaş. the court held that the requirement of “having completed military service” should be considered to apply only to male candidates and that there had been no restriction on women working as security officers in tedaş. it further noted in that connection that since there had not been a specific requirement to recruit only male candidates for the said post, the fact that the applicant had been rejected solely on account of her sex had been unlawful. on 12 april 2002 the twelfth division of the supreme administrative court granted the stay of execution of the judgment of 4 october 2001. on 11 june 2002 tedaş informed the applicant that her contract of employment had been terminated on 27 may 2002 by virtue of the supreme administrative court decision of 12 april 2002. on 26 december 2002 the twelfth division of the supreme administrative court quashed the judgment of 4 october 2001. the supreme administrative court therefore found that the decision not to appoint the applicant to the post had been in accordance with the law. on 23 october 2003 the gaziantep administrative court dismissed the applicant’s case by following the reasoning of the supreme administrative court. the applicant appealed against the decision of 23 october 2003 and argued that the supreme administrative court’s interpretation, namely that the post in question must have been reserved only for male candidates given that there was a requirement to complete military service, ran counter to the principle of equality and the state’s positive obligation to ensure non‑discrimination between men and women. in support of her arguments, the applicant maintained that this obligation was set out not only in article 10 of the constitution but also in article 2 § d of the united nations convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women as well as article 3 of the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights. she further argued that it was of no importance to dwell on whether the post in question had been reserved for male candidates only, since such a reservation itself would be contrary to the prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex in access to employment as set out in the relevant international instruments and european union regulations. on 16 november 2017 the twelfth division of the supreme administrative court unanimously upheld the decision of 23 october 2003, without replying to the arguments of the applicant. on 6 december 2007 the supreme administrative court’s general assembly of administrative proceedings divisions (danıştay i̇dari dava daireleri genel kurulu), the composition of which included some members of the twelfth division, delivered a decision in favour of r.b., the general assembly held that the requirement of “having completed military service” should be considered to apply only to male candidates. it found, however, that it was unlawful to refuse to appoint r.b. on an unspecified date, the applicant applied for rectification of the decision of 16 november 2007, and maintained the arguments she had submitted during appeal (see paragraph 17 above). she therefore requested the supreme administrative court to rectify its decision of 16 november 2007. in the rectification proceedings the judge rapporteur of the twelfth division submitted his written opinion on the merits of the case and argued, inter alia, that the decision of 16 november 2007 should be rectified in the light of the decision of the supreme administrative court’s general assembly of administrative proceedings divisions of 6 december 2007 in the case of r.b. he also noted in that connection that turkey had ratified the united nations convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and that pursuant to its article 11, the state was bound to take all appropriate measures to ensure, inter alia, the right to the same employment opportunities on a basis of equality of men and women, including the application of the same criteria for selection in matters of employment. 2577) and that its previous decision was in accordance with law and procedure. therefore the gaziantep administrative court’s decision of 23 october 2003 became final.
the applicants are serving either life sentences or a lengthy period of imprisonment in different prisons in bulgaria. the applicant was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment in november 2011. as it transpires from documents in the file, pursuant to an order of the prison governor referring to section 248(1)(1) of the 2009 execution of punishments and pre-trial detention act (see paragraph 18 below), on 29 july 2011 the applicant was placed in isolation in burgas prison, in a permanently locked cell without the possibility to take part in collective activities. the applicant described, and the government did not comment on, the conditions under which he had been detained there as follows. he was kept in isolation since 29 july 2011, without running water and toilet in his cell. the heating was insufficient in winter and the temperature was excessively high in the cell in summer. there was poor ventilation and poor natural light in his cell. also, the light in his cell was kept on during the entire night, the cell was infested with rats and cockroaches, and the latter sometimes also reached his food. on an unspecified date before july 2016 the applicant was transferred to varna prison and he has not complained about the conditions there. the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment in a final decision by the supreme court of cassation of 10 november 2005. there has been no running water or toilet in his cell which measured about 6 square metres. he has had to use a bucket to comply with the needs of nature in his cell; he has also been taking his food in the cell. the ventilation was poor, which aggravated the repugnant smell coming out of the sewers situated close to his cell. in the summer the temperatures were very high and in the winter the heating was switched off at around 6 p.m. as a result of which it became very cold in his cell. in addition, between 2007 and 2011 he had been kept under the very impoverished and restrictive “special regime”, alone in a cell. according to the applicant, while his regime was formally changed from “special” to the lighter “strict” one on 6 june 2011, in reality the restrictions and inadequate conditions in which he has been detained did not change. he has been handcuffed systematically upon leaving his cell. the applicant was sentenced to whole-life imprisonment on 26 july 2004 in a final judgment of the supreme court of cassation. the period of detention of this applicant before that date was subject to examination in an earlier court’s judgment in which it found a violation of article 3 on account of the excessively strict prison regime and poor conditions of detention (see iordan petrov v. bulgaria, no. the applicant submitted that he has been serving his sentence in isolation from the surrounding world, namely in a permanently locked cell. he has not been involved in any collective activities or provided with work and has been denied contact with prisoners who are serving sentences lighter than life imprisonment. every time he was taken out of the high security zone, he has been hand-cuffed. thus, their assessments did not involve an analysis of his psychological and physical state, or of his attitude and demonstrated willingness to change, and were not conducted by specially-trained personnel. as the toilet has not been separated from the rest of the space, he has had the intrusive feeling of living in a toilet. the overall hygiene in the cell and the common spaces has been extremely poor, with cockroaches and rats roaming about. on 10 june 2011 the first instance court sentenced the applicant to a whole-life sentence, which was confirmed by the appellate court on 27 june 2013. there has been no running water or toilet in his cell which measures less than 6 square metres. the hygiene in the cell has been very poor and there have been cockroaches and bed bugs, and the prison administration has done nothing to get rid of them. as there is no table in his cell the applicant has been eating over a newspaper spread over his bed. the temperature in the cell was inadequate, fluctuating between extremes in the summer and winter.
the applicant was born in 1987 and lives in argenteuil. who was 60, set off in the latter’s vehicle after consuming alcoholic beverages. after telling him three times to calm down, unsuccessfully, officer b.g. immobilised him by bending him over, with his head touching his knees. at 9.15 p.m., half an hour after the arrival at the police station, the officer in charge asked a team of four officers to take both men to hospital. he moved into or was placed in a safe lateral position until the nurses arrived. he was taken to intensive care, where he never regained consciousness. he observed that the neurological prognosis was negative owing to a lack of signs of awakening and the duration of the coma, noted the same bruising and skin abrasion as those indicated on the medical certificate, and recorded the hypothesis of the intensive care unit staff that mr ziri had succumbed to “hypoxia linked to choking in the context of vomiting with cardio-respiratory arrest then coma”. on 22 june 2009 a preliminary police investigation was opened against persons unknown on a charge of manslaughter. had stated that both he and mr ziri had been subjected to violence and that this could have been the cause of the latter’s death. on 16 july 2009, at the request of counsel acting for mr ziri’s family, the investigating judge ordered a fresh autopsy. it thus concluded:
“death from probable anoxia in a multi-factor context. toxicological and anatomical pathology analyses are indispensable, together with a study of the medical file and procedure for the purpose of any useful synthesis”. and five individuals who had been at argenteuil police station at the same time as the latter. in addition, the radio messages exchanged between officers b.g., in that opinion the commission began by indicating that it was not in a position to pursue its investigations concerning the allegations that mr ziri and a.k. all the officers questioned by the commission indicated that he had been vociferous and insulting, but the senior police officer who met mr [ziri] to notify him of his rights indicated in a report drafted on 9 june at 8.50 p.m. as follows: ‘in response to our questions, he answered only by gurgles. ... it can be seen from all the testimony gathered during the preliminary police investigation and by the commission that mr [ziri] vomited as soon as he entered the police station. i in fact left immediately afterwards as i had vomit on my shoes ...’. his team took charge of mr [ziri] and mr a.k. who had not followed such training for twelve years. a notice that the judicial investigation had concluded was issued to the parties on 22 june 2011. who, turning round on his seat, grasped him under the armpits and held his head down against his knees. who was in the porch waiting for the patrol to arrive. then ziri, were restrained in that manner, as [v.p.] it can be seen from those particulars that in the light of the state of agitation and rebellion of the individuals arrested, whose conduct, in the confined space of a vehicle, close to the driver, was highly dangerous for the safety of all passengers and other road users, the immobilisation techniques applied for a few minutes by the police officers, whose professional attitude is not in doubt and is attested by the witnesses to the arrest, did not constitute excessive restraint. the video recording of the arrival at the police station shows, once again, that it was only because of his resistance that he was forced out of the vehicle and then carried onto the premises to be laid on the floor. the expert [p.] indicated that a sound initial assessment of his condition had been made and that the aggravation of this condition within less than one hour was exceptional. while the expert expressed surprise that the police, although they were not in charge of his medical supervision, nevertheless failed to sound the alarm when ali ziri’s condition worsened, dr [m.] indicated that in the absence of medical knowledge the police officers might have thought that he was sleeping. in the light of the above and the conclusion that the police made use only of the degree of force strictly necessary, and since an assessment of the evidence shows that the investigation has been comprehensive, the investigation division justified its decision ...”
the applicant company is a bank with its registered office in vienna. according to the information available to the court, the applicant company has been in liquidation since november 2016 and the proceedings have not yet been terminated. the applicant company purchased and kept shares in deposit, predominantly shares in the if company (hereafter – “if”), for third parties. the applicant company and if were related to each other; the management board partly consisted of the same persons and staff employed by the applicant company were provided to if. the a. company, an investment advisor, functioned as an important distribution partner of the applicant company. due to a significant, successive loss in value of the shares purchased in if, starting from the second half of 2007, numerous court proceedings were instituted against the applicant company. following consultations with the a. company, f.m. ordered the applicant company, between 2006 and 2008, to purchase and keep if shares in deposit. filed a civil action against the applicant company and requested the annulment of their share purchase. if joined the proceedings as an intervening party (nebenintervenientin) on the side of the applicant company. on 6 april 2012 the vienna commercial court (handelsgericht wien) granted the action and ordered the applicant company to repay f.m. the amount invested in exchange for the shares acquired by them. by employees of the a. company could not be attributed to the applicant company. filed an ordinary appeal on points of law (ordentliche revision). for that reason, employees of the a. company had been provided with inadequate information material. on 12 august 2013 the applicant company filed an action for nullity (nichtigkeitsklage) under section 529 of the code of civil procedure (see paragraph 25 below). the supreme court had accepted judge n.’s withdrawal from all these cases. he had thus been subjectively and objectively biased, which constituted a reason for challenge under section 19 § 2 of the act on exercise of jurisdiction (jurisdiktionsnorm) (see paragraph 21 below). as judge n. had not withdrawn from the case at hand, there had been a breach of article 6 § 1 of the convention. the applicant company further explained that it had only learned about the composition of the panel – and thus the involvement of judge n. in the proceedings at issue – when the supreme court’s judgment had been served on the applicant company. on 27 november 2013 the supreme court (the second section) decided on the applicant company’s action for nullity. it confirmed that judge n. had purchased shares in if prior to their decrease in value. in 2009 judge n. had offered his shares to a litigation funder (prozessfinanzierer) in order to introduce possible actions against if or other persons and entities involved. for this reason judge n., even though he had not considered himself personally biased, had withdrawn from at least two cases concerning if shares (see the supreme court’s decisions of 14 may 2010, 9 nc 13/10a, and of 26 november 2012, 9 nc 38/12f). however, after the litigation funder had terminated the contract with judge n., the latter had decided not to pursue any claims against if and had, furthermore, no longer considered it necessary to withdraw from cases dealing with these shares. following these explanations, the supreme court rejected the applicant company’s action for nullity, holding that a decision which had become final could only be contested under section 529 of the code of civil procedure on the ground that a judge who had taken part in the decision had been excluded by law from exercising his or her office (see paragraph 25 below). in contrast, bias of a judge (referring to its decision of 13 november 2013, 7 nc 19/13y, see paragraph 20 below) did not constitute a ground for nullity. lastly, the supreme court held that no issues arose under article 6 of the convention. the fact that judge n. had in the past withdrawn from two comparable cases due to the acquisition of shares in the same company gave rise to doubts as to his impartiality, notwithstanding that he no longer intended to file any civil action in this regard. the fact that he had withdrawn of his own motion from previous cases increased fears as to judge n.’s impartiality and rendered such doubts objectively justified, even if he did not consider himself personally biased.
the applicants were born in 1942 and 1969 respectively. the first applicant lives in gabrovo and the second applicant lives in varna. mihalev, father of the first applicant and grandfather of the second applicant, owned a machinery factory in gabrovo, which was nationalised in 1947. after the nationalisation the property was allocated for use to a state-owned enterprise, which in 1991 was transformed into a state-owned company named t.. under domestic law, such a transformation entailed the newly-created company becoming, in principle, the owner of the assets which had until then been allocated to it for use and management; some assets allocated to state-owned enterprises or companies could nevertheless be the subject of restitution (see paragraph 15 below). after the restitution of ownership of nationalised real property act (hereinafter “the restitution act”, see paragraphs 15-16 below) came into force in 1992, the first applicant and his brother asked the mayor of gabrovo to strike the factory building out of the register of state properties. their request was allowed in a decision of the mayor of 28 august 1992, which explicitly referred to the restitution act. on that basis in 1993 the first applicant and his brother obtained a notary deed, which also stated that the property had been subject to restitution under the restitution act. in 1994 the first applicant and his brother concluded a rent contract with company t., which undertook to pay rent in exchange of the use of the building. the term of the contract was extended on several occasions, the last of which in 2002. in 1997 the first applicant’s brother transferred his share in the building to his daughter, the second applicant. after the entry into force of the compensation of owners of nationalised real property act (hereinafter “the compensation act”, see paragraph 17 below), in january 1998 the first applicant and his brother applied to receive compensation for moveable properties such as industrial equipment and materials which had been nationalised together with the factory. in a decision of 21 december 1999 the minister of economy awarded them compensation for these properties, noting in addition that the factory building had been the subject of restitution and no compensation was due for it. that decision was upheld in a final judgment of the supreme administrative court of 17 september 2002, after the first applicant and his brother sought its judicial review, contesting the manner of compensation. eventually, in 2005 they received compensation bonds with a face value of 19,494 bulgarian levs (bgn, the equivalent of 9,970 euros (eur)). company t. was privatised in 2003 and the new management stopped paying rent to the applicants for the factory building, arguing that it had in fact never been subject of restitution. in january 2009 company t. brought proceedings against the applicants, claiming to be the factory building’s owner. it argued that the restitution of the property had not taken place, because the preconditions under the restitution act had not been complied with, and that it had become the owner of the building as a result of its transformation into a company (see paragraph 5 above). in a judgment of 27 october 2009 the gabrovo regional court dismissed the claim. however, on 17 may 2010 the veliko tarnovo court of appeal quashed the lower court’s judgment and allowed the action against the applicants, finding that the preconditions for restitution had indeed not been met. on the basis of expert evidence and witness testimony, it concluded that after the nationalisation the building had been modified in a manner and to a degree which meant that in 1992 it had not existed in its state prior to 1947. accordingly, the applicants could not rely on restitution and company t. had become the owner of the building on the strength of its transformation from a state-owned enterprise into a company in 1991 (see paragraph 5 above). in a final decision of 30 march 2011 the supreme court of cassation refused to accept for examination the applicants’ appeal on points of law. in june 2011 the applicants applied to the gabrovo regional governor to receive compensation for the factory building under the compensation act. in a decision of 19 july 2011 the governor dismissed their request, as it had not been submitted within the time-limit provided for under that act (see paragraph 17 below). after the applicants applied for its judicial review, the governor’s decision was upheld in a final judgment of the supreme administrative court of 14 june 2012.
the applicant was born in 1984 and lives in athens. on 21 september 2013 the applicant was arrested in athens for possession of a fake french passport. he was taken to a public prosecutor, who initiated criminal proceedings against him. on 24 september 2013 the applicant was sentenced to ten months’ imprisonment for use of a false instrument, giving false unsworn testimony, and illegally entering the country (judgment 46181/2013 of the three-member athens court of first instance). 538848/1-α/25.9.2013 of the director of the aliens subdivision of attica (υποδιεύθυνση αλλοδαπών αττικής). according to the applicant, he was informed of those decisions on 30 september 2013. in those objections, he had included a request for international protection. his appeal against the decision ordering his expulsion was dismissed the next day. on 8 october 2013 the applicant filed objections to his detention before the athens administrative court of first instance (διοικητικό πρωτοδικείο αθηνών) (his first set of objections). 8256/07, 26 november 2009), he argued that his detention was unlawful, since his expulsion to syria was not possible, given the ongoing intensive military action taking place there. in her reasoning, she noted that it was not clear whether the applicant had in fact submitted the first objections, that up to that date he had not submitted any proof that he was syrian, and that he could request asylum before the head of zografou police station. he also claimed that he had submitted via his lawyer a request to be informed of the decision by which he had been detained, or to be set free if such a decision did not exist. on 23 october 2013 the applicant filed objections to his detention, asking for judgment no. 5563/2013 to be revoked (his second set of objections). in his application, he referred, inter alia, to the fact that he had proved his syrian nationality by giving his identity card to the police, and that he should be set free, as his expulsion could not be achieved. on 25 october 2013 the applicant’s application was dismissed by the president of the athens administrative court of first instance. he also submitted complementary observations contesting the date of the decision modifying the legal basis of his detention. on 13 november 2013 his application was dismissed (judgment no. she further ruled that the applicant’s objection regarding the date of the document modifying the legal basis of his detention was unsubstantiated. on 12 november 2013 the applicant was granted refugee status (decision no. 538848/1-β that had been issued on 28 september 2013. he had been detained in a basement, which had been damp and inadequately ventilated. the cell had been filthy and overcrowded. the food provided had been of very poor quality. he had not had access to outdoor exercise or other recreational activities. in addition, medical treatment had not been provided. there was also an additional space, measuring 7.67 sq. the area was adequately lit, ventilated and heated; in addition, it had fans outside the dormitories to be used during the summer months. food was provided three times a day by an external restaurant. international organisations and non-governmental organisations had free access to the premises.

the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in focşani. at the material time the applicant was a local correspondent for the national daily newspaper românia liberă. the leak consisted mostly of copies of documents produced by the romanian unit and classified as secret. the documents referred to the military operations of the romanian troops at the said base in 2002 and 2003, such as operations orders or military maps. in march 2005 three romanian journalists, including o.o., who was working for românia liberă, were kidnapped by a terrorist group in iraq. together with other journalists, participated in a television show on a national channel. the journalists speculated as to whether such information could have reached terrorists too and demanded an investigation in order to establish whether the leaks had been voluntary. on 3 march 2006 the minister of defence held a press conference during which he announced that an internal inquiry into the leak of classified information had been finalised and that seventy-nine members of the army were being punished with disciplinary sanctions. the minister also confirmed the fact that he had been informed about the leak by the romanian intelligence service (serviciul român de informaţii) in october 2005 and that the specialised army departments had immediately started preliminary verifications. and the ambient recording of their discussions. had been included in the investigation file. had met the applicant and had given him a copy of the cd. in the following months, both the applicant and o.s. he also said that as soon as he had found out about the information in question, he became interested in it as a journalist. it was in that context that he had discussed and shown the said documents to e.g. and i.m., who had let him believe they had connections with high-ranking politicians. on 2 july 2007 the head of the romanian armed forces informed the chief prosecutor of the prosecutor’s office attached to the high court of cassation and justice that the documents which formed the object of the investigation and which had been issued by the romanian army, and had been compromised by their publication in the media, had been de-classified. on 15 august 2007 the prosecutor’s office attached to the high court of cassation and justice decided that “by receiving (obtaining) from o.s. 182/2002 on the protection of classified information, government decision no. the decision further mentioned that the applicant had received the secret military information and had proceeded to verify its nature and importance. he had further shared the information with other people. noting that the protection of classified information was an obligation incumbent only on authorised personnel, the prosecutor nevertheless considered that information concerning national defence was classified and could not be of public interest, as provided for by article 12(1)(a) of law no. 544/2001 on access to public information. he contended that he had not made any steps to gather military secrets but had merely passively received information that was already in the public domain. on 5 february 2008 the bucharest court of appeal rejected the applicant’s complaint as ill-founded. the applicant appealed against that judgment. the court held that article 19 of law 51/1991 applied to anyone who gathered and shared secret information outside the legal framework. considering that the information in question had not been in the public domain, the court held that journalists coming into possession of such information must submit it to the competent authorities and were allowed by law to share with the public only the failure of the institution concerned to protect its confidentiality. the applicant was ordered to pay court fees of rol 200 (eur 47).

the first and second applicants were born in 1953 and 1954 respectively. the first applicant lives in munich and the second in erding. they lodged an appeal on points of law which was dismissed in 1994. an application to the court lodged by the applicants concerning those proceedings (no. in the context of those proceedings the applicants contacted the press, providing them with documents connected to the reopening proceedings and other unspecified documents. the first and second applicants were released on probation in august 2007 and january 2008 respectively. the court of appeal observed that the fact that material on the internet was often made permanently available to users and that the information was visibly old did not alter that conclusion. the court of appeal gave the radio station leave to appeal on points of law. the courts were called upon to consider the seriousness of the infringement of the right to personality and the offender’s interest in resocialisation; in that regard, account had to be taken of the way in which the person concerned was presented in the report and, in particular, the extent of its dissemination. the federal court of justice added that the way in which the transcript of the report had been posted on the deutschlandradio portal had resulted in limited dissemination. it would not have been found on the radio station’s internet pages devoted to news items that might be immediately obvious to internet users; the latter would have had to search under the heading “older news items” (altmeldungen), and the transcript would have been marked as such in a clear and visible manner. in the view of the federal court of justice, offenders could not claim such a right. lastly, the federal court of justice noted that a ban such as that sought by the applicants would have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and freedom of the press: if they were prohibited from making available to internet users transcripts of old radio programmes whose legality had not been challenged, media outlets such as deutschlandradio would no longer be able to fulfil their task of informing the public, a task entrusted to them under constitutional law. it stated that it was not giving reasons for its decisions (nos. the file included five articles that had appeared between 1991 and 1993 in the print and online editions of the magazine. access to the file was subject to payment. ’s mother and who had adopted him when he was twenty-four years old. 39/1992 of 21 september and 49/1992 of 30 november 1992) were accompanied by photographs, one showing the two applicants in the courtroom of the criminal court, another showing the first applicant with a prison officer, and a third showing the second applicant with w.s. the applicants then brought a similar application before the hamburg regional court, which granted them legal aid. on 29 july 2008 the hamburg court of appeal upheld the judgments of the regional court on the same grounds as those set out in its other judgments of the same day (see paragraphs 14-16 above). (c)  the judgments of the federal court of justice 35. the federal court of justice added that the articles in question reported on the applicants’ attitude towards the acts of which they were accused and recalled certain circumstances that had not been elucidated; this left it open to readers to conclude that the applicants had been wrongly convicted. it reiterated that offenders were not entitled to obtain a blanket ban on viewing a report concerning named offenders or an obligation to erase such reports. on the subject of the impugned photos, the federal court of justice pointed out that it had developed a concept of graduated protection (abgestuftes schutzkonzept) based on sections 22 and 23 of the copyright act (see “domestic law”, paragraph 50 below), which it had clarified following the court’s judgment in von hannover v. germany (no. the federal court of justice concluded that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, the applicants had no legitimate interest, within the meaning of section 23(2) of the copyright act, in prohibiting the publication of the photos. in 2007, on an unspecified date, the applicants brought proceedings against the daily newspaper mannheimer morgen in the hamburg regional court. on 20 april 2010 the federal court of justice allowed the appeals on points of law lodged by the newspaper (nos. on 23 june 2010 the federal constitutional court decided not to entertain the constitutional appeals lodged by the applicants, not to grant them legal aid and not to appoint lawyers to represent them. vi zr 114/09 and 115/09 of 22 february 2011, and no. vi zr 217/08 of 8 may 2012 concerning the second applicant).
the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in the village of tsereteli, marneuli region, georgia. on 1 december 2005 a certain individual, ms k., applied to the governor of the marneuli region for the permit necessary for the construction of a petrol station on a plot of land situated in the region. she expressed her readiness to cooperate with the dcs. still on 6 december 2005, the general public prosecutor’s office (“the prosecutor’s office”) issued the dcs with a general authorisation to remain in charge of the bribery case and to conduct all types of investigative measures necessary. by rulings dated 7 december 2005, the tbilisi city court authorised secret video surveillance of the applicant’s meetings with ms k., as well as the tapping of their telephone conversations. on the same day, the applicant contacted a notary and the head of the land registry of the marneuli region, requesting them, respectively, to certify the sales agreement and to register, in an expedited manner, the plot in ms k.’s name. on 12 december 2005 ms k. brought to the applicant’s office the sales agreement and a record from the land registry of the marneuli region confirming her title to the newly acquired plot of land. ms k. promised to bring the sum the following day. as soon as ms k. handed over the money to the applicant, dcs officers entered the room and arrested the applicant. the accuracy of these findings was later confirmed by a forensic chemical examination. the accused party did not contest that evidence. he stated that he had never had any intention of accepting a bribe but had been helping ms k. out of good will, as he had considered her to be a distant relative. she had falsely presented herself as his distant relative in order to obtain the applicant’s favour more easily. ms k. emphasised that she had never been sure that the applicant had intended to retain any part of the above-mentioned sum for his personal benefit. nevertheless, still suspecting that there might have been illegal intent involved in the applicant’s wish to be involved in the money transfer, ms k. had decided to inform the dcs of her conversation with the applicant. on 3 may 2006 ms k. requested that the bolnisi district court hear her again in relation to the applicant’s case, stating that she had forgotten to testify in respect of a number of significant factual details when the court had previously heard her on 20 april 2006. on 17 may 2006 ms k. lodged a complaint with the prosecutor’s office in respect of the initiation of the criminal proceedings against her (see paragraph 19 above). allowing a request lodged by the applicant on 23 june 2006, the trial court admitted to the criminal case file as evidence a recording of a television programme and a newspaper article in which ms k. had publicly acknowledged having been an dcs undercover agent in four other unrelated criminal cases. ms k. also confirmed that the applicant had indeed conducted negotiations with a number of construction companies on her behalf at that time. ms k. did not deny that, prior to her involvement in the case against the applicant, she had acted as an undercover agent for the dcs in four other unrelated cases. she further stated before the trial court that she had already acted as an undercover agent of the dcs when she had approached the applicant for the first time on 1 december 2005. notably, the dcs had been in possession of information that the governor had been prone to requesting bribes in return for providing various public services. ms k. also stated that the sales agreement in respect of the plot of land had been annulled shortly after the applicant’s arrest, as it had in fact been a fictitious transaction concluded under the dcs’s close supervision. according to ms k.’s statements, ms n. had also been collaborating with the dcs at that time, and the first meeting between ms k. and ms n. had taken place on the dcs’s premises. as regards the applicant’s statement that the money discovered on his person (usd 10,000) had not been a bribe but a valid advance payment for preparatory works associated with ms k.’s construction project, the district court answered that this was not supported by the totality of the collected evidence; it did not provide any additional explanation in that respect. on 18 october 2006 the examination of the applicant’s appeal by the tbilisi court of appeal began. the appellate court granted the applicant’s request. ms n. was scheduled to appear before the appellate court on 1 december 2006, but failed to do so. ms n. stated, in particular, that her aged mother had been seriously ill and remained under her constant supervision. on 24 november 2008 the applicant was granted early release from prison under a presidential pardon.
the applicant was born in 1964 and lives in thessaloniki. in december 2007 the applicant published an article in a local newspaper, chortiatis 570. the article’s title was “the ludicrousness of power” and stated, inter alia, the following:
“it is known to more or less all of us how some people, fellow citizens or neighbours, especially the latter, act when they think that interests of any kind which they have had ‘since the beginning of time’ are affected ... when these same people get involved in politics and take up a little post, owing to there being a lack of other interested people who are all too often more capable. in this space, which they consider to belong to their yard, they plant trees, as if they suddenly have a mania for saving the environment ... they construct their buildings (in our case, a gazebo with a tiled roof) a little further from the limits of their land, saying with impudence that it is not they who are to blame for this, but ‘the bad albanian’ to whom they assigned [the building work]. so, in order to hinder any ‘reckless’ neighbours or other visitors who [have] the audacity to park their cars in the area between the limits of their land and the street, that is to say in the remaining public space, they put trees-obstacles. these people] find themselves faced with criminal complaints, because they dare to park where all the others park ...” 7. filed a criminal complaint against the applicant for slanderous defamation via the press. on 24 september 2008 the three-member first-instance criminal court of thessaloniki (τριμελές πλημμελειοδικείο) held a hearing in the case. the applicant argued that, under article 367 of the criminal code, his act had not been wrongful, as what he had written in the published text was true. had used her position as an elected member of the local council in order to plant trees and construct a pavement in front of her house without permission. the applicant appealed against that decision. on 28 may 2009 the three-member thessaloniki court of appeal (τριμελές εφετείο – hereinafter “the court of appeal”) changed the charges from slanderous defamation to insult (εξύβριση), and found the applicant guilty of insult via the press. it sentenced him to a four-month suspended prison sentence (decision no. on 5 may 2010 the court of cassation (άρειος πάγος) quashed the judgment which had been appealed against, on the grounds of a lack of reasoning, and remitted the case to the court of appeal (decision no. on 13 july 2010 the court of appeal held a new hearing in the case. the applicant argued again that his act had not been wrongful, as what he had written in the published article was true, and he had written with a legitimate interest in the matter. the appeal court rejected the applicant’s argument and held the following:
“... considering the above-mentioned content of the article and the then ongoing dispute between the parties and especially their personal confrontation at the city council, it is at the outset clear and without a doubt that the references (facts and characterisations) solely and exclusively concern the complainant. furthermore, from the impugned article it is apparent that in it the following facts are included: that the complainant 1) had built a gazebo with a tiled roof on her land and that a part of the roof jutted out onto the street; 2) had built a pavement and had planted trees in a public space; 3) threatened to sue persons (who were proven to be the drivers of the defendant) who dared to park in a place where other residents also parked their cars. it is also apparent that these facts are accompanied by adverse judgments against her and that those facts are connected to her in her capacity as head of the local council, that is to say that her above-mentioned actions had taken place arbitrarily and in abuse of her position at chortiatis municipality. it follows that, in the present case, the above-mentioned elements objectively and subjectively constitute the criminal act of simple defamation (article 362 of the criminal code) which, however, goes without punishment, under article 366 § 1 (a) of the criminal code. nevertheless, taking into account the way the above-mentioned defamation was expressed, and in the circumstances which were previously detailed, the court concludes that there was an intention to insult, and for this reason the defendant must be punished for this act. lastly, the defendant’s separate argument that he committed this act with a legitimate interest must be dismissed as unfounded, as the above-mentioned expressions included in the article ‘the ludicrousness of power’, which the defendant published in the newspaper chortiatis 570, indicate that he intended to insult the complainant. based on the above, the court of appeal found the applicant guilty of insult via the press and sentenced him to a two-month suspended prison sentence (judgment no. the court held that the judgment of the court of appeal had included sufficient reasoning. the decision was finalised (καθαρογραφή) on 24 march 2011. lodged a civil action for damages against the applicant. the thessaloniki multi-member first-instance court by its judgment no. 697/2011 ordered the applicant to pay 5,000 euros (eur) to e.p. following the applicant’s appeal, the thessaloniki court of appeal ordered the applicant to pay eur 2,500 (judgment no. the judgment became final and the applicant paid to e.p.
the applicant companies have their registered offices respectively in bari (g.i.e.m. mr f. gironda was born in december 1959 and lives in pellaro. 1042 of 11 may 1992 the bari municipal council approved a site division and development plan (piano di lottizzazione ‑ hereinafter “site development plan”) submitted by sud fondi s.r.l. on 28 october 1992 the applicant company informed the bari municipal authority that it wished to participate in a site development agreement. began the building work, which had mostly been completed by 17 march 1997. challenged the temporary restraining measure before the court of cassation. it acknowledged the material illegality of the site development plans on the ground that the land in question was subject to an absolute ban on building and to a landscape protection measure, both provided for by law. in that connection, the court noted that at the time the development plans had been adopted (20 march 1990), regional law no. the court of cassation observed that law no. 56/1980 in fact imposed a prohibition on building within the meaning of section 51(f), from which the circumstances of the case allowed no derogation, because the site development plans concerned plots of land that were not situated within the city limits. the court added that, at the time when the site development agreements were adopted, the land in question was included in an implementation plan (piano di attuazione) for the general land-use plan which post-dated the entry into force of regional law no. in the light of those considerations, the court of cassation thus found that the site development plans and building permits had been illegal. the applicant company appealed on points of law. it emphasised that no construction work had actually been carried out on its land, which had not been the subject of a building permit. and others judgments (merits and just satisfaction, no. in a decision of 12 march 2013 the preliminary investigations judge of that court revoked the confiscation measure and ordered the return of the land on account of the fact that, first, the court had found a violation of article 7 of the convention in sud fondi s.r.l. on 27 march 1991, under section 13 of regional law no. on 17 july 1992 the sardinia region issued its final approval of the plan. on 13 august 1992 the mayor of golfo aranci and r.i.t.a. entered into a site development agreement. on 23 november 1992 the municipality issued the building permit for the construction work. in 1997 eighty-eight housing units, less than one third of the total number, had been built. on 14 february 1995 the municipal authority stated that the agreement had been drafted clearly enough; it therefore did not need clarification. on 11 march 1996 the municipal authority, again approached by the applicant company, confirmed the opinion issued on 14 february 1995. with a view to becoming the owner of the land and buildings, on 26 february 1997 hotel promotion bureau s.r.l. having regard to the entry into force of regional law no. in a judgment of 11 october 2004 the cagliari court of appeal upheld the olbia district court’s finding of dismissal (non doversi procedere) in respect of the offence which was statute-barred and reiterated that the municipality of golfo aranci should not have issued the building permits, which were illegal and in any event ineffective. on 12 october 1994 the applicants applied for a building permit to erect a tourist residential complex consisting of forty-two houses and sports facilities. on 1 october 1998 the inspector of the municipality of reggio di calabria noted that the work was in conformity with the amended plan. given that there had been no preliminary or final contract of sale, there was no evidence of any change in the purpose of the constructions and therefore no unlawful development.
the cases concern the 1982 state internal premium loan bonds (облигации государственного внутреннего выигрышного займа 1982 года - “1982 premium bonds”) which are in the applicants’ possession. the applicants submitted lists of serials numbers or photocopies of their bonds. on 30 december 1980 the ussr cabinet of ministers decided to issue bonds of an internal premium loan to finance certain state programmes. the bonds had nominal values of 25, 50 and 100 soviet roubles (sur). their period of circulation was set at twenty years, from 1 january 1982 to 1 january 2002, and they were redeemable at any time during the term of the loan with interest at 3% per annum. soviet citizens could either buy the 1982 premium bonds with their own money or obtain them in exchange for bonds from an earlier 1966 state internal premium loan. the average monthly wage in 1982 was sur 177.30 across all branches of the economy plus sur 68.70 in various social benefits (people’s economy of the ussr 1982, a statistical yearbook by the ussr central statistics directorate, moscow, 1983). by the late 1980s the soviet economy was suffering from a structural imbalance due a rapidly increasing money supply and decreasing availability of consumer goods sold at state-controlled prices. in january 1991 the ussr government freed 40% of prices and carried out a monetary reform eliminating the largest banknotes in circulation and restricting the withdrawal of money from bank deposit accounts to sur 500 a month. this led to a two to threefold increase in prices. on 22 march 1991 the ussr president issued decree no. up-1708, ordering a one-time increase to savings instruments, including the 1982 premium bonds, of 40% to offset the price rise. on 26 december 1991 the ussr was dissolved by declaration no. the declaration invited the heads of newly independent states to reflect on the issues of succession. on 19 february 1992 the russian government issued resolution no. 97, recognising its succession in respect of the obligations of the former ussr under the 1982 loan:
“1. to confirm succession of the [russian] government in respect of the obligations of the former ussr vis-à-vis russian federation citizens arising out of the bonds of the 1982 state internal premium loan. to give russian federation citizens who are holders of bonds of the 1982 state internal premium loan the right to voluntarily exchange their bonds against state securities, including 1992 russian internal premium loan bonds, shares in the savings bank ... and also to credit the proceeds of sale of the bonds into deposit accounts open in the savings bank ... from 1 october 1992 ...” 11. between 1995 and 2000 a series of russian laws and regulations were passed which provided for the conversion of soviet securities, including the 1982 premium bonds, into special russian promissory notes nominated in “promissory roubles” (dor) (for details, see yuriy lobanov v. russia, no. from 2003 to the present day, the application and implementation of those laws and regulations have been continuously suspended, most recently for the period 1 january 2017 to 1 january 2020, by law no. 429‑fz of 19 december 2016 and resolution no. the applicants applied to the russian financial authorities and the courts, seeking the redemption of their bonds. their claims were rejected on procedural and substantive grounds. mr ruzanov’s claim was allowed at first instance but the judgment was later overturned on appeal. on 5 may 2014 mr israfilov obtained a decision from the leninskiy district court in makhachkala, requiring the russian government to convert his bonds into special promissory notes. mr losyakov and ms losyakova’s claim was referred by the supreme court to the constitutional court. 632-o of 3 april 2012, the constitutional court declared it inadmissible, finding that it was not competent to rule on the issue of an alleged failure of federal lawmakers to enact laws guaranteeing the protection of savings which had been recognised as russia’s internal debt. in its view, the federal lawmakers had adequate discretion to legislate on those issues in the interests of everyone, taking into account the specific social and economic conditions prevailing in russia and the balance between the rights and lawful interests of various categories of citizens, including those who acted as creditors of the state and others in respect of whom the state had public policy obligations. the legislature was entitled to restrict the rights, including property rights, of some people for the protection of rights and lawful interests of others.
the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in râmnicu-vâlcea. until december 2009, the applicant had unhindered opportunity to talk to his daughter on the phone and to take her to his home whenever he wished. appealed, arguing that the applicant had never been prevented from visiting the child but that since the divorce he had not visited her more than once every three months and had not contributed in any way to the continuous medical treatment she required. during the proceedings the parties reached an agreement about the visiting schedule. on 17 may 2012 the county court questioned m.a. and noted:
“the parents divorced about 5-6 years ago and after that she often used to visit her father up until about 6 months ago, when her mother stopped allowing her to answer the phone, because the father only wanted to make [n.e.c.] since then, she can no longer answer the phone and her father has not seen her. she does not wish to visit her father because that would make her mother upset and she does not want that because she cares a lot about her mother. in a decision of 15 june 2012 (hereinafter “the contact order”) the county court took note of the parents’ agreement as to the visiting schedule and considered that it was beneficial for the child to maintain contact with her father. in these circumstances, the [county court] has correctly decided that the visits should take place in the applicant’s home, in order to allow the normal parental ties to develop and to avoid the possibility of inculcating feelings of hatred towards the father, which would run counter to the child’s harmonious psychological development.” on each occasion they found no one there, despite prior notification. on 21 august 2013, acting on an application lodged by the bailiff under article 188 § 2 of the ccp (see paragraph 27 below), the brezoi district court fined n.e.c. ron 100 (approximately eur 22 at the relevant time) for obstructing the enforcement proceedings. he did not otherwise contest the findings of the bailiff’s report. 299 of 12 may 2016, the constitutional court dismissed the constitutional complaint raised by the applicant (see paragraph 30 below). on 4 march 2014 the applicant asked the district court to quantify the amount of damages to which he was entitled under article 905 § 4 of the ccp (see paragraph 27 below). maintained that it had been the applicant who had distanced himself from the child and that due to the break-up of the father-daughter relationship it was impossible to comply with the contact order at that time. the latter could not obtain this payment as n.e.c. had sold all her possessions and had not declared any fixed income. on 14 january 2015 the applicant reiterated his request for psychological counselling. be fined for the delays in executing the contact order. had not allowed them to talk with the child about her relationship with her father. refused to re-establish contact with her father and expressed her belief that her father was only trying to hurt her mother through his actions because of their work-related conflicts, of which she had been partially informed by her mother. she said:
“i believe that by his actions my father wants, in reality, to hurt my mother. it might be that through his actions my father wants to hurt my mother. i no longer want to know him or to have personal relations with him. (...) it is true that my mother has never said bad things about my father, but she has never encouraged me to have personal ties with him either.” would be beneficial for re-establishing the relationship between the applicant and his daughter. on 18 april 2017, in response to a complaint lodged by the applicant, the prosecutor in chief of the prosecutor’s office upheld the above decision. however, in a decision of 3 october 2017 the râmnicu vâlcea district court allowed a complaint lodged by the applicant, quashed the prosecutor’s decision and sent the case back to the prosecutor’s office for further examination.
the applicant was born in 1985 and lives in oryol. he is currently serving his sentence in ik-7 in the village of areyskoye, krasnoyarsk region. the applicant, his partner and his mother were living in oryol when the applicant was charged with drug-related crimes. on 2 december 2009 the federal penal authority (“федеральная служба исполнения наказаний”, “the fsin”) of russia sent a telegram to the fsin department for the oryol region (“the oryol fsin”) instructing the latter to send each month up to forty people detained in remand prisons and sentenced to a term of imprisonment in a strict-regime facility to the krasnoyarsk region. the instruction was valid as of 1 december 2009 until further notice. on 7 december 2009 the sovetskiy district court of oryol convicted the applicant of drug-related crimes and sentenced him to twelve years’ imprisonment in a strict-regime post-conviction detention facility. on 2 february 2010 the oryol regional court upheld the conviction on appeal. acting on the basis of the fsin of russia’s instruction of 2 december 2009, on an unspecified date the oryol fsin decided, in view of the overcrowding in the post‑conviction detention facilities in the oryol region, that the issue of which particular facility the applicant would be transferred to should be resolved by the fsin department for the krasnoyarsk region (“the krasnoyarsk fsin”). the latter allocated the applicant to ik-7, a strict-regime post-conviction detention facility in the village of areyskoye, krasnoyarsk region (about 4,200 km from oryol), to serve his sentence. the applicant has been detained there since 20 april 2010. the applicant has repeatedly asked the penal authorities at different levels to transfer him to a detention facility located closer to oryol so that he could effectively maintain family ties while serving his sentence. on 12 november 2010 the fsin of russia rejected the applicant’s request, informing him that, under article 81 of the code on the execution of sentences (“the ces”), in the absence of exceptional circumstances convicts were to serve their prison term in its entirety in the same detention facility, and that there were no such exceptional circumstances in the applicant’s case. they noted as follows:
“[a]s regards maintaining the convict’s social ties, the right to receive visits and parcels as well as the right to correspondence and phone calls should be realised in accordance with the laws on execution of sentences in force and does not depend on the place in which he is serving the sentence.” the applicant brought civil proceedings against the oryol fsin, claiming compensation for pecuniary and non‑pecuniary damage caused by their decision to transfer him to a penal facility in the krasnoyarsk region in breach of his right, under article 73 § 1 of the ces, to serve his prison sentence in his home region, which had adversely affected his capacity to maintain his family and social ties. on 3 august 2012 the zavodskoy district court of oryol dismissed the claims for damages with reference to article 73 § 2 of the ces and ruling no. 1700-o-o of the constitutional court of russia. the court held that the oryol fsin’s decision had been lawful because between december 2009 and february 2010 the penal facilities in the oryol region had been overcrowded. it also noted that the defendant had acted in accordance with the fsin of russia’s instructions. the court did not address the applicant’s argument regarding his difficulties in maintaining family ties because of the distance between his family home and the detention facility. it appears that the applicant did not appeal against the judgment. between july 2011 and october 2013 the applicant’s partner made long-term family visits to ik-7 on six occasions. in 2014 she gave birth to the couple’s daughter. while in ik-7, the applicant received a number of parcels and phone calls from his mother and partner.
the applicants were born in 1965 and 1954 respectively and live in bucharest. both applicants were ill-treated and injured on 21 december 1989 during the events which led to the fall of the communist regime in bucharest. the first applicant suffered injuries that needed eight days of medical care and the second applicant was beaten by militia forces on the same occasion. in 1990 the military prosecutor’s office opened ex officio investigations into the illegal detention, ill-treatment and injury suffered by the applicants and other participants in the events of december 1989 in respect of several offences as mentioned below. the main criminal investigation was recorded in file no. in the meantime, an ex officio investigation concerning the offences of illegal deprivation of liberty, illegal arrest and abusive investigation of a large number of persons, including the applicants, culminated in the referral to court and subsequent conviction of senior military and public officials by a decision of the supreme court of justice of 10 may 1991, which became final on 14 november 1991. the injured parties, including the applicants, did not participate in that procedure, as the government acknowledged. as regards the offence of abusive conduct, the military prosecutor’s office decided on 9 march 1994 (in respect of the first applicant) and 28 october 1994 (in respect of the second applicant) not to open a separate ex officio investigation on the grounds that the offence of abusive conduct fell under a subsequently enacted amnesty law; that decision was communicated only to the second applicant on 4 october 2001. no decision was adopted in respect of the applicants’ injury. further, without a formal decision to overturn the decisions issued by the military prosecutor’s office (see paragraph 8 above) and to reopen the applicants’ respective cases, in the main criminal investigation, the prosecutor heard the applicants who reiterated their complaints regarding the offences of illegal deprivation of liberty and homicide as an attempt raised on account of their ill-treatment and injury during the events of december 1989. thus, the first applicant requested on 5 january 2005 and on 4 august 2008 to participate in these proceedings as a civil party and for the investigation of his case to be pursued by the military prosecutor’s office. in the main criminal investigation, the second applicant gave a statement on 4 october 2001 and lodged a civil claim on 17 may 2005, asking for the punishment of those responsible. the relevant procedural steps taken in the main criminal investigation were described in association “21 december 1989” and others v. romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 may 2011) and anamaria‑loredana orășanu and others v. romania ([committee] (nos. 43629/13 and 74 others, §§ 10‑11, 7 november 2017). on 14 october 2015, as regards the second applicant, the military prosecutor’s office issued a decision only in respect of the offence of instigation to illegal deprivation of liberty by closing the main criminal investigation on the grounds of res judicata in relation to the supreme court of justice’s decision of 10 may 1991, failing to decide the offence of homicide as an attempt or her injury, as complained of (see paragraph 7 above). no decision was taken in respect of the first applicant. although the parties have not communicated any information regarding the lodging of an appeal against this decision, it can be seen from the military prosecutor’s office website that it was subsequently quashed. thus, on 1 november 2016 the military prosecutor’s office ordered the initiation in rem of a criminal investigation regarding the offence of crimes against humanity in respect of the same circumstances of fact. to date, the main criminal investigation is still ongoing.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in gdynia. on 2 january 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed homicide together with other persons. on 5 january 2007 the gdynia district court (sąd rejonowy) remanded him in custody. the court stressed the need to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given that extensive evidence had still to be obtained in the case. it also referred to the fact that the proceedings in question concerned several alleged accomplices. the court further relied on the likelihood that a severe penalty would be imposed on the applicant. on 12 february 2007 the applicant applied for the preventive measure to be lifted or varied. the applicant’s detention was further extended by decisions of the gdańsk regional court (sąd okręgowy) of 20 march, 19 june and 21 august 2007. the applicant appealed against all of those decisions. his appeals were dismissed by the gdańsk court of appeal (sąd apelacyjny) on 4 may, 1 august and 19 september 2007 respectively. the courts repeatedly relied in their decisions on the strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence in question, the likelihood of a severe prison sentence being imposed on him and the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation, especially the need to obtain further expert evidence. on 17 september 2007 the applicant again applied for release. his application was refused on 21 september 2007 by the gdynia district prosecutor. on 27 november 2007 the gdańsk regional court further extended the applicant’s detention until 31 march 2008. on an unspecified date in late 2007 a bill of indictment was lodged with the gdańsk regional court. the applicant was charged with homicide committed together with two other co-accused. on 4 august 2008 the applicant requested the court to release him on health grounds. on 19 august 2008 the trial court refused his request. it relied on the medical certificate issued by a prison doctor, stating that the applicant could be adequately treated in detention. the applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment. on 13 may 2009 the gdańsk court of appeal quashed the impugned judgment and remitted the case for retrial (case no. the applicant’s detention was continually extended by the domestic courts, pending his appeal and in the course of the retrial. in particular, on 24 august 2009 the gdańsk regional court extended his detention until 31 december 2009. the applicant appealed against this decision. on 23 september 2009 the gdańsk court of appeal upheld the impugned decision, finding that the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence in question persisted, despite the fact that the judgment convicting the applicant had been quashed. on 16 march 2010 the gdańsk regional court gave judgment (case no. during the retrial proceedings the gdańsk regional court held fifteen hearings in total. the applicant was again convicted and sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment. he lodged an appeal against that judgment. the applicant was released on the same day.

the first applicant was born in 1954 and lives in sofia. the second applicant was registered in 1992 and has its registered place of business in sofia. at the time of the events in question the first applicant was registered as a sole trader. at that time the main commercial activity of the two applicants was trade in medicaments. in february and march 2006 the first applicant sold medicaments to a company called k., for which she was paid 22,043.23 bulgarian levs (bgn), the equivalent of 11,275 euros (eur), in total. between december 2005 and april 2006 the second applicant also sold medicaments to k., receiving a total of bgn 33,344.05 (the equivalent of eur 17,055) by way of payment. in september 2006 other companies which were creditors of k., including e., applied for the commencement of insolvency proceedings against k. their request was allowed in a judgment of 17 november 2006 of the plovdiv regional court (hereinafter “the regional court”), which declared company k. insolvent, opened insolvency proceedings and appointed a trustee. it noted that k. had ceased its payments to e. and other creditors in october 2005, and held that the initial date of the company’s insolvency was therefore 30 october 2005. in january 2007 the trustee prepared the first list of k.’s creditors, which included company e. 11. in may 2007 company e. brought proceedings against the first applicant under section 646(2) of the commerce act, as in force at the time (see paragraph 25 below), seeking to have the payments k. had made to her during the so-called “suspect period” – the period between the initial date of insolvency as declared by the plovdiv regional court and the commencement of the insolvency proceedings (the payments described in paragraph 7 above) − declared null and void and the sum received by her returned to the insolvency estate. the action was allowed in a judgment of the regional court of 31 october 2007. observing that it was undisputed that k. had paid the first applicant bgn 22,043.23 during the “suspect period”, and without analysing the matter any further, it ordered her to pay back this sum to the insolvency estate, plus default interest. that judgment was upheld on 12 march 2008 by the plovdiv court of appeal (hereinafter “the court of appeal”). the court of appeal’s judgment was enforceable and, at the request of k.’s trustee, a bailiff opened enforcement proceedings against the first applicant for the sums due to the insolvency estate. in december 2008 the applicant settled that debt, which also included interest and costs and expenses related to the enforcement proceedings. in the judicial proceedings against the first applicant, in a final decision of 21 january 2009 the supreme court of cassation refused to accept for examination an appeal on points of law lodged by her. in april 2007 company e. brought proceedings against the second applicant under section 646(2) of the commerce act, as in force at the time (see paragraph 25 below), seeking to have the payments k. had made to it during the “suspect period” between 30 october 2005 and 17 november 2006 (payments described in paragraph 8 above) declared null and void and the sum received by the applicant returned to the insolvency estate. the action was allowed in a judgment of 23 january 2008 of the regional court. while it acknowledged that the transactions between the second applicant and k. had not damaged the latter’s interests, because k. had received equivalent goods in exchange for its payments to the applicant, the regional court added that the commerce act “did not take account” of such considerations. it thus ordered the second applicant to pay back to the insolvency estate the sum of bgn 33,344.05, plus default interest. upon appeal by the second applicant, on 10 june 2008 that judgment was upheld by the court of appeal, which stated once again that section 646(2) of the commerce act did not require any proof that the contested payment had damaged the interests of k.’s remaining creditors; such damage, as well as the knowledge about it, were to be considered “presumed”. since the court of appeal’s judgment was enforceable, a bailiff opened enforcement proceedings against the second applicant for the sums owed by it to the insolvency estate. the second applicant settled that debt, which included interest and costs and expenses related to the enforcement proceedings, in october 2008. in the main judicial proceedings against the second applicant, in a final decision of 29 july 2009 the supreme court of cassation refused to accept for examination an appeal on points of law lodged by it. in the insolvency proceedings against k., the majority of its assets were distributed among its creditors between november 2007 and october 2008. in two decisions delivered in november and december 2008 the trustee in bankruptcy added the state to the list of creditors, with claims exceeding bgn 5,000,000. as the state was a privileged creditor, almost all payments from the insolvency estate after that were made to it, but a substantial proportion of the debts owed to it by k. nonetheless remained unpaid. the applicants did not make use of the possibility afforded to them by section 648 of the commerce act (see paragraph 29 below) to join the insolvency proceedings as creditors of k. two other companies in a similar situation – they had also been obliged to return sums to the insolvency estate on the basis of section 646(2) of the commerce act – did join the insolvency proceedings, but received no part of the sums owed to them. the insolvency proceedings continued until 2014, when company k. was wound up.

the applicants were born in 1983, 1973, 1983, 1986, 1984 and 1984. according to the applicants’ submissions, which were not contested by the government, at the time of the lodging of the application, they were serving the prison sentences arising out of their criminal convictions which gave rise to the present application. on 17 and 18 june 2005 seventeen members of the maoist communist party (hereinafter “the mkp”), an illegal organisation, were killed in a rural area within the administrative jurisdiction of the town of ovacık, near the city of tunceli, by members of the security forces. on 21 june 2005 a gathering was held in protest at the alleged unlawful killings of 17 and 18 june 2005 in samsun. university students from the samsun ondokuz mayıs üniversitesi, including the applicants, gathered in front of the building of the black sea fundamental rights and freedoms association (karadeniz temel haklar ve özgürlükler derneği) where a press statement was read out. on 8 july 2005 one of the applicants, mr ahmet doğan, attended another reading out of a press statement in samsun. the press statement concerned the killings of 17 and 18 june 2005, the arrest of a number of persons subsequent to the reading out of the press statement on 21 june 2005 and the alleged unlawful killing of a detainee by the police. on 21 february 2007 the ankara public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against twenty-three people, including the applicants, charging them with disseminating propaganda in favour of the mkp, under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. according to the indictment, during the gathering of 21 june 2005, slogans such as “long live revolutionary solidarity” (“yaşasın devrimci dayanışma”), “we have paid a price. murderer state” (“katil devlet”), “revolutionary martyrs are immortal” (“devrim şehitleri ölümsüzdür.”), “ martyrs are immortal” (“şehit namırın”), were chanted and the applicants participated in the gathering. the public prosecutor further noted that mr ahmet doğan had participated in the gathering of 8 june 2005, during which the following slogans had been chanted: “no emancipation alone, either all of us or none of us.” (“ kurtuluş yok tek başına, ya hep beraber ya hiçbirimiz.)”, “ arrests, provocations and coercion cannot discourage us.” (“ tutuklamalar, provakasyonlar, baskılar bizi yıldıramaz.”), “ we will resist and succeed” (“direne direne kazanacağız.”), “ we have paid a price; we will make them pay a price.” “ on 31 march 2009 the ankara assize court found the applicants guilty as charged and sentenced each of them to ten months’ imprisonment pursuant to section 7(2) of law no. 3713, except for mr ahmet doğan, who was sentenced to twenty months’ imprisonment. as regards the gathering of 21 june 2005, the assize court found it established that the slogan “martyrs are immortal” had been chanted by mr kürşad arslan, ms dilek kömpe, mr olcay bayraktar and mr ahmet doğan and that the slogans “the murderer state will pay the price”, “revolutionary martyrs are immortal” and “long live revolutionary solidarity” had been chanted by mr yaşar çalışkan, mr kürşad arslan and ms dilek kömpe. we will resist and succeed” and “we have paid a price; we will make them pay a price.” in its judgment, the ankara assize court referred to article 10 of the convention as well as to the court’s judgment in the case of sürek v. turkey (no. 26682/95, echr 1999‑iv) and the report of the european commission of human rights in the case of karataş v. turkey (no. 23168/94, commission’s report of 11 december 1997). the court held that by chanting the above-mentioned slogans the applicants had not exercised their democratic rights but had glorified terror by adopting the style of discourse of terror organisations and that they had not distanced themselves from violence. in the court’s view, by chanting those slogans the applicants had not intended to find a solution to a problem but had praised and glorified the source of the problem, that is to say, the terrorist organisations concerned. hence, the applicants had incited terror. the ankara assize court concluded that chanting the slogans in question could not be considered as falling within the scope of the right to freedom of expression. on 8 july 2010 the court of cassation upheld the judgment of 31 march 2009 in so far as it concerned the applicants’ conviction. on unspecified dates the applicants served their prison sentences.
the applicant was born in 1977 and was detained at the kırıkkale f‑type prison when the application was lodged. on 1 october 2004 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of being member of a terrorist organisation. on 5 october 2004 the applicant was brought before the judge at the ankara assize court who placed him in detention on remand taking into consideration the nature of the offence, the state of evidence and the severity of the envisaged penalty. on 15 march 2005 the ankara public prosecutor filed an indictment with the ankara assize court, charging the applicant with membership of a terrorist organisation. on 31 january 2008 the ankara assize court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 15 years’ imprisonment. the court ordered the continuation of his detention. on 6 may 2009 the court of cassation quashed the judgment. the case was accordingly remitted to the ankara assize court for further examination. on 10 november 2009 the 11th chamber of the ankara assize court held a further hearing, in which both the applicant and his lawyer were present. at the end of that hearing, the court ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention. on 10 december 2009 the applicant’s lawyer filed an objection against the decision of 10 november 2009. on 21 december 2009 the 12th chamber of the ankara assize court dismissed this objection without holding a hearing. in delivering its decision, the court took into consideration the written opinion of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative. on 28 august 2012 the ankara assize court once more convicted the applicant and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment. on 8 july 2013 the court of cassation upheld the judgment of the first instance court.
the applicants were born in 1964, 1957 and 1947 respectively. the first and third applicants live in ankara. the second applicant left turkey subsequent to his criminal conviction giving rise to the present application. on 21 august 2006 the applicants took part in a religious ceremony (mevlüt)[1] on the premises of the altındağ district branch of the party for a democratic society (demokratik toplum partisi – “the dtp”) in ankara, at which they paid tribute to three members of the pkk, an illegal armed organisation, who had been killed by the security forces. one of the deceased was the first applicant’s nephew. the second applicant was the head of the ankara branch of the dtp at the relevant time. the third applicant was a member of the dtp and a friend of the first applicant. on 23 november 2007 the ankara public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the ankara assize court, charging the applicants and a number of other persons with dissemination of propaganda in favour of the pkk, under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. 3713), on account of their participation in the ceremony of 21 august 2006. according to the indictment, during the ceremony photographs of the deceased and the pkk’s flag were displayed at the venue and a film about the lives of the deceased was shown. in addition, the second applicant, the head of the ankara branch of the dtp, made the following statement:
“our fears and worries continue. in such a context, we would like this mevlüt to be a moment of peace and fraternity.” on 24 september 2008 the ankara assize court convicted the applicants of disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk and sentenced them to ten months’ imprisonment each. in its judgment, the assize court observed, firstly, that the persons in whose memory the ceremony had been held were members of a terrorist organisation and that they had been killed by the security forces during an operation against that organisation. it also took the view that the choice of venue for the ceremony – the premises of a political party – and the fact that the pkk flag had been spread over the tables and photographs of members of the organisation had been displayed, contributed to raising serious doubts as to the applicants’ submissions that they had taken part in the ceremony in observance of their religious duties. the court considered that the applicants had committed the offence of dissemination of propaganda given that they had shared the feelings of mourning and sorrow for the deceased who had been involved in terrorism. it further considered that the venue where the ceremony had been held had turned into a propaganda venue in favour of the pkk. following an appeal lodged by the applicants, their conviction was upheld by a final decision of the court of cassation on 8 march 2010. the first and third applicants served their prison sentences.
the applicant was born in 1980 and is detained in pravieniškės correctional facility. in the context of that investigation, on 15 december 2009 some of the members of the organisation were arrested and in the course of imposing coercive measures on them it was established that the applicant also possibly belonged to the organisation. it appears that the applicant did not appeal against this decision. on 22 april 2010 the vilnius region district court extended the applicant’s detention for a further three months. in addition, the court noted that the case against the applicant was complex and of a large scale, and that a number of investigative actions had to be carried out, including the determination of the applicant’s role in the criminal organisation and his relationship with other suspects. he also had a father and a brother, which showed his strong social ties. on 17 december 2010 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. on 23 february 2011 the vilnius regional court extended the applicant’s detention on remand for a further three months. the applicant appealed against that decision and asked that it be quashed. moreover, the court held that the applicant might try to interfere with the proceedings and that thirty-three persons stood accused. on 14 september 2011 the court of appeal upheld the decision of the vilnius regional court of 18 august 2011. in addition, it stated that the case file comprised ninety-six volumes of material; the standpoints of the co-accused were not clear because all of the co-accused had stated that they would give their testimony at the end of the proceedings; and the hearings were planned in advance and their schedule was extremely intense. the applicant appealed against that decision and asked for it to be quashed. the applicant also stated that he had a father and could live with him. the court stated that the case was being examined before the first-instance court on the merits and that the evidence had been examined; the applicant’s allegations that no investigative actions had been performed in respect of him were thus unfounded. it relied on the same grounds as those given in its previous decision (see paragraph 31 above). on 21 december 2012 the court of appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal and upheld the lower court’s findings that the applicant might abscond, that the criminal case was complex (it had 106 volumes and thirty‑three co-accused), and that it was not possible to achieve the purpose of article 119 of the code of criminal procedure. on 15 february 2013 the vilnius regional court extended the applicant’s detention on remand for a further three months. on 5 march 2013 the court of appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal and upheld the lower court’s findings. in addition, the court noted that the case filed contained 114 volumes and thirty-two co-accused and that the hearings had been taking place in accordance with the schedule. the applicant appealed against that decision and asked for a less restrictive measure to be imposed. it relied on same grounds as those given in its previous decision (see paragraph 39 above). the applicant appealed against that decision and asked for the imposition of a less restrictive measure. the applicant was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and he was ordered to pay a fine of 4,443 euros (eur). lastly, the mere fact that some narcotic and psychotropic substances had been found in his room during the search did not mean that he had had the intention of distributing them. had stored large amounts of narcotic and psychotropic substances in the same flat. 24652/04, § 58, 15 september 2011; pawlak v. poland [committee], no. 28237/10, § 46, 13 january 2015; and tomczyk v. poland, no. as regards the remaining period of time, the court considered that for 248 days the applicant had been held in overcrowded cells and awarded him approximately eur 1,437 in compensation. the applicant appealed and on 6 october 2015 the supreme administrative court upheld the decision of the vilnius regional administrative court of 9 january 2015.
the applicants were born in 1969, 1977 and 1980, respectively, and are currently absconding from the moldovan authorities. at the time of the events, the applicants were police officers. on 8 december 2010, the applicants attempted to apprehend p. in the staircase of an apartment block building. p. managed to escape, however he was chased and apprehended by the applicants, was thrown to the ground and severely beaten up until he lost consciousness. after that, he was carried by the applicants and put into a car. several persons witnessed p.’s apprehension and beating. p. was never seen alive after that and several years later his body was found in a well. the applicants claimed that they believed p. to be a criminal and intended to take him to the police station for questioning. after chasing him, they arrested him and drove him to the police station. however, p. managed to escape from their car at a busy road crossing and ran away after having waded across a small river. on 7 february 2011 the applicants were arrested and charged with kidnapping, murder and abuse of their authority as police officers. the same day the public prosecutor applied to the centru district court for a warrant for the applicants’ detention in custody. the same day the centru district court issued a detention order for thirty days. in court the applicants argued that the allegations presented by the public prosecutor were not supported by any facts or materials and that no materials whatsoever were presented by the prosecution. on 9 february 2011 the applicants appealed and argued, inter alia, that the orders for detention lacked reasoning and that the court had relied only on suppositions. the applicants further noted that the court had refused to provide their representative with any materials from the file other than the prosecutor’s requests. the risk of interference with the investigation was determined by the fact that the investigation had just started and the risk of absconding resulted from the fact that the applicants were police officers and thus knew how the investigating authorities operated. on 5 march 2011 the centru district court extended the applicants’ detention by thirty days for the same reasons as it had done earlier. the applicants appealed and argued, inter alia, that the investigation was not advancing as claimed by the public prosecutor and that the risk of interference could just as well be mitigated by the applicants’ house arrest. on 14 march 2011 the chișinău court of appeal upheld the decision of the centru district court of 5 march 2011 for the same reasons as it had done earlier. on 29 march 2011 the case was committed for trial. the prosecutor cited the same reasons as before: risk of absconding, of interfering with the investigation and of re‑offending. on 7 april 2011 the applicants lodged a habeas corpus request, arguing that the risk of interfering with the investigation was no longer valid because the criminal investigation had been concluded and that there had not been any evidence indicating that the applicants might abscond. the court also cited the risk of absconding. on 25 may 2011 judge v. had withdrawn from the case because he had previously worked together with the third applicant. on 6 june 2011 the applicants lodged another habeas corpus request, noting that their previous request had still not been examined. the court did not make any reference to the habeas corpus request of 10 may 2011. on 30 september 2011 the rîșcani district court acquitted the applicants of all charges and released them in the court room. on 12 november 2013 the supreme court of justice upheld that judgment in absentia. it appears that on an unspecified date after the victim’s body was found, a new set of criminal proceedings based on murder charges was initiated against the applicants.
on 6 march 2006 the applicants were taken into police custody on suspicion of aiding and abetting the mlkp (marxist-leninist communist party), an illegal armed organisation. on 7 march 2006 the applicants were brought before a judge at the ankara assize court. they also claimed that the material found in their homes had not been illegal. on 22 march 2006 the ankara public prosecutor filed an indictment with the ankara assize court against the applicants. the applicants were charged with membership of an illegal organisation under article 220 § 7 and article 314 of the criminal code. on 18 may 2006 the ankara assize court held the first hearing in the case. the applicants conceded before the court that they had participated in the demonstrations of 17 december 2005 and 19 february 2006 but stressed that those demonstrations had been legal. during the hearing held on 22 june 2006, latife canan kaplan, uğur güdük and levent çakır were released pending trial. between 18 may 2006 and 17 january 2007 the ankara assize court held nine hearings. on 17 january 2007 the assize court convicted deniz bakır, metin kürekçi, necla çomak and alihan alhan of membership of a terrorist organisation under article 314 § 2 of the criminal code, on the basis of articles 220 § 7 and 314 § 3 of the same code. metin kürekçi, necla çomak and alihan alhan were sentenced to six years and three months’ imprisonment. deniz bakır was sentenced to seven years and six months’ imprisonment. the rest of the applicants were convicted of disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. 3713) and sentenced to one year and eight months’ imprisonment each. on 22 october 2008 the court issued a judgment containing the same conclusions and sentences as in its judgment of 17 january 2007. 15  in its judgment, the assize court noted that although the esp and the sgd were legal entities, their activities were in line with those of the mlkp. the court observed that members of the esp and sgd regarded members of the mlkp who had been killed by the security forces or during hunger strikes as “martyrs” and that they had organised commemorative ceremonies for them. the court hence considered that the esp and the sgd appeared in the legal domain on behalf of the mlkp and had an organic relationship with it. the court found it established, on the basis of the conduct of members of the esp and the sgd and having regard to the documents found in the accused’s homes, that esp and sgd members were carrying out activities in line with the strategies of the mlkp and had been holding legally authorised demonstrations in favour of that organisation on the pretext of exercising their democratic rights. lastly, the court noted that selçuk mart had chanted the slogan “dısa dısa serhildan mlkp kürdistan” (“rise up again and again, mlkp kurdistan”) during the demonstration of 19 february 2006. the assize court also noted that metin kürekçi, alihan alhan and deniz bakır had been taken into police custody in the past on account of their participation in various public meetings. there were also several police records in respect of necla çomak. alihan alhan and deniz bakır had also previously been remanded in custody. metin kürekçi had also had written material regarding the esp and sgd. the court held that the applicants had aided the mlkp by acting and directing other people to act “in a manner planned by” that organisation. it convicted them under articles 220 § 7 and 314 §§ 2 and 3 of the criminal code. as regards levent çakır, uğur güdük, latife canan kaplan, serdar kır, selçuk mart, mehmet ali tosun, filiz uluçelebi and mesut açıkalın, the assize court noted that they had chanted slogans and carried banners and flags in favour of the mlkp during the demonstrations of 17 december 2005 or 19 february 2006 and had been in possession of banned books and documents in favour of that organisation. they were therefore convicted pursuant to section 7(2) of law no. on various dates between 10 march 2009 and 12 july 2012 all the applicants except necla çomak served the prison sentences imposed on them. 3713, in accordance with provisional section 1 of law no.
the applicant was born in 1988 and is currently in the netherlands. on 20 april 2015 a supplementary request was sent to the moroccan authorities. criminal proceedings against him commenced on charges of several preparatory acts of terrorism, including the criminal offence defined in article 134a of the criminal code (wetboek van strafrecht), namely the acquisition of information and know-how in preparation of the commission of a terrorist offence. in support of his claim, the applicant referred to various press articles about the criminal proceedings against him in the netherlands, as well as to several internet news articles written in dutch, moroccan and english about a terrorist cell in salouin ‒ the town where he had been living before going to the netherlands ‒ which had been dismantled by the moroccan authorities in april 2015. according to the applicant, they had been referring to him (see paragraph 11 above). had been arrested by the moroccan security service in march or april 2014. 2a)  the report about the dismantling of a terrorist cell appeared in moroccan and international media on 13 april 2015. 2c)  is it known whether [the applicant] and the persons mentioned under 2b) know each other? 3)  are the persons mentioned under 2a) still detained since their arrest in april 2015? question 4:
[the applicant] is not mentioned by name in the media reports. it was mentioned in the media reports that a moroccan national residing in the netherlands had been arrested in cooperation with the local authorities. was the person behind the radicalisation of his neighbour (the applicant), who was being detained in the netherlands in connection with terrorism. the appellant] has pointed to general information about the treatment of detainees in morocco and about the proceedings in respect of terrorist suspects, but this information is only relevant if it is plausible that [the appellant] upon return will be arrested or prosecuted for terrorism. according to the constant case-law of the administrative jurisdiction division (afdeling bestuursrechtspraak) (including the ruling of 29 july 2016, ecli:nl:rvs:2016:2171), an official report from the minister of foreign affairs about the situation in a country is an expert opinion for the deputy minister for the exercise of the latter’s powers. [the appellant’s] argument that [the deputy minister] was not allowed to base his decision on the person-specific official report of the ministry of foreign affairs because insufficient due care had been taken in drawing it up, fails. the deputy minister] has indicated that the use of a trusted local advisor is to ensure that the authorities of the country of origin are not informed of the alien’s stay in the netherlands and of his asylum application, whereas in this case it can be assumed that the moroccan authorities, due to reports in the media there, are already aware [of this circumstance]. as mentioned by the applicant, but these names are not necessarily the names of the persons. in the first place, this mere remark does not comprise a concrete argument as mentioned above. moreover, it follows from question 5 in the letter from [the deputy minister] to the ministry of foreign affairs of 15 october 2015 that the ministry has been asked both whether [the appellant] is being searched for by the moroccan authorities in connection with the criminal investigation into the arrested terror cell and whether [the appellant] is being searched for by the moroccan authorities in connection with a criminal investigation into other facts. incidentally, [the appellant] has not argued that the state of affairs would be different at a different (later) point in time. in addition to the person-specific report of the ministry of foreign affairs, [the deputy minister] has also referred to experiences made with young moroccan men (including members of the hofstad group) who had been the subject of a terrorism trial in the netherlands and/or constituted a danger to dutch national security in connection with involvement in islamic terrorism and/or jihad and for that reason [had been] returned to morocco. this can also not be inferred from previous experiences in similar cases. no further appeal lay against this ruling. the authentic and valid id-card held by the applicant was sufficient for him to be accepted onto a flight to morocco. no special procedure had been put in place for his removal, but during his transfer he would be accompanied by officers of the royal netherlands military constabulary (koninklijke marechaussee) and after arrival he would be handed over to the authorities at the destination airport. had been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. in particular, he recruits young men in his area for his terrorist organisation. on 30 march 2017 the interim measure under rule 39 staying the applicant’s removal to morocco was extended for the duration of the proceedings before the court. see paragraph 23 above at point 6.2) – assisted by the attorney e.i. – against a judgment given on 10 march 2016 by the criminal division of the rabat first instance court for terrorism cases.
the applicant was born in 1958 and lives in batman. on 18 october 2005, 6 december 2005, 1 february 2006 and 23 march 2006 the applicant made statements before the batman public prosecutor in relation to his attendance at a number of public meetings. in particular, when he was questioned on 18 october 2005 the applicant was asked about his participation in an event commemorating a number of deceased members of the pkk (kurdish workers’ party, an illegal armed organisation) held on 22 august 2005. the applicant responded that he had become aware of that event when demonstrators had started to march to the cemetery where the deceased were buried. as he was the head of the batman branch of dehap, he had attended the march in order to keep the demonstrators under control and to prevent any possible disturbances in the town. the applicant’s intention had been to express that social fact and he was against any kind of violence. when the public prosecutor reminded him of the violent acts of the pkk, the applicant once again stated that he was against violence regardless of whom it emanated from. on 1 february 2006 the batman public prosecutor asked the applicant why he had referred to the pkk leader as “esteemed/mr (sayın) öcalan” during one of his speeches. he stated that he had not intended to disseminate propaganda in favour of the pkk or to praise a criminal. when he was asked about a sentence condemning both the death of turkish soldiers and pkk members which he had uttered during a speech, the applicant stated that he would utter that sentence again without hesitation. he also stated that the petition campaign entitled “i accept abdullah öcalan as a political actor” had not been started upon the instructions of the pkk. the applicant contended that he had attended the demonstrations and meetings in question in order to control the crowds and to prevent any possible disturbances. lastly, he claimed that his aim was to contribute to peace and democracy. on 24 march 2006 the batman public prosecutor decided to transfer the investigation to the diyarbakır public prosecutor’s office, holding that the offence which the applicant had committed, namely membership of a terrorist organisation and carrying out membership activities, was not within his office’s jurisdiction. in the indictment the public prosecutor listed a total of ten marches and demonstrations which the applicant had attended. he further submitted that he had not directed demonstrators to commit any illegal acts. during the second hearing held on 18 july 2006 the public prosecutor submitted his observations on the merits of the case. the public prosecutor contended that the applicant had attended various illegal public meetings between 19 february 2005 and 16 february 2006 and that he had made speeches in which he had praised the pkk and its leader. the applicant was sentenced to six years and three months’ imprisonment. attendance at the demonstration held on 16 november 2005 during which the demonstrators chanted slogans in favour of the pkk and abdullah öcalan and carried banners, and making a speech in kurdish addressed to the press and the demonstrators; 7. attendance at the reading out of a press statement and at a march held on 21 december 2005 protesting against the solitary confinement of abdullah öcalan, during which the demonstrators chanted illegal slogans and carried banners, and making a speech in kurdish addressed to the press and the demonstrators; 9. ...
the file contains police reports, photographs and video recordings of the events which the accused attended and the speeches he made. it is established that the accused attended the public meetings in question and organised them. as a result of the trial and in the light of the evidence,
it has been established that abdulcelil i̇mret worked as the head of the batman branch of dehap and that subsequent to the closure of dehap he was the head of the batman branch of the dtp. in some of those meetings, abdulcelil i̇mret read press statements containing expressions praising abdullah öcalan. on 13 april 2010 the court of cassation upheld the first-instance judgment. the applicant applied to the diyarbakır assize court requesting it to examine whether the amended version of that provision could be considered to be in his favour and, if so, whether the execution of his sentence could be suspended. he added that he was currently serving his prison sentence. on 16 august 2012 the diyarbakır assize court decided to reduce the applicant’s sentence to five years, two months and fifteen days’ imprisonment. the court rejected the applicant’s request to have the execution of his sentence suspended.
the list of applicants and the relevant details of the applications are set out in the appended table. the applicants complained that they had been unfairly convicted of drug offences following entrapment by state agents. 48523/15, the applicant also raised other complaints under the provisions of the convention. the applicant was sentenced to ten years and a month of imprisonment. the conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal by the stavropol regional court on 23 january 2014. in may 2015 the deputy prosecutor of the stavropol region asked the presidium of the regional court to amend the conviction by excluding episodes of 17 may and 19 june 2013 “in view of the lack of a criminal conduct [in the applicant’s actions]” and to uphold the conviction in respect of the episode on 10 may 2013. the deputy prosecutor argued, in particular, that the “operative experiment” in the course of which the applicant had sold drugs on 10 may 2013 had been properly authorised by the acting head of the district police department and had been recorded, and thus there was no need to perform subsequent “operative experiments” in the form of the test purchase on 17 may and 19 june 2013. on 30 june 2015 the presidium of the stavropol regional court accepted the deputy prosecutor’s request for the revision of the final conviction by virtue of article 401 of the russian criminal code, annulled the conviction in respect of the two episodes of drug sale on 17 may and 19 june 2013, declared the applicant guilty of an attempted drug sale on 10 may 2013 and sentenced him to eight years and one month of imprisonment. however, the police officers had not prevented the applicant’s subsequent criminal activities and “had again, on 17 may and 19 june 2013 performed similar operative measures”. the presidium concluded that the applicant’s conviction of episodes of 17 may and 19 june 2013 had therefore been based on unlawfully obtained evidence and thus should be voided. it then read out a statement by a witness m. who had testified that “the buyer had not incited anyone to sell drugs” when they were in the “company drinking alcohol”. the presidium concluded that there was no indication of the police entrapment on 10 may 2013. title 3, section xiii of the code of criminal procedure (here and after – the ccrp) of 2002 (“procedure for review at second instance”) (часть 3, раздел xiii “производство в суде второй инстанции”) stipulates in article 390 § 2 that the decisions taken by the second-instance courts on appeal acquire binding force immediately. article 401.2 (“right to lodge a cassation appeal”) of the code prescribed a list of persons who were entitled to lodge a cassation appeal against any judicial act. first, such revision was possible only within one year after these judgments or decisions had become final. on 19 december 2014 the state duma adopted federal law no. 518-fz, approved by the council of the federation on 25 december 2014, and signed by the president on 31 december 2014. the law amended article 401.2 of the code by removing any time bars for lodging cassation appeals. the provisions of article 401.6 remained in force. the ccrp provides for a possibility to reopen proceedings in a criminal case when a violation of a convention right has been found by this court. the relevant provisions read as follows:
article 413. grounds for reopening of proceedings in a criminal case due to new or newly discovered circumstances
“1. final judgments ... may be annulled and the proceedings in a criminal case reopened due to new or newly discovered circumstances ...
... 4. new circumstances are ...
...
2) a finding by the european court of human rights of a violation of [convention provisions] during consideration of a criminal case by a russian court ...”
article 415. initiation of [revision] proceedings
 “5. proceedings in a criminal case after annulment of judicial decisions
“judicial proceedings in a criminal case after annulment of judicial decisions due to new or newly discovered circumstances and the lodging of appeals against new judicial decisions follow the general rules [established by the code].” in 2016 the russian supreme court published an extensive report summarising the legal positions of the european court of human rights in cases where a violation of article 6 § 1 of the convention has been found in view of the applicants’ conviction as a result of the police entrapment. it has since issued a number of similar interpretative summaries of the court’s case-law on this subject. 28-p17 issued on 12 april 2017 in response to the court’s decision in the case of ulyanov and others v. russia [committeee], nos. 22486/05 and 10 others, 9 february 2016).
the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in i̇zmir. in march 2002, the applicant, who was a working as a civil servant, was dismissed due gross misconduct. he applied to the administrative courts to have the annulment of that decision. in the course of the proceedings, on 4 july 2006 law no. 5525, granting amnesty to civil servants who had been subjected to disciplinary proceedings, entered into force. accordingly, in the light of this new amnesty law, on 10 april 2009 the supreme administrative court decided that there was no need to examine the merits of the case. in the meantime, on 30 september 2005 the criminal proceedings initiated against the applicant had ended with the decision of the criminal court, convicting him of abuse of office. following the entry into force of the amnesty law, the applicant applied to the administration and asked to be reinstated. his request was refused on 19 december 2006. the applicant initiated proceedings to have the annulment of that decision. by a decision dated 8 january 2008, the ankara administrative court found in line with the applicant’s claims and decided to annul the decision of the authorities by which they had refused to reinstate the applicant. following appeal, the case was transferred before the supreme administrative court. in the course of the proceedings, the chief public prosecutor at the supreme administrative court filed his written opinion. this opinion included substantial grounds on the merits of the case with a proposal to quash the decision of the first instance court. on 25 may 2009, relying also on the opinion of the chief public prosecutor, the supreme administrative court quashed the decision of 8 january 2008. in particular, the appeal court referred to its previous leading case which had been delivered on 17 october 2008 on a similar case and held that the amnesty law did not put an obligation on the administration to reinstate the applicant. the case was accordingly remitted before the ankara administrative court. on 9 october 2009 the first instance court adhered to the judgment of the appeal court and dismissed the applicant’s case. this decision was served on the applicant on 13 november 2009.

the applicants, mr i̇rfan dündar and mr fırat aydınkaya, were born in 1972 and 1979 respectively and live in istanbul. at the material time, the applicants were the legal representatives of abdullah öcalan, the leader of the pkk, an illegal armed organisation. on 29 and 30 april 2004 the newspaper ülkede özgür gündem published two interviews with the applicants. the interviews contained the applicants’ statements following meetings with their client, abdullah öcalan, in prison. the first interview was included in two articles in the issue of 29 april 2004 entitled “lawyers convey abdullah öcalan’s opinions concerning developments within the kongra-gel[1]” and “the pain of change”. the second interview published on 30 april 2004 was entitled “abdullah öcalan is an opportunity for turkey” and “abdullah öcalan’s opinions are important for an enduring peace”. on 30 april 2004 the public prosecutor at the now defunct istanbul state security court filed a bill of indictment under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. 3713), charging the applicants with disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk/kongra-gel on account of the interview published on 29 april 2004. in the indictment, the applicants were accused of acting on öcalan’s instructions and conveying messages from him about the pkk’s strategy. subsequently, criminal proceedings were launched against the applicants before the istanbul assize court. on 7 may 2004 the istanbul public prosecutor filed a second bill of indictment against the applicants, again charging them with disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk under section 7(2) of law no. 3713 on account of the interview published in the 30 april 2004 issue of the newspaper. on 24 august 2004 the istanbul assize court decided to join the two sets of criminal proceedings against the applicants owing to the factual and legal similarities between them. during the proceedings the applicants maintained that they had made the statements with a view to providing information to the press, since the case against abdullah öcalan had attracted media interest, but that they had been misquoted to a certain extent in the newspaper. they stressed that they had not acted with the intention of disseminating propaganda in favour of any illegal organisation. on 18 february 2010 the istanbul assize court convicted the applicants of disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk/kongra‑gel under section 7(2) of law no. it sentenced them to ten months’ imprisonment each, but decided to suspend pronouncement of their convictions on condition that they did not commit another intentional offence for a period of five years, in accordance with article 231 of the code of criminal procedure. in its judgment, the istanbul court held that the applicants had overstepped the limits of the lawyer-client relationship and made statements in a manner that induced and promoted the adoption, dissemination and enrootment of abdullah öcalan’s opinions in society. the first-instance court considered that in the light of the applicants’ role, the readers they targeted, the aim of the publication, and the manner in which their applicants’ interviews were perceived by the readership, the interviews could not be deemed to be protected by the right to freedom of expression or the privilege of the lawyer-client relationship. the court further considered that the right to freedom of expression carried with it duties and responsibilities and could be restricted for the purpose of protecting national security and territorial integrity in a democratic society. the istanbul assize court concluded that the reported interviews were aimed at disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk/kongra-gel and found the applicants guilty. on 20 september 2010 the applicants’ objection to the assize court’s judgment was dismissed by the same court.

the court dismisses [the applicants’] arguments that they had no intention to incite religious hatred or enmity or to offend the dignity of a group of people because of their religious beliefs, as those arguments were refuted by the evidence in the case. ... the two-year prison sentence was to be calculated from the date of arrest of each of the applicants, that is from 3, 4 and 15 march 2012 respectively. she stated, in particular, that throughout the trial she and the other accused had not been able to have confidential consultations with their lawyers. in a letter of 28 may 2013 the president of the moscow city court refused to review the decision of 15 march 2013. on 10 december 2014 the supreme court instituted supervisory review proceedings upon the above applications. it was also republished by many websites. on 26 september 2012 a state duma member, mr s., asked the prosecutor general of the russian federation to study the video of the group’s performance, to stop its dissemination and to ban the websites which had published it. that judgment can be appealed against by way of supervisory review in entirely different proceedings. accordingly, the aforementioned activities are against the public interests of the russian federation.
the applicants, who are police officers, were born in 1967, 1978, 1976, 1979 and 1964 respectively. the first and second applicants live in chișinău and caușeni and the remaining applicants live in bender. on 14 june 2006 officers mangîr, vasiliev and condrea, who were conducting a criminal investigation in tiraspol, were arrested by the secret service of the self-proclaimed “moldovan republic of transdniestria” (“mrt”)[1]. during their arrest they managed to call the bender police station. the other two applicants (officers daţco and pohila) went to tiraspol to clarify the reasons for the arrest of their colleagues, but were also arrested upon their arrival. the applicants were placed in the tiraspol remand centre (ivs tiraspol). on 17 june 2006 officers pohila, daţco and vasiliev were released without charge and without any explanation for their arrest. on 18 june 2006 officer mangîr was allegedly beaten up and injected with an unknown substance, which rendered him unconscious for four days. after his release he was admitted for in-patient treatment in the hospital of the ministry of internal affairs of the republic of moldova, where he was diagnosedwith, inter alia, concussion. on 20 june 2006 the tiraspol city court issued a warrant for officer mangîr to be detained for thirty days. on 23 june 2006 the “mrt” authorities released officers mangîr and condrea. the head of the “mrt” secret service declared in an interview that the officers had been released after russian authorities had “given assurances” that moldovan authorities would not “kidnap people” in the “mrt”. the applicants were accused in the “mrt” media of being members of “black squadrons” created for the purpose of kidnapping politicians and other persons causing nuisance to the moldovan authorities. according to the applicants, during their detention they were questioned by the “mrt” secret service and forced to declare that in tiraspol they had been trying to kidnap “mrt” politicians. officers pohila, daţco and vasiliev were allegedly beaten on the soles of their feet and threatened with the killing of members of their families, as well as with being transferred to cells occupied by common criminals, where they would be ill-treated or even killed. officer condrea was allegedly subjected to so-called “palestinian hanging” for up to seven hours and was taken to his cell unconscious thereafter. the applicants described as follows their conditions of detention at the tiraspol remand centre. the cells in which they had been held had been in the basement and had not had access to natural light. in the absence of ventilation and because of overcrowding it had been difficult to breathe. officer condrea submits that he was detained in the same cell as that in which mr ilie ilaşcu had been detained (for more details see ilaşcu and others v. moldova and russia [gc], no. during their detention the applicants did not have any daily exercise and were not given access to a shower; they could not receive parcels containing food from their relatives, they did not have bed linen and they were not allowed to be seen by doctors. after the applicants’ release the moldovan authorities initiated two sets of criminal proceedings concerning their unlawful detention and their alleged ill-treatment while in detention. however, several years later the investigation was discontinued. the applicants were also subjected to medical check-ups, which found no traces of violence on their bodies. only one applicant, stefan mangîr, was found to be suffering from the consequences of concussion.
the first applicant was born in 1976 and is serving a sentence of imprisonment in the sverdlovsk region. the second applicant was born in 1950 and lives in vladivostok. in july 2012 the first applicant’s employer, the prosecutor’s office of the primorskiy region, provided him with a flat and concluded a tenancy agreement with him. the second applicant was included in the agreement as a member of the first applicant’s family. in august 2012 the second applicant was classified as having a first‑degree disability. on 7 october 2014 the first applicant retired from the prosecutor’s office. on the same date he applied to the general prosecutor of the russian federation with a request for the transfer of the title to the flat in question to him. on 8 october 2014 criminal proceedings were initiated against the first applicant in respect of a suspected criminal offence. on the same date he was arrested and on 10 october 2014 he was detained pending investigation. on an unspecified date in 2016 the first applicant was released and placed under house arrest. on 25 november 2014 the first applicant received notice to vacate the flat by 5 december 2014. on 26 november 2014 the first applicant’s brother received notice to vacate the flat (the notice was addressed by the prosecutor’s office to the second applicant). the first applicant contested those claims. he submitted that it would be unlawful to evict him and his mother because he, as a retired prosecutor, had a right to acquire ownership of the flat in question. in addition, his mother was a retired person and had a first-degree disability. on 27 february 2015 the frunzenskiy district court (“the district court”) dismissed the eviction claims. on 8 june 2015 the regional court quashed the judgment of 27 february 2015 and delivered a new decision ordering the applicants’ eviction, with no alternative accommodation being provided. the first applicant was represented by a lawyer, k. the second applicant was not present and was not represented in those proceedings. in particular, the regional court found that the first applicant and his mother had been provided with a flat for the period of the first applicant’s service in the prosecutor’s office. under domestic law and the terms of the agreement, the tenants had had to vacate the housing after the termination of the agreement and in the event of their refusal they had had to be evicted with no alternative accommodation being provided. as at the date of the examination of the eviction claims the first applicant had not applied to the prosecutor general of the russian federation for title to the flat in question to be transferred to him; therefore, the district’s court conclusion as to the absence of any obstacles to the transfer of ownership of the flat in question to the first applicant was in conflict with the circumstances established in the case. he complained that the hearing of 8 june 2015 had been held in his absence and that as a result he had been evicted from the only accommodation he had had. on 22 july 2015 a judge of the regional court refused to refer the first applicant’s appeal to the civil chamber of the regional court for examination on the merits. the first applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the supreme court of the russian federation. on 22 september 2015 the second applicant was evicted from the flat. on 30 september 2015 a judge of the supreme court refused to refer the first applicant’s cassation appeal to the civil chamber of the supreme court for examination. in june 2015 the first applicant’s brother (mr d. pylayev) initiated court proceedings for the second applicant to be deprived of legal capacity and for him to be appointed as her guardian. in particular, the district court based its decision on an expert report dated 25 january 2016 which had established that she had been suffering from a mental handicap since 2010 and as a result had not been able to understand or control her actions. that judgment entered into force on 14 june 2016. on 29 june 2016 the local public health department appointed the first applicant’s brother as her guardian.
the applicant was born in 1991 and lives in orenburg. the facts of the applicant’s ill-treatment were established in a judgment of the promyshlenniy district court of orenburg of 15 december 2011, as upheld on 14 february 2012 by the orenburg regional court, and are as follows. at around 7 p.m. on 30 august 2009 the applicant was arrested at a bus stop by police officers of the criminal investigation unit and taken to a police station in orenburg (увд по г. from 8 p.m. to midnight on 30 august 2009, and from 12 noon to 6 p.m. on 31 august 2009, police officers k. and m. subjected the applicant to physical and psychological violence in order to obtain a confession from him about a drug-related crime which they suspected him of having committed. the facts of the ill-treatment on 30 august 2009 were established as follows. officers k. and m. pushed the applicant to the floor and punched and kicked him numerous times in the head, face, chest, arms and legs. k. placed a plastic bag over his head, closing off his access to air, while m. held him down. as regards the ill-treatment on 31 august 2009, officers k. and m. punched the applicant numerous times in the head and threatened to detain him. at 8 p.m. on 31 august 2009 the applicant was formally arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs and placed in a temporary detention facility. on 2 september 2009 the applicant was released after giving an undertaking not to leave his place of residence. on the same day he sought medical help at a traumatology centre (tp no. according to his medical records, he had abrasions on his forearms, a bruise under his right eye, a bruise in the left lumbar region and abrasions on his legs. on 3 september 2009 the applicant made a complaint to the orenburg regional investigative committee regarding his ill‑treatment. on 4 september 2009 he underwent a forensic medical examination ordered by the investigation authority. 6368, he had the following injuries: (i) a haematoma (swelling) of the soft tissues in the parietal region of the head, measuring 4 by 3 cm; (ii) four bruises of indefinite form on the right infraorbital region of the face, on his neck, on the left side of his chest and around the right iliac (hip) bone, measuring up to 4 by 3 cm each; and (iii) seventeen abrasions, some linear and some of indefinite form, on both forearms, his right hip and left lower leg, measuring from 0.8 by 0.5 cm to 2.5 by 1 cm each. the expert concluded that the applicant’s injuries had resulted from being struck repeatedly with a hard, blunt object with a limited surface area on the day of the alleged incident, and had not caused any “health damage”. subsequent forensic medical expert reports of 4 december 2009 and 21 october 2010 came to similar conclusions. it was stated in the first of those reports that the applicant’s injuries had been caused by at least twenty traumatic blows to his body. officers k. and m. were convicted under article 286 § 3 (a) of the criminal code and banned from exercising official duties for three years. they were also given a three-year suspended sentence with a three-year probation period, which required them to appear monthly before the service for the execution of sentences and disclose any change of place of work or residence. the following circumstances were taken into account in sentencing the police officers. the fact that officer k. had a child under 14 years old was considered a mitigating circumstance, while the fact that he and m. had committed the crime with a group of other officers was considered an aggravating circumstance. it was further taken into account that k. and m. had positive references from their places of work and residence, had no previous convictions, and had led a law-abiding way of life without committing any administrative offences for more than two years since the crime had been committed. on 31 november 2009 criminal proceedings against the applicant under article 228 § 2 of the criminal code (possession of large quantities of drugs) were terminated for absence of a crime, pursuant to article 24 § 1(2) of the code of criminal procedure. in 2012 the applicant brought a civil claim against the russian ministry of finance, seeking 2,655,936 russian roubles (rub) in compensation for his unlawful detention and ill‑treatment in police custody by k. and m. 16. on 28 june 2012 the leninskiy district court of orenburg allowed the applicant’s claim in part and awarded him rub 20,000. in determining the amount of compensation, the court found that the applicant had sustained injuries as a result of the police officers’ actions and had experienced physical and mental suffering, but that this had not caused him any “health damage”. the applicant appealed against that judgment to the orenburg regional court, which on 19 september 2012 increased the amount of compensation to rub 80,000.
the applicant was born in 1979 and before his conviction lived in izhevsk. no suspicions were raised against the applicant. he was allegedly beaten and coerced into confessing to having committed the murder and to signing a record of his surrender and confession (явка с повинной). according to that record, at 9.50 p.m. on 22 march 2005 in office no. 312 at izhevsk police station, a police officer, m., obtained from the applicant a confession to the crime, in accordance with article 142 of the code of criminal procedure of the russian federation. at an unspecified time after midnight he left s.’s flat. on his way home he entered a nearby house to urinate. there he saw a man who made a rude remark about the applicant’s behaviour. they began to fight, in the course of which the applicant hit the man several times on the head with a knife handle, and also punched and kicked him. when the applicant left the man was still lying on the ground floor. the record further stated that the confession had been handwritten by the applicant himself without any coercion on the part of police officers, and that the applicant had been informed of article 51 of the constitution (the right not to give self-incriminating statements), which he had understood. at 00.05 a.m. on 23 march 2005 a record of the applicant’s arrest was drawn up. the record further contains the applicant’s request for access to his lawyer. later on the same day, 23 march 2005, the applicant was provided with a legal-aid lawyer and questioned as a suspect. he consistently repudiated his confession throughout the ensuing proceedings. on 27 march 2005 the applicant was remanded in custody and transferred to the izhevsk sizo-1 remand prison. on 29 march 2005 charges of murder were brought against the applicant. on 22 april 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint with the ustinovskiy district prosecutor’s office of izhevsk, alleging that he had been ill-treated. on 25 july 2005 the criminal case against the applicant was submitted to the supreme court of the republic of udmurtiya for trial. on 22 august 2005 the trial against the applicant commenced. the court dismissed the applicant’s allegation that his confession had been obtained through ill-treatment, referring to the statements made by the police officers and to expert report no. 2672, which had not recorded any injuries on the applicant’s body. the applicant appealed against the conviction. in his statement of appeal he submitted, in particular, that his confession was inadmissible evidence, as it had been obtained under duress and in the absence of a lawyer. on 14 june 2006 the supreme court of russia dismissed the appeal. the supreme court held, in particular, that the law did not require the presence of a lawyer at the moment of giving a confession. on 19 august 2006 the applicant was transferred to the iz-16/2 remand centre of kazan with ankle-joint oedema, skin erosion and fever. on 30 august 2006 the applicant was transferred to the surgical unit of that facility for medical treatment. on 25 october 2006 the applicant was transferred to penal institution liu-19 of the republic of mordoviya (a medical penal establishment designed for the treatment and detention of drug addicts, alcoholics, and hiv- and tuberculosis-infected prisoners), where he underwent compulsory treatment for drug addiction until 21 november 2008. the applicant believed, therefore, that he had faced a serious risk of contamination via the working utensils (for example, scissors and sewing needles).
the applicant was born in 1980 and lives in kópavogur. at the material time he was a well-known personality in iceland who for years had published articles, blogs and books and appeared in films, on television and other media, under pseudonyms. some of the applicant’s published views attracted some attention, as well as controversy. these included, inter alia, his views about women and their sexual freedom. the applicant had often justified such conduct by stating that the material had been meant in jest and that those who criticised him lacked a sense of humour (see egill einarsson v. iceland, no. in november 2011, an 18-year-old woman reported to the police that the applicant and his girlfriend had raped her. in january 2012 another woman reported to the police that the applicant had committed a sexual offence against her a few years earlier. upon the completion of the police investigation the public prosecutor, on 15 june and 15 november 2012, dismissed the cases in accordance with article 145 of the act on criminal procedures, because the evidence which had been gathered was not sufficient or likely to lead to a conviction. the applicant submitted a complaint to the police about false accusations made against him by the two women. the applicant stated several times that the accusations were false. he accepted that, having placed himself in the media spotlight, he had to tolerate publicity which was not always “sunshine and lollipops” but criticised the way the media had covered his case. when asked about the girl’s age, he responded that the girl had been in a club where the minimum age had been 20 years and that it had been a shock to find out later that she had been only 18 years old. when asked about his complaints against the girl for allegedly wrongful accusations, he stated again that he was not seeking revenge against those who had reported him to the police, but that it was clear that they had had ulterior motives. on the same day a facebook page was set up for the purpose of protesting about the interview and encouraging the editor of monitor to remove the applicant’s picture from its front page. extensive dialogue took place on the site that day. later that day, x posted a comment on the above‑mentioned facebook page which stated, inter alia: “this is also not an attack on a man for saying something wrong, but for raping a teenage girl ... it is permissible to criticise the fact that rapists appear on the cover of publications which are distributed all over town ...”. by letter the following day, x’s lawyer opposed the applicant’s claims and submitted that the impugned statements were not defamatory. by a judgment of 1 november 2013, the district court found that x’s comment on facebook had been defamatory and declared the statements null and void. however, the court dismissed the applicant’s claim for the imposition on x of a criminal punishment under the penal code, as well as rejecting the claim to have x carry the cost of publishing the main content and reasoning of the judgment in a newspaper. furthermore, the district court did not award the applicant non-pecuniary damage and concluded, finally, that each party should bear its own legal costs. according to the aforementioned, it is clear that [x] made defamatory insinuations about [the applicant]. however, when assessing the damage suffered by [the applicant], it has to be taken into account how [the applicant] has built a certain reputation by his conduct in public. notwithstanding the extensive disputes about his comment made under the name of gillz, it cannot be seen that he took a clear stand against sexual violence until complaints against him materialised. nevertheless [the applicant] had full reason to clarify his situation in this respect, taking into account that material stemming from him is often very ambiguous and provocative, and could easily be interpreted as an incitement to this type of violence. additionally, the comments were removed from the website when [the applicant] so requested. lastly, it should be considered that by declaring the comments null and void, as this judgment concludes, [the applicant] has received full judicial satisfaction. furthermore, [the applicant’s] claim to have [x] carry the cost of publishing the main content and the reasoning of the judgment in a newspaper will not be accepted. by judgment of 18 december 2014 the majority of the supreme court (two out of three judges) upheld the district court’s decision to declare the statements null and void. furthermore, the supreme court upheld the district court’s decision not to award damages to the applicant and that each party should bear its legal costs. the dissenting judge agreed with the majority to declare the impugned statements null and void.
the applicants were born in 1956, 1952, 1975, and 1980 respectively. the first applicant lives in tivat and the second, third and fourth applicants live in kotor. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. they submitted, in particular, that the land at issue had been lawfully owned by their father, but that without any legal basis the state appeared as the registered owner thereof in the real estate registry, and that they should be declared owners as their father’s legal successors (kao pravni sledbenici). the municipality remained registered as the owner of one part of it, whereas the other part was registered in the name of the applicants’ predecessor (the father of the first and second applicants, and the grandfather of the third and fourth applicants). on 21 november 2011, after a remittal, the court of first instance (osnovni sud) in kotor ruled against the first and second applicants and the third and fourth applicants’ father. the court made no reference to section 30 of the coastal zone act (see paragraph 22 below). as regards the state’s submission that the land had been nationalised, the court noted that the contents of the decisions relied on by the state could not be clarified. notably, the state archive (državni arhiv) informed the court, on 4 october 2010 and 26 august 2011, that the case files and decisions dn 428/90 and dn 615/92, referred to by the state, had not been found in that institution. finally, the court considered that the real estate administration decision of 2 march 2010 (see paragraph 8 above) was “of no particular influence” (bez posebnog uticaja) given that it related to a different plot of land which was not the subject of these proceedings. they also submitted that: (a) section 30 of the coastal zone act had never been complied with even though it was indisputable that their predecessor had lawfully owned the land; and (b) the relevant legislation did not prohibit private ownership of land in the coastal zone, and referred to section 4 of the coastal zone act and section 20 of the property act 2009 (see paragraphs 21 and 19 below). they reiterated that the adjacent plot of land, also a forest in the coastal zone, was privately owned, by them, and submitted the decision of the real estate administration of 2 march 2010. it found that the land at issue was indisputably forest in the coastal zone, that it was state property pursuant to section 13 of the state property act and that the claimants therefore could not claim ownership. the court further held that even assuming that the claimants had had ownership of these plots of land, they had lost it “in accordance with the state property act and the coastal zone act. in support of this was also section 30 of the coastal zone act, relied upon by the claimants, which provided that the owners of land in the coastal zone, who had obtained it in a lawful manner before that act entered into force and which was duly registered in the real estate register as private property, were entitled to compensation in case of an expropriation”. on 11 october 2012 the supreme court (vrhovni sud) upheld the previous judgments. the court made no explicit reference to the adjacent plot of land and the decision of 2 march 2010. that means that the land did not remain in the private property regime, but became state property by the law itself. likewise, section 20(2) of the property act 2009 is inapplicable to the present case as it cannot be retroactively applied to relations which had arisen before it came into force. exceptionally, the right to property over a coastal zone can be acquired only after it entered into force.” on 25 december 2012 the first and second applicants and the third and fourth applicants’ father lodged a constitutional appeal. they submitted, inter alia, that it was not true that land in the coastal zone could not be privately owned, as numerous plots of land in that zone were private property, including the plot of land adjacent to the one at issue, which was owned by them. they invoked the right to a fair trial and the right to property, and reiterated the importance of legal certainty. on 23 july 2014 the constitutional court dismissed the constitutional appeal. it held that the lower courts’ assessment “was based on a correct application of substantive law and a constitutionally acceptable interpretation thereof, in accordance with article 6 of the convention”. 1 the court held that a claim which had been dismissed because the claimants did not meet statutory conditions was not considered a possession that could constitute property rights, and thus there could be no violation of such a right either. this decision was served on 13 october 2014 at the earliest. on 16 december 2014 the third and fourth applicants’ father died, leaving the third and fourth applicants as his heirs. it found, inter alia, that section 20(2) of the property act provided that exceptionally coastal zone can be privately owned, while at the same time section 22(3) of the same act provided that the coast cannot be privately owned. it can also be concluded that the issue of lawfully acquired rights in respect of the coastal zone is not regulated in a precise and clear manner...”, but that it was a fact that there were lawfully acquired property rights over the coastal zone, as indicated by section 30 of the coastal zone act.

the first applicant is the mother of the second applicant and of ms anna politkovskaya, who was born in 1958 and died in 2006. a makarov pistol with a silencer and bullet cartridges were found on the stairs. on the same date a death certificate was issued. they also questioned ms politkovskaya’s colleagues, friends and family as witnesses. on 27 august 2007 the prosecutor general of russia stated at a press conference that there had been serious progress in the investigation of ms politkovskaya’s killing, and that ten people had been arrested in connection with the investigation. on 29 august 2007 a press officer of the moscow city court (“the city court”) disclosed to the public a list of ten people detained in connection with anna politkovskaya’s assassination. in the course of august 2007 four people, d.m., later, the investigation established that fibres found in their car were identical to those left on the murder weapon. were formally charged with contract killing in conspiracy with others. was regarded as the leader of the organised criminal group. whom the investigation suspected to be implicated in the assassination, fled russia on a forged passport. in june 2008 the investigators prepared a case against s.kh., the applicants requested that the case file remain with the investigators. a high‑ranking officer of the moscow city department of the interior, was questioned as a witness for the prosecution. on 20 february 2009 the circuit court acquitted s.kh., on 5 august 2009 the third and fourth applicants requested that the circuit court remit the case to the prosecutor’s office for further investigation. on unspecified dates the charges against p.r. who had spent some time hiding in belgium, was arrested in the chechen republic. according to the government, the investigator in charge of the case attempted to find o.g., on 26 august 2011 the basmannyy district court of moscow (“the district court”) ordered d.p. on 29 august 2012 the criminal case against d.p. was severed and a separate investigation was created; the applicants disagreed with that decision. was transferred to the city court for trial. on 29 may 2014 the jury delivered a verdict finding all five co‑accused guilty of anna politkovskaya’s murder. on 9 june 2014 the city court delivered a judgment. regarded as the hitman – to life imprisonment. were sentenced to fourteen and twelve years’ imprisonment respectively. was sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment. respectively, rub 500,000 (approximately eur 10,570) to be paid by s.kh., the defendants appealed against the conviction.
the applicants were born in 1964 and 1973 respectively and are detained in corradino correctional facility, paola, malta. the first applicant is a venezuelan national who has been detained in corradino correctional facility, paola, since september 2009. he is serving a ten‑year prison sentence following a judgment of 21 march 2012. the first applicant submitted that his cell has one window and one air vent. the latter is clogged with dirt and debris and his cell window is positioned too high up, meaning that he therefore has to climb onto the sink to open or close it. he stated that the cell does not have adequate ventilation and it is subject to high temperatures in the summer and low temperatures in the winter. he alleged that he had not been provided with a heater during the winter and that his requests to this effect had been turned down. the prison authorities had provided him only with one blanket, other blankets and clothes having been received from ngos. in the summer, when the temperature ranges between 35 and 40 degrees celsius, the two fans purchased by the first applicant do not suffice as they merely circulate hot air, which is made worse in the absence of proper ventilation. he also claimed that he has to use a bucket to flush his toilet. given the low water pressure, it takes time to fill a bucket and sometimes more than one bucket is necessary to flush the toilet, making the situation deplorable, especially in the summer. as the building housing the division is more than 150 years old, the ceiling releases dust, which is allegedly harmful to the first applicant’s lungs. the first applicant submitted that he does not have access to drinking water, since the tap water is rusty and filthy, and he therefore has to purchase drinking water. however, his job in prison pays only 0.60 euro (eur) cents per day and in the summer he drinks three six packs of water a week, at considerable cost. the government submitted that the first applicant received eur 34.77 every four weeks in so‑called “gratuity” remuneration and from the “work and pay” scheme, with which he had been involved since 2015. they stated that at the tuck shop a six‑pack of water cost eur 2.24 and an individual bottle eur 0.38. he is serving a nine-year prison sentence following a judgment of 15 october 2012. since 27 january 2012 he has been detained in division 3, cell no. 155 (with the exception of one day ‑ 3 october 2015 ‑ spent in division 6). according to the government, following communication of the complaint, the second applicant was asked whether he wanted to be transferred to another division and replied in the negative. the second applicant submitted that his cell window is at a height of more than two metres and it is very difficult to open without endangering one’s life. its metal protective bars make it difficult for the cell to admit any natural light. although there are two openings for the purposes of ventilation, one of them is blocked and there is therefore not sufficient ventilation. the second applicant alleged that the water is not drinkable; he therefore has to purchase it. they noted that the second applicant had never asked for materials to paint his cell. the second applicant also submitted that because of the humidity in his cell and the fact that he does not have a heater, he frequently catches the flu during the winter months. the government submitted that the cell was humid because the second applicant had blocked his vent with a towel and did not undertake any maintenance of his cell. the government noted that the second applicant had a ceiling light and another wall‑mounted light, as well a portable lamp which he had acquired. natural light came in through three skylights and artificial light was provided through bell lamps of 400w each. in this connection the government submitted that other options were available should an emergency arise, such as the use of the walkway between the divisions.
the applicants were born in 1937, 1934 and 1941 respectively. the first and third applicants live in sofia. the applicants’ fathers owned printing houses in sofia, which were nationalised by the communist authorities in 1949 and 1950. after that their assets were taken over by a state-owned printing house. the company is managed by the minister of education. among the tasks of the company is the printing of school textbooks. in 1997 parliament adopted the compensation of owners of nationalised real property act (hereinafter “the compensation act” – see paragraph 23 below). in march 1998 the first and second applicants and their mother applied under the compensation act to receive compensation for the nationalised printing house. as to the manner of compensation, they expressed preference to receive shares in ‘obrazovanie i nauka’ ead. in a decision of 14 june 1999 the minister of education allowed their request, stating that the exact number of shares to be awarded would be determined after a valuation of the assets of the former printing house. despite that, in another decision dated 3 july 2000 the minister rejected the request for compensation. that decision was quashed by the supreme administrative court in a final judgment of 24 june 2002, on the ground that it impermissibly modified the previous one, which had become final. after that an expert prepared a valuation of the nationalised property, which was confirmed by the minister of education on 5 june 2003. it stated that the first and second applicants and their mother were entitled to compensation for 57,932 bulgarian levs (bgn, equivalent of 29,630 euros (eur)), which equalled 579 shares in ‘obrazovanie i nauka’ ead, each with a face value of bgn 100 (eur 51). however, on 26 august 2003 the minister adopted another decision, stating that the applicants and their mother were to receive compensation bonds instead of shares. once again, that decision was quashed by the supreme administrative court, in a final judgment of 18 october 2004, as it impermissibly modified the previous decisions awarding the first and second applicants and their mother compensation in the form of shares, which had become final. the domestic court held in particular that section 11 of the concluding provisions mentioned above could not justify such a modification. in 2006 the first and second applicants and their mother filed with the minister of education and other state bodies several complaints, requesting that the compensation procedure be completed. in a letter dated 7 april 2006 the council of ministers (government) informed them that the ministry of education was seeking “a lawful solution”, which “would not infringe upon the public interest and would not be in breach of the [privatisation act]”. the first and second applicants’ mother passed away in 2007 and was succeeded by them. their request was allowed by the minister of education in a decision of 22 december 1998. in 1999, 2001 and 2003 an expert drew up three valuations of the expropriated property. despite the above developments, in another decision dated 26 august 2003 the minister stated that the third applicant, her mother and her sister were to receive compensation bonds instead of shares. as in the procedure described above concerning the first and second applicants, he relied on the fact that the company had been included in the list under section 11 of the concluding provisions of the privatisation act (see paragraph 24 below). the third applicant’s mother and sister passed away in 2006 and 2004 respectively, leaving the third applicant her father’s only surviving heir. in 2007 the ministry of education requested the privatisation agency to authorise the transfer to private parties of shares in ‘obrazovanie i nauka’ ead. the authorisation, related to the claims of all applicants, was given on 23 april 2008. the ministry took no further measures to complete the compensation procedures. in 2011 the third applicant wrote a letter to the executive director of ‘obrazovanie i nauka’ ead, urging him to enter into the company register her shareholding and to present to her copies of all decisions taken by the company’s general meeting after 2003. the applicants applied for the judicial review of that decision, arguing that it affected their rights as shareholders.
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in skopje. at the time of the events he was vice-president of the sdsm opposition party and a member of parliament. on 14 december 2007 the applicant held a press conference that was broadcast by the main news programme of the a1 television channel, which had national coverage and was the most popular channel at the time. had paid taxes on his property, which had been assessed as being worth several million euros (eur). ’s reply, denying the allegations and stating that the money in question had been transferred to the respondent state from a foreign bank account. the transcript of the broadcast was published on the channel’s website on the same day under the headline: “sdsm: m. has wrongfully used wiretapping equipment”. ’s assets and that the ministry of the interior had requested that it submit any evidence in support of its allegations. the applicant did not submit any comments in reply. submitted half a year ago, in which he specified that he possessed shares valued at eur 300,000. in the concluding remarks, the applicant’s lawyer stated that the applicant had made the impugned statement in an interrogatory form and as the vice-president of an opposition political party, which had the role of expressing concerns about and assessing the work of state officials. on 3 november 2009 the trial court, sitting as a single-judge (judge v.m.), consequently, a victim is not required to prove that a defamatory statement is false, rather the accused is obliged to prove (the veracity of) what was said ...
... based on the audio and video material to hand the court finds that [the applicant] made statements about [mr s.m.] in a form capable of persuading an ordinary viewer ... that they are truthful ...
... the court does not deny that questions can be put to and answers sought from state officials ... it is true that every person, including a member of a political party, as is [the applicant], has the right to put questions of public interest, to criticise the work of the government and to express concerns about someone who holds the highest office in the executive. given) the manner in which the applicant expressed his allegations and other circumstances, the court has found that the [applicant’s] allegations are false and (represent) an assertion made in an interrogatory form, which have had a considerable effect on the claimant’s reputation and dignity. such a status does not entitle him to express or disseminate untruthful allegations which are detrimental to the reputation and dignity of a third party. on 11 may 2010 the skopje court of appeal, sitting as a three-judge panel composed of judges m.s., in that connection, it referred to article 172 of the criminal code, which punished the dissemination of untrue information that could affect the reputation and dignity of a third party. accordingly, the statement lost the attributes of the freedom (of thought and public expression of thought) and (represents) an abuse of (that freedom).” the claim was examined at three levels of jurisdiction. it was broadcast on local television news. as described in the trial court’s judgment (see below), the applicant stated that:
“the attractive location behind the ‘ramstor’ shopping mall planned for the construction of a hotel was granted to a company supported (зад која стои) by o. holding ... after the revelation of this megascandal, the biggest dilemma is whether the academy award for the most corrupt politician should be given to the prime minister or his cousins? in reply to a request for information, sdsm notified the public prosecutor on 1 october 2007 about the company that had been selected (it was registered at the same address as o. holding and its manager was a former o. holding employee), alleging that it had not met the requirements of the sale. he had also not signed the sale contract with the company that had been chosen. the trial court scheduled seventeen hearings. and viewed audio and video material of television coverage of the applicant’s statement. it fined him eur 1,000 with one hundred days’ imprisonment in default, ordered him to pay a court fee of eur 30 and a further eur 375 to cover mr s.m. was privately involved in the sale transaction in question ...” 27. the burden of proof therefore rests with the accused to prove that the assertion is true. on 12 february 2013 the trial court stayed the execution of the fine it had imposed (see paragraph 36 below). the court did not accept the applicant’s defence (he did not attend any of the scheduled hearings) that his statement had been an expression of a reasonable suspicion about the public sale of the land.

the applicant was born in 1982 and lives in warsaw. on 29 november 2012 the warsaw-wola district court (sąd rejonowy) ordered the applicant’s detention on remand on suspicion of drug dealing, as well as facilitating and benefiting from prostitution, committed in an organised criminal group. the domestic court relied on a strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences in question, on the fact that he faced a severe penalty and that he was suspected of acting with accomplices. the likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences in question was established, in particular, on the basis of the testimony of a key prosecution witness (the so-called “crown witness”). on 8 january 2013 the warsaw regional court (sąd okręgowy) dismissed the applicant’s appeal against this decision. it stressed that the sole fact that the applicant faced a severe penalty and had been suspected of committing offences in an organised criminal group justified a suspicion that, if released, the applicant would try to obstruct the proceedings by influencing witnesses or his accomplices. in these decisions, the court repeated the reasons originally relied on. in its decision of 21 february 2013, the warsaw regional court further noted that the case against the applicant was complex, and indicated a number of steps that still had to be taken in order to terminate the investigation. the court noted that not all of those steps required the applicant’s detention and urged the prosecutor to accelerate the proceedings. the applicant appealed against all these decisions, without success. on 21 november 2013 the warsaw court of appeal (sąd apelacyjny) ordered a further extension of the applicant’s detention on remand. it relied on the same grounds as previously given for his detention. the decision was upheld on appeal on 12 december 2013. the bill of indictment against the applicant was lodged with the warsaw regional court on 30 december 2013. the charges included facilitating prostitution by renting an apartment to prostitutes and collecting money from them, and a number of counts of drug possession and distribution. the bill of indictment concerned altogether seventeen accused, charged with 150 offences. later, the number of accused in the proceedings dropped to fourteen. the prosecutor requested that the court hear over 90 witnesses, including five “crown witnesses”. subsequently, the applicant’s detention pending trial was extended by the warsaw regional court’s decisions of 10 january and 7 may 2014 and by the warsaw court of appeal’s decisions of 30 december 2014, 28 april, 27 august and 26 november 2015, and of 25 february and 25 may 2016. the domestic courts continued to rely on the same grounds for detention as in their previous decisions. they also stressed the complexity of the case and the links between the co-accused within an organised criminal group which, according to the domestic courts, justified a suspicion that, if released, they would attempt to obstruct the proper course of the proceedings. the appeals by the applicant against decisions extending his detention and all his applications for release were unsuccessful. on 9 may 2016 the trial court ordered the applicant’s release on bail for 80,000 polish zlotys (pln) (approximately 20,000 euros (eur)). the applicant appealed against this decision, contesting the amount of bail as excessive. it underlined that the amount of bail had to take into consideration not only the financial situation of the applicant, but also the gravity of the charges against him. it indicated that the amount in question had to be such that the prospect of its loss would constitute a genuine deterrent against any illegal activities which, until that moment, had been prevented by the applicant’s detention. on 30 may 2016 the warsaw regional court again ordered the applicant’s release on bail of pln 80,000. it also imposed a prohibition on leaving the country. the applicant paid the security required by the court and was released on 31 may 2016. the case against the applicant and his co-accused appears to be pending before the warsaw regional court (no.
the applicant was born in 1958 and lives in yerevan. she suffers from cardiac problems, including a heart rhythm disorder. in particular, they assaulted her, grabbed her hands, insulted her and forcibly took a document concerning her which she had taken in to them in order to write down her objections. on 12 january 2012 the applicant filed a written report with the head of staff of the ministry, giving a detailed account of what had happened. using physical violence and personal insults, he had tried to take the papers from her. the two of them had grabbed her hands, causing her serious pain, and forcibly taken away the papers. she had suffered injuries, health problems and serious distress. after the incident, the applicant felt unwell and underwent a medical examination. on 14 january 2012 the applicant reported the incident to the police, stating that on 10 january 2012 she and h.a., asking him to come to see him with the other employees. he denied harassing the applicant either physically or verbally and said that she had used foul language. made a statement and similarly denied using violence against the applicant. on 18 january 2012 the forensic medical examination was completed. conclusion: [the applicant’s] bodily injuries in the form of ecchymoses [around] the right and left upper arms and the left forearm have been inflicted with blunt, hard objects possibly in the period mentioned; [the injuries] taken separately as well as all together do not contain elements of [short-term] damage to health.” she stated that she had no objections to the opinion of the forensic medical expert and intended to pursue her complaint. on 25 january 2012 the investigator took another additional statement from the applicant. said that but it is logical that they would deny committing such acts. are continuing this kind of behaviour, abusing their official capacity, in the circumstances i am unable to reconcile with them. i also wish to add that because of their actions i have had health problems and as a result have been on sick leave from 13 to 27 january ...” 18. he had never harassed her or grabbed her hands and had remained seated in his chair until she had left. stated that he had never touched her and did not know how they had been inflicted. and was calling for them to be prosecuted. on the grounds that no crime had been committed. she further complained that, as a result of deliberate violence on the part of h.a. in addition, the applicant stated that the incident had taken place in the workplace and naturally all the witnesses questioned by the investigator were the subordinates of h.a. on 4 april 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint with the kentron and nork-marash district court (hereinafter “the district court”), requesting that criminal proceedings be instituted. in the end, it had never been established who had inflicted her injuries. if criminal proceedings were instituted, they would have the procedural status of witnesses and would be warned about criminal liability for making false statements. on 18 may 2012 the district court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. she also reiterated her arguments in relation to the refusal to institute criminal proceedings and the unreliability of the statements made by her colleagues.
the applicant organisation is a public notary professional association and has its main office in bucharest. they informed a receptionist that they were clients. the receptionist asked them to leave the premises and to wait outside, but they refused. one of the private parties in question was suspected by the police of being part of an organised criminal group involved in immovable property fraud. the police officers also seized a number of documents, including the sale contract and original documents concerning the aforementioned private parties. moreover, the police officers seized the fees and taxes that had been paid by the private parties for the services rendered by the applicant organisation. furthermore, the police officers took statements from the applicant organisation’s employees. on 23 april 2008 the applicant organisation, legally represented by d.o.r., moreover, according to the available evidence, an official order from the prosecutor would in any case not have been necessary in this regard because the seized documents and sums of money had been turned over to the officers without any objections. a large number of police officers had been mobilised for an operation aimed at catching the suspects red‑handed. the two police officers had entered the premises of the applicant organisation, disclosed their identity and the fact that they were police officers, and proceeded to seize the relevant documents and fees. consequently, the police officers had acted in their professional capacity in order to fulfil their professional duties and with the aim of investigating cases they had been working on. their presence on the applicant organisation’s premises had not amounted to the offence of unlawful home intrusion because the premises of the applicant organisation constituted by their nature a public area and the event in question had occurred during working hours. moreover, the elements of the offence of abuse of office against private interests had not been met. consequently, no damage had been caused given that the valuables seized by the officers had concerned the commission of offences. on 31 august 2009 the superior prosecutor dismissed the applicant organisation’s challenge as ill-founded. on 21 september 2009 the applicant organisation lodged an appeal against the prosecutor office’s decisions with the bucharest court of appeal. it considered that the two police officers, accompanied by other colleagues, had carried out an operational mission seeking to catch suspects red-handed in the commission of an offence and to gather evidence. to turn over all the documents and sums of money connected to the sale. they could have protected the victims’ property by taking property preservation measures only after establishing that an offence had been committed. moreover, the domestic rules concerning professional secrecy applicable to employees of a public notary’s office had not prevented them from providing relevant information or from allowing access to documents to anyone proving a legitimate right or interest, such as police officers exercising their professional duty. the operation had not concerned the commission of an offence, as the sale contract validated by the applicant organisation had not been a forged one. also, the first-instance court’s finding that the applicant organisation could have vented its discontent with the unlawful seizure of its fees by the police officers by means of a complaint against the acts and measures taken by the police officers (rather than by means of a criminal complaint lodged against the perpetrators – see paragraph 22 above) had amounted to a breach of its right of access to court. furthermore, any natural and legal person had a duty to turn over impugned evidence. in addition, it stated that if the prosecutor’s office refused to order the return of the relevant fees the applicant organisation would join the criminal proceedings opened against the criminal group as a civil party. on 8 july 2010 the bucharest prosecutor’s office informed the applicant organisation that the criminal case in question had been referred to the domestic courts which had the authority to examine its requests. on 3 august 2010 the applicant organisation informed the bucharest county court that it had joined as a civil party the criminal proceedings opened by the domestic authorities against the organised criminal group allegedly involved in immovable property fraud. moreover, the applicant organisation had not proved that it had suffered non-pecuniary damage. the applicant organisation appealed against the judgment. on 17 november 2011 the bucharest court of appeal dismissed the applicant organisation’s appeal.
the applicant was born in 1973 and lives in mykolayiv. on 21 march 2007 their daughter s. was born. on 15 april 2009 the leninsky district court of mykolayiv, in response to an application from o., pronounced the couple’s divorce. it ordered that the applicant should be granted an opportunity to see his daughter no less than three times a week, including overnight stays with the applicant, the dates and times thereof to be fixed by mutual agreement in advance. on 13 july 2009 the local police examined the applicant’s complaint concerning threats which o. regularly made when the applicant went to see the child, as well as o.’s refusal to let the child stay overnight with him and her restriction on the amount of time which the applicant could spend with the child. the police refused to open criminal proceedings because of the absence of the constituent elements of a criminal offence. in the autumn of 2009 o. and s. moved to selydove in the donetsk region. the distance between mykolayiv and selydove is about 600 kilometres by road. that claim was dismissed as unfounded by the courts with the final decision being taken by the higher specialised court on civil and criminal matters (“the hscu”) on 1 august 2011. on 20 october 2011 when the applicant arrived in selydove and attempted to collect the child from the childcare centre, o. arrived and took back the child. on 28 march 2012 the applicant submitted to the selydove state bailiff’s service a writ of execution of judgment dated 4 june 2009. on 29 march 2012 the state bailiff opened the enforcement proceedings. the final decision was taken by the hscu, which on 3 august 2012 dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law. on 20 november 2012 in proceedings concerning child support allowances, the applicant admitted that he took the child to mykolayiv to live with him for about one or two months per year. the courts dismissed the claim for lack of proof. the applicant challenged that decision in the court. however, on 8 december 2015 the donetsk regional court of appeal partly allowed the applicant’s claim. on 26 may 2016 the selydove department of state bailiffs’ service opened enforcement proceedings in relation to the judgment of 8 december 2015. on 10 june 2016 the bailiffs notified o. about the judgment of 8 december 2015. in spring 2014 illegal armed groups associated with two self‑proclaimed entities known as the “donetsk people’s republic” and the “luhansk people’s republic” started operating in the donetsk and luhansk regions, seizing control of certain parts of those regions by force. ukrainian government forces launched a military anti-terrorist operation against them. according to information provided by the government, in april 2014 certain movements of illegal armed groups had been registered in selydovo, but no active military operations had ever taken place in that area. in august 2014 the applicant lodged a claim with the selydove court seeking a declaration that o. was unlawfully failing to cooperate in executing the judgment of 4 june 2009 granting the applicant access rights. he argued that o. was unemployed and had no source of independent income, and that the child was fully dependent on the child support payments which the applicant was duly making. he also argued that it was dangerous for the child to continue to reside in the proximity of a theatre of armed conflict. the court established that the applicant was employed and had good references from his employer, and had no recorded mental health or addiction problems. however, the applicant had failed to prove that o. had no independent income or had failed to perform her parental duties or was engaged in unlawful or immoral conduct. on 4 august 2015 the donetsk regional court of appeal upheld the selydove court’s judgment, finding that the applicant had failed to substantiate the allegations that the child’s place of residence should be changed. it stated that the selydove town court had correctly established the relevant facts and had properly applied the law. the hscu agreed with the lower courts’ conclusion that separating the child from the mother had not been justified.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in naberezhnyye chelny. on 1 november 2004 he was arrested on suspicion of having extracted a bribe. on 10 november 2005 the supreme court of the tatarstan republic convicted the applicant and sentenced him to imprisonment. he stayed under the obligation not to leave his place of residence in naberezhnyye chelny until the conviction became final. he could leave his place of residence only upon the summons from the investigator or the court. several parties to the criminal proceedings, including the applicant, appealed against the conviction. the case was forwarded to the russian supreme court in moscow, 1,000 km away from naberezhnyye chelny. the applicant never received any summons to the appeal hearing due to the supreme court’s mistake in the postal code. neither did he receive copies of the statements of appeal filed by the prosecutor, by the co-accused, g., and the latter’s lawyer. on 28 february 2006 the conviction was upheld by the russian supreme court. the prosecutor and g.’s lawyer attended the appeal hearing. neither the applicant nor his lawyer was present. in 2011 the applicant lodged a compensation claim for non-pecuniary damages caused by poor conditions of detention. in the text of his claim the applicant explicitly asked the court to consider the claim in his absence. on 14 april 2011 the bugulminskiy town court of the tatarstan republic dismissed his claim. the applicant received the notification of the time and date of the hearing after the hearing had actually taken place. the first-instance judgment was upheld on 4 july 2011 by the supreme court of the tatarstan republic. the applicant had been notified of that hearing on 29 june 2011.
the applicant was born in 1966 and is detained. on 3 may 2010 the arnsberg regional court opened the main proceedings against the applicant. who was also summoned to appear on that date, informed the court that she did not wish to give evidence. he then beat her on different parts of her body and kicked her. refused, he delivered several blows all over her body, including her head and face, and also beat her with a wooden hiking pole. the following evening the applicant asked her again to write the letter and delivered blows with his fist, primarily to her head. he then beat her with a thin rope on her back, before forcing her to carry out sexual acts on herself. he then stubbed out a cigarette on her left breast. the applicant then choked her so that she could not breathe. they reported the number plate of the car to ke. [ a towel, which she put on the back of her head, from where she was visibly bleeding. a few minutes later two police officers, ra. she had described the events of between 31 july and 2 august 2009 as several acts of torment stretched out over the whole weekend with some breaks in between. n., the women’s shelter’s counsellor, testified that she had received a copy of the police report and had discussed the report and the events with r.k. ’s statements had been consistent with the police report. s., a witness, said that he had been at a local sports meeting with another witness, ke., had then given the registration number to s., who passed it on to the police. he had then led the police to the house of the m. family. when the door had opened, he had seen r.k. sitting on the stairs, with a bloody cloth pressed on her head. a witness, testified that s. had rung her door bell on 2 august 2009. s. had told her that he had had to call the police as it had seemed that the applicant had harmed his wife. she had told that to s., who had asked her to spell out the car’s number plate, which she had done. in shock, pressing a cloth to the back of her head. stated that she wanted to clear up her life and that adultery was a sin, was read out before the regional court. ’s letter of 26 september 2009, in which she had described examples of acts committed by the applicant from 31 july 2009 onwards, reporting the assaults, humiliations and sexual acts to which she had submitted for fear of receiving even more blows (see paragraph 29 above). he argued that evidence obtained in breach of the right of confrontation enshrined in article 6 § 3 (d) of the convention must never be admitted, regardless of its importance. in a written submission of 8 november 2010 the federal public prosecutor general argued that the examination of the investigating judge, resulting in the use of the untested evidence given by r.k., it had been unlawful to admit her testimony, as reported by the investigating judge, as evidence and to use it to convict him. it was not sufficient to take the violation of his right of confrontation into consideration as part of the evidentiary assessment by attaching less evidentiary value to the untested testimony and by requiring that it be corroborated by other significant pieces of evidence.
the applicant was born in 1938 and lives in tbilisi. on 10 september 2003 the applicant was dismissed from a printing company. he brought proceedings against his employer. the preparatory hearing was attended both by the applicant and his lawyer. he requested that the hearing be adjourned. the district court held the hearing on 28 january 2004 as planned. the applicant appeared and submitted that, as he was not a lawyer, he would be unable to argue his case in the absence of his representative. he requested that the hearing be adjourned so that he could be represented by his lawyer. counsel for the opposing party objected to the request and asked the first-instance court to issue a default judgment against the applicant. the applicant, however, repeated that he would be unable to present his case without his lawyer. the decision stated in its operative part that an application to set aside the judgment could be made to the same court within ten days. the applicant’s lawyer filed an application to set aside the judgment, enclosing a letter from the supreme court dated 5 february 2004 confirming that he had participated in the hearing of an appeal on points of law at 3 p.m. on 28 january 2004. on 19 march 2004 the same district court judge confirmed his own decision of 28 january 2004. when he had appeared before the court, the applicant had stated that he objected to the examination of the case without his lawyer present and had refused to take part in the hearing. the applicant appealed against the decision of 19 march 2004. on 16 july 2004 the tbilisi regional court (“the regional court”) found that, in breach of article 72(z) of the ccp, the applicant and his lawyer had not been properly warned of the consequences of not appearing before the court. the regional court considered that, as the applicant was not a lawyer, he could not have known that a decision in absentia would necessarily be to his detriment. therefore, as the caution provided for in articles 70 to 78 had not been issued in the present case, the regional court held that there were grounds, under articles 233 and 241 of the ccp, for setting aside the decision of 19 march 2004. the applicant’s appeal was thus remitted to the district court for re-examination. the applicant’s former employer lodged an appeal on points of law against the appeal judgment. there had therefore been no violation of article 72(z) of the ccp. the supreme court also found that, according to the record of the hearing of 28 january 2004, the judge had warned the applicant that “in the event of a refusal to take part in the hearing, a decision [would] be given in absentia”. the applicant had therefore been sufficiently informed of the consequences of his conduct. lastly, the supreme court pointed out that a court could give a decision in absentia if a lawyer or a party failed to appear at a hearing, on condition that the party had been summoned in accordance with the rules set out in articles 70 to 78 of the ccp. consequently, the supreme court set aside the regional court’s judgment of 16 july 2004 and remitted the case. according to the regional court, this meant that any refusal to take part in the hearing was unjustified. it therefore upheld the decision of 19 march 2004. thus, this argument could not have served as a valid basis for a re-examination of the case in accordance with article 241 of the ccp. it emphasised in this connection that the refusal to participate equated to a failure to appear in terms of its legal consequences. no appeal lay against the above decision of the supreme court.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in köthel. in 2004 the applicant began a relationship with x, a married woman who continued to live with her husband, with whom she had six children. in early 2006, x became pregnant and disclosed this to the applicant. in october 2006, she gave birth to a girl. shortly after, the relationship with the applicant ended. 20578/07, 21 december 2010) delivered on the same day. in addition, he made a sworn declaration that he had had sexual intercourse with x around the time of conception. on 9 may 2011 the family court dismissed the applicant’s request. 17080/07, 15 september 2011) and requested contact with the child at least once a month, initially under supervision. he had learned of his wife’s pregnancy in february 2006 and concluded that he was the father. at that moment, the mother had felt relieved that the time of secrets was over. this moment had been a breakthrough for them as a couple and their relationship had improved subsequently. even assuming that the applicant were the child’s father, he would not agree to any contact because the applicant had caused them much suffering and had to bear the consequences of his behaviour. on 17 august 2012 the applicant requested the court of appeal to mandate an expert opinion on the question of whether contact would be detrimental to the child or would at least serve her best interest; to hold an oral hearing where the guardian ad litem should explain her written statement; to conduct a paternity test and to hear the child. the child’s guardian ad litem opposed this. on 21 november 2012 the applicant commented on the child’s hearing, submitted a private expert opinion and requested the court of appeal to mandate an expert opinion regarding contact rights and to appoint a new guardian ad litem. (b)  the decision of the court of appeal 20. on 13 december 2012 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s requests. the child was living in a well-organised and emotionally stable family unit consisting of a father, a mother and other children. the court of appeal pointed out that it was convinced that this family union would be destroyed if the applicant’s paternity were established and contact rights ordered. there were no indications that the latter did not assume his role as a father towards the child or assumed it differently than towards his other children. the child was well-integrated in the family, where she felt protected and secure. in spite of these doubts, and the long-lasting court proceedings, he did not put in question his wife’s statements. the couple’s separation would amount to the breaking-up of the child’s family unit and the loss of her relationships, which would endanger her well-being. this might evolve once the child started to ask questions, but for now it was not in her best interest to be confronted with the paternity issue. due to the highly emotional conflicts between the legal parents and the applicant, and the fact that the applicant had not ruled out that he might tell the child that he was her biological father if he saw her, contact would jeopardise the child’s well-being. as regards the applicant’s request for information the court of appeal held as follows:
“the applicant’s request for information, claimed in the alternative in his lawyer’s submissions of 21 november 2012, does not exist. such claim cannot be based on article 1686, 1st sentence, of the civil code because the applicant is not, as required by this provision, the child’s legal father. it enquired of the applicant whether, under these circumstances, he would withdraw his constitutional complaint. on 13 august 2013 the applicant replied that he would maintain his complaint because, even under the new law, he would not have obtained a more favourable decision.
the applicant was born in 1982 and lives in cadiz. the district court had, at the applicant’s request, authorised mr arif – at that time still a law student – to act as defence counsel under article 138 § 2 of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 19 below). the applicant and the public prosecutor lodged appeals. the prosecutor’s appeal was directed merely against the sentencing. thereafter, the applicant moved to spain to work as a chef in a hotel and communicated his new address to the court. this decision was served on the applicant in spain. it decided to serve the summons on the applicant via public notification because the applicant had moved abroad. the summons was displayed on the court’s noticeboard from 27 april until 12 may 2009. he applied by fax for the hearing to be adjourned, citing the fact that he was going to be out of town the next day. the presiding judge ordered that a copy of that appeal and of the decision to serve the summons of the applicant by public notification be sent to the applicant’s lawyer. this proved impossible, as the lawyer’s fax machine had no receiving function. on 13 may 2009 the regional court refused, in a separate decision, an application lodged by the applicant’s lawyer for the appeal hearing to be adjourned. simultaneously, the regional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal without an assessment of the merits, in accordance with article 329 of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 19 below), because he had not appeared at the appeal hearing (without any sufficient excuse, and despite having been summoned), nor had he been represented by a lawyer in a permissible manner. it found that the requirements for the serving of a summons by means of public notification, as set out in article 40 §§ 2 and 3 of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 19 below), had been met. on 15 april 2010 the court of appeal upheld that decision. the summons to attend the hearing before the district court had been served on the applicant’s previous address in germany and he had lodged the appeal in question. as a result of his move to spain it had not been possible to serve the summons at his previous address in hamburg. it had thus been acceptable for the summons to be served by public notification. there had been neither an obligation to undertake an attempt to serve the summons at the applicant’s new address abroad prior to serving it via public notification nor one to notify him at that address that the summons had been served by public notification. on 16 july 2010 the court of appeal rejected an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant against the regional court’s judgment of 13 may 2009 as ill-founded, finding that the review of the regional court’s judgment had not revealed any legal errors that had been detrimental to the applicant. on 16 november 2010 the federal constitutional court declined to consider a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant, without providing reasons (no. the decision was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 10 december 2010. following communication of the case and unsuccessful friendly settlement negotiations, on 8 july 2016 the government informed the court of their intention to resolve the issue raised by the application. by a letter to the court of 30 august 2016 the applicant indicated that he was not satisfied with the terms of the unilateral declaration. the aim he pursued with the present application was a reopening of the criminal proceedings against him and a subsequent acquittal. he argued that, under domestic law, such a reopening could not be achieved if the court struck the case out of its list, but required a judgment finding a violation. furthermore, the compensation offered was insufficient. 6 of the code of criminal procedure, which provides for the reopening of criminal proceedings following a judgment of the court finding a violation (see paragraph 19 below), also applies to violations acknowledged by the government by way of a unilateral declaration. this question was for the domestic courts to assess. they acknowledged that the provision had, in practice, been construed narrowly.
the applicant was born in lithuania in 1980 and lives in ljubljana, slovenia. it had involved four men, while three others had assisted in its organisation. one of the men, later recognised as a.v., were arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting the robbery. this child will have nothing to eat because our situation is very difficult. when asked, why i am ashamed, i say that i am scared. when asked how old i am and whether i have children, i answer that i am 21 and have one child, who means the whole world to me. a decision opening a judicial investigation against the seven suspects was issued on 26 march 2002 but was quashed on appeal by a panel of three judges. the applicant did not attend those sessions, but his counsel attended them all. on 12 april 2002 the investigating judge decided that the statements given by the suspects to the police should be excluded from the case file as the court could not rely on them. the decision was translated into russian and notified to the applicant on 16 april 2002. once they had given him their passports, he had demanded that they take part in the robbery. ’s latest account, been too scared to participate, so they had left him in the woods to wait for them. the transcript includes the following record of the applicant’s statement:
“i agree with what has been said by my defence counsel. on 2 august 2002 the judgment with a translation into russian were also notified to the applicant. the applicant complained about the first-instance court’s assessment of the evidence and about his sentence. in the proceedings before the constitutional court, the kranj district court replied to the applicant’s allegations, submitting that he had at no time stated that he had trouble understanding russian. it replied on 28 december 2004, explaining that the applicant had used russian to communicate with the court and with his counsel at all stages of the first-instance proceedings. the supreme court found that there was no indication in the file that the applicant had been informed of his right to use his own language in the proceedings, either by the investigating judge or by the kranj district court. on 1 september 2007 the applicant was released on parole. the complaint that some of the evidence in the proceedings was in slovenian, thus preventing him from familiarising himself with it and defending himself, was not pursued in the proceedings before the lower courts. he has therefore failed to exhaust remedies in that regard ...” 47. the lawyer also assisted the applicant during his court appearances. article 62

the applicant was born in 1939 and lives in vác. he was awarded a disability pension on 6 may 1995. the provision stipulated that the rights of a person to whom a pension had been awarded prior to the entry into force of the regulation could, at the request of the person concerned, be reviewed, taking into account the provisions of the regulation. with regard to the applicant, the date of “entry into force” was hungary’s eu accession. on 1 september 2006 the applicant’s monthly pension was reviewed by the budapest and pest county pensions board (fővárosi és pest megyei nyugdíjbiztosítási igazgatóság), acting as a first-instance pension authority. the applicant’s pension was increased to huf 134,566 (approximately eur 449) per month with effect from 1 may 2004. despite the appeal, the decision was implemented with immediate effect and the applicant received huf 1,996,104 (approximately eur 6,650) in arrears. for the period 1 may 2004 to 28 february 2007 he received a total of huf 42,065 (approximately eur 140) in arrears and interest. however, in his view, this did not amount to a withdrawal of the request for a reference for a preliminary ruling. the judgment became final on 19 march 2010. on 7 july 2010 the central hungary regional pensions board adopted a new decision in accordance with the instructions of the budapest labour court and increased the applicant’s monthly pension to huf 139,545 (approximately eur 465) with effect from 1 may 2004. on 23 july 2010 the applicant appealed against the decision, claiming the arrears for the whole period following hungary’s eu accession. the appeals department of the national pensions administration (országos nyugdíjbiztosítási főigazgatóság jogorvoslati főosztály) conducted a repeated second-instance review and, in a decision dated 5 november 2011, amended the decision of 11 november 2010 (see paragraph 19 above). on 26 june 2013 the kúria upheld the judgment of the budapest labour court. the relevant provisions of the code of civil procedure (act no. the order shall be notified to the [cjeu] and, for information, to the minister in charge of justice at the same time. (3)  no appeal lies against a court decision making a reference for a preliminary ruling or dismissing a request for a reference for a preliminary ruling.” article 275
“(2)  the kúria may review a final decision only within the framework of the petition for review ... unless it decides to dismiss the action of its own motion, or if the court that rendered the decision had not been properly formed, or if a judge who should have been disqualified by law took part in rendering the decision.” bh 2016.12.342 the kúria held, in so far as relevant:
“a petition for review may only be examined on the merits if[, in addition to a pure reference to the allegedly violated legal provision,] the petitioning party also describes the substance of the infringement, explains his or her legal opinion thereon and sets out the reasons supporting his or her argument.” however, the petition for review is an independent, extraordinary remedy[. given] its special nature, references to previous submissions are not accepted.” section 46(1) of the constitutional court act (act no. in such cases, the level of protection to be afforded by the constitutional court to the fundamental right should in no way be lower than the level of international protection afforded to the given right (typically by the european court of human rights in strasbourg)” ... based on this consideration, the constitutional court has reviewed the case-law of the [european] court [of human rights] on the right to a reasoned court decision, which it also finds applicable in interpreting the right enshrined in article xxviii (1) of the fundamental law. 21) ab) the constitutional court examined a complaint regarding a final judgment of the budapest high court concerning its failure to refer a question to the cjeu for a preliminary ruling and to provide reasons for its decision not to do so. in these circumstances, the constitutional court shared the budapest high court’s opinion that there had been no need for a reference for a preliminary ruling. however, the constitutional court’s decision did not find the budapest high court’s particular judgment unconstitutional on account of the court’s failure to provide reasons for the non-referral – indeed, it did not contain any arguments related to the lack of reasons in that particular judgment. in accordance with the constitutional court’s decision no. 26/2015, article 155/a (2) of the code of civil procedure (see paragraph 28 above) was amended as of 4 december 2015 with the following additional wording:
“if the court dismisses a request for a reference for a preliminary ruling, it shall formulate its decision in the form of an order (végzés). the cjeu also defined the meaning of the expression “where any such question is raised” contained in the third paragraph of article 267 of the tfeu (see cilfit, cited above, §§ 8-9). it appears that the interpretation of that provision has so far not been the subject of a preliminary ruling of the cjeu.[2]

the applicants are:

(2) ms muslimat alikhanova, who was born in 1936 and
(3) ms tamara alikhanova, who was born in 1976. then they had grabbed him and forced into one of their vehicles. at 12.59 p.m. on 28 december 2004 the same person called mr a. and told him that he should now add a zero to the amount – meaning that mr a. would have to pay usd 250,000. the report had shown bodies of bearded men in camouflage uniforms and military boots, with firearms and ammunition next to them. it had been impossible to identify the corpses by their faces owing to bullet wounds to their heads. mr a. stressed that his brother, amirkhan alikhanov, had been abducted by servicemen from the organised crime unit. on 1 february 2005 the investigators questioned the neighbourhood police officer, mr r.sh., according to rumours in their village, amirkhan alikhanov had been arrested for causing someone’s death in a traffic accident. on 28 march 2005 the investigators questioned a police officer, a.kh., on the same date he and his relative, mr a.g., had gone to that village, where in a shed next to the cemetery they had found various pieces of clothing. the local residents had buried the bodies but had kept the clothing for identification. answer her telephone for a few seconds; behind his wife she had heard a man asking who was calling – then the connection had been cut off. who stated that her findings, as stated in the forensic report (see paragraph 53 below), had not with absolute certainty established that the blood on the clothes found in zamay-yurt had been related to that of the first applicant; their facilities had been limited in their capacity to establish such conclusions. on 8 august 2005 the investigators questioned a traffic police officer, a., who, according to mr a., had been present at the traffic police checkpoint during his brother’s abduction. on 15 august 2005 the investigators questioned v.m., on 11 january 2005 the investigators wrote to the dagestan ministry of the interior asking for assistance in establishing the circumstances of amirkhan alikhanov’s abduction. 55826 to investigate the abduction of amirkhan alikhanov. on 1 april 2005 the investigators sent an assistance request to the khasavyurt department of the organised crime unit. one of the traffic police officers from makhachkala followed them in amirkhan alikhanov’s car ...

the applicants were born in 1969 and 1964 respectively and live in sandnes, norway. the second applicant went to sweden in the 1980s and met the first applicant in 1993. they contacted persons from the neonatal unit, the primary health care clinic for children and the women’s clinic, as well as a and b’s child-minder, all of whom expressed great concern about how the applicants were coping with their family situation and described how they had failed to provide a and b with the necessary structure and rules. instead, they agreed to have a team from the social council visit their home on a number of occasions. friends of the applicants informed the social council that the first applicant was afraid to return to sweden since she feared that her children would be taken into public care. thus, on 13 february 2008 the social council cancelled the care order since it could not be enforced. subsequently, the second applicant telephoned, from a swedish telephone number, the norwegian social council, which in turn contacted the swedish authorities as it suspected that the family might be in sweden. neither the first nor the second applicants had reacted when the team had taken the children away with them. the applicants appealed against the judgment to the administrative court of appeal which, on 6 august 2009, struck the case out since, in the meantime, the children had been taken into public care (see paragraph 20 below) and the immediate public care order thereby had lapsed. a maintained that he had been beaten by the second applicant and b had told her foster home that she, a and the first applicant had all been beaten by the second applicant. all of the children had lacked communication and emotional response from their parents, which had affected their psychosocial development and their ability to interact socially with other children as well as adults. a was hyperactive and had difficulties following rules and functioning in social situations. they submitted that they were capable parents who cared for and loved their children. it had been noted that she felt great affection for her children. the children’s legal representative supported the social council’s stance. the representative emphasised the children’s need to see their parents but referred to the extensive material in the case-file which showed that the children had special needs. moreover, the representative found it questionable whether the applicants would agree to voluntary care, since they had refused to cooperate with the social council on previous occasions. lastly, the court noted that both of the applicants had declared that they were willing to receive help from the social council while, at the same time, they had refuted the accuracy of the investigation and claimed that the information was fabricated or much exaggerated. the applicants appealed against the decision to the administrative court. moreover, they were actively involved in an adhd association and were attending courses to understand the condition better and be able to help a. with assistance from the norwegian authorities and the school, they could take care of a and meet all of his needs. in fact, the first applicant’s visit with the children had gone very well and the children had also reacted positively to photographs and letters from their parents. on 20 january 2011, after having held an oral hearing, the administrative court rejected the applicants’ appeal and upheld the public care order. these decisions were confirmed on 10 june 2009 by the administrative court. they were also willing to hand over their passports to the authorities. it stated that there were strong reasons to believe that the applicants would intervene in the care of the children and stressed that it was necessary to decide on total restrictions in order to keep the children’s residences secret. moreover, currently there was no dialogue between the social council and the applicants and this would have to be re-established before contact rights could be granted. moreover, telephone contact was allowed twice a year, for no more than 20 minutes, in a controlled setting. the fact that they had later had a reaction in their foster home was normal since the meetings had been short and had taken place in an unnatural environment. on 27 september 2011, after an oral hearing, the administrative court rejected the appeal. they should therefore be given enough time during each meeting to share activities and be together.
the applicant was born in 1985 and lives in steiermark in austria. at the relevant period the applicant lived in syktyvkar in the komi republic of russia and had a blog hosted by livejournal.com, a popular blog platform. on 14 february 2007 the police arrived with an “unplanned inspection” (внеплановая проверка) at the office of a local newspaper in syktyvkar. the police searched the office, stated that the software installed on the computers was counterfeit, and seized the hard disks. the press release mentioned, in particular, that the newspaper in question had published a large amount of material in the context of the election campaign, and that it was in opposition to the current authorities of the komi republic, as it actively supported a well-known local politician who had a long-standing conflict with those authorities. on the same day, the president of memorial, mr i.s., published the text of that press release on his blog at livejournal.com. three comments were left under that publication on that day. it feels like they are an instrument of punishment of the recalcitrant rather than being a service to society. what can be done to carry out a rotation of meanings (ротация смыслов) in the law-enforcement agencies?” a journalist, blogger and the applicant’s acquaintance, made a short post on his blog at livejournal.com about the search, stating that the police “[were] seconded for a fight with the political opposition”. firstly, they are not police officers but cops; secondly, their mentality is incurable. only lowbrows and hoodlums – the dumbest and least educated representatives of the animal world. it would be great if in the centre of every russian city, on the main square ... there was an oven, like at auschwitz, in which ceremonially every day, and better yet, twice a day (say, at noon and midnight) infidel cops would be burnt. on the same day the applicant, who had found out the reasons for the criminal case against him, removed his comment. in the proceedings before the syktyvkar town court of the komi republic (“the town court”), the applicant pleaded not guilty. in his comment the applicant had expressed his disagreement with mr t., who, in the applicant’s view, had confused those two notions. with whom he had shared his thoughts regarding the police operation of 14 february 2007, and that he had had no intention of making it public, let alone calling for any actions against the police. the applicant further conceded that his comment had been quite provocative, but insisted that he had used exaggeration, in particular, referred to “an oven, like at auschwitz”, only to express an idea that “infidel” police officers should be severely punished. the town court called and examined a large number of witnesses. in particular, three police officers, who had conducted a pre-investigation inquiry in connection with the applicant’s comment on the internet, stated that they had not seen it as directed against only “infidel” police officers; in their view, it had related to all police officers, had ascribed negative characteristics to them and had proposed to incinerate them in public. some of the witnesses stated that they had seen the applicant’s comment in mr b.s. another witness stated that he had not taken the applicant’s comment seriously, let alone seen it as calling for any violent action. at the request of the parties, the first-instance court ordered that a comprehensive socio-humanities forensic expert examination of the impugned text be carried out by a commission of experts. the court based its findings on, among other evidence, the expert reports of 30 april 2007 and 19 june 2008, stating that it had no reasons to doubt the experts’ conclusions as those were consistent with the circumstances of the case as established by the court. according to the town court, the applicant had “argued that the police officers’ [had been] inferior on account of their professional grouping”, had humiliated their dignity by comparing them with “pigs” and ascribing to them the humiliating characteristics of “lowbrows and hoodlums – the dumbest and most uneducated representatives of the animal world ...” and “cop-hoodlum filth”. in the court’s view, the applicant “negatively [influenced] public opinion with the aim of inciting social hatred and enmity, escalating social conflict and controversy in society and awakening base instincts in people” and “[set] the community against police officers in calling for [their] physical extermination by ordinary people”. lastly, the court considered that “the crime committed by [the applicant was] particularly blatant and dangerous for national security [as] it [ran] against the fundamentals of the constitutional system and state security”, with the result that a sentence involving the deprivation of liberty should be imposed on the applicant. the applicant appealed against the conviction. on 19 august 2008 the supreme court of the komi republic rejected the applicant’s appeal and endorsed the town court’s conclusions.
the applicant was born in 1987 and lives in rotterdam. the applicant was charged with having, with an accomplice called v., robbed three supermarkets and with having, with two accomplices, mugged someone in the street outside a discotheque. v. made statements to the police admitting his own participation in the supermarket robberies and implicating the applicant in all four crimes. the applicant was tried before the rotterdam regional court (rechtbank). v. was summoned as a witness by the defence. not being suspected of having taken part in the street mugging, v. could not refuse to give evidence about it; he made a statement to the effect that he had not personally witnessed the robbery but had heard from bystanders that it had been committed by a group that did not include the applicant. v.’s statement disculpating the applicant was not believed by the public prosecutor (officier van justitie) and the court. v. was subsequently charged with perjury (meineed). on 30 august 2006 the regional court gave judgment convicting the applicant of all four crimes. it sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment and ordered the execution of a suspended two-week sentence of juvenile detention (jeugddetentie) imposed on a previous occasion when the applicant was still a minor. the applicant lodged an appeal (hoger beroep) with the court of appeal (gerechtshof) of the hague. v. was again summoned as a witness by the defence. as relevant to the case before the court, he kept silence on all four charges, including the street mugging in relation to which he was by this time being prosecuted for perjury. the court of appeal gave judgment on 4 march 2008 convicting the applicant of all four charges. it sentenced the applicant to six years’ imprisonment and, as the regional court had done, ordered the execution of the two-week suspended sentence of juvenile detention. the evidence on which the conviction of the fourth charge was based may be summarised as follows:
(a) the supermarket manager’s report to the police that his supermarket had been robbed;
(b) a statement made to the police by a cashier who had been forced at gunpoint to open her cash register, from which one of the robbers had snatched money and other goods;
(c) v.’s confession to the police, in which the applicant was named as co-perpetrator. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (cassatie) with the supreme court (hoge raad). as relevant to the case before the court, he complained under article 6 § 3 (d) of the convention of the use made by the court of appeal of v.’s statements to the police to ground his convictions even though v. had refused to answer the questions of the defence under cross-examination. the advocate general (advocaat-generaal) submitted an advisory opinion (conclusie) analysing the case-law of the court, in particular the chamber judgment al-khawaja and tahery v. the united kingdom, nos. 26766/05 and 22228/06, 20 january 2009, and expressing the view that v.’s evidence was “sole and decisive” in respect of the fourth charge but not in respect of the first three charges, for which sufficient other evidence was available. on 5 january 2010 the supreme court gave judgment dismissing the applicant’s appeal on points of law. referring to its own case-law (its judgment of 6 june 2006, ecli:nl:hr:2006:av1633, netherlands law reports (nederlandse jurisprudentie, “nj”) 2006, no. 332, its judgment in the vidgen case; see vidgen v. the netherlands, no. 29353/06, § 23, 10 july 2012), it found that the applicant had had sufficient opportunity to cross-examine v. or have him cross-examined. the mere fact that v. had refused to give evidence under cross-examination did not mean that use in evidence of his statement to the police was excluded by article 6 § 3 (d) of the convention.
the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in liski, voronezh region. in this notification he specified, inter alia, three different addresses as follows: the address at which he was actually residing (that he called “адрес места жительства”), his “registration address” (адрес места регистрации) which corresponded to his registered residence address and the address of the place of this new business (адрес фактического осуществления заявленного вида деятельности) for stands selling food. the applicant’s business was subject to an inspection in july 2014. it appears that the applicant was aware that this inspection took place. the offence record states that the applicant came to the liski unit on 6 august 2014 but then left the building before any offence record could be compiled, having stated that he had not been properly informed of the actual purpose of the meeting. thus, the applicant was not present during the compiling of the record. on 12 august 2014 the court adopted a decision to initiate a case and to examine it by way of a summary procedure. on 10 october 2014 the court decided to examine the case by way of an ordinary procedure because it was necessary to hear the defendant (that is to say the applicant). a preliminary hearing was scheduled for 11 november 2014 and the applicant’s or his representative’s presence was required. the government has provided the court with a dispatch card showing that the notification was dispatched on 14 october 2014 to the applicant’s registered residence address and then returned to the court on 24 october 2014 with a note listing reasons for return with “expiry of the retention period” being checked. on 12 november 2014 letters were sent by registered mail to the applicant’s registered residence address and the location of the business (the stalls). those letters were subsequently returned to the court as undelivered. the government has also submitted a dispatch card showing that the notification was delivered to the liski unit on 19 november 2014. on 10 december 2014 the court heard the case and acquitted the applicant. neither the applicant nor his representative was present, and they lodged no submissions. the liski unit appealed to the 19th commercial court of appeal. the court has not been provided with any relevant dispatch card or postal slip. by a decision of 26 december 2014 the appeal court scheduled a hearing for 28 january 2015. according to the government, this decision was dispatched to the applicant but was then returned to the court as not claimed within the retention period. on 4 february 2015 the appeal court adjourned the hearing to 4 march 2015. this decision became final and enforceable on the same date. according to the applicant, he first learnt about the trial and appeal decisions on 3 june 2015 during a conversation with an official of the liski transport prosecutor’s office. the appeal court could have required the representative to hand over a notification to the applicant in person. the applicant insisted that he had not received any notifications; no correspondence, including by registered mail, had been handed over to him by any official of the postal service; he had never refused any such correspondence. it is noted, however, that the statement of cassation appeal in respect of the appeal decision of 12 march 2015 was dispatched to the first-instance court on 8 july 2015 – that is to say after the expiry of the relevant period ...
the case file contains no indisputable proof that the impugned court decision was in a timely manner dispatched to and received by [the applicant]. the cassation court then upheld the appeal decision. in particular as regards the matter of notification, it considered that the decision to start proceedings had been dispatched to the applicant but that he had avoided being served with judicial notifications; however, he had been able to continue to keep himself informed, via the court’s website, of the appeal proceedings after the first-instance judgment against him (see the “relevant domestic law and practice” section below). when applying the above provision it is relevant that it follows from article 121 § 6 and article 123 § 1 that before a hearing or before taking a procedural act a court must have information that the participants have received a copy of the first judicial act in a given case or must have information relating to article 123 § 4. a first judicial act means a decision to initiate a case. ... it was then sent back to the court on 21 august 2014, as indicated “because there was no addressee”, and was handed over to the court on 1 september 2014.
the first applicant is one of the founders and the chief executive officer of the second applicant, a non-profit organisation. tamimdarov;
-  “the foundations of sincerity”, 2000 edition, translator not specified;
-  “the truths of an eternal soul”, 2000 edition, translated by m. sh. muslims guilty of apostasy from islam were even denied the right to life. they did not contain any calls for violence, ethnic or religious hatred or for overthrowing governments. the experts had found that the books by said nursi did not contain any harmful or unlawful statements;
-  a letter from the council on religious matters of the committee of ministers of the turkish republic, stating that said nursi’s books contained directions on moral and religious issues inspired by the qur’an and did not touch on politics. his books did not contain any insulting or hostile statements against adherents of other religions or persons belonging to other races;
-  a letter from dr t., a professor of the institute of middle eastern and islamic studies of the university of durham, submitting that said nursi’s books did not contain any statements aimed at stirring up religious hatred. he asked the court to appoint persons with expertise in religious issues. counsel for the second applicant submitted to the koptevskiy district court the following specialist opinions, criticising the report of 15 february 2007:
-  a specialist opinion by mr mu., although in his books said nursi indeed criticised the western way of life and condemned non-believers, he did not promote hatred or enmity towards those who did not share his opinion. on the contrary, they were permeated with ideas of brotherhood, friendship and goodness, while anger and hatred were clearly condemned;
-  a specialist opinion by mr me., on 28 april 2007 the koptevskiy district court ordered an additional expert opinion by the same experts. on 15 may 2007 the experts delivered an additional expert report, confirming their previous findings. any religious text would be found irrational and extremist by an atheist. it also rejected the oral submissions by the co-president of the council of mufti of russia on the grounds that he was an interested party. their content aims to incite religious discord and advocate the idea of the superiority or inferiority of citizens, depending on their religion. that finding was based, among other things, on the fact that the book contained military metaphors which, according to the specialists, could incline the reader to see the reality through the prism of the conditions of a military camp, a military ground and potential military actions. on 28 april 2010 the court-appointed experts delivered their joint report, finding as follows:
“the book ‘the tenth word: the resurrection and the hereafter’ from the risale-i nur collection by bediüzzaman said nursi, 2005 edition, is a popular exposition of the qur’an. the main part of the text is devoted to lauding and glorifying god and his wisdom, as is customary for any monotheistic religious tradition. the author’s objective is to ‘show that the truths of islam are reasonable, solid and interrelated’, which is a typical objective of any theologian ...
the verbal means used in the book do not go beyond value judgments used in any religious literature ...
under a normal perception of the text the book does not contain anything that could have a possible incentive influence on the human consciousness, will, socio‑psychological characteristics or conduct. the gist of the book is a breach of religious equality consisting in forming in the reader a negative and aggressive attitude towards non-believers and adherents to other religions, which amounts to inciting hatred and discord against them (see [specialist report of 24 december 2008]). the author uses in his text disparaging words and expressions to belittle the european culture, which is understood, in the light of the religious contents of the book, as religious confessions other than islam. the value of such a world-view is stressed by positive epithets. the book suggests to the reader corporate norms and a model of society where all people follow the same rules; the actions of all members of such a society are tightly regulated, they are encouraged to comply like obedient soldiers, military officers or civil servants who must unquestioningly carry out orders and commands (see [expert report of 24 december 2008]). on the one hand, the text is addressed to non-believers who do not have a developed ability to think critically. it means that any person who identifies with his parents, who has the slightest feeling of existential guilt for them, may be moved to adopt the view of the world suggested by the author. the court considered the findings of the report by the astafyev krasnoyarsk state pedagogical university to be credible because they had been made by specialists with professional expertise in the spheres of social psychology, psycholinguistics, philosophy and religious studies who had used scientific methods of analysis. the specialists had confirmed their findings when questioned at the hearing. the experts had not cited the statements which, in their opinion, could be subject to different interpretations and had not explained why they had come to that conclusion. it therefore had to be seized wherever it was found and on whatever information medium it was reproduced. it proved impossible to seize the other copies as they had already been distributed.
the applicant was born in 1969 and lives in bílovice nad svitavou (the czech republic). on 30 december 1992 the applicant’s legal predecessor and two others applied to the bratislava land office for the restitution of some plots of land under the land ownership act of 1991. the date on which the applicant subsequently became a party to the proceedings is not specified. on 23 june 1997 the land office issued a decision approving an agreement whereby the proceedings would end in relation to part of the property but continue in relation to the remainder. by a decision of the land office of 17 may 1999, the proceedings in respect of another part of the property ended. however, on 23 may 2003 the relevant part of the proceedings was reopened. on 12 july 2013 the land office stayed the restitution proceedings on the grounds that the parties had failed to furnish it with their consent to process, in the course of the proceedings, their personal data. on 11 september 2015 the land office dismissed part of what was left of the applicant’s claim. on 19 october 2015 the land office stayed the examination of the remainder of the claim, inviting a number of institutions to submit relevant documentation, which they did by the end of 2015. the remainder of the applicant’s claim is still pending. following repeated requests for acceleration of the proceedings and complaints, on 18 june 2011 the bratislava regional land office acknowledged that there had been unjustified delays in the proceedings before the district land office. on 20 december 2011 the applicant brought an action in the bratislava regional court for acceleration of the proceedings under article 250t § 1 of the code of civil procedure (“the ccp”). on 19 april 2012 the regional court dismissed the action on the grounds that the land office was short of staff and overburdened with complex and time-consuming restitution claims. it also noted that the land office had maintained active correspondence with the applicant and had therefore not caused any undue delays. the decision of 19 april 2012 was quashed by the constitutional court following the applicant’s constitutional complaint (see paragraph 22 below). this led to re-examination of the case by the regional court, which decided on 11 april 2013 to allow the action and to order the land office to decide on the applicant’s claim within sixty days. on 21 august 2014 the applicant lodged a fresh action with the regional court under article 250t § 1 of the ccp, arguing that the land office had failed to abide by the order of 11 april 2013. on 27 may 2015 the regional court allowed the action, issuing a fresh order to the land office to decide on the matter within three months. at the same time, it fined it 1,000 euros (eur) payable to the account of the regional court. on 4 july 2012 the applicant lodged two constitutional complaints. the first complaint was directed against the land office, in particular at the length of the proceedings on his restitution claim before it. on 23 august 2012 the constitutional court rejected that complaint for lack of jurisdiction to examine it. the constitutional court noted that under article 250t § 1 of the ccp examination of delays in proceedings before administrative authorities fell within the jurisdiction of administrative tribunals, which excluded the jurisdiction of the constitutional court. even though the applicant had already been unsuccessful in using such a remedy, the regional court continued to have jurisdiction over actions of that type. the second complaint was directed against the regional court. the applicant contested, inter alia, the fairness of the proceedings leading to its decision of 19 april 2012 (see paragraph 15 above). in a constitutional judgment of 16 january 2013, the constitutional court allowed the relevant part of the applicant’s complaint and found a violation of his right to a fair hearing. it held, in particular, that the regional court had failed to take account of relevant aspects of the case and to give adequate reasoning in respect of them. accordingly, it quashed the regional court’s decision of 19 april 2012 and remitted the applicant’s action of 20 december 2011 to the regional court for fresh examination. moreover, it awarded the applicant eur 2,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.
on 23 december 2004 the applicants and 126 others lodged a claim with the komárno land office, an authority that is now part of the komárno district office (“the land office”), for restitution of land under the restoration of land ownership act (law no. on 27 may 2010 the land office dismissed the claim on the grounds that all the claimants lacked standing to bring it. on 21 november 2011 the nitra regional court upheld that decision following an administrative-law appeal by the claimants, lodged on their behalf by four individuals. however, following an appeal lodged by the claimants with the supreme court, on 29 january 2014 that court quashed the regional court’s judgment and remitted the case to it on the grounds that the latter had failed to establish the representatives’ authority to act on behalf of all the claimants. the proceedings before the regional court had been conducted merely in the presence of the designated representatives and the court had failed to summon the claimants in person and to have its judgment served on them. it had thereby breached the claimants’ right of access to a court. accordingly, it became incumbent on the regional court to determine anew the claimants’ administrative-law appeal against the decision of the land office of 27 may 2010. in those proceedings, the court invited the claimants to clarify issues concerning their legal representation with a view to ensuring that they would be represented by a common representative. in a decision of 4 december 2014 the regional court issued several rulings. in so far as relevant for the present application, it ruled that the claimants would all be jointly represented by a lawyer who had up until then represented only some of them. on 25 may 2016 the supreme court upheld the decision of 4 december 2014 following an appeal lodged by the claimants. the proceedings are still pending before the regional court. meanwhile, on 21 january 2015 the constitutional court had rejected a complaint lodged by the applicants about the length of the proceedings in their claim, in so far as they had taken place before the land office and the regional court. the constitutional court held that the length of the administrative proceedings before the land office and of the judicial‑review proceedings held before the regional court could not be considered together. having split the complaint into those two segments, the constitutional court rejected the complaint concerning the administrative proceedings on the grounds of non-exhaustion of ordinary remedies. in particular, it noted that the applicants had failed to challenge the alleged inactivity of the land office under article 250t § 1 of the code of civil procedure (ccp) (see paragraphs 19 et seq. in “relevant domestic law and practice” below). as regards the judicial-review proceedings, the constitutional court dismissed the complaint as manifestly ill-founded. it noted that those proceedings as a whole had lasted some four and a half years. however, the case had been pending on appeal before the supreme court for about two years of that period. although the length of the appellate proceedings had been unsatisfactory, as such it had not been complained of by the applicants, who had limited their compliant to the proceedings before the regional court. in addition, the constitutional court observed that the proceedings had been procedurally complex on account of the number of claimants. in sum, despite the fact that its judgment had been quashed as flawed, the length of the proceedings before the regional court had not been excessive.
the applicant was born in 1972 and lives in ploiești. at the relevant time, he was married to i.m.u. and they had a son together, born in 2006. following a series of conflicts between the parents concerning their son’s education, on 13 september 2012 i.m.u. filed for divorce and custody of the child. on 19 october 2012 she left the family home and took the child with her. they moved in with her parents and grandmother. on 2 november 2012 the applicant lodged an application for an interim injunction (ordonanţă preşedenţială), seeking to be granted sole or shared custody of the child during the divorce proceedings, or alternatively the right to visit the child during those proceedings according to a detailed schedule that he submitted to the court. the ploiești district court gave its ruling on 8 january 2013. it ruled that it would not be in the child’s interests to change his residence temporarily during the divorce proceedings. the court noted that in any case the law did not provide for the possibility to have visiting rights established during divorce proceedings. it relied on article 6132 of the code of civil procedure (see paragraph 18 below). following an appeal by the applicant, that ruling was upheld by the prahova county court, which rejected all the arguments raised by the applicant concerning his right to visit his child. the court also ordered the applicant to pay 1,000 romanian lei (ron – approximately 230 euros (eur)) to i.m.u., the court delivered the final decision in the case on 27 may 2013. in june 2013 the applicant, who was in the habit of visiting his son at school in the mornings, was removed from the school premises by the school guard, who informed him that from then on, he would need the school principal’s permission if he wanted to see his son at the school. and her family denied him any further contact with his son. it appears from the parties’ submissions that the applicant was able to see his son on 27 december 2012, between 31 december 2012 and 2 january 2013, on 20 january, between 2 and 3 march, on 14 and 17 march, on 28 april, on 2, 6 and 12 may 2013, and one last time, on 9 june 2013, after the court had given its ruling in respect of the interim injunction. on 30 october 2013 the applicant added a copy of the district court’s ruling of 8 january 2013 (see paragraph 8 above) to the case file. after several postponements that were due mainly to the parties’ requests to be allowed to submit additional evidence, on 22 january 2014 the ploieşti district court gave its judgment on the divorce proceedings, ruling that the child’s sole residence would be with his mother. on 4 march 2014 the judgment was served on the applicant at his address; on 28 march 2014 he lodged an appeal. also lodged an appeal against the district court’s judgment. despite requests from the applicant to expedite the proceedings in order to allow him to re-establish contact with his son, the case file could not be sent to the prahova county court before 7 may 2014 owing to administrative problems within the district court. the county court delivered its ruling on 22 october 2015. it upheld the previous decision adopted by the district court. both parties lodged appeals against the county court’s decision. at the applicant’s request, the case was sent to the bucharest court of appeal. after several postponements to the proceedings, on 2 november 2016 the bucharest court of appeal delivered the final decision in the case. it upheld the ruling of the district court, but made some amendments to the applicant’s visiting schedule. on 19 february 2018 the child moved in with the applicant, at the boy’s own express request and in accordance with an agreement signed before a notary by both parents, following the mother’s decision to move permanently to another town.
the applicant was born in 1967 and was detained at the tekirdağ f‑type prison when the application was lodged. on 9 april 2003 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist organisation. on 13 april 2003 the applicant was brought before the judge at the istanbul state security court who placed him in detention on remand taking into consideration the nature of the offence, and the state of evidence. on 23 july 2003 the istanbul public prosecutor filed an indictment with the istanbul state security court, charging the applicant with membership of a terrorist organisation, and attempting to undermine the constitutional order of the republic of turkey by force. the criminal proceedings against the applicant commenced. on 10 november 2008 the court held a further hearing, in which both the applicant and his lawyer were present. at the end of that hearing, the court ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention. on 10 november 2008 the applicant’s lawyer filed an objection against this decision. on 27 november 2008 the 13th chamber of the istanbul assize court dismissed the objection without holding a hearing. in delivering its decision, the court took into consideration the written opinion of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative. on 4 may 2011 the istanbul assize court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to life imprisonment. on 25 september 2012 the court of cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.
are companies specialising in air transportation. each of the companies had a valid air operator certificate (an “aoc”)[1] issued by the moldovan civil aviation state authority (the “casa”). on 1 june 2007 the casa issued an order banning all flights of aircraft registered in moldova to iraq and afghanistan, with effect from 15 july 2007. between 4 and 8 june 2007, all moldovan aviation companies were subjected to a check by the european union safety committee. as a result, some irregularities concerning compliance with the european norms in the field of aviation safety were detected. the european union safety committee also found that some aviation companies did not comply with the rule according to which the companies have to have their principal place of business in the state of registration. one of the conclusions set down in the visit report drawn up by the european union safety committee was that the casa failed to demonstrate the ability adequately to enforce and implement the relevant safety standards. according to the report, the casa had undertaken to remedy the situation within three months. in a letter addressed to the casa by the european commission on 8 june 2007, the former was asked to require all the companies concerned to present their response to the findings in the report by 22 june 2007 at the latest. on 14 june 2007 the casa sent the applicant companies the eu safety committee’s report and informed them that they had until 22 june 2007 to present their comments. on 18 june 2007 the casa sent the applicant companies aviation instruction no. 2584 and asked them to present by 21 june 2007 a plan for remedying the irregularities found by the eu safety committee. the corresponding plan was sent by the applicant companies to the casa on 21 june 2007. 2585 requesting them to undertake measures with a view to remedying some of the irregularities before 20 july 2007 and other irregularities before 20 september 2007. on 21 june 2007 the casa issued order no. 102/gen withdrawing the applicant companies’ aocs, and thereby terminating their activity. the casa did not specify which irregularities it referred to. as to the second and third companies, the casa relied on the fact that they flew to destinations such as iraq, afghanistan, congo, sudan, sierra leone, kosovo, new zealand and united arab emirates. the casa argued that those destinations involved security risks and that it had no resources to ensure flight security in those territories. on 22 june 2007 the applicant companies wrote to the casa and asked it to reverse its decision on the grounds that it had not explained exactly what irregularities formed the basis for the withdrawal of the aocs and that the casa had not afforded them enough time to remedy the alleged irregularities. the casa refused to reverse its decision, and on 28 june 2007 the applicant companies challenged it in the chişinău court of appeal. the applicants submitted, inter alia, that according to section 23 of the law on civil aviation, the casa was entitled to suspend or withdraw the aocs only if the companies failed to remedy the irregularities found by the casa within the prescribed time-limit. they also made reference to section rac‑aoc 0170 from the regulations in the field of civil aviation according to which an aoc could be revoked only after being initially suspended. since the casa had not observed those legal provisions, its actions were unlawful. the court of appeal did not indicate the irregularities to which it referred. the court did not give an answer to the applicants’ argument concerning the casa’s failure to observe the provisions of section 23 the law on civil aviation and those of the regulations in the field of civil aviation. the applicant companies challenged the decision before the supreme court of justice, reiterating inter alia their position concerning the unlawfulness of the challenged decision. on 29 april 2009 the supreme court of justice dismissed the applicant companies’ appeal and upheld the judgment of the court of appeal after finding that the casa was entitled to revoke the aocs since the second and third applicant companies had failed to comply with its instructions concerning the ban on all flights of aircraft registered in moldova to iraq and afghanistan, with effect from 15 july 2007. as to the first applicant company, the supreme court confirmed the finding of the inferior court that serious irregularities threatening the safety of the flights had been found in respect of it and other companies which are not applicants in the present case and that they had failed to remedy those irregularities. the supreme court did not specify which irregularities it referred to and did not address the issue of the unlawfulness of the casa’s decision.
the applicant was born in 1969 and lives in aydın. at the material time, the applicant was the manager of a hotel in kuşadası. the applicant identified another co-accused, a certain m.b., this periodical, which was sold legally, was supportive of leftist ideas. whom he had met when he had been in germany. the applicant had allowed them to stay in his hotel and use his car when they had needed a vehicle. the applicant admitted that he had expressed his wish to be involved in the activities of the bolshevik party, but mehmet desde, who had connections in the organisation, had never replied to him. on 13 july 2002 the applicant was questioned by the public prosecutor again in the absence of a lawyer. however, he denied any affiliation with the illegal organisation. following his questioning, the applicant was released. on 24 october 2002, at the first hearing in the case, the applicant, who was represented by a lawyer, denied the charges against him. he maintained that he had not been involved in any illegal activity. the applicant also stated that he had lent his car to mehmet desde and m.b. when they had told him that they wanted to drive to another coastal town. he reiterated his previous defence submissions. at the same hearing the i̇zmir state security court convicted the applicant of aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation under section 7 (2) of law no. 3713 as then in force and sentenced him to ten months’ imprisonment and a fine. having regard, inter alia, to the statements of the applicant as well as of the other co-accused, the “written evidence” and the content of the case file as a whole, the trial court concluded that the applicant had committed the offence of aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation by allowing the other co-accused, namely mehmet desde, e.y. to stay in his hotel without registering them in his hotel’s guestbook and by lending his car to those people. 5190 of 16 june 2004, published in the official gazette on 30 june 2004, state security courts were abolished. on 13 december 2004 the applicant appealed. by a decision dated 10 november 2005, the principal public prosecutor at the court of cassation sent the case file back to the first‑instance court and requested that the latter reconsider the case in the light of the amendments made to the code of criminal procedure. the public prosecutor before the i̇zmir assize court submitted his opinion on the merits of the case and requested the acquittal of the applicant and his co-accused on the grounds that the organisation which they had allegedly founded did not correspond to the definition of a terrorist organisation under section 7 (1) of law no. consequently, he considered that the applicant’s acts could not be characterised as aiding and abetting an illegal organisation under section 7 (2) of the same law. again, it listed the periodicals found in the applicant’s possession as evidence in the “written evidence” part of its judgment. on 23 march 2006 the applicant appealed against the judgment. on 5 october 2006 the principal public prosecutor at the court of cassation lodged a written opinion with the ninth division of the court of cassation in which he submitted, inter alia, that the objections of the lawyers concerning the use of police statements to convict the co-defendants should be rejected as irrelevant and unsubstantiated. on 25 december 2006 the court of cassation upheld the judgment of 16 march 2006 stating that the lawyers’ objections in respect of the applicant and two other co-defendants were irrelevant and unsubstantiated. the applicant maintains that he only became aware of the judgment in april 2007. there is nothing in the case file to indicate that the applicant became aware of the judgment on the date of delivery.

a was born in 2011 and is the daughter of the applicant and y. both the mother and father had just turned 19 when the child was born. while the applicant was staying at r. family centre, on 1 december 2011 the grandfather stabbed a neighbouring married couple who were the parents of one of the applicant’s friends. the county social welfare board (fylkesnemnda for barnevern og sosiale saker – “the board”) approved the emergency placement the following day. on 25 june 2012 the board reviewed the emergency care order. a witness from r. family centre had testified that the mother would not take advice, had herself had a troubled childhood and was under the dominance of her father. a similar decision was made in relation to y the next day, on 27 september. concluded that neither parent should have care and control of or contact with a. 14. she had recently been moved again and had a particular need for calm and stability. on 19 december 2012 the board, composed of a chairperson qualified to act as a professional judge, a psychologist and a layperson, in accordance with the first paragraphs of sections 7-2 and 7-5 of the child welfare act, issued a care order pursuant to section 4-12(a) of that act (see paragraph 67 below). the board went on to examine the instant case in view of the fact that, in its opinion, it would be a long-term placement. nor had any information about where a had been placed emerged during contact sessions, since she was too young to communicate that information. on 5 july 2013 the city court gave judgment and ordered that the applicant and y were not entitled to have contact with a. 24. the court referred to statements the applicant had made to the police, to the extent that her father wanted to take over the care of the child and planned to take the applicant and her daughter abroad, kill the applicant and then take over the care of a. he had allegedly said this only a few hours before he had stabbed the parents of the applicant’s friend (see paragraph 7 above). it was also, to the city court, unlikely that the applicant had cut off contact with her father. in addition, the applicant’s father could not in any way be expected to be a serious care person for a. viewed in connection with the contact sessions that had taken place, which had led to the child having negative reactions and challenged the calm and stability in the foster home, this supported the conclusion that the court should not allow any contact. the applicant and y both appealed to the high court (lagmannsrett) which heard the case, including testimony from the applicant and the child’s father – who both attended with counsel – and eight witnesses, three of which were experts. it gave judgment on 5 may 2014, dismissing the appeals. moreover, the high court noted, the applicant’s father had thrown the applicant out of her home when she had had care of the child, then only newborn. the child had already been a victim of neglect when living with the applicant and the applicant’s parents and there were reasons to fear that she would again be subject to neglect if someone in the applicant’s extended family (storfamilie) kidnapped her. in the instant case there were, however, some unclear or new aspects of the case that needed further examination by the high court. in the present case, the relevant provisions were found in article 9(3) of the 1989 convention on the rights of the child on the child’s right to regular and direct contact with both parents (see paragraph 69 below) and article 8 of the convention on the right to respect for family life. she was now described as resourceful and eager to learn, she had her own flat, and she had recently had her second child. shortly after b’s birth in october 2014 (see paragraph 38 above) social services had raised concerns because the applicant had been at risk of losing her home for being behind on her rent. it could just as well be due to a lack of opportunity as a change in attitude. she was still a vulnerable child with attachment problems. she would probably be subjected to more neglect if she were abducted. according to the foster parents, the contact sessions had caused her sleep and digestive problems. both the foster parents and the child welfare service still considered a to be suffering from separation anxiety, which could be exacerbated by contact. both parents appealed to the supreme court. as to the appellants’ attack on the substance of the high court’s judgment, the committee found that neither the decision’s significance beyond the scope of the current case nor any other circumstances indicated that the case should be heard by the supreme court.
the applicants, ms bozhana boyanova uzunova and mr ferad ismail seid, were born in 1978 and 1955 respectively, and live in kardzhali. the applicants co-owned a plot of land of 15,276 square metres near the town of kapitan andreevo. on 30 november 2007 the council of ministers decided to expropriate 6,218 square metres of the applicants’ plot with a view to building a motorway. the decision allowed preliminary enforcement of the expropriation and stated that the owners were to be given bgn 13,023 (the equivalent of approximately eur 6,657) in compensation. the decision recorded as owner of the expropriated plot the person from whom the applicants had bought the property. the applicants brought judicial review proceedings in respect of the expropriation decision before the supreme administrative court. in a final judgment of 3 april 2009 that court declared the decision null and void as it had failed to specify the actual owners of the plot to whom compensation was due, and referred the case back to the administrative authorities. the road infrastructure agency requested re-opening of the judicial review proceedings on the ground that it had not been able to take part in them as an interested third party even though its participation was mandatory under the state property act 1996 as investor in the construction of the motorway. in a judgment of 12 october 2009 a five-member panel of the supreme administrative court allowed the request, quashed the judgment of 3 april 2009 and remitted the case to be re-examined by a three-member panel of the supreme administrative court. in a final judgment of 28 december 2010 the supreme administrative court found that compensation was due to the applicants as owners of the plot at issue and that it had to be increased to bgn 59,817 (the equivalent of eur 30,577), in accordance with the conclusions of an expert report obtained in the course of the proceedings. the court also awarded the applicants bgn 600 in costs, to be paid by the council of ministers. on 13 january 2011 the applicants invited the road infrastructure agency to pay the compensation due to them. in its response of 21 february 2011, the agency informed the applicants that due to some changes in the layout of the motorway, a new decision for expropriation of the affected property was being prepared. on 5 july 2011 the council of ministers issued a new decision for expropriation, in accordance with which 5,215 square metres of the applicants’ plot were to be expropriated against compensation in the amount of bgn 1,794 (the equivalent of eur 917). the applicants brought judicial review proceedings in respect of this decision. in a judgment of 26 june 2012, the supreme administrative court declared the decision of 5 july 2011 null and void as it had failed to take account of the binding character of the judgment of 28 december 2010, the latter having determined the dispute between the parties with final effect. in march 2012 the ministry of finance unsuccessfully sought reopening of the proceedings ending with the judgment of 28 december 2010 before the supreme administrative court. on 4 july 2012 the applicants once again invited the road infrastructure agency to pay the compensation due to them. they subsequently wrote to the agency again on 15 october 2012, to the council of ministers on 14 october 2013 submitting also a writ of enforcement in respect of the sum due, and to the regional governor on 21 february 2014. on 26 february 2015, at the time of submitting their observations on the admissibility and merits in this case, the government informed the court that on 15 may 2014 the road infrastructure agency had paid to each applicant bgn 29,908.50, or altogether bgn 59,817 pursuant to the final judgment in their favour of 28 december 2010. on 10 december 2014, 20 january 2015 and 23 march 2015 respectively, the applicants wrote to various authorities, without success, seeking the payment of interest on the above amount for the period of over three years when it had remained unenforced. in the meantime, on 22 november 2013 the applicants brought proceedings before the sofia administrative court in relation to the lack of enforcement of the final judicial decision of 28 december 2010. in particular, they claimed they had incurred pecuniary damage as a result of the lack of enforcement; they also claimed interest on the amount determined in the said judgment for the period of its non-enforcement. on 18 december 2013 the court dismissed their claim as inadmissible. it found, on the one hand, that the applicants had not indicated an individual administrative act as the subject of their judicial review proceedings. if, on the other hand, the applicants’ claim was about the lack of enforcement of a final judicial decision, the court held that the competent body in that connection was the bailiff and the relevant procedure was under chapter xvii of the code of administrative procedure 2006 (“the 2006 code”). the applicants appealed before the supreme administrative court, alleging a breach of article 203 of the 2006 code and a breach of section 1(1) of the state and municipalities responsibility for damage act (the “smrda”), and challenging the lower court’s decision as being unreasoned. in a final decision of 13 february 2014, the supreme administrative court confirmed the lower court’s decision.
the applicant was born in 1939 and lives in sofia. the applicant owns one half of a plot of land in the village of golyamo buchino, close to the city of pernik. he also owned one half of a house standing on the plot, in which he lived until 1997, and one half of two smaller buildings, a barn and a pen. the expropriation decision stated that the applicant should receive in compensation another plot of land in the village. on 22 december 1993 the applicant paid back that compensation. in the years which followed the mine approached the house, due to its gradual enlargement. coal was extracted from it by means of detonations, which, according to the applicant, shook the house on a daily basis. towards the beginning of 1997 the applicant’s family moved out of the house, judging it too dangerous to stay. subsequently, the applicant contacted the mine, seeking to obtain compensation, but the negotiations failed. at the time, the mine was managed by a company which was wholly state-owned. in 2001 the applicant brought a tort action against the company operating the mine, seeking compensation for the damage caused to his property. he thought that the house had been well constructed, and explained that after the initial damage the applicant had attempted to repair it. on 7 march 2002 the regional court heard another witness, who stated that most of the damage to the applicant’s house had been caused three or four years earlier. at the time of drawing up the expert report the house was uninhabitable, as its walls were bent and cracked, with the cracks sometimes reaching 20-35 cm in width. the distance between the house and the mine’s periphery was about 160‑180 metres. the expert confirmed his conclusions at a court meeting on 24 january 2002. in a judgment of 27 june 2003 the regional court dismissed the applicant’s action. it considered it established that the applicant’s property had been seriously damaged and that the damage had coincided in time with the beginning of detonation works in the mine. still, it concluded that the applicant had not proven that a causal link existed between the damage and the detonations. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. it was also necessary to assess compliance by the company operating the mine with other statutory requirements, such as those concerning environmental protection. after the case was remitted, the court of appeal commissioned a new expert report. the expert noted that, owing to the passage of time and the destruction of some documents, it was impossible to determine the exact distance between the applicant’s house and the area where the detonations had been carried out in 1997. nevertheless, it was clear that the house had been well inside the “sanitation zone” around the mine. the expert additionally noted that the detonations had been carried out by qualified workers, in accordance with the mine’s internal rules. he added that the detonations took place on a daily basis, that they caused “earthquakes”, and that the houses shattered as a result. the witness was not aware of any landslides in the area. in a judgment of 2 april 2007 the court of appeal once again upheld the regional court’s judgment of 27 june 2003, dismissing the applicant’s claim. it pointed out in particular that the expert report presented to the court of appeal (see paragraph 18 above) had only established that the applicant’s property had been situated within the “sanitation zone” around the mine, but “was insufficient to prove the existence of a causal link between the damage ... and the unlawful behaviour of employees of the respondent company”. in the meantime, the applicant’s house has collapsed and no longer exists.
the first and third applicants were born in 1941, the second applicant was born in 1974, and the fourth applicant was born in 1967. the first, second and third applicants live in kazanlak and the fourth applicant lives in sofia. ms maria kopankova and her grandson, the fourth applicant (son of the first applicant) co-owned a house with a garden in kazanlak. at the time ms maria kopankova lived in the house with her two sons, the first applicant and mr kancho kopankov, and their families, which included the remaining applicants (the second and third applicants are mr kancho kopankov’s wife and son). by a decision of the town mayor of 18 july 1988 the property was expropriated under the territorial and urban planning act with a view to constructing a residential building. the decision stated that each of the two owners (ms maria kopankova and the fourth applicant) were to be compensated with a flat in a building which the municipality planned to construct. after the expropriation the municipal authorities opened a blocked housing savings account with the state savings bank in the name of ms maria kopankova and the fourth applicant and transferred to it 13,420 old bulgarian levs (bgl) – the equivalent of the expropriated property’s value as assessed at the time. in 1989 ms maria kopankova and the applicants were moved out of the expropriated property and the house was pulled down. construction work started on the plot of land and the foundations of a future building were laid. however, the site was soon after that abandoned. throughout the years that followed ms maria kopankova and the applicants petitioned on many occasions the municipal authorities to provide them with the compensation due, but to no avail. the mayor never took a decision specifying the exact future flats to be offered in compensation (see paragraph 20 below). in 1998 ms maria kopankova passed away and was succeeded by her sons, the first applicant and mr kancho kopankov. the latter passed away in 2011 and was succeeded by the second and third applicants. as no response followed, they applied for judicial review of the mayor’s tacit refusal. the stara zagora administrative court (hereinafter “the administrative court”) gave a judgment on 27 may 2010. it found, firstly, that the fourth applicant and ms maria kopankova, and subsequently her heirs, had not received the compensation due to them, namely two flats. it pointed out in this connection that the transfer of money to a blocked housing savings account in their name (see paragraph 8 above) was not equivalent to the provision of compensation. the administrative court found further that the authorities had not “taken possession” of the applicants’ property, within the meaning of section 9(2), because there had been no formal decision to take possession (as had been required at the time), and because in any event the construction work which had started on the plot had eventually been abandoned. thus, the preconditions for the revocation of the 1988 expropriation under section 9(2) had been fulfilled. on that basis the administrative court quashed the mayor’s tacit refusal and revoked the expropriation order. the judgment above was not appealed against and became final. in 2011 the applicants brought a tort action against the kazanlak municipality under section 1 of the state and municipalities responsibility for damage act (see paragraph 23 below). they claimed the value of the house and of other objects (such as trees, the pavement and outbuildings) which had stood on the plot of land and had been destroyed, but for which they had never received any compensation. the applicants also made claims in respect of non-pecuniary damage. in the context of the ensuing proceedings the administrative court, examining the case, appointed experts, who estimated the value of the house and the remaining objects at 37,868 new bulgarian levs (bgn – the equivalent of approximately 19,370 euros (eur)). in a decision of 26 january 2012 the administrative court found the applicants’ claims inadmissible and refused to examine them on the merits. it reasoned that the applicants’ situation had been regulated by sections 9(1) and 9(2) of the transitional provisions of the territorial planning act of 2001 (see paragraph 22 below, hereinafter “section 9(1)” and “section 9(2)”), and that the existence of such a special avenue of redress meant that the general tort provisions of the state and municipalities responsibility for damage act did not apply. it pointed out in addition that the applicants’ claims did not fall to be examined by the civil courts, under the general rules of tort, and that the administrative courts remained competent to examine them, even though the claims were inadmissible. it thus refused to apply article 135 § 2 of the code of administrative procedure (see paragraph 25 below) and transfer the case to the civil courts, as the applicants had requested.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in silistra. shortly after the printing company began operating, the applicant and his family started resenting the nuisance it was causing. moreover, as time went by, the applicant’s young daughter developed an allergy, which the applicant believed was due to the chemicals used in the printing process and had to take daily medication to keep it under control. he also asked the authorities for help in forcing the printing company to cease its operations. he did so in a brief one-paragraph letter in reply to a complaint made by the applicant on 31 july 2006. in particular, two individuals who had not shown any credentials had turned up and measured the noise with a machine which had not reacted to sudden high-pitched noises but was set up to measure only background noise. on 25 august 2006 the ministry for health wrote to the public health agency, asking that a check be carried out and the applicant informed of the results accordingly. 13 of 2003 for the protection of individuals exposed to chemical agents at their work station; the noise reaching the applicant’s home when the windows were open, as well as the dwelling of one of his neighbours, was not in conformity with the requirements of regulation no. 6 of 2006; and that instructions had been issued to the owner of the printing company to ensure that the noise levels produced by his business were brought within the legal limits. on 27 october 2006 the applicant and his three neighbours wrote to the ministry for health, expressing their dissatisfaction with the reply they had received on 5 october 2006. they referred to point 393 of regulation no. they asked once again that the authorities order the printing company to cease its operations on the ground that they were in breach of point 393 of regulation no. the letter then listed the exact name of the machines operating at the printing company and the type of ink used. the applicant and his neighbours further pointed out that, according to regulation no. the printing business in question had been formally registered as “a workshop for printing services with up to two work stations” and not as a “printing house”; in this way it had successfully circumvented the legal requirements applicable to printing houses, despite the fact that the notice exhibited at its entrance read “printing house” (печатница). the applicant and his neighbours had learned from the staff that no antidote was being given to them; this was obligatory as protection against carcinogens present in printing inks and solvents used to clean the machines (up to ten times a day on a busy day). the authors of the letter then wondered whether they as well as the people living in the immediate vicinity of the printing house should also have been taking such antidotes. like the staff at the printing company, the applicant and his neighbours suffered frequently from headaches, their washing turned grey whenever it was hung to dry and the noise produced by the machines when operating was unbearable. the applicant and his neighbours were also worried that the owner did not wish to hear any suggestion of moving his printing business away, but insisted that it was harmless as he preferred to profit from the commercial advantages a central location offered. the letter’s authors then invited the authorities to carry out an unannounced nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry in order for the community to learn about the poisons they were being exposed to, as well as to proceed with closing down the business. they enclosed a copy of the 810 signatures collected in support of their cause. on 10 september 2007 the head of the ruse regional inspectorate for the environment and water wrote to the applicant in reply to the letter of 20 august 2007. the reply stated that two experts sent by the inspectorate had carried out a check on 30 august 2007 at the printing company in the presence of its owner. 7 of 2003 on limiting emissions of volatile organic compounds released into the environment as a result of the use of solvents in certain installations. on an unspecified date the owner of the printing company, v.v., brought defamation proceedings against the applicant under article 147 of the criminal code 1968. the court then stated that, as seen from a chemical agents inspection report of august 2006 and from the subsequent explanations of the person who had carried out the check, it was clear that measurements had been taken throughout the working process at the printing premises and that the level of the chemical agents measured was not above the norms. that amounted to defamation, which was in breach of the law and had to be sanctioned. by exhibiting posters on the windows of his own shop. it further found that the punishment had been neither excessive nor unfair and, if anything, it had been too lenient.
the applicant was born in 1971 and lives in zagreb. on 28 april 2008 the daily newspaper b. published an article under the headline “mob lawyer joins the supervisory board”, describing the applicant as an extortionist. on 27 may 2008 the applicant’s representative asked the publisher to publish a correction of that information. the publisher neither replied nor published a correction of the disputed information. on 9 july 2008, after the expiry of the deadline envisaged in the relevant provisions of the media act (zakon o medijima) to publish a correction, the applicant brought a civil action against the publisher in the zagreb municipal civil court (općinski građanski sud u zagrebu), claiming non-pecuniary damage. on 10 july 2009 the publisher replied stating in particular that the applicant had failed to submit a power of attorney with his request. at a hearing held on 31 january 2012 the zagreb municipal civil court heard evidence from the applicant who said that he had authorised his representative to act on his behalf vis-à-vis the publisher. on 31 january 2012 the zagreb municipal civil court, relying on sections 22(2) and 40(3) of the media act, declared the applicant’s claim inadmissible. the first-instance court held that the request for the publication of a correction of the disputed information had not been signed by a duly authorised person because the applicant had not proved that his representative had actually submitted a power of attorney with the request. and that it was not accompanied with a power of attorney, the [applicant] has not proved that he had properly requested the publication of a correction of the disputed information ... an action which is, pursuant to section 22(2) of the media act, a procedural requirement for bringing a civil action for non-pecuniary damage against the publisher ...” 11. on 19 november 2012 the šibenik county court (županijski sud u šibeniku) dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the first-instance decision. on 14 march 2013 the constitutional court declared a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant inadmissible on the grounds that there was “no constitutional issue” to be examined.
the first applicant company, b. tagliaferro & sons limited, is a company registered in malta in 1966 and is situated in valletta. the second applicant company, coleiro brothers limited, is also a company registered in malta in 1966 and it is situated in marsa. 109 archbishop street, valletta (hereinafter “the properties”). 109 was valued at the equivalent of eur 93,000 in 1993 and eur 140,000 in 2012. the same architect estimated that the rental value from 1993 to 1998 would be the equivalent of eur 233, eur 250 and eur 600 respectively, to be augmented by 10 % every five years thereafter. no notice to treat (offering an amount of compensation) was issued by the commissioner of lands (‘col’) at the time (see below). on 2 june 1993 and 12 october 1993 the government had lodged planning applications, which were later withdrawn. another development application was submitted in 1996 and approved in the same year. between 1996 and 2007 the attorney general repeatedly requested the lands department to take steps to vacate the premises. in turn the latter department wrote to the housing authority requesting it to provide alternative accommodation to the lessees and the squatters. thus, the construction permit in relation to the planned project issued in 1996 expired. on 18 september 2000 another application was submitted to the malta environment and planning authority for approval. by the end of 2015 no approval had yet been issued due to various obstacles from the various committees of the planning authority. on 24 june 2009 the government issued a new declaration for the expropriation of the properties. 109 (for a plot of land measuring 87.08 sq.m), in line with estimates made by architect fhv. the two applications were heard and determined concurrently by the domestic courts. the attorney general’s office was to be moved to a more appropriate location, allowing it to expand. moreover, the property was still earmarked for the same purpose, which purpose had never been abandoned by the authorities. it further found a violation of article 6 in so far as the applicant companies had not had access to court between 1993 and 2009, given that access to the land arbitration board (lab) was limited solely to the col. moreover, until 2009 the lab did not fulfil the requirements of an independent and impartial tribunal given its composition according to the law as it stood before the 2009 amendments. nevertheless, the latter amendments provided that the technical members, who assisted the chairperson in his decision, would now be appointed by the chairperson. the constitutional court confirmed the violations of article 6 (access to court and length of proceedings) and article 1 of protocol no. however, these violations persisted further, in so far as even after the declaration of 2009 and the col’s deposit in court of the offer made to the applicant companies, he had failed to notify the owners as required by law [article 9 (2) of the ordinance] with the consequence that proceedings had stagnated and no access to court by the applicant companies was possible as a result of his inaction. indeed, the authorities had slacked all throughout the process. similarly, the constitutional court confirmed that the applicant companies’ failure to bring judicial proceedings to oblige the col to act could only have a bearing on the award of compensation but not on the substance of the claim. the constitutional court considered that, even following those amendments the law remained deficient given the lack of security of tenure of the technical members of the board, on whose technical advice the chairperson had to base his or her decision. thus, such a body did not fulfil the guarantees of independence and impartiality. it further directed that the judgment be served upon the speaker of the house of representatives. it was now being refurbished and modified for such purpose. however, the applicant companies’ property remained designated for public use.
the applicant was born in 1972 and lives in albania. he was a member of parliament from 2013 until 20 october 2015. having regard to his parliamentary immunity, on 26 march 2015 parliament authorised the applicant’s arrest. as a result, on the same day the gpo ordered his arrest, which was carried out with immediate effect. on 27 march 2015 the gpo asked the supreme court to validate the applicant’s arrest. the applicant had been charged with a number of offences. the supreme court thus considered that the applicant’s deprivation of liberty was lawful. as to the security measure to be imposed on the applicant, the supreme court ordered his placement under house arrest. it appears from the case file that, according to a red notice issued by interpol in respect of the applicant, he was wanted for prosecution purposes. on 1 april 2015, relying on a criminal report filed by the high inspectorate for the declaration and audit of assets and the prevention of conflicts of interest, the prosecutor’s office initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant for laundering the proceeds from a criminal offence or activity and refusing to state or falsely stating what his possessions were in breach of articles 287 and 257/a of the cc. on 2 april 2015, following parliament’s authorisation on the same day (see above), the applicant was detained in connection with the second and third set of criminal proceedings. since he had been charged with offences punishable by no less than two years’ imprisonment, his detention was in compliance with article 253 of the ccp. there were reasonable grounds to believe that there was a risk of flight on account of the offences with which he was charged. the applicant was a member of parliament, he had financial means, and there was a risk that he might tamper with the collection of evidence or abscond from justice. the supreme court further stated that the security measure of detention (arrest) should be imposed in accordance with articles 228-230 of the ccp, and this entailed the fulfilment of three conditions: firstly, that there was a reasonable suspicion, based on evidence, that the accused had committed a crime; secondly, that the facts attributed to the accused constituted a criminal offence which had not become time-barred, as provided for by the criminal law; and thirdly, that the accused was criminally responsible for the alleged criminal offence. in the supreme court’s view, all three conditions had been cumulatively fulfilled in the applicant’s case. stated that a risk of flight should not rest on assumptions, hypotheses, suppositions or second guesses. the fact that the police could not secure the applicant’s house arrest should not have been held against him. the case file did not contain evidence of any risk of flight. on 26 may 2015 the applicant appealed to the constitutional court. further, no authorisation for his arrest had been given by parliament in relation to the charges under articles 287 and 257/a of the cc. on 6 july 2015 the constitutional court, composed of a bench of three judges, dismissed the applicant’s appeal. on 19 february 2015 the belgian assize court of brabant wallon decided to reopen the criminal proceedings against the applicant, and scheduled a hearing for 19 october 2015. on 15 july 2015 the albanian gpo decided that it did not have the authority to examine a request by the applicant to attend the hearing of 19 october 2015 in belgium. on 4 september 2015 the assize court of brabant wallon adjourned the proceedings sine die. on 2 october 2015 the applicant asked for the “personal security measure” of detention to be changed to house arrest. on 12 october 2015 the supreme court rejected the applicant’s request. it appears from the case file that the applicant lost his mandate as a member of parliament on 20 october 2015. on 26 april 2016 the tirana district court decided that the applicant should remain in detention. the court has not been informed of any outcome in those proceedings.
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in tbilisi. on 3 august 2004 the applicant became member of the public monitoring commission overseeing the implementation of the inmates’ rights and competent to issue recommendations if any irregularities were observed. the persons concerned had the right to meet inmates in private and access any documentation except that which was classified as confidential. it included seven state and non-state mental health experts, including the applicant. some members of the civil society contended that the transfers to the prison hospital were not implemented adequately and objectively but were based on suspicious arrangements within the ministry. on an unspecified date the applicant was questioned as a witness. the general inspectorate of the ministry was to deliver its findings on 13 october 2005. on 16 september 2005, while speaking live on a private television channel, rustavi 2, about allegations of corruption and mismanagement within the ministry and its medical department, the minister, mr k.k., the programme also featured the applicant’s brief comment, as recorded by a journalist, that the minister wanted to have “a monitoring council that [would] not take a peek inside a prison]” and “the prisons [were] in the same conditions ... as those under saddam hussein’s regime.” that field is very tainted with respect to prisons. the confrontation started immediately after we uncovered materials where mariam jishkariani had signed documents on the transfer of inmates to the prison hospital. it was revealed that there had been healthy people amongst those inmates. ... doctors at the medical department are responsible for the medical reports. the money they took should either have been brought to me or taken by them. the inmates] who assaulted the personnel had been transferred to the prison hospital based on jishkariani’s medical report even though they are healthy. naturally, jishkariani could not have committed it alone. it principally concerned the actions and omissions of the director of the medical department in the management of the transfers of inmates to the prison hospital. see paragraph 10 above) was assessed by the medical commission of the ministry on 12 january 2005. he was diagnosed with organic personal disorder with periodic episodes of decline. however the commission did not recommend his transfer to the prison hospital. on 27 december 2007 the investigation into the incident of 10 september 2005 was discontinued on the grounds of the absence of a crime, as provided under article 28 § 1 (b) of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 32 below). the minister’s false allegations had had all the more of a negative impact on the applicant’s reputation as a mental health professional because of the minister’s position as a high-level public official and the public confidence that it invited. yet, according to the court, she could have been considered as a public figure in view of the public attention that her activities had attracted. on 22 june 2006 the tbilisi city court found against the applicant. the court concluded that the applicant was a public figure for the purposes of the act (see paragraph 30 below) in view of her activities in prison (see paragraph 7 above), and that the burden of proving the existence of the three cumulative conditions set out in section 14 of the act (see paragraph 30 below) to classify the minister’s statements as defamation had rested with her. thus [the minister] issued an order aimed at verification three days prior to making the public statement. accordingly, it is possible that he was in possession of preliminary information about the existence of irregularities. however, the possession of [such information] is not confirmed in the case file. therefore it has not been confirmed that the minister was aware that the information was false by 16 september 2005. the failure of a party to abide by [those obligations] will lead to an unfavourable result.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in weinheim. the applicant subsequently redesigned his online presence. at the material time, the content of the austrian website was essentially consistent with that of the german website prior to the objection from the federal review board. only the website credits had been deleted. the photo underneath showed a pile of corpses in an unspecified third reich concentration camp. 60 jahre nach auschwitz: nach der “unterbrechung” geht’s in den verbrennungsofen oder auf den müll!) following the link “germany” and a further link on that page to “prayer requests”, reference was made to a decision by the karlsruhe court of appeal (judgment of 28 february 2007 – 6 u 98/06) prohibiting the applicant from labelling abortions as performed by the doctors named on his website as “aggravated murder”. can anyone seriously argue that an innocent, unborn human being is not wilfully killed in an ‘abortion’?” ( abtreibungsärzte sind von uns nicht als mörder bezeichnet worden und werden von uns nicht als mörder bezeichnet. aber: wir werden zu unserer meinung stehen: das vorsätzliche „zu tode bringen“ eines unschuldigen menschen ist mord. und wer kann ernstlich behaupten, dass bei einer „abtreibung“ kein unschuldiger, ungeborener mensch vorsätzlich getötet wird?) at the very bottom of the same page, under the highlighted text “german contemporary history in brief”, a sentence read:
“perverted doctors murdered unborn children at the behest of their mothers” (pervertierte ärzte ermordeten im auftrag der mütter die ungeborenen kinder)
from that page, the reader was directed to a location-based alphabetical list mentioning the names and practice addresses of many doctors across germany who performed abortions. the list was accompanied by an invitation to pray for these doctors. dr f., the plaintiff in the main proceedings, was mentioned on the list. he was of jewish faith and his family had suffered from the atrocities carried out during the national socialist era. dr f. applied to the courts for an injunction against the applicant and m.h. to pay dr f. compensation of 10,000 euros (eur). the karlsruhe regional court gave the following grounds for its decision. firstly it established that the statements at issue could be attributed to the applicant. the applicant had made the content his own by having referred and created a link on the german website expressly to m.h. he had also not disputed during the proceedings that the statements had originated from him. it concluded that the website at issue contained the general statement that abortions, as performed by dr f., were acts of aggravated murder comparable with the utterly unjustifiable atrocities inflicted on jews in the third reich. the applicant had purposefully undermined the plaintiff’s right of personality by labelling abortion as aggravated murder, equating it to the crimes of the holocaust and reproaching dr f. specifically for his involvement. this was also true on the assumption that the statements constituted an expression of opinion and not a factual claim. moreover, the court took into account that the applicant had persistently made these or similar statements and had not been dissuaded by orders to desist issued against him, such as the decision of the karlsruhe court of appeal of 28 february 2007 (6 u 98/06) to which the website referred (see paragraph 11 above), or the inclusion of the website on the list of publications harmful to minors by the federal review board. this had constituted a serious attack on dr f.’s reputation and personality rights. and had given his consent, by means of a link, for it to be posted on the austrian website. the regional court had correctly taken into account, to the detriment of the applicant, that he had failed to observe the legally binding decision of the karlsruhe court of appeal of 28 february 2007. the applicant was provided with the opportunity to submit his position on the above reasoning, which he made use of to no avail. on 2 february 2011 the karlsruhe court of appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant without an oral hearing.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in weinheim. he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an anti-abortion website. on 25 november 2004 and 7 december 2004 the applicant distributed leaflets in the immediate vicinity of the medical practice of dr s. the leaflets contained, inter alia, the following text on the front page:
“did you know that dr s. [full name and address] performs abortions that are unlawful according to the case-law of the federal constitutional court?” ( wussten sie schon, dass dr s. ... abtreibungen durchführt, die nach der rechtsprechung des bundesverfassungsgerichts rechtswidrig sind?) sinngemӓβ aus den internationalen strafgesetzen: mord ist das vorsӓtzliche “zu-tode-bringen” eines unschuldigen menschen!) die ermordung der menschen in auschwitz war rechtswidrig, aber der moralisch verkommene ns-staat hatte den mord an den unschuldigen menschen erlaubt und nicht unter strafe gestellt.) by a letter of 23 december 2004 dr s. requested that the applicant sign a declaration to cease and desist. instead dr s. considers the leaflet campaign to be slander, threatens an interim injunction and has already given his lawyer a mandate to lodge a criminal complaint for defamation/slander. we ask ourselves: is dr s. unprincipled and characterless?” ( wenn dr s. mit der durchführung von abtreibungen öffentlich bekundet, dass er für abtreibungen ist, dann sollte er auch dazu stehen. wir fragen uns: ist dr s. stand- und charakterlos?) in ihrer nähe: rechtswidrige abtreibungen ... und sie schweigen zum mord an unseren kindern?) [ emphases in original]
the back of the folded leaflet contained the following text:
“these pre-natal infanticides have meanwhile taken on proportions that bring to mind a new holocaust!” ( diese vorgeburtlichen kindstötungen haben mittlerweile ausmaße angenommen, welche an einen „neuen holocaust“ erinnern!) [ emphases in original]
farther down the leaflet read:
“i’m simply unable to understand that medical personnel and doctors, who are supposed to help and save lives, stoop to take part in aggravated murder.” ( on 4 november 2005 the karlsruhe regional court granted the requested injunction and ordered the applicant to desist from asserting publicly, both in writing and orally, on the internet as well as on leaflets, that the plaintiff performed unlawful abortions in his medical practice. the court held that the applicant’s statements were protected by freedom of expression and contributed to a public debate. moreover, they had to be classified as statements of fact and, as such, the information that abortions were unlawful was in line with the judgment of the constitutional court and not incorrect. the court came to this conclusion based on the facts that the applicant had singled out dr s. by mentioning him by name and distributing the leaflets in the vicinity of his practice, that he had quoted the federal constitutional court’s judgment only in parts and had omitted the parts that stated that doctors had not been subject to criminal liability, that he had implied by defining aggravated murder that dr s. had committed this criminal offence and that he had associated dr s. with the holocaust. the applicant and dr s. appealed against the regional court’s decision. on 28 february 2007 the karlsruhe court of appeal confirmed the reasoning of the regional court and in essence dismissed both appeals. however, it partly modified the regional court’s judgment concerning the precise wording of the requested injunction. it ordered the applicant to desist from asserting in public that dr s. performed unlawful abortions in his medical practice and asserting in direct connection to this that “aggravated murder is the intentional ‘bringing-to-death’ of an innocent human being”. at the outset, it emphasised that the applicant’s view that abortions should be subject to criminal liability and were not compatible with higher-ranking law fell within the applicant’s freedom of expression. in the court’s view the applicant had created an unacceptable “pillory effect” by singling out the plaintiff, who had not given the applicant any reason to do so. in that regard the court noted that dr s. had not been involved in the public debate about abortions in any way. in regard to the second leaflet the court of appeal held that even though dr s. had not been mentioned by name, it had referred to him as it had been distributed in front of his medical practice and deposited in letterboxes in the vicinity. as to the claim for damages the court of appeal upheld the first‑instance judgment. it also did not grant leave to appeal on points of law. on 29 may 2007 the federal court of justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid for his complaint against the denial of leave to appeal on points of law on the grounds that the applicant’s intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success.
the first applicant was born in 1937 and lives in sopot. the second applicant was born in 1955 and lives in gdańsk. on 10 april 2010 an aircraft of the polish air force was carrying a polish state delegation from warsaw to smolensk, russia, to attend a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the katyń massacre. it concluded:
“the immediate cause of the accident was the descent below the minimum descent altitude at an excessive rate of descent in weather conditions which prevented visual contact with the ground, as well as the delayed execution of the go-around procedure. according to the applicants, the parliamentary group was not an official investigative authority. both applicants were granted victim status in the investigation. the first applicant attended that meeting. the second applicant did not attend the meeting. she did not trust the state prosecutor’s office because she felt that it favoured those families who supported the exhumations and the conspiracy theories around the crash. the victims’ remains had subsequently been repatriated to poland and buried. he further intended to resolve doubts concerning the alleged explosion on board. the applicants argued that the prosecutor had applied article 209 § 1 and article 210 of the ccp without any consideration for the relevant provisions of the constitution. the ombudsman considered that exhumation of human remains carried out following a prosecutor’s decision constituted an interference with the right to respect for the memory of a late relative, one of the personal rights protected by the civil code. in the light of that provision, everyone who considered that his or her private life had been violated by an act of the authorities had to have the opportunity to seek legal protection. a decision on that matter would be issued in a separate order, specifying the time and place of exhumation. they submitted that the decision of 7 october 2016 concerned not only the appointment of a team of forensic experts but also the exhumation of their husbands’ remains. the decision on exhumation constituted interference with the applicants’ legal interests and therefore it was constitutionally required that they be provided with a legal remedy aimed at reviewing the prosecutor’s decision. the applicants also stated that the prosecutor had failed to respond to their arguments based on the constitution and the convention. on 3 april 2017 the warsaw regional court (case no. the prosecutor replied in the negative on 7 june 2017. the government submitted that in accordance with the code of conduct adopted by the investigative team of the state prosecutor’s office, the prosecutors in charge of the investigation had taken steps to arrange a meeting with the applicants and their lawyers in order to explain the reasons for the intended investigative actions, to clarify the aim of the autopsies and to elucidate other important issues, such as the families’ participation in the investigative actions and the issue of reburial. on 19 april 2018 the second applicant’s lawyer informed the state prosecutor’s office that his client would not take part in the proposed meeting with the prosecutors because she opposed the exhumation. the exhumation of the remains of mr arkadiusz rybicki, the husband of the second applicant, was carried out on 14 may 2018. according to reports in the media, a few hundred people protested peacefully against the exhumation at the cemetery in gdańsk. the exhumation exercise was secured by a large group of police officers. on 10 november 2016 the warsaw regional court refused to grant an injunction. the exhumation, the examination of the corpses and a second burial would interfere with that right. however, the regional court found that the applicants had failed to demonstrate that the intended interference with their personal rights would be unlawful and therefore dismissed their application. the legislature had given priority in this context to the investigation of serious crimes and punishment of the perpetrators over the protection of the right to respect for the memory of deceased family members. on 5 december 2016 the warsaw court of appeal dismissed an interlocutory appeal lodged by the applicants and upheld the regional court’s findings.
the applicant was born in 1962 and at the time of the events lived in saray, absheron region. its main functions consisted of raising legal awareness, organisation of training programmes for lawyers, human-rights defenders and journalists and preparation of reports relating to various human-rights issues in azerbaijan. on 24 june 2014, during the june session of the parliamentary assembly of council of europe (pace), the applicant, along with other local human-rights defenders, including mr rasul jafarov, participated as one of the speakers at a side event organised in the council of europe. the[se] organisations have had grants allocated to them in non-transparent ways, directing them into various activities, including those against azerbaijan. the head of the department of social and political issues of the presidential administration, stated the following in an interview with trend news agency:
“the most deplorable thing is that such ngos and individuals and some journalists, relying on foreign circles funding them, placed themselves above national law, evaded registration of their grant projects, filing financial statements, taxes and other legal requirements.” in an interview published on 2 september 2014 y.m., for local human-rights ngos, the purpose of such funding schemes was the formation of a “fifth column” inside a country. he submitted in this connection that the actual reason for his arrest had been the fact that he had represented numerous applicants before the strasbourg court in cases relating to election irregularities and that he had publicly accused the government of human-rights abuses at a pace event in june 2014. on 13 august 2014 the baku court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and found the first-instance court’s decision lawful. on 23 october 2014 the applicant applied again to the nasimi district court, requesting the substitution of remand with either house arrest or release on bail. as regards the charges of embezzlement, the applicant was accused of transferring various amounts from the bank accounts of the association to the bank account of one of the association’s employees with a view to their subsequent withdrawing the cash. on 9 august 2014 the investigator carried out a search of the association’s office. on 15 september 2014 the applicant appealed against this decision, reiterating his previous complaints. the applicant did not have his own bed and had to share beds with others. the temperature inside the cell was very high. there was no bathroom and the sanitary conditions were very bad. m., which was designed to accommodate four persons. there had been one window in the cell measuring 120 by 140 cm. sanitary facilities had been separated by a plastic door and consisted of a toilet, a sink and a shower. the applicant suffered from a number of conditions before his arrest. according to the results of the scan, there was no pathology in the brain or the vertebral column. small masses were detected in the prostate. on 11 november 2014 the applicant’s lawyer asked the head of the detention facility to provide him with copies of the results of the applicant’s medical examinations. it is not clear from the case-file whether the applicant was provided with those documents. according to the applicant, he decided not to take the drugs owing to the serious side effects, such as appearance of suicidal behaviour. according to the applicant, the vehicles were in poor condition and there was no appropriate place to sit or stand inside. m. the applicant shared this room with four detainees all day waiting for his hearing. he was allegedly not provided with food and water. on 8 february 2015 the court left the applicant’s complaint without examination for lack of jurisdiction as the investigation had been already completed and his criminal case had gone to trial. on 25 february 2015 the baku court of appeal upheld the above decision.
the applicant was born in 1942 and lives in yerevan. he had unsuccessfully tried to calm them down and then had gone back into the restaurant. he had not seen the murder or heard gun shots. on 11 may 2007 levon gulyan appeared again at the police station. on the order of the head of the pdci, h.m. it appears that he had fallen from the window of the office of the head of the homicide unit, g.t., the results of the talk, he had then left the office but had not wanted to leave levon gulyan alone, so he had taken him to officer s.m. ’s office and had been aware that he had been summoned in connection with the murder. the window had been open so he had immediately understood that levon gulyan had escaped. he had quickly run to the courtyard and had seen levon gulyan lying on his back, with blood around his head. a.m. submitted that he could not give their names as he had been in a state of shock. on 13 may 2007 the requested medical examination was performed, resulting in medical report no. on 19 may 2007 the prosecutor, following a request by the applicant, decided to order another medical examination of levon gulyan’s body to be performed by two foreign experts from germany and denmark. there were no lesions that could not be explained by a fall from a height. the experts, having examined the scene of the incident, found no indentations or other indications of a person having hit the shed. by letter of 12 july 2007 the prosecutor, in reply to an enquiry made by the yerevan prosecutor’s office, stated, inter alia, that the officers of the police station, having received an assignment to find and bring eyewitnesses, had brought levon gulyan to the prosecutor’s office for questioning, which had happened only once on 10 may 2007. he had been accompanied by police officers but not handcuffed. on 19 december 2007 the investigator questioned pdci officer g.t. had then left the office in order to report this new piece of information, while levon gulyan had remained with the deputy head of the homicide unit a.m., with whom he had had a talk of a general nature. after a.m. had gone out to fetch some water, levon gulyan had tried to escape through the window but had fallen from a height of about 7 m and had died on the spot. on 7 april 2008 the applicant contested that decision before the courts, complaining in detail that the investigation had not been impartial, transparent and effective. on 6 june 2008 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan allowed the appeal and ordered that the case be resumed. there had been no instruction from the investigator to carry out a face-to-face confrontation and, moreover, by taking levon gulyan to an alleged confrontation, the pdci officers had violated article 206 § 2 of the ccp, pursuant to which a witness had had to be questioned at the location where the investigation had been in train or, if necessary, where he or she had been located, whereas the pdci could not be considered to have been either of those. (b)  resumption of the criminal proceedings, their subsequent termination and the applicant’s challenge before the courts 43. the applicant and his representatives were present at these interviews and were apparently able to pose questions. it referred, inter alia, to the statements of a number of police officers, medical reports nos. on 5 february 2010 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of the district court. it was therefore necessary to obtain the dummy in question, carry out the experiment, compare its results with the other evidence and, if necessary, carry out other investigative measures. on 3 july 2011 the prosecutor lodged an appeal against this decision. on 8 september 2011 the investigation was resumed and assigned to the same sis investigator.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in yerevan. it further appears that the applicant was an active participant in the rallies and was often on the podium, and had made a speech on the first day of the rallies. then there was silence for about a minute. this decision stated:
“after the announcement of the preliminary results of the presidential election of 19 february 2008, the presidential candidate, mr levon ter-petrosyan, members of parliament, [k.s. on 2 march 2008 another criminal case was instituted, no. it further appears that police officer a.arsh. according to the testimony of police officer a.arsh., dozens of the most active and aggressive participants in the mass disorder were taken to various police stations. 62202508 and 62202608, however, is unclear. in reality he had been taken into custody by about 10-15 persons who did not introduce themselves as police officers and were masked. the applicant further alleged that upon his arrival at kentron police station the same persons had continued to beat and humiliate him. the arrest record was signed by the applicant. the applicant complained of pain in his legs. he and others had fled, but the police officers had pursued them armed with rubber batons. a number of demonstrators were assaulting us, police officers, with stones. moreover, no actual police officer to whom he had put up the alleged resistance had been identified. on 5 march 2008 the applicant was transferred to vardashen remand prison. on 21 november 2008 the court of cassation refused to examine the appeal on the grounds that it had been lodged out of time and that no proof was attached to the appeal certifying that its copy had been served on the respondent party. identified the applicant, from among the photographs shown to him, as the person who had assaulted him at freedom square on 1 march 2008 at around 7 a.m. by hitting him twice with a stick. stated that he recognised the applicant by the general structure of his face, his wide forehead and his haircut and style. on 5 august 2008 the investigator decided to drop the charges against the applicant under article 225.1 § 2, article 301 and article 318 § 1 of the cc (see paragraphs 91, 93 and 95 below). it was stated that the applicant, having regularly participated in the unauthorised demonstrations held following the presidential election, had been present at freedom square on 1 march 2008 at around 7 a.m., when some of the demonstrators, using makeshift clubs, rods and other dangerous objects, had assaulted the police officers after the latter had demanded to be allowed to verify the information concerning the possession of arms and ammunition by the demonstrators. on the same date the investigator invited the applicant for questioning and a confrontation with police officer a.arsh. he and his co-thinkers who were at freedom square on 1 march 2008 had found out about the forthcoming arrival of the police several hours in advance. he had never carried a knife, therefore, no such object had ever been found in his possession. the applicant further contested the allegation that he had assaulted police officers a.arsh. the argument that they were able to confirm the fact that at 6.30 a.m. the applicant had already been at the police station, was not a sufficient reason to call and examine them in court. who were on duty at that time in the same area, noticed the incident and brought [the applicant] in to kentron police station, during which a bladed weapon – a knife – fell from [the applicant’s] pocket, as well as two mobile telephones and a bunch of keys. the police officers had effectively refused to answer any questions in court, limiting their answers to either “i do not remember” or “i do not know”. what had happened in reality was that the police officers had initiated an unlawful clash with the demonstrators and then rounded up all the activists, many of whom had also been subjected to ill-treatment.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in yerevan. the applicant is an ethnic armenian who was born and raised in iran and who subsequently went to live in armenia. in the applicant’s arrest record drawn up on 2 march 2008 his name was indicated as both vartgez gaspari and vardges gasparyan. on 5 march 2008 the applicant was formally charged and brought before the arabkir and kanaker-zeytun district court of yerevan. the court examined an application lodged by the investigator for the applicant’s pre-trial detention for a period of two months on the grounds that, if he remained at large, he could abscond, obstruct the course of justice, commit another offence and evade criminal responsibility. the applicant submitted before the district court that the application was unsubstantiated. he had a higher education, was married, was head of a company, had a minor child dependent on him and had no previous convictions. he was a respected and trusted person in the society, was known to be of good character, had a permanent place of residence and a minor child dependent on him, and had always respected the law. on 14 may, 17 june, 17 july and 5 august 2008 the applicant applied to the district court for his release. it adjourned the examination of the applications of 17 july and 5 august until circumstances necessary for a decision to be taken had been clarified. at the hearing of 23 september 2008, the applicant once again urged the court to release him and asked it to reason its decision. the hearing was adjourned until 29 september 2008. thereafter the applicant declared that he wished to lodge a challenge to the judge. on 22 october 2008 the applicant lodged another application, seeking to be released on bail. it appears that no decision was taken on that application. the periods from 23 to 29 september and from 29 september to 3 october 2008, during which the court hearings were adjourned because of the applicant’s removal from the courtroom, were not to be calculated as part of his sentence, pursuant to article 314.1 § 6 of the code of criminal procedure (ccp). m and accommodated seven to eight inmates. the cell was located in a semi-basement and was very damp and unsanitary. the air was stale, as the only source of ventilation was a window measuring one square metre and facing a pit filled with several centimetres of rubbish and frequented by rats. in the evening the toilet situated in the corner of the cell became clogged and sewage from the upper floors flooded the entire cell floor. at noon on 7 march the applicant was transferred to cell no. while in that cell, the applicant declared a hunger strike in protest against alleged human-rights violations in armenia. 4, where he was kept until 14 march 2008. m, had a pit in front of it which prevented natural light from entering the cell. m. the cell was relatively calm and ventilated. being a non-smoker, he felt asphyxiated and his eyes watered continuously. the television was switched on twenty-four hours a day, which disrupted his sleep. from 15 april to 4 september 2008 the applicant was kept in cell no. the cell had only eight beds, so the inmates had to sleep in turns. the sanitary conditions were relatively satisfactory.
the applicant was born in 1964 and is detained in gorodyshche in the rivne region. the victims”) and threw a jar of petrol with a burning fuse into the room where mrs ma. on 19 july 2010 the applicant was arrested. according to the applicant, following his arrest, from 19 to 22 july 2010 police officers ill-treated him in order to force him to confess to attempted murder of the victims. in particular, he alleged that the police officers hit him, put a plastic bag over his head cutting off his air supply, and subjected him to electric shocks. on 22 july 2010 an arrest report was drawn up documenting the applicant’s arrest on suspicion of attempted murder. o., a legal aid lawyer, was appointed for the applicant. he responded that he had chosen the window which had been lit up by light from a computer, indicating that people were living there. on 24 july 2010 the applicant refused the services of lawyer o. and asked that s. be admitted as his lawyer instead. he refused to give evidence and stated that he would testify on that point in the course of the trial. the prosecutor questioned several police officers, who denied any ill‑treatment. two officers stated that the applicant had been arrested on 19 july 2010 but had refused to follow the arresting officers to the police station, so he had been handcuffed. he had then been released and had come back to the station voluntarily when summoned on 22 july 2010. in the course of the pre-trial investigation against the applicant witness mi. he testified that on the night of the crime he had taken the applicant to the vicinity of the victims’ house in his car. the applicant had had in his bag a jar of petrol, which he had equipped with a fuse in mi. said that he had been subjected to “psychological and physical influence” by the police during the pre-trial investigation. it sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment. the applicant appealed, arguing, primarily, that he had not intended to murder the victims and had set their house on fire only after attempting to verify that there had been nobody inside. he insisted that he had been ill‑treated in order to extract his confession. on 29 may 2012 the donetsk regional court of appeal (“the court of appeal”) requested the slovyansk prosecutor to investigate the applicant’s ill-treatment allegations. in the course of the enquiries the prosecutor’s office took statements from the applicant, the police officers, lawyer o. and the medical expert who had issued the report of 29 july 2010, and examined the premises of the police station where the alleged ill-treatment had taken place and its entry records. police officers stated that the applicant had been arrested and handcuffed on 19 july 2012 but had then been released and invited back for a new interview on either 21 or 22 july 2010. the record of the interview with the medical expert is one page long. first, he was asked on what grounds he had concluded that the applicant’s injuries could have been caused by electric shocks. the expert responded that his conclusion had been based on the applicant’s statements and the results of the examination. on 15 july 2012 the prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers for lack of a corpus delicti in their actions. by way of reasoning, the prosecutor stated, in particular, that the records of the police station where the applicant had allegedly been ill‑treated did not show that he had entered the station during the relevant period. however, the court of appeal did not establish any causal link between that irregular detention and his confession. on 19 march 2013 the high specialised civil and criminal court upheld the judgment of the trial court and the ruling of the court of appeal.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in weinheim. he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an anti-abortion website. on 12 and 13 april 2005 the applicant distributed leaflets in the vicinity of the medical practice of dr st., the leaflets stated, inter alia, that the abortions performed by dr st. in his practice, for which he gave the address, were unlawful according to the case-law of the federal constitutional court. in addition the leaflet contained the following statements:
“according to international criminal law: aggravated murder is the intentional ‘bringing-to-death’ of an innocent human being!” ( sinngemӓβ aus den internationalen strafgesetzen: mord ist das vorsӓtzliche “zu-tode-bringen” eines unschuldigen menschen!) “the murder of human beings in auschwitz was unlawful, but the morally degraded ns state allowed the murder of innocent people and did not make it subject to criminal liability.” ( die ermordung der menschen in auschwitz war rechtswidrig, aber der moralisch verkommene ns-staat hatte den mord an den unschuldigen menschen erlaubt und nicht unter strafe gestellt.) the applicant also addressed passers-by and the physician’s presumed patients and attempted to engage with them in conversations about abortion. lodged an application for a civil injunction against the applicant and on 25 october 2005 the mannheim regional court granted the requested injunction. the court ordered the applicant to desist from speaking to passers-by in the immediate vicinity of the medical practice and labelling the abortions performed by the plaintiff unlawful with the objective of irritating female patients and preventing them from visiting dr st. on 24 february 2007 the karlsruhe court of appeal upheld the decision and slightly modified the wording specifying the geographical area concerned by the injunction. it also refused to grant leave to appeal on points of law. the regional court as well as the court of appeal both referred to a previous decision of the federal court of justice in which it had confirmed a civil injunction against similar conduct by the applicant (see paragraph 13 below). the courts held that in the case at issue there were no factual or legal differences justifying deviating from the case-law of the federal court of justice. in so far that the doctor in the present case was slightly more well-known than the doctor in the original case, the court of appeal held that this was of minor relevance. had appeared as an expert before the german parliament many years previously did not have any substantial effects on dr st’s public profile at that time. in different legal disputes was irrelevant, as trying to enforce his rights in the appropriate legal procedure could not redound to dr st. in sum, the applicant had vilified the non‑criminal professional activities of dr st. by implying that he committed criminal acts and interfered with the relationship of trust between doctor and patient, which deserved special protection against the interventions of others. the applicant had therefore severely interfered with dr st. this interference was not justified by the applicant’s freedom of expression in view of the massive “pillory effect” the applicant had created by singling out the plaintiff and criticising him in a harsh way in the immediate vicinity of his practice. on 29 may 2007 the federal court of justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid on the grounds that the applicant’s intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success. on 20 july 2009 the federal constitutional court refused to admit the applicant’s complaint for adjudication for being inadmissible, without providing reasons (no.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in weinheim. he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an anti-abortion website (babycaust.de). at the time of the proceedings outlined below, the website included, among other things, the following content. on the starting page a picture of graves was shown and the text underneath read “then: holocaust”. upon clicking on the picture, the user was directed to a page titled: “abortion – the new holocaust?” on which the holocaust was compared to abortions. on the left margin of the starting page, there were several links, of which one was called “life or death?”. upon clicking on it, the user was directed to a page with the headline “prayer requests for germany”. from that page, the reader was directed to a location-based alphabetical list mentioning the names and practice addresses of doctors who performed abortions in germany, and to a request for prayers for those doctors. somewhat farther down on the same page, it was stated that counselling centres that issued certifications:
“... are enabling and facilitating the unpunished aggravated murder of children in their mother’s womb.” (... ermöglichen und begünstigen einen straffreien kindermord im mutterschoβ.) one of the doctors listed on the applicant’s website, dr q., sought a civil injunction ordering the applicant to remove his name and address from the website. on 23 may 2006 the mannheim regional court rejected dr q.’s application on the grounds that it was a fact that dr q. performed abortions and that the remainder of the website’s content was covered by the applicant’s freedom of expression. it observed, in particular, that the present case was not comparable to similar cases which had concerned an interference with personality rights by the distribution of personalised leaflets. the publishing of a doctor’s name on a list of abortion performing doctors had no comparable “pillory effect”. subsequently dr q. appealed and – during the appeal proceedings –
modified his application, seeking a civil injunction ordering the applicant to desist from labelling abortions, such as those performed by dr q., “aggravated murder”. on 28 february 2007 the karlsruhe court of appeal granted the sought injunction. the court held that the applicant’s website led it to be understood that abortions performed by dr q. constituted “aggravated murder”. while the term “aggravated murder” did not have to be understood in a merely legal sense but could also be understood as a moral judgment, the overall presentation of the website at the very least did not exclude a reading that dr q. had perpetrated the criminal offence of aggravated murder. even though the applicant had pointed out that abortions were exempt from punishment, he had not referred to section 218a of the criminal code (see paragraph 14 below), which exempted abortions as performed by dr q., from criminal liability. in addition, the applicant had emphasised the term “aggravated murder” in the relevant parts of the website and had compared abortions with the holocaust. in sum, the statements of the website could be understood as a personalised accusation against dr q. of perpetrating aggravated murder. on 29 may 2007 the federal court of justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid on the grounds that the applicant’s intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success. on 2 july 2009 the federal constitutional court refused to admit a complaint by the applicant for adjudication for being inadmissible, without providing reasons (no.
the applicant was born on 6 july 1948 and lives in kyiv. the applicant’s judicial career started in 1976, when he was first elected to the post of judge of a district court. on 22 december 2005 the applicant was elected to the post of judge of the kyiv administrative court of appeal by the ukrainian parliament. on 6 february 2009 he was appointed president of that court by the council of judges of ukraine (a body of judicial self-governance). he was appointed for a five-year term, it being understood that he would reach the retirement age in july 2013, before the end of that term. the review was carried out in february and march 2011 and concerned the years 2009 and 2010, as well as the period between january and february 2011. the proposal was based on the results of the aforementioned review. the hcj scheduled hearings on 30 and 31 may 2011 and the applicant was invited to attend them. however, in view of information received from the kyiv administrative court of appeal on 27 may 2011 that the applicant was on annual leave until 8 july 2011, the hcj adjourned the examination of the case. it sent the applicant a summons for the next hearing, which was scheduled on 14 june 2011. in reply, the kyiv administrative court of appeal informed the hcj once again that the applicant was on holiday until 8 july 2011. on 14 june 2011 the hcj examined the case in the applicant’s absence and decided to dismiss him from the post of president of the court, relying on section 20 of the judiciary and status of judges act and section 32-1 of the high council of justice act. it stated that “the improper organisation of the court’s work was the result of the failure by the president of the court, mr a. denisov, to comply with the provisions of the applicable laws concerning the fulfilment of his administrative duties”. the decision was voted on by the hcj, whose members present on that occasion included judge k., the prosecutor general and other judicial and non-judicial members. out of the eighteen members present, eight were judges. fourteen votes were cast in favour of the applicant’s dismissal. according to the applicant, the composition of the hcj in his case included two members who on earlier occasions had initiated proceedings for his dismissal from the post of judge for an alleged “breach of oath”. furthermore, the applicant alleged that the president of the hcj and another member of the hcj had previously communicated with him, attempting – albeit without success – to influence him in the course of his professional activities. on 17 june 2011 the president of the hcj asked the kyiv administrative court of appeal to ensure that the hcj’s decision on the applicant’s dismissal was executed and that information about its execution was provided to the hcj immediately. on 23 june 2011 the applicant was dismissed from his administrative position, remaining in office as a judge of the same court. the applicant further argued that his right to participate in the hearings had not been secured. he alleged that the decision of the hcj was worded in general terms and that it did not refer to any specific facts or indicate a specific time when those facts had taken place. the applicant then asked the hac to take into account the fact that his judicial career had exceeded thirty-five years, that he had held positions of president at several courts for twenty-five years, that he had been given awards for his judicial service and that during the initial period of his presidency of the kyiv administrative court of appeal that court had moved from a demolished military barracks to premises in the city centre with proper equipment and a sufficient number of hearing rooms. on 25 august 2011 the hac held a hearing in the presence of the applicant and decided to dismiss his claim in respect of pecuniary damage without considering it. the hac adopted a decision to that effect, stating that it had no jurisdiction to determine that issue. on 11 october 2011 the hac rejected the applicant’s claim concerning his dismissal from the administrative position as unsubstantiated. in its decision the hac specified, in particular, that it had competence to review whether the impugned decision had been taken lawfully, reasonably, proportionately and, among other requirements, impartially. the hac stated that the applicant had not contested the facts forming the grounds for his dismissal and therefore those facts had been taken as established. the hac found that the hcj had acted in accordance with the constitution, the judiciary and status of judges act and the high council of justice act. in conclusion, the hac stated that the hcj had not violated the constitution or the laws of ukraine.
the applicants were born in 1973 and 1976 respectively and live in switzerland. at the relevant time, they were members of a research cooperative called the east scientific research cooperative (doğu bilimsel araştırmalar kooperatifi – “the cooperative”). between 30 may and 1 june 2005 the cooperative organised an exhibition in diyarbakır as part of the fifth diyarbakır culture and art festival, entitled “witnesses of war talk”. within the context of the exhibition, photographs of deceased members of the pkk (an illegal armed organisation), deceased members of the security forces who had been killed in security operations, persons who had lost their lives in prison, victims of enforced disappearances and victims of assassinations by unknown assailants in south-east turkey were publicly displayed. the exhibition also included statements from family members of deceased and disappeared individuals, presenting their relatives and containing their personal views on the disturbances going on in south-east turkey, and their wish for an enduring peace. on an unspecified date a criminal investigation was launched against the applicants and five other people in relation to a charge of disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk. on 31 may 2005 the applicants gave a statement to the investigating judge. both of the applicants maintained that the exhibition in question had been organised for purely sociological reasons, and that they had conducted interviews with the families of the deceased which had also been included in the exhibition. they asserted that there had been no intention to disseminate propaganda in favour of the pkk. the investigating judge dismissed an application by the public prosecutor to remand the accused in custody. on 6 october 2005 the public prosecutor filed an indictment with the diyarbakır assize court, charging the applicants and five other suspects with disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk under section 7(2) of law no. throughout the proceedings before the diyarbakır assize court the applicants repeated their previous statements and contended that photographs of deceased members of the security forces had also been displayed in the exhibition alongside those of members of the pkk. on 18 may 2006 the diyarbakır assize court convicted both applicants of disseminating propaganda in favour of an illegal organisation under section 7(2) of law no. the applicants were sentenced to two years and a year and eight months’ imprisonment, respectively. in its judgment, the court observed that the invitations to the exhibition had referred to the armed conflict between the security forces and the pkk as a “war”, and the pkk members as “guerrillas”, thus glorifying the deceased terrorists and inciting young people to become members of the pkk. the court also noted that a “war” was an armed conflict between two states and a “guerrilla” was an armed person who fought against unjust occupation. the court further observed that a couple of photographs of deceased soldiers had also been displayed in order to conceal the accused’s intention to incite young people to join the pkk. on 9 june 2009 the court of cassation quashed the judgment in respect of the second applicant, holding that the case should be reviewed in the light of article 231 of the code of criminal procedure (law no. 5271), which regulates the suspension of a judgment’s pronouncement. however, the trial court’s judgment of 18 may 2006 became final in respect of the first applicant. on 3 august 2009 the decision of the court of cassation was filed with the registry of the first-instance court. on 22 october 2009, in accordance with article 231 of the code of criminal procedure, the diyarbakır assize court decided to suspend the pronouncement of its judgment in respect of the second applicant on the condition that he did not commit another intentional offence for a period of five years. the first applicant served the sentence arising from the judgment of 18 may 2006.
the applicant was born in 1983 and lives in tunceli. on 5 april 2007 the applicant attended a concert performed by a band called “grup yorum” in the hozat district of tunceli. on 17 october 2007 the malatya public prosecutor filed an indictment with the malatya assize court, charging the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of the dhkp/c (revolutionary people’s liberation party/front), an illegal armed organisation, under section 7 (2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. the public prosecutor noted that the applicant had chanted the following slogans during the concert: “mahir, hüseyin, ulaş; fight until emancipation”[1] (“mahir, hüseyin, ulaş; kurtuluşa kadar savaş”); “martyrs of the revolution are immortal” (“devrim şehitleri ölümsüzdür”); “revolutionary prisoners are our honour” (“devrimci tutsaklar onurumuzdur”); and “victory on mountains, emancipation at the front; long live victory, long live resistance” (“dağlarda zafer, cephede kurtuluş; yaşasın zafer, yaşasın direniş”). during the investigation and the proceedings against him, the applicant stated that he had attended the concert in question and chanted the slogans “music shall not stop, dance shall continue” (“türküler susmaz , halaylar sürer”) and “we will not be defeated by oppression” (“baskılar bizi yıldıramaz”). he also noted that he had been on the concert’s organising committee. on 6 march 2008 the malatya assize court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to ten months’ imprisonment. in its judgment, on the basis of a police report on a police video recording of the concert of 5 april 2007, the indictment, the applicant’s defence submissions, and the public prosecutor’s observations on the merits of the case, the court considered it established that the applicant had chanted the slogans noted in the indictment. the court considered that the concert, for which legal and administrative authorisation had been obtained, had become a propaganda activity in favour of the dhkp/c, and that the applicant had chanted slogans used by that organisation. the malatya assize court concluded that the applicant had committed the offence of disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation. on 4 july 2011 the court of cassation upheld the first-instance court’s judgment. between 6 october 2011 and 1 august 2012 the applicant duly served his prison sentence.
the applicant was born in 1971 and serves his life sentence in a correctional colony in the yamalo-nenetskiy region of russia. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. on 27 march 2003 the applicant was arrested on charges of illegal possession of firearms, two armed robberies of local post offices, murder of three russian post service cash messengers and attempted murder of the fourth one. on 14 october 2003 the case was sent to the supreme court of the buryatia republic (“the regional court”) for trial. twice, on 20 april 2004 and 22 may 2007, the applicant was convicted as charged. both convictions were set aside by the supreme court of russia. on 12 september 2008, in the course of the third round of jury trial, the regional court decided, upon a request by a representative of the russian post, to close proceedings to the public. it dismissed the applicant’s objections made with reference to article 6 § 1 of the convention. in doing so the presiding judge referred to the case-file documents containing information about security measures and equipment in post offices, weaponry, schedules and routes of cash messengers, etc. under the relevant russian post regulations that information was classified as “for internal use only”. the regional court found that that information was a trade secret protected by the commercial secrets act (federal law no. 98-fz of 29 july 2004) and that its disclosure could have harmed public interests. every hearing after 12 september 2008 was held in camera. on 14 december 2008 the jury convicted the applicant as charged. in the last days of december the trial judge sentenced him to life imprisonment. on 4 june 2009 the supreme court quashed the conviction on one count and upheld the remainder of the verdict and sentence. the court of appeal held, in particular, that the decision to dispense with a public hearing had been lawful and rejected, in a summary fashion, the relevant arguments by the applicant.
he is currently serving a prison sentence. on 17 april 1999 the fier district court (“the district court”), following proceedings in which the applicant did not take part, convicted the applicant and his two co-accused of a number of serious criminal offences. it sentenced the applicant to death in absentia. on 1 june 1999 the vlora court of appeal (“the court of appeal”), following appeals lodged by the two other co-accused, upheld the district court’s decision of 17 april 1999. on 8 may 2001, following appeals lodged by the applicant’s co‑accused, the supreme court upheld the lower courts’ decisions. however, it sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment. on 1 december 2006 the applicant was extradited to albania from italy. he was officially informed of his conviction in absentia on the same day. on 8 december 2006 the applicant lodged an application with the district court for leave to appeal out of time. on 25 january 2007 the district court dismissed the application, finding that the supreme court’s decision of 8 may 2001 had become res judicata and that, consequently, the applicant could not be tried a second time for the same offence. on 8 june 2007 and 2 july 2010, following the applicant’s appeals, the court of appeal and the supreme court, respectively, upheld that decision. on 8 june 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal against the supreme court’s decision of 2 july 2010. he also complained about the unfairness of the proceedings in absentia. on 21 september 2011, the constitutional court, sitting as a full bench, rejected the appeal by a majority. it found that the applicant’s complaint against the supreme court’s decision of 2 july 2010 was manifestly ill-founded. as regards his complaint about the unfairness of the proceedings in absentia, and the domestic courts’ dismissal of his application for leave to appeal out of time, the constitutional court noted that the applicant had not complained about the domestic courts’ decisions taken in absentia (see paragraphs 6-8 above). it further found that that complaint was in any event time-barred. it also reasoned that in the present case the supreme court’s unifying decision no. 1 of 20 january 2011 was applicable (see izet haxhia v. albania, no. in addition, it noted that although the appeals before the supreme court against the lower courts’ decision were lodged by the co‑accused and not the applicant, the supreme court had examined and amended the lower courts’ decisions of 17 april and 1 june 1999 also in respect of the applicant. on an unspecified date in 2007 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal against the district court’s decision of 17 april 1999, the court of appeal’s decision of 1 june 1999 and the supreme court’s decision of 8 may 2001 complaining about his conviction in absentia. on 21 september 2007 the constitutional court dismissed the appeal as having been lodged out of time, considering that the two-year time-limit had started to run as from 8 may 2001. the decision was communicated to the applicant’s lawyer on 25 september 2007.
the applicant was born in 1960 and lives in diyarbakır. on 30 september 2007 a reading out of a press statement and a march were held in diyarbakır in order to protest about the conditions of detention and alleged poisoning of abdullah öcalan, the leader of the pkk (kurdistan workers’ party), an illegal armed organisation. the protesters gathered in front of the building of the diyarbakır branch of the democratic society party (demokratik toplum partisi) (dtp) where a press statement was read out. the applicant, as a member of the dtp, participated in the gathering and the ensuing march. according to a police report dated 9 october 2007, the applicant was seen while carrying a banner which read “i̇nsanlık zehirleniyor” (“the humanity is being poisoned”) and applauding together with other demonstrators in the police video footage. on 9 october 2007 the applicant was taken into police custody. on the same day she was detained on remand. on 17 october 2007 the diyarbakır public prosecutor charged the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. 3713) on account of the content of the banner she had carried during the demonstration of 30 september 2007. on 4 december 2007 the applicant was released pending trial. on 18 march 2008 the diyarbakır assize court convicted the applicant as charged. the court found it established, on the basis of an expert report on the police video footage, that the applicant had been together with other persons who had chanted the slogan “be serok jiyan nabe” (“there is no life without the leader”) and that she had carried a banner which read “the humanity is being poisoned”. the applicant was sentenced to ten months’ imprisonment. on 9 january 2012 the court of cassation upheld the judgment of 18 march 2008. on an unspecified date the applicant started serving her prison sentence. on 17 july 2012, upon the applicant’s request, the diyarbakır assize court ordered her release from prison, in accordance with law no. 6352 which had entered into force on 5 july 2012 and which had amended certain provisions of law no.
the first applicant was born in 1972 and is detained in vilnius. the second applicant was born in 1982 and is detained in pravieniškės. the first applicant has been detained in lukiškės remand prison since 17 march 2008. on 27 july 2012 he lodged a civil claim against the state, alleging that he was being detained in overcrowded and unsanitary cells. he claimed 74,690 lithuanian litai (ltl – approximately 21,630 euros (eur)) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. on 8 november 2012 the vilnius regional administrative court allowed in part the applicant’s claim. it firstly held that the time‑limit for claiming damages was three years after the damage arose, and accordingly dismissed the part of the applicant’s claim concerning the period before 27 july 2009 as time‑barred. the court then examined various documents provided by the prison authorities and found that, during the remaining period, for about one year and seven months the size of the personal space afforded to the applicant had not complied with the domestic requirements (until 11 may 2010 the minimum personal space in prison cells stipulated by domestic law was 5 sq. the court also found, on the basis of reports submitted by domestic public healthcare authorities, that the temperature and the amount of natural light in some of the cells in which the applicant had been detained had not complied with domestic hygiene norms. however, it dismissed as unproved the applicant’s allegations that the cells had been dilapidated and that there had been parasites and rodents. furthermore, the court considered that the applicant had not proved that his health had deteriorated as a result of the conditions of his detention. the applicant was awarded ltl 1,500 (approximately eur 434) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision, but on 20 may 2013 the supreme administrative court dismissed his appeal and upheld the lower court’s decision in its entirety. the second applicant was detained in vilnius correctional facility from 8 june 2012 to 5 february 2016. on 4 october 2013 he lodged a civil claim against the state, alleging that he was being detained in overcrowded dormitory‑type rooms. he claimed ltl 11,000 (approximately eur 3,200) in respect of non‑pecuniary damage. on 12 march 2014 the vilnius regional administrative court allowed in part the applicant’s claim. the court found that for seventy‑nine days the applicant had had 2.9 sq. m of personal space, in breach of the domestic requirement of 3.1 sq. it also found that for eighteen days, when the applicant had been kept under stricter disciplinary regime, he had had 3.34 sq. m of personal space, in breach of the domestic requirement of 3.6 sq. however, the court noted that the applicant had been allowed to move freely around the correctional facility during the day, except when he had been serving disciplinary penalties, and that the material conditions of his detention had been appropriate. it also considered that the applicant had not proved that his health had deteriorated as a result of the conditions of his detention. the court therefore dismissed the applicant’s claim for non‑pecuniary damages. the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision and on 15 may 2015 the supreme administrative court upheld in part his appeal. it found that, according to the applicant’s submissions which the administration of the correctional facility had failed to refute, for 274 days he had had between 2.33 and 3.04 sq. m of personal space, in breach of the relevant domestic requirements. the court considered that, despite the fact that the applicant had been allowed to move freely during the day and that the material conditions of detention had been appropriate, there were grounds to award him non-pecuniary damages.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in adıyaman. on 17 october 1999 the applicant sat an examination in order to become a public servant. she was successful in the examination and on 27 june 2000 she was notified by the state personnel department attached to the prime minister’s office that she had been appointed to the post of security officer in the kilis branch of tedaş, the state-run electricity company. on 4 september 2000 the kilis branch of tedaş informed the applicant that she would not be appointed to a post in that office as she did not fulfil the requirements of “being a man” and “having completed military service”. on an unspecified date the applicant lodged an action against tedaş with the ankara administrative court requesting the annulment of the decision of the kilis branch of tedaş. in her deposition, the applicant noted that being a man was not a requirement for appointment to the post in question and that she fulfilled all the requirements for that post. on an unspecified date the general directorate of tedaş submitted to the administrative court that one of the requirements for the post in question had been declared by the state personnel department as “having completed military service” and that therefore only men could be appointed to the post. the applicant, being a woman, could therefore not be recruited as a security officer. on 28 november 2001 the ankara administrative court annulled the decision of the kilis branch of tedaş. the court held that the requirement of “having completed military service” should be considered to apply only to male candidates and that there had been no restriction on women working as security officers in tedaş. on 30 january 2002 tedaş lodged an appeal against the judgment of 28 november 2001. on 1 april 2003 the applicant was recruited by tedaş. on 21 october 2003 the supreme administrative court quashed the judgment of the ankara administrative court, holding that the requirement regarding military service demonstrated that the post in question was reserved for male candidates. the high court therefore found that the administration’s decision had been in accordance with the law. on 19 march 2004 the applicant was dismissed from her post. on 30 december 2004 the ankara administrative court dismissed the applicant’s case, taking into consideration the decision of the supreme administrative court. on 7 may 2007 the supreme administrative court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the judgment of 30 december 2004. on 12 july 2007 the supreme administrative court’s judgment was notified to the applicant.
the applicant was born in 1955 and lives in assemini (italy). by a decision of 4 december 2006 of the cantonal prosecutor of the hercegovina-neretva canton (hercegovačko-neretvanski kanton; one of the ten cantons of the federation of bosnia and herzegovina) the applicant was granted the reimbursement of costs which she had incurred as a witness in the amount of 519 convertible marks (bam)[1]. on 29 february 2008 the mostar municipal court (“the municipal court”) rejected the applicant’s request for the enforcement of this decision, deeming it unenforceable. on 18 september 2008 the mostar cantonal court (“the cantonal court”) quashed this decision and remitted the case for reconsideration. on 19 november 2008 the municipal court issued a writ of execution (rješenje o izvršenju). on 19 june 2009 the municipal court upheld the objection lodged against this decision. on 1 april 2010 the cantonal court quashed this decision and again remitted the case to the municipal court. on 18 february 2011 the municipal court partly accepted the objection against the writ of execution specifically as regards the interest on the main debt calculated from 4 january 2007, and the interest on the total costs of the enforcement proceedings. on 2 december 2011 the cantonal court upheld this decision. on 19 september 2013 the supreme court of the federation of bosnia and herzegovina dismissed the applicant’s request for revision as inadmissible. on 23 december 2013 the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina partially accepted the applicant’s appeal and thereby found a violation of her right to a trial within a reasonable time, due to the non-enforcement of the decision of the municipal court of 18 february 2011 (see paragraph 12 above). it also ordered the hercegovina-neretva canton to undertake measures in order to enforce the decision within a reasonable time. the constitutional court, however, did not award the non-pecuniary damage requested by the applicant. on 21 october 2014 the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina confirmed that the final decision in question had not yet been enforced. on 18 december 2014 the said final decision was enforced and the applicant was paid in cash. by a judgment of the municipal court of 3 april 2009, which became final on 16 december 2009, a certain p.m. was ordered to pay the applicant the costs of civil proceedings in the amount of bam 1,959. on 31 october 2010 the applicant submitted to the municipal court a request for the enforcement of this judgment. on 14 september 2011, 4 november 2011 and 5 october 2012 the applicant submitted requests for the acceleration of the enforcement proceedings. on 5 december 2012 the municipal court issued a writ of execution. on 13 june 2013 the municipal court dismissed the objection lodged against its decision of 5 december 2012, and p.m. subsequently appealed this decision to the cantonal court. on 17 september 2013 the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina found a violation of the applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time, due to the duration of the enforcement proceedings before the municipal court. it further ordered the cantonal court to urgently rule on the appeal lodged by p.m. the constitutional court, however, did not award the non-pecuniary damage requested by the applicant. on 16 october 2013 the cantonal court dismissed the appeal lodged by p.m. 25. on 11 june 2015 the municipal court issued a writ of execution. on 4 august 2016 the said final judgment was enforced and the applicant was paid in cash on her bank account in bosnia and herzegovina. it appears that the applicant was still living in italy at that time.

the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in diyarbakır. at the time of the events giving rise to the application, the applicant was the head of the district branch of the democratic people’s party (demokratik halklar partisi – dehap) in the ergani district of diyarbakır. on 15 february 2005, on the anniversary of the arrest and transfer of abdullah öcalan, the leader of the pkk[1], to turkey, the ergani district branch of dehap organised a gathering in front of the district branch office in order to read out a press statement. the applicant read the statement in question. on 31 may 2005 the ergani public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the ergani criminal court against twenty-six persons, including the applicant, charging them with breach of the marches and demonstrations act (law no. 2911) on account of their participation in the above-mentioned event. they were accused of participating in the gathering and carrying banners with slogans such as “the solution is in i̇mralı[2]” (“çözüm i̇mralı’da”), “solitary confinement is a crime against humanity” (“tecrit insanlık suçudur”), “not eu, not us, öcalan has the solution” (“ne ab ne abd, çözüm öcalan’da”) , “the youth is öcalan’s fedai”[3] (“gençlik apo’nun fedaisidir”), and “freedom to öcalan” (“öcalan’a özgürlük”), as well as posters of abdullah öcalan. they were also accused of chanting slogans such as “to the sun, to freedom” (güneşe güneşe, özgürleşmeye”), “long live the brotherhood of peoples” (“yaşasın halkların kardeşliği”), “may those hands which aim to damage peace be broken” (“barışa uzanan eller kırılsın”), “a tooth for a tooth, blood for blood, we are with you” (“dişe diş kana kan, seninleyiz”) and “akp, be careful, do not abuse our patience” (“akp şaşırma, sabrımızı taşırma”). on 5 october 2006 the ergani criminal court decided that it lacked jurisdiction to examine the case. it held that the impugned acts constituted the offence proscribed by section 7 (2) of law no. 3713 and that the accused should therefore be tried by the diyarbakır assize court. on an unspecified date the diyarbakır assize court remitted the case file to the ergani criminal court. on 19 march 2007 the ergani criminal court once again decided that the diyarbakır assize court had jurisdiction over the case. on 10 august 2007 the sixth chamber of the diyarbakır assize court began the trial in the case. on 15 april 2010 the diyarbakır public prosecutor submitted to the first-instance court his observations on the merits of the case. according to those submissions, the public prosecutor considered that the applicant should be convicted under section 7 (2) of law no. 3713, as the press statement read out by him had referred to abdullah öcalan as the “honourable kurdish people’s leader”. on the same day the diyarbakır assize court convicted the applicant of disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation under section 7 (2) of law no. the court based its judgment, among others, on a police report regarding the reading out of the press statement dated 15 february 2005 and a police report dated 23 february 2005 on the examination of a police video recording of the event of 15 february 2005. the court judgment read as follows:
“... it has been decided that ahmet kınık and r.a. committed the offence proscribed by section 7(2) of law no. 3713, as they participated in the reading out of a press statement organised by the dehap in ergani on 15 february 2005 on the anniversary of the arrest of abdullah öcalan, and chanted slogans such as ‘the solution is in i̇mralı’, ‘solitary confinement is a crime against humanity’, ‘not eu, not us, öcalan has the solution’, and ‘the youth is öcalan’s fedai’. they marched and chanted these slogans without obtaining prior permission.” the sixth chamber of the diyarbakır assize court sentenced the applicant to ten months’ imprisonment but decided to suspend the pronouncement of the judgment (hükmün açıklanmasının geri bırakılması) for a period of five years, under article 231 of the code of criminal procedure. on 5 july 2010 the applicant objected to the decision of the assize court to suspend the pronouncement of the judgment. on 22 november 2010 the fourth chamber of the diyarbakır assize court dismissed the applicant’s objection.
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in suponevo, the bryansk region. he also referred to witness statements in criminal proceedings against anna stregeleva, the former head of the regional department of the federal agency for state property management (росимущество), which had concerned the misappropriation of other plots of land and ended with ms stregeleva’s conviction. the article read as follows, in so far as relevant:
“maksim kosenkov and ruslan pogulyayev will be on trial in bryansk. they ‘certified’ the papers with makeshift stamps and took them to the bryansk region department of the state register (росреестр). try to register your property at that department. they will wear you down with requests for piles of papers. however, in this case the credulous clerks easily signed the documents after accepting the fakes. their market value exceeded 6,400,000 roubles. the lads face up to ten years’ imprisonment for this. they could be doing good deeds, raising their kids. 1 remand prison in moscow] and who happily got out with a million in compensation. it looks like very few people understood that material. we shall have to shake the dust off those volumes once more. there are almost 66 hectares of land there. the thing is, they were going to build cottages there and sell them at triple the price. however, the bezhitskiy lads may face up to ten years of prison time for a lesser crime. mr simonenko brought an action for defamation against the applicant and sought damages of 300,000 russian roubles (rub). “however, they got carried away by the example of the big bryansk thieves and failed to take into account that the latter were protected from all sides – by the powers that be, the party, relations, and so on”; 4. “... having become skilled at the misappropriation of land, the thief-officials and a deputy decided to pocket that billion. on 26 september 2012 the bryanskiy district court of the bryansk region dismissed the claim (“the bryanskiy district court”). as regards the second sentence, the court found that the claimant had failed to prove that he was the one referred to in the passage as many people with the surname simonenko lived in the bryansk region. furthermore, the sentence in question had not contained information about any facts but had merely expressed the author’s opinion and his suppositions. it also ordered the applicant to pay fees of rub 200. the lads wanted to replicate the deed of the bryansk thieves from the local administration, but they lacked the power, although they had skills in abundance”, it was clear that the first, third and fourth sentences constituted assertions to the effect that the claimant had committed offences and had abused his official position for personal gain. it went on to conclude that the above passages, which contained negative judgments, were insulting and discrediting to the moral character of the claimant. they had also diminished his business reputation, portrayed him negatively as a person engaged in criminal activity, as a state official who abused his powers for mercenary ends, and created a wrong perception about the claimant in the eyes of society, both as a citizen and as a deputy governor of the bryansk region. on 27 december 2012 the bryansk regional court refused the applicant leave to lodge a cassation appeal. on 23 april 2013 the bryanskiy district court granted the claim. the court found that the first passage could not be considered as constituting a statement of fact but was rather a value judgment. the applicant had referred to “big bryansk thieves”, and, given that the article contained comments on criminal proceeding instituted against other people from the bryansk administration, it was impossible to regard the passage as relating specifically to mr denin.
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in suponevo, the bryansk region. on 21 february 2008 the applicant published an article in bryanskiye budni no. 429/7 headlined “fedorov always takes the lead” (“федоров всегда впереди”) about viktor fedorovich fedorov, a member of the bryansk region duma and the head of the regional committee on legislation, law and order and state service. now viktor fedorovich is a member of the duma faction of united russia, as is mr bugayev. a very convenient and interesting position which, most importantly, is based on principle. in fact, they both ‘dumped’ the social democrat nikolay rudenok. others contend that that is just politics ...
now the ‘sweet couple’ of former social democrats are united in their dislike of the speaker of the regional duma vladimir gaydukov. at present mr fedorov is at a political crossroads. to be a candidate in a single-member constituency entails expenses, and that would go against his principles. sources note that he all too often takes a ‘promenade’ there in his official cars. and each one was a foreign car that was cooler than the one before ...” 8. the following is the original russian text:
“в областную же думу он попал по партийным спискам социал-демократов. помню, что на большом красивом плакате федоров красовался рядом с анатолием бугаевым и николаем руденком. фактически и один, и другой «кинули» лидера социал-демократов николая руденка. в настоящее время господин федоров на политическом распутье. баллотироваться по одномандатному избирательному округу – надо раскошеливаться, а это не в его правилах. источники отмечают, что слишком часто он совершает туда «променаж» на служебных автомобилях. но потом стало ясно, что это «опыт» несколько другого рода ...

the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in županja. on 5 july 2011 the applicant was indicted before the zagreb municipal criminal court (općinski kazneni sud u zagrebu) on charges of causing a road accident under article 272 of the criminal code. the applicant was tried in summary proceedings (skraćeni postupak). on 4 may 2012 the zagreb municipal criminal court convicted the applicant as charged and gave him a suspended sentence of four months’ imprisonment with two years’ probation. on 23 may 2012 the applicant appealed against his conviction and asked to be allowed to appear at the session of the appeal panel. on 15 january 2013 the zagreb county court (županijski sud u zagrebu), without informing the applicant or his lawyer, examined the case without holding a hearing. it dismissed the appeal and upheld the applicant’s conviction and sentence. the applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske), complaining, inter alia, that he had not been allowed to appear at the session of the appeal panel. on 18 september 2013 the constitutional court declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. that decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 4 october 2013.
the applicants were born in 1973 and 1970 respectively, and live in odessa. her mother, n., was its director and owner. on 23 july 2001 the odessa prymorskyy district prosecutor’s office (“the prymorskyy prosecutor’s office”) opened a criminal case against the officials of company y. on suspicion of forgery of quality certificates for the company’s goods. as the first applicant lost control of her vehicle, it collided with a car parked nearby, which belonged to a private person, g. 11. she asked the court to declare the officers’ actions unlawful and to oblige them to make a public apology to her. the prosecutor gave the following reasons for that decision. the first applicant had also had bruises on her wrists and arms. she challenged the ruling before the odessa suvorivskyy district court (“the suvorivskyy court”). as confirmed by a postal receipt, the first applicant sent the above complaint on 3 january 2002 and the court received it on 4 january 2002. on 21 january 2002 the first applicant appealed against the above ruling to the odessa regional court of appeal. she submitted that the correct date on which she had lodged her complaint was 3 january 2002[2] and she had not missed the seven-day time-limit, given that there had been official holidays during which neither the post office nor the court had been open. however, the clerk who had registered it had been dismissed in february 2003. on 26 april 2005 the first applicant again challenged the prosecutor’s ruling of 20 december 2001 before the suvorivskyy court. the case file does not contain any further information in that regard. the reason for the rejection was that on 20 december 2001 the prosecutor had refused to institute criminal proceedings regarding the matter (see paragraph 16 above). the suvorivskyy court adjourned hearings on several occasions owing to the absence of the first applicant and the absence of the victims and witnesses. one of them had a bite wound on his right wrist possibly originating from a human bite, and an abrasion on his right hand that might have resulted from scratching by handcuffs. another officer had abrasions on his face and right arm possibly resulting from being scratched with fingernails. furthermore, the police officers involved had been wearing plain clothes. on 18 january 2006 the suvorivskyy court started a retrial. the case file before the court does not contain a copy of that ruling. on 10 february 2009 the odessa regional court of appeal upheld the judgment of 10 october 2008 and the separate ruling. after the seizure of the foodstuffs on 24 july 2001, the prosecuting authorities transferred them to a private company, d. (“company d.”), for storage purposes. following several unsuccessful complaints to the prosecuting authorities in respect of the search and seizure, on an unspecified date the second applicant brought a commercial claim against company d., seeking the return of his property, as well as compensation for lost profit. on 15 april 2002 the odessa commercial court of appeal allowed an appeal by the defendant in part and deleted certain foodstuffs from a list referred to in the judgment of 18 january 2002. apparently, the appellate court was not aware of the ruling of 14 february 2002. on 29 may 2002 the higher commercial court quashed the lower courts’ decisions and rejected the second applicant’s claim. on 18 june 2002 the second applicant applied to the higher commercial court for a review of its ruling of 29 may 2002 on the basis of newly discovered circumstances, namely the prymorskyy court’s decision of 24 may 2002 recognising that the criminal investigation against the company y. officials had been unlawful (see paragraph 11 above). it held that the impugned seizure had taken place within the criminal proceedings, whose institution had been recognised as unlawful. furthermore, the police had had no procedural documents authorising them to seize the goods in question.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in zagreb. she gave birth to her first three children in hospital. in 2011 she became pregnant with her fourth child and had a due date in february 2012. in november 2011 she sent a letter to the croatian chamber of midwives (hrvatska komora primalja), enquiring about the possibility of having professional assistance with a home birth. she explained that her first three hospital deliveries had gone normally, without the need for much medical intervention, but that she had not felt fulfilled afterwards. she therefore wanted to give birth to her fourth child at home. on 1 december 2011 she received a reply that according to the relevant domestic legislation health professionals, including midwives, were unable to assist with home births. in particular, although the act on midwifery allowed the setting up of private practices by midwives, the healthcare act, as the general act in the sector, still did not expressly provide for such a possibility. therefore, since the matter was not clearly regulated, no midwife had set up a private practice or officially assisted with home births. considering the above, we are of the opinion that the protection of children, who do not choose the circumstances of their coming into this world, takes precedence over respect for a woman’s right to freely choose to give birth outside a medical facility.” the croatian chamber of midwives thus declined to assist with the applicant’s planned home birth. it noted that home births nevertheless occurred in croatia, and for that reason it had urged the ministry of health to clearly regulate the matter as soon as possible. on 15 february 2012 the applicant gave birth to her child at home, assisted by a midwife from abroad. after the birth a paediatrician and a gynaecologist allegedly declined to examine the applicant and her baby but she eventually managed to find doctors who examined them both. on 23 february 2012 the applicant registered the birth and obtained a birth certificate. on 11 may 2011 the ministry of health sent a letter in reply to an enquiry from the ombudswoman for children (pravobraniteljica za djecu), which stated that the relevant domestic law provided that babies were to be delivered in medical facilities. the question of home births had not been regulated by law and medical assistance in such procedures was considered as quackery. it further stated that home births were the personal responsibility of the mother and the person assisting with the delivery. in the event of a delivery outside a medical facility and where a woman claiming to be the mother did not have any medical documentation, the doctor carrying out the first examination of the child was obliged to make note of the absence of such documents. the doctor was not allowed to register data which he or she was not able to verify. it further stated that officials were obliged to verify data reported to them before putting anything down in the state register. the medical documentation required for proving such circumstances was a matter for the health administration authorities. on 31 may 2012 the ministry of health replied to an enquiry from parents in action – roda ngo by saying that it had never instructed doctors not to examine children born at home. on the contrary, having regard to the increased frequency of situations in which doctors were faced with having to examine children born at home without any medical documentation, it had consistently held that doctors were obliged to examine such children but were not allowed to register any data that they were not able to verify. it added that home birth was still not regulated by law and that therefore there was no mechanism for registering requests for home birth or regulations on the duty to report them. on 24 january 2012 the croatian chamber of midwives reported on a case in which, according to the media coverage, a woman who had given birth at home had been separated from her child for two days. in particular, the hospital had called the police and social workers in order to establish that she was indeed the child’s mother after she had refused to be examined by a gynaecologist in a hospital. in addition, several midwives suspected of having taken part in the birth had been questioned by the police. according to information submitted by the government, no health professional has ever been prosecuted in criminal proceedings or sanctioned for assisting with a home birth. in the concluding observations on the combined fourth and fifth periodic reports on croatia issued on 24 july 2015, the committee on the elimination of discrimination against women expressed concern regarding the lack of oversight procedures and mechanisms for ensuring adequate standards of care, the protection of women’s rights and their autonomy during deliveries and the lack of options for giving birth outside hospitals.
on 21 november 2016 the civil and criminal court (tribunale civile e penale) of rome decided to issue a warrant for the applicant’s arrest, as he was suspected of tax evasion, money laundering, embezzlement and membership of a transnational criminal organisation. on 13 december 2016, via a “red notice” issued through interpol, the italian judicial authorities requested the applicant’s provisional arrest (voorlopige aanhouding) for the purpose of extradition. in the days following his arrest the applicant was visited several times by a doctor, who found that the applicant had received treatment for a malignancy on his tongue in 2015, and that this should be monitored regularly. in addition, the applicant’s blood pressure was too high. he was prescribed medication, and after a few days the applicant’s blood pressure had sufficiently decreased. in his opinion, his fragile state of health and considerable business interests in sint maarten opposed (a continuation of) his detention. on 20 december 2016 the sint maarten prosecution authorities apparently decided to transfer the applicant from sint maarten to curaçao, another country within the kingdom of the netherlands. on 4 january 2017 the joint court rejected the applicant’s request for suspension of his detention. it noted that the applicant had not established that he was unable to receive adequate medical care in detention or that his business interests were at risk. the joint court, taking all interests at stake into consideration – including the procurator general’s substantiated claim that there was a high risk of absconding – decided to reject the applicant’s request for suspension of his detention. no further appeal lay against that decision. on 3 february 2017 the procurator general filed a request for the applicant’s extradition with the joint court. a hearing was initially fixed for 21 march 2017 but, at the applicant’s request, was rescheduled for 16 may 2017. on 7 february 2017 the applicant filed a fresh application with the joint court, requesting that his detention be either terminated or suspended. he lastly argued that the police cells in which he had been held since 13 december 2016 were neither intended nor suitable for longer periods of detention. on 22 february 2017 the joint court accepted the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 20 december 2016 to transfer him to curaçao. on this point, it found that all formalities for the applicant’s detention pending extradition had been satisfied. lastly, the joint court saw no reason to grant the applicant bail. in addition, the dentist prescribed antibiotics and a disinfectant for irritated gums. he further recommended that the applicant be seen by a dentist every three to four months to avoid similar infections. on 3 april 2017 the dentist reported that the infection had subsided but the build-up of plaque was already visible again, and this was probably due to the lack of possibilities for adequate oral hygiene. on this point, he submitted that for three months he had been staying in a cell measuring 16 square metres which he often had to share with five or sometimes even six other persons. furthermore, the cells were dark and unhygienic and there was a foul smell. he further submitted that the unhygienic circumstances had caused the infection diagnosed by the dentist on 13 march 2017. the applicant could be transferred to curaçao, where the conditions of detention were better, but the applicant had opposed such a transfer. in this respect the joint court took into account that during the hearing on 4 april 2017, on which his request was examined, it was confirmed that the applicant by that time was no longer detained in a multi-occupancy cell, but in a single-occupancy cell, that he daily received vitamins and that, if he wished so, he could see a doctor or dentist. it also took into account that, in reply to an explicit question it had put to him about a possible voluntary transfer to curaçao, the applicant had indicated that this was not an option for him. lastly, it found no medical reason for the applicant to be transferred to the sickbay of point blanche prison. on 20 june 2017, following a hearing held on 16 may 2017, the joint court declared the applicant’s extradition permissible on the basis of the facts as set out in the decision of 21 november 2016 of the civil and criminal court of rome, facts which also constituted criminal offences under the laws of sint maarten. on 16 august 2017 the applicant was extradited to italy.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in kazan. in 1969 the shumelka river in tveretinovka, republic of tatarstan, was dammed and an artificial lake was created. the original owner of the plot of land that contained the lake was a state fur farm. in 2003 the fur farm sold the plot of land and the lake to a private limited liability company through a public sale by tender. the new owner’s title to the plot of land was registered in the state land register. on 5 may 2008 the company sold the land to the applicant through a public sale by tender. the applicant’s title to the plot of land was registered in the state land register and on 28 june 2008 the applicant was issued with the relevant certificate. on 18 october 2011, following bankruptcy proceedings, the limited liability company was de-registered as a legal entity. on 29 march 2012 the regional agency for management of state property brought a civil action against the applicant, seeking to reclaim the plot of land and the lake. on 5 may 2012 the pestrechinskiy district court of the republic of tatarstan granted the claims in full. the court noted that, pursuant to the applicable legislation, the lake could not be owned by a private entity or a person and should be returned to the state. the court further noted that the public sale by tender in 2008 had been conducted in contravention of certain regulations (in particular, the announcement concerning the sale had not been published in the newspapers indicated in the state-approved list) and refused to apply the three-year statute of limitations to the agency’s claims. on 5 july 2012 the supreme court of the republic of tatarstan quashed the judgment of 5 may 2012 on appeal and rejected the claims in full. the court considered that the district court had erred in the interpretation of the applicable legislation and that the plot of land with the lake could be owned by a private party. it further noted that, in any event, the agency’s claim should be dismissed for its failure to bring its action within the three-year time-limit. in this connection the court referred to the fact that (1) the state had been aware that the contested property had left its possession back in 2003 when the plot of land had been sold by the state farm to a private company and the new owner’s title to the property had been registered in the state land register and (2) the state had been aware that the applicant had owned the plot of land since 2008 when the applicant’s title to the property had been registered in the state land register. on 14 september 2012 the supreme court referred the matter for a review of points of law. on 10 october 2012 the presidium of the supreme court quashed the appeal judgement of 5 july 2012 and upheld the judgment of 5 may 2008, by way of a points-of-law review. it rejected the applicant’s request to apply the statute of limitations, considering that the agency had learnt about the infringement of the state’s rights in respect of the plot of land only in 2012 after receiving a letter from the federal water resources agency (федеральное агентство водных ресурсов россии). on 22 february 2013 the plot of land was registered as federal property in the state land register. on an unspecified date the applicant challenged the imposition of a fine on her in 2011 as the owner of the plot of land. she claimed that she had not been the owner of the plot of land. on 19 april 2013 the vakhitovskiy district court of kazan dismissed the applicant’s claims. it noted that the applicant had been the owner of the plot of land in 2011 and that the parties had not furnished any evidence to the contrary.
on 17 april 1936 the government of the union of soviet socialist republics (“the ussr”) entrusted the management of the network of recreational facilities for workers in the ussr to the union-wide central council of trade unions (“the union-wide council”), the central authority for the ussr’s official state-controlled trade unions. the federation was also declared the republican council’s legal successor. on 24 august 1991 ukraine declared its independence. on 10 september 1991 the law on enterprises, establishments and organisations of the soviet union located on the territory of ukraine was enacted. all contracts concluded in breach of the 1990 moratorium were declared null and void. on 22 november 1991 the federation decided to create upo, a joint-stock company (currently, a private joint-stock company). pursuant to that decision, the federation transferred to upo various assets (including the sanatorium). on 23 december 1991 the local authorities registered upo. by a resolution of 4 march 1992 on the implementation of the law of ukraine on privatisation of property of state enterprises, the parliament of ukraine repealed the resolution of 29 november 1990 and instructed the cabinet of ministers of ukraine to draw up, by 15 march 1992, a list of enterprises which had concluded contracts whereby title to state property had been transferred, in breach of the 1990 moratorium. by a resolution of 4 february 1994 on the property of union-wide civic organisations of the former soviet union, parliament further ordered that, until the owners of the above-mentioned assets had been determined in legislation, those assets were to be regarded as state property. on an unspecified date the spfu brought a claim against the federation, the sifu and upo, arguing that the assets the federation had transferred to upo had not belonged to it, but had belonged to the union-wide council, and the spfu had therefore been their managing authority. by a judgment of 20 january 1997 (case no. 137/7), the higher arbitration court of ukraine (“the hacu”; in 2001 renamed “the higher commercial court of ukraine”, “the hccu”) rejected the claim. on 17 june 1997 the hacu review panel upheld the above judgment. they had not been in the union-wide council’s use and were not, therefore, covered by the resolution of 10 april 1992. by a decision of 22 november 2007, which is available to the public, the supreme court of ukraine refused to allow a request submitted by the prosecutor general for a review of the decision of 17 june 1997. the supreme court did not provide the details of its decision. their price under the contract was 1,915,200 ukrainian hryvnias[1] (uah). the 2002 contract had thus breached state interests. the prosecutor also stated that he had only learned about the 2002 contract in july 2011. on 19 september 2011 the court allowed the claim. therefore, when upo had been created, the disputed premises had belonged to the state. lastly, the court rejected the prosecutor’s argument that the resolutions of 10 april 1992 and 4 february 1994 had been breached, holding that they were inapplicable in the present case, as they concerned property owned by civic organisations of the former soviet union (including trade unions), whereas the disputed property had not been transferred from the state (that is to say, trade unions had never gained title to the property). the applicant appealed, stating that upo had a title certificate to the disputed property. on 1 april 2014 the kyiv commercial court of appeal quashed the judgment of 19 september 2011 and found for the applicant, stating that there were no legal grounds to conclude that the disputed premises belonged to the state. upo had therefore become the owner of property transferred to it. accordingly, the disputed property which had been transferred to the republican council and used by it had been state property. the hccu also held that its position was confirmed by its own decisions and those of the supreme court given in 2007-2014 (the parties did not provide copies thereof). it referred, inter alia, to the resolution of 23 april 1960, the resolution of 29 november 1990 and the law of 10 september 1991, and stated that it did not follow from them that the transfer of property to the republican council had entailed a change in the state’s title to it. the state, as represented by the spfu, was indicated as the new owner of the disputed property.
the applicants are a family comprising the husband and wife (the first and second applicants) and their child (the third applicant). they were born in 1976, 1978 and 2001 respectively and live in kayseri. on 9 august 2001, the second applicant was admitted to a state hospital in niğde. she gave birth to the third applicant who has irreversible injuries caused by an intervention performed by that hospital’s medical staff during labor. in their report of 12 may 2004, the forensic medicine institute concluded that the two members of the medical staff who tended to the labor were equally and solely at fault for the third applicant’s injuries. on 1 december 2004, the first and second applicants on their own and on behalf of the third applicant, submitted a claim to the ministry of health for compensation arising from the third applicant’s injuries. following the tacit dismissal of the claim by the administrative authorities, the applicants brought an action for damages before the konya administrative court on 2 february 2005. they claimed 30,000 turkish liras (try) in respect of pecuniary damage and try 100,000 in respect of non‑pecuniary damage. in the course of the proceedings, the domestic court decided proprio motu to seek an expert report to determine the amount of pecuniary damage suffered by the applicants. in his report submitted on 14 june 2006 to the court, the expert assessed the amount of pecuniary damage suffered by the applicants to have been try 194,916. on 27 june 2006, the applicants requested to increase the amount of their claim for pecuniary damage in the light of the expert report. on 6 july 2006 the court ruled in favour of the applicants and awarded them the full amount of their initial claims in respect of pecuniary damage, namely try 30,000 plus interest running from the date of lodging their claims with the ministry of health. it further awarded them a total of try 50,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and interest running from the date of the lawsuit. the applicants’ request to increase their claim for pecuniary damage were dismissed by the court which considered itself bound by the initial claim indicated by the applicants when they lodged their case. the applicants’ ensuing appeals were dismissed by the supreme administrative court on 16 june 2009 and 28 december 2010 respectively. on 22 january 2010, the ministry of health paid the applicants a total of try 144,144. approximately try 53,830 of that sum represented statutory interest accrued on the principal judgment award.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in adana. at the time of the events giving rise to the application, the applicant was a member of the socialist democracy party (sosyalist demokrasi partisi). on 21 march 2007 the applicant attended the newroz (kurdish new year) celebrations in adana, where he made a speech on behalf of his political party. according to a report prepared on the same day by the police, in his speech the applicant stated that the military forces should comply with the ceasefire declared by the pkk and that a general amnesty should be declared. he contended that people were being detained for referring to abdullah öcalan, the leader of the pkk, as “sayın (esteemed) öcalan” whereas the prime minister also referred to him as “sayın öcalan”. the applicant further stated that abdullah öcalan should not be kept in isolation in prison and that independent doctors should visit him. he lastly made the following statement:
“do not fire but talk for resolving the kurdish issue”. the police report of 21 march 2007 further stated that subsequent to the applicant’s speech, songs with kurdish lyrics were played and some demonstrators waved pkk flags. on 6 april 2007 the adana public prosecutor asked two experts to prepare a report on the police video recordings of the celebrations of 21 march 2007. according to the report dated 16 april 2007 prepared by two persons, the demonstrators chanted certain slogans and waved flags and posters of abdullah öcalan from time to time during the celebrations. on 18 april 2007 the adana public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the adana assize court charging the applicant with membership of the pkk[1] under articles 220 § 7 and 314 § 2 of the criminal code on account of his participation in the demonstration of 21 march 2007 and of the content of his speech. he relied on the police report of 21 march 2007, the police video recordings of the newroz celebrations and the expert report dated 16 april 2007. on an unspecified date the adana public prosecutor amended the charges against the applicant and asked the adana assize court to convict him of disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk under section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. on 24 march 2008 the adana assize court convicted the applicant under the aforementioned provision and sentenced him to ten months’ imprisonment. the court considered, on the basis of the police report of 21 march 2007 and the expert report of 16 april 2007, that the applicant’s statements had constituted propaganda in favour of the pkk and that the crowd had chanted slogans in favour of the pkk after having listened the applicant’s speech. on 19 july 2011 the court of cassation upheld the judgment of 24 march 2008. on 11 january 2012 the applicant started serving his prison sentence. on 29 may 2012 the adana assize court granted the applicant early conditional release starting from 3 june 2012.
the applicants were born in 1949 and 1950, respectively, and lived in podgorica, where the second applicant still lives. on 25 july 2000 the applicants’ mother instituted civil proceedings against podgorička banka societe generale group ad podgorica (hereinafter “respondent”) seeking the payment of her savings, which she had deposited with the respondent’s legal predecessor titogradska osnovna banka titograd. on an unspecified date the applicants continued the above-mentioned proceedings in their mother’s stead as she had passed away in the meantime. on 25 july 2008 the first instance court in podgorica ruled partly in favour of the applicants. on 19 january 2010 the high court in podgorica reversed the first‑instance judgment by dismissing the applicants’ claims in their entirety. this judgment was upheld by the supreme court on 19 october 2010. on 5 december 2010 the supreme court’s judgment was served on the applicants. on 3 february 2011 the applicants lodged a constitutional appeal. on 12 april 2012 the constitutional court rejected the applicants’ appeal, which decision was served on the applicants on 29 may 2012.
under article 6 § 1 of the convention the applicants complained of the excessive length of enforcement proceedings. the circumstances of the cases as presented by the parties may be summarized as follows. on 26 december 2007, the čačak municipal court ruled in favour of the applicants. on 30 july 2008 čačak district court (okružni sud u čačku) upheld this judgment on appeal. on 31 march 2009 the applicants lodged a joined enforcement request which was accepted by čačak municipal court on 2 april 2009. on 22 june 2005 the fifth applicant lodged her civil complaint with the čačak municipal court against akcionarsko društvo fabrika reznog alata čačak requesting the payment of an allowance. on 21 april 2008 the čačak municipal court ruled in favour of the fifth applicant. in the absence of an appeal, this judgment subsequently became final. on 29 october 2008 the čačak district court upheld this judgment on appeal. on 22 april 2003 the seventh applicant lodged his civil complaint with the čačak municipal court against akcionarsko društvo fabrika reznog alata čačak requesting the payment of salary related damages. on 11 november 2008 the čačak municipal court ruled in favour of the seventh applicant. on 9 april 2009 the seventh applicant lodged an enforcement request which was accepted by čačak municipal court on 4 february 2010. since the judgment rendered in favour of the applicants remained unenforced, on 24 february 2014, the sixth and the seventh applicants and on 19 may 2014, the first, second, third, fourth and fifth applicants, lodged their appeals with the constitutional court. in so doing, the applicants complained about the length of enforcement proceedings in question and the ultimate non-enforcement. pursuant to the amendments to court organization act (zakon o izmenama i dopunama zakona o uređenju sudova; published in the official gazette of the republic of serbia, no. 101/13) the complaint concerning the length of proceedings was transmitted to the kragujevac court of appeal which then itself forwarded the matter to the čačak high court (viši sud u čačku), i.e. the former čačak district court. it, further, ordered the čačak court of first instance (osnovni sud u čačku), i.e. the former čačak municipal court, to speed up the enforcement proceedings and enforce the judgment rendered in the applicants’ favour. on 11 february 2015 the applicants complained to the supreme court of cassation claiming that the compensation awarded was too low and, accordingly, inadequate for the violation found. on 26 march 2015 the supreme court of cassation rejected the applicants’ appeals. it also ordered to the čačak court of first instance to speed up the proceedings and enforce the judgment. on 2 february 2015 the fifth applicant complained to the supreme court of cassation of the insufficient redress. her appeal, however, was rejected on 22 april 2015. on 2 december 2014 the čačak high court found that the sixth applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time had been violated and awarded her eur 300 in respect of the non-pecuniary damage suffered due to the length of the enforcement proceedings. her appeal to the supreme court of cassation concerning the amount of the compensation awarded was rejected on 6 may 2015. between 3 august 2015 and 30 december 2015 all applicants lodged new appeals with the constitutional court. they complained, inter alia, about the failure of domestic authorities to enforce the final judgments rendered in their favour, and that the amount of compensation awarded by the competent courts in respect of the breach of their right to a trial within a reasonable time had been too low. between 12 may 2016 and 9 june 2016 the constitutional court found that due to the failure of domestic authorities to enforce the judgments rendered in the applicants’ favour their right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions had, indeed, also been violated. the constitutional court, accordingly, awarded the applicants with pecuniary damages in the amounts granted by the judgments that had remained unenforced. however, the constitutional court rejected the applicants’ complaints concerning the insufficient redress as regards the violation of their right to a hearing within a reasonable time since it considered the awards given by the domestic courts as reasonable compensation for the violations found. the constitutional court lastly emphasized that, in any event and due to the changes in legislation, it could not have assessed the specific reasons for the amounts awarded by other courts in this respect.
the applicants were born in 1957 and 1981 and live in diyarbakır and adana respectively. on 17 august 2006 the adana public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with adana magistrate’s court charging the applicants and five other persons with praising an offence and an offender under article 215 of the criminal code. the public prosecutor alleged that the applicants had signed a petition in september 2005 which had been drafted in order to be sent to several institutions. the petition read as follows:
“as a person from kurdistan, i consider and accept mr/esteemed abdullah öcalan of kurdistan as a political actor. on 19 january 2007 the adana magistrate’s court decided that it lacked jurisdiction in the case due to the possibility of application of section 7(2) of the prevention of terrorism act (law no. 3713) proscribing disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation. the court then sent the file to adana assize court. on 24 march 2008 the adana assize court convicted the applicants of disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation under section 7(2) of law no. 3713 and sentenced them each to two years’ imprisonment. in its judgment, the first-instance court found it established that the above-mentioned petition had been prepared for the purpose of disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk and its leader and that by signing that petition the applicants had committed the offence proscribed in section 7(2) of law no. on 13 july 2011 the court of cassation upheld the judgment of 24 march 2008. on 24 august 2011 the court of cassation’s judgment was deposited with the first instance court’s registry. on an unspecified date the second applicant started serving his prison sentence. on 19 october 2012 the adana assize court decided to suspend the execution of the applicants’ prison sentence in accordance with law no. 6352 which had entered into force on 5 july 2012 and which had amended certain provisions of law no. the suspension was for a period of three years, on condition that they did not commit an offence through the press, media or other methods of expressing ideas and opinions.
the first applicant (mr aristov) was born in 1986 and lives in moscow. the second applicant (mr gromov) was born in 1983 and lives in moscow region. 74568/12, §§ 7-65, 5 january 2016), and yaroslav belousov v. russia (nos. 2653/13 and 60980/14, §§ 7-33, 4 october 2016). the parties’ submissions on the circumstances directly relevant to the present cases are set out below. there were numerous clashes between the police and protesters. it took them about two hours to clear the protestors from the square. they were arrested at the venue of the event and brought to the police stations where they were charged with administrative offences. after an overnight detention the applicants were brought before the justices of the peace and convicted as charged. the applicant did not resist the police officers, who gave no orders during his arrest. these reports and notes were drawn up using an identical template and contained no individualised information except the police officers’ personal information and the applicant’s name. the administrative-offence record reiterated the police reports, stating as follows:

the applicant was born in 1972 and now lives in odessa, ukraine. on 31 january 2014 the applicant sold a plot of land and a summer cottage in the moscow region for 4,600,000 russian roubles (rub). on 20 february 2014 he exchanged rub 3,605,000 for 100,000 united states dollars (usd). on 19 march 2014 the applicant travelled to odessa from domodedovo airport in moscow. he was carrying the entire usd 100,000 in his handbag. at the security check, his hand luggage was x-rayed. an officer asked him whether he was carrying any cash. the applicant acknowledged that he had money in his handbag and showed it to the officer. the applicant was subsequently interviewed by a police officer and an investigator on suspicion of smuggling foreign currency. he insisted on the lawful origin of the money and claimed that he had erroneously believed that the customs control would take place after the security check. on 18 april 2014 the investigator refused to initiate criminal proceedings because it could not be established that the applicant had deliberately sought to circumvent customs regulations. on 6 june 2014 the federal customs service prepared a report on a regulatory customs offence under article 16.4 of the code of administrative offences. the applicant was charged for his failure to make a written declaration in respect of the usd 100,000 he had been carrying on him. a hearing was held on 18 december 2014 before a justice of the peace in the domodedovo district of the moscow region. the court held that the customs report and statements the applicant had given to the police were sufficient evidence of the offence. it was legally irrelevant whether he had deliberately sought to circumvent customs regulations or negligently failed to abide by the applicable declaration requirements. the court issued a confiscation order for usd 90,000, reasoning as follows:
“when deciding on the punishment, the court takes into account the nature and gravity of the offence which is connected to the operation of a hazardous device, the information on the character of mr gyrlyan, who has no previous record of similar offences, and considers it appropriate to order confiscation of the object of the administrative offence.” in his grounds of appeal, the applicant relied in particular on the case-law of the constitutional court, which emphasised that any punishment had to be fair and proportionate to the nature of the offence, the gravity of the consequences, the extent of the damage and other relevant factors. he pointed out that the money had been lawfully obtained and that his actions had not caused any damage to the state. on 14 january 2015 the domodedovo town court dismissed the appeal in a summary fashion, noting that the punishment had been determined “within the range of penalties [provided for in article 16.4 of the code of administrative offences] and with regard to the character of the offender”. an appeal on points of law was dismissed by the deputy president of the moscow regional court on 30 april 2015. he wrote that “the defence’s allegation of a formalistic approach on the part of the [lower] courts [was their] subjective opinion that [did not] shield mr gyrlyan from liability.”
the applicants, suren osmanyan, serob osmanyan, bakur osmanyan, mane osmanyan and donara amiraghyan were born in 1935, 1961, 1988, 1990 and 1966 respectively and live in teghout village. the applicants are a family of five, making their living from agriculture. they jointly owned a plot of arable land in the village measuring 0.383 ha. in the 1970s a copper-molybdenum deposit (“teghout”) was discovered about 4 and 6 km from the villages of teghout and shnogh respectively, in the lori region. in 2001 a private company, armenian copper programme cjsc, was granted a mining licence for the exploitation of the teghout copper‑molybdenum deposit for a period of twenty-five years. on 1 november 2007 the government adopted decree no. 1279-n approving the expropriation zones of territories situated within the administrative boundaries of the rural communities of shnogh and teghout in the lori region to be taken for state needs, and changing the category of land use. according to the decree, armenian copper programme cjsc or teghout cjsc, founded by the former for the implementation of the teghout copper-molybdenum deposit exploitation project, were to acquire the units of land listed in its annexes. on an unspecified date teghout cjsc addressed a letter to the applicants containing an offer to buy their plot of land for amd 188,000 plus an additional 15% as required by law, making the final offer amd 216,200 (approximately eur 470). the applicants did not reply to the offer, not being satisfied with the amount of compensation. in the course of the proceedings teghout cjsc submitted a corrected version of the evaluation report on the applicants’ property stating that oliver group llc had made certain corrections as a result of which the market value of the land was estimated at amd 194,000 (approximately eur 422). the final amount of compensation, together with the additional 15% required by the law, would thus be equal to amd 223,100 (approximately eur 485). the remainder of the data contained in the original report had not been changed. on 6 october 2008 the regional court granted teghout cjsc’s claim, awarding l. and the applicants a total of amd 223,100 in compensation. they further argued that they had not been duly notified about the dates and times of the rescheduled hearings. on 27 february 2009 the civil court of appeal quashed the regional court’s judgment and remitted the case for a fresh examination. on 2 june 2009 the regional court granted teghout cjsc’s claim finding, inter alia, that the evaluation reports prepared by oliver group llc should be considered lawful and acceptable evidence to determine the market value of the applicants’ property to be taken for state needs and that the applicants’ request to order a forensic expert examination was groundless. also, they argued that the regional court should have exercised its statutory discretion to order an expert examination since such a necessity had arisen in the course of the proceedings and they had no possibility to provide an alternative evaluation themselves. the case was remitted to the regional court. on 12 august 2010 expert g. of the “expertise centre”, a state nonprofit organisation, delivered a report according to which the market value of the property was estimated to be amd 230,000 (approximately eur 500). there were four peach trees on the land in question. on 1 november 2010 the regional court ordered an additional forensic expert examination. the report confirmed the description of the applicants’ plot of land contained in the previous expert report. the report also stated that the first expert report and the evaluation report by oliver group cjsc had produced quite realistic results. it relied on the corrected evaluation report prepared by oliver group cjsc and two forensic expert reports. the applicants lodged an appeal arguing, inter alia, that the second forensic examination report was not credible since the expert had failed to specify the sources of information he had used to reach his conclusions and moreover no account had been taken of the number of the applicants’ trees and their value. on 7 july 2011 the civil court of appeal upheld the regional court’s judgment finding that the amount of compensation had been correctly determined based on the existing evidence. as regards the applicants’ arguments concerning the fruit trees, the civil court of appeal stated that both experts appointed by the regional court had recorded that there were only four fruit trees on the plot of land while expert a. had stated in his report that the trees in question could not have a significant bearing on the market value of the land. the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law. they raised similar complaints to those raised before the court of appeal.
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in ostia lido. at birth, the applicant was entered in the civil-status registers as male and was given the forename l. however, the applicant stated that she had always identified as female and lived in society as a woman under the forename s. for instance, her work colleagues (the applicant has worked as a civil servant since 1999) had always called her s., and in the photograph on her identity card issued in august 2000 her appearance was that of a woman. began treatment with feminising hormones as part of the gender transition process. on 9 november 2000 she applied to the rome district court on the basis of section 3 of law no. 164 of 1982, stating that she wished to complete the transition process by permanently changing her primary sexual characteristics, and sought authorisation to undergo gender reassignment surgery. in a judgment of 10 may 2001 the district court found that the applicant had embarked on the gender transition process after careful consideration. having taken note of her determination the court authorised her to undergo surgery in order to adapt her primary sexual characteristics to match her female gender identity. on 30 may 2001 the applicant, while awaiting the surgery authorised by the district court, applied to the prefect of rome for a change of forename under article 89 of presidential decree no. she argued that, given that she had been undergoing a gender transition process for several years, and in view of her physical appearance, the fact that her identity papers indicated a male forename was a constant source of humiliation and embarrassment. she also asserted that the waiting period for surgery was approximately four years. in a decision of 4 july 2001 the prefect refused the applicant’s request on the grounds that, under presidential decree no. 396 of 2000, a person’s forename had to correspond to his or her gender. in the prefect’s view, in the absence of a final court ruling ordering the change to her legal gender status for the purposes of law no. 164 of 1982, the applicant’s forename could not be changed. the applicant appealed against that decision to the lazio regional administrative court and also requested a stay of execution of the prefect’s decision. on 23 july 2001 the applicant underwent mammoplasty. on 6 september 2001 she was placed on a waiting list at trieste university hospital for surgery to alter her primary sexual characteristics. on 21 february 2002 the regional administrative court refused to grant a stay of execution of the prefect’s decision. on 3 february 2003, while the proceedings before the regional administrative court were still pending on the merits, the applicant underwent an operation to change her sexual characteristics from male to female. she subsequently applied to the rome district court, on an unspecified date, for legal recognition of her gender reassignment under section 3 of law no. in a judgment of 10 october 2003 the rome district court granted the applicant’s request and ordered the savona municipal authorities to alter the indication of the applicant’s gender from male to female and to change the forename l. to s. 17. by a judgment of 6 march 2008, deposited with the registry on 17 may 2008, the regional administrative court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the prefect’s decision of 4 july 2001. the court held that article 89 of presidential decree no. 396 of 2000 concerning changes of forename was not applicable in the present case, which actually came within the scope of law no. 164 of 1982 concerning changes to legal gender status. the court stressed in that regard that, under the terms of the latter, the amendment of the civil-status records of a transgender person had to be ordered by the court ruling on his or her gender reassignment. it therefore considered that the prefect had correctly refused the applicant’s request. the applicant did not appeal against that judgment.
the applicants, listed in the appendix, were all professors who at the material time were working at tbilisi state university (“the university”). on 8 june 2005 the president of georgia issued presidential decree no. on 19 june 2006 the already-dissolved grand academic council organised a meeting of university staff. after the meeting, several former members of the council met the new acting rector of the university, mr g.kh., for the purpose of expressing their concerns to him regarding the changes at the university. without giving any explanations or any prior warning, they forced everyone out of the university building. despite the applicants’ repeated requests, the police officers did not show them any order authorising the removal of the people gathered. towards the evening the police allegedly again dispersed their meeting. to leave the office; the latter, however, refused to do so. afterwards, the police asked the applicants, along with the other people present, to leave. left his office as soon as the police arrived. with reference to the events of 3-4 july 2006, they made a particular complaint that they, along with several hundred other people, had been locked in the university lecture hall for the whole night. a copy of the above-mentioned letter was sent to the prosecutor general of georgia. on 29 july 2006 the relevant prosecutor issued a ruling terminating the criminal proceedings concerning the alleged organisation and participation in group actions violating public order. the decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings provided in its operative part a fifteen-day time-limit for an appeal. the applicants were served with a copy of the above-mentioned ruling late in the evening of 29 july 2006. the judge allowed a request lodged by the prosecutor for the three police officers to be examined in court and postponed the hearing until 3 august 2006. they furthermore requested that the court hear the deputy rector of the university and four other eyewitnesses to the events of 3 july 2006, including two journalists who had not been questioned at the pre-trial stage of the discontinued criminal proceedings. the second applicant stated that he had been taken out of the office sitting on a chair because he had apparently looked very tired. they tried to put to the prosecutor several questions in this regard but the presiding judge dismissed the questions as irrelevant, having no bearing on the case. during the hearing of 3 august 2006 the following witnesses were questioned. according to the statement given in court by g.ch., it had taken him and the other officers about one hour to persuade the protesters to leave the office. the court terminated the proceedings concerning the alleged disobeying of a lawful order given by the police (article 173) with respect to the sixth and ninth applicants, finding that they had left the office of the rector before the arrival of the police and held them guilty of the administrative offences under articles 166 and 174 of the cao only, imposing a fine of gel 100 on each of them (see paragraph 39 below). the tbilisi city court dismissed the applicants’ argument that the rector’s office was merely a private working space, reasoning that the presence of the public rendered it a public space for the purposes of the cao. they were thus acquitted of the above-mentioned charge. she concluded that the decision of the first-instance court had been lawful and properly reasoned. as was shown in imedi’s recording of the events of 3 july 2006, at least twenty people had entered the reception area of the acting rector’s office by force, in disregard of the protests of the security staff and reception staff. then some of them had walked into the office itself, notifying g.kh. according to the video, dozens of protesters had simultaneously gathered in the corridor adjacent to the acting rector’s office and had chanted “step down!”
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in bucharest. during the events which led to the fall of the communist regime in bucharest, on 21 december 1989, the applicant suffered injuries caused by impingement and compression, as a result of which she needed 50 days of medical care, her life not being imperilled. in 1990 the military prosecutor’s office opened, of its own motion, several investigations into the ill-treatment and injuries suffered by those participating in the events of december 1989. the main criminal investigation was recorded in file no. as regards the applicant, an investigation was opened under a separate file and she gave a statement as a witness on 23 june 1994. her case has been further examined at a later date in the main criminal investigation. the most important procedural steps were described in the case association “21 december 1989” and others v. romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 may 2011), and also in sidea and others v. romania ([committee] no. 889/15 and 38 others, §§ 8-11, 5 june 2018). subsequent relevant domestic decisions are referred to below. on 14 october 2015 the military prosecutor’s office closed the main investigation, finding that the complaint regarding the offence of attempted homicide committed against the applicant was statute-barred. this decision was annulled by a prosecutor general’s decision of 5 april 2016, confirmed by the high court of cassation and justice on 13 june 2016. it was noted that the investigation under file no. 11/p/2014 was incomplete and that the facts could not be established based on the evidence gathered up to that date. on 1 november 2016 the military prosecutor ordered the opening of a criminal investigation in rem for the offence of crimes against humanity in respect of the same factual circumstances. up to february 2017 further steps were taken to gather information from domestic authorities: the prosecutor’s office contacted 211 civil parties, questioning members of the political party which took over the presidency at the time of the events, planning the hearing of military officers and other participants in the events, and verifying the activity of the relevant military units and the audio/video recordings broadcast by radio and television. at the date of the latest information available to the court (see sidea and others, cited above, § 11), the criminal investigation was still ongoing.
the applicant was born in 1944 and lives in vilnius. on 17 april 2009 the applicant was officially notified that she was suspected of having organised the embezzlement of property of high value. on 7 may 2009 the applicant was charged with the relevant offences. on 22 july 2011 the vilnius regional court held that the legal classification of the charges against the applicant was incorrect, because the total value of the allegedly embezzled property was not high. the court reclassified the charges on the basis of a less serious offence, held that the prosecution had become time-barred and discontinued the proceedings. on 27 october 2011 the court of appeal quashed the decision and remitted the case to the vilnius regional court. after re-examining the case, on 10 june 2013 the vilnius regional court found the applicant guilty of the charges against her. she was given a fine of 12,000 lithuanian litai (ltl) (approximately 3,475 euros (eur)). she was also ordered to pay some of the damages claimed by a company, amounting to ltl 2,800 (approximately eur 810). the applicant lodged an appeal, but on 18 october 2013 the court of appeal dismissed it and upheld the lower court’s judgment in its entirety. on 7 january 2014 the applicant submitted an appeal on points of law to the supreme court. on 17 february 2014 a selection panel of three judges refused to examine the appeal, on the basis that it did not comply with article 368 § 2 and article 369 of the code of criminal procedure (hereinafter “the ccp”) (see paragraphs 15 and 16 below). the chair of the selection panel, judge v.g., who had been the prosecutor in the case against the applicant before the first-instance and the appellate courts. the supreme court consists of two divisions: civil and criminal. the criminal division has sixteen judges in it.
the first applicant company, könyv-tár kft, is a limited liability company with its registered office in budapest. the second applicant company, suli-könyv kft, is a limited liability company with its registered office in tata. the applicant companies are schoolbook distributors. the hungarian school system was entirely reorganised by a series of measures adopted in 2011 and 2012. the schools, formerly decentralised, became subject to centralised state management. on 9 december 2011 and 24 july 2012 respectively, acts nos. the amendments came into force on 1 october 2012 and were effective from the school year starting in september 2013. the essence of the new legislation was already contained in the first amendment, published in december 2011. however, the schoolbook distribution sector in itself was an unregulated market. the task of distributors included not only the provision of logistical services but the processing of orders, the management of customised billing and the handling of returns. most of the companies dealing with the distribution of schoolbooks leased warehouses and delivery vehicles for a two-to-four-month period when performing their activities, which were predominantly seasonal in nature. besides their regular staff, ranging from three to fifty-seven employees, they employed an additional ten to thirty seasonal workers, normally students, for the compilation of schoolbook packages. larger market participants generally had their own vehicles and storage bases where they performed both retail and wholesale activities. these companies bought the books from the publishers and made them available to the smaller distributors. they made continuous efforts to keep hold of their clients, the schools, by providing flexible and prompt services. the wholesale price margin was generally about 3% to 5%, and the operating profit about 1% to 5%. the first applicant, könyv-tár kft, distributed educational materials for elementary and secondary schools. in this activity, it had business relationships with some 200 publishers, sixty of them being schoolbook publishers. the second applicant, suli-könyv kft, served directly (i) 90% to 95% of schools in komárom-esztergom county; (ii) 100% of schools in the western part of pest county; (iii) 65% to 70%) of schools in the northern part of pest county; (iv) 95% to 100% of schools in győr-moson-sopron county; (v) 95% to 100% of schools in vas county; (vi) 85% to 90% of schools in veszprém county; and (vii) 25% to 30% of schools in budapest. moreover, it supplied more than 1,200 schools indirectly via subcontractors dealing exclusively in schoolbook retail, competing with another five large distributors. the third applicant, tankönyv-ker bt, supplied about thirty-five schools in two counties. a description of the objectives pursued gave the following reasons for the decision:
“to strengthen the schoolbook procurer’s position through the uniform and centralised procurement of schoolbooks ... and ... to make schoolbook distribution more transparent by generating competition in a stronger position, that of the procurer.” as a consequence, the applicant companies and other schoolbook distributors had effectively been barred from the market (which was either their exclusive or major field of activity), where they had been operating freely prior to the entry into force of the new regulations. the applicant companies filed a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court, requesting that the new regulations be repealed. however, in their submissions to the court, they stated that this was not an effective remedy because even if the constitutional court had repealed the new regulations, they would have needed to reinvest a significant amount of money in order to re-establish their business, and would have been unable to repair the damage they had already sustained. on 14 april 2014 the constitutional court terminated the proceedings without an examination of the merits of the applicant companies’ complaint. the constitutional court noted that subsequent legislation, act no. ccxxxii of 2013 on schoolbook supply in the national public education system, had been enacted, and had entered into force on 1 january 2014. xxxvii of 2001 on the schoolbook market entirely, including the impugned new regulations. ccxxxii of 2013 had completely removed any schoolbook distribution based on the free market, and had introduced an entirely state-organised form of schoolbook supply to the hungarian public education system.
the first applicant, mr tamašauskas, was born in 1971. the second applicant, mr radzevičius, was born in 1977. the first applicant was detained in šiauliai remand prison from 28 september 2012 until 4 september 2014. on an unspecified date he lodged a civil claim against the state, alleging that he had been detained in overcrowded and unsanitary cells. he claimed 48,493 euros (eur) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. on 9 january 2015 the šiauliai regional administrative court allowed in part the applicant’s claim. it found that during the period under consideration the applicant had spent 629 days in šiauliai remand prison and that during the remaining periods he had been transported outside of that prison. during those 629 days, he had between 1.72 and 16.96 sq. the court noted that the documents provided to it by the administration of the prison did not indicate the exact amount of personal space available to the applicant in each cell. it therefore gave the applicant the benefit of the doubt and held that during the entire period of 629 days his right to adequate personal space (3.6 sq. m, under the domestic law applicable to prison cells) might have been breached. the court also noted that parts of the cells had been occupied by furniture and that the space in which the applicant had been able to move had thus been even smaller. however, the court dismissed the applicant’s allegations that the conditions in the cells had been unsanitary on the basis of reports submitted by domestic public healthcare authorities. it also held that the applicant had not proved that his health had deteriorated as a result of the conditions in which he had been detained. the applicant was awarded eur 3,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision, but on 6 october 2015 the supreme administrative court dismissed his appeal and upheld the lower court’s decision in its entirety. the second applicant was detained in alytus correctional facility from 22 november 2012 until 17 september 2014. on an unspecified date he lodged a civil claim against the state, alleging that he had been detained in overcrowded and unsanitary dormitory-type rooms. he claimed eur 16,611 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. on 12 october 2015 the kaunas regional administrative court allowed in part the applicant’s claim. it found that from 22 november 2012 until 11 april 2013 the applicant had had 2.96 sq. m of personal space, and that from 11 april 2013 to 13 august 2014 he had had 3.03 sq. m of personal space, in violation of the domestic requirement of 3.1 sq. during the remainder of his detention the personal space available to the applicant had complied with the domestic requirements. on the basis of reports submitted by the domestic public healthcare authorities, the court held that the temperature, ventilation and humidity in the rooms had complied with the relevant domestic requirements, and dismissed the applicant’s complaints in that regard. however, it observed that the administration of the correctional facility had not submitted any documents refuting the applicant’s allegation that the natural light in the rooms had been insufficient, and found in the applicant’s favour. the court also noted that during the relevant period the applicant had sought medical help for back pain, headaches, mood swings and insomnia; the court considered that those ailments might have been related to the unsuitable conditions of his detention. however, the court considered that the reduction in the minimum personal space available to the applicant had been minor and that it had been compensated for by his ability to move freely around the correctional facility and by the various leisure activities available there. it therefore held that the finding of a violation was sufficient, and dismissed the applicant’s claim for non-pecuniary damages. the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision, but on 14 october 2016 the supreme administrative court dismissed his appeal and upheld the lower court’s decision in its entirety.

the applicant was born in 1943 and lives in bucharest. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, refer to the same context and domestic criminal proceedings as those described in the case association “21 december 1989” and others v. romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 may 2011). during the events which led to the fall of the communist regime, on the night of 21/22 december 1989 the applicant’s son was killed by gunfire in bucharest. in 1990 the military prosecutor’s office opened several investigations into the december 1989 armed crackdown on the anti-communism demonstrations. a main criminal investigation concerning the use of violence against civilians in bucharest and other cities was registered with the highest prosecutor’s office – the military prosecutors section − under no. in the main criminal investigation the applicant raised civil claims and asked that the perpetrators of the offence of homicide committed against her son be identified and punished. at the same time, another investigation concerning the offences of complicity in seriously aggravated homicide and complicity in attempted seriously aggravated homicide, committed against a large number of persons, including the applicant’s son, culminated in the committal for trial of public officials, members of the ruling political party, and their subsequent conviction by a final decision of the supreme court of justice of 20 april 1992. the relevant procedural steps taken in the main criminal investigation were described in the cases association “21 december 1989” and others (cited above, §§ 12-41) and sidea and others v. romania ([committee] no. on 14 october 2015 the military prosecutor’s office closed the main criminal investigation, finding that the applicant’s complaint regarding the offence of homicide committed against her son was statute-barred and that a complaint concerning instigation of homicide was a matter of res judicata following the supreme court of justice’s decision of 20 april 1992 (see paragraph 8 above). the decision of 14 october 2015 was subsequently annulled by a prosecutor general’s decision of 5 april 2016, confirmed by the high court of cassation and justice on 13 june 2016. on 1 november 2016 the military prosecutor ordered the opening of a criminal investigation in rem for the offence of crimes against humanity in respect of the same factual circumstances. according to the information submitted by the parties, the main criminal investigation is still ongoing (see bănuțoiu and ștefoglu v. romania [committee], nos. 64752/13 and 54607/14, § 12, 3 july 2018).
the facts, as submitted by the parties, are similar to those in the case of association “21 december 1989” and others v. romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 may 2011). all applicants were ill-treated and injured on the night of 21⁄22 december 1989 during the events which led to the fall of the communist regime in bucharest. 30392/15 (vasu v. romania) suffered injuries that needed twenty-two days of medical care and the other two applicants were beaten by militia forces on the same occasion. in 1990 the military prosecutor’s office opened, of its own motion, investigations into the illegal detention, ill-treatment and injury suffered by the applicants and other participants in the events of december 1989 in respect of several offences as mentioned below. the main criminal investigation was recorded in file no. at the same time, another investigation concerning the offences of illegal deprivation of liberty, illegal arrest and abusive investigation against a large number of persons, including the applicants, culminated in the committal for trial of senior military and public officials and their subsequent conviction by a decision of the supreme court of justice of 10 may 1991, which became final on 14 november 1991. it cannot be seen from the court’s decision whether the injured persons, including the applicants, participated in those proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, bănuțoiu and ștefoglu v. romania [committee], nos. 64752/13 and 54607/14, § 7, 3 july 2018). as regards the offence of improper conduct, the military prosecutor’s office decided on 27 october 1993 (ms nicoleta-lorena giurcanu ‑ applicant in application no. 30365/15, hereinafter “the first applicant”), 9 march 1994 (mr traian vasu – applicant in application no. 30392/15, hereinafter “the second applicant”) and 27 august 1993 (ms luminița zeleniuc – applicant in application no. 30410/15, hereinafter “the third applicant”) not to open a separate investigation of its own motion on the grounds that the offence of improper conduct fell under a subsequently enacted amnesty law; that decision was communicated only to the third applicant on 25 september 2008. no decision was adopted in respect of the applicants’ injury. further, without a formal decision to overturn the decisions issued by the military prosecutor’s office (see paragraph 8 above) and to reopen the applicants’ respective cases, in the main criminal investigation, the prosecutor heard evidence from the applicants, who reiterated their complaints regarding the offences of illegal deprivation of liberty and assault and battery, based on their ill-treatment and injuries during the events of december 1989. thus, the first applicant asked on 29 april 2005 to be joined to these proceedings as a civil party and for the investigation of the case to be pursued by the military prosecutor’s office. the second applicant gave statements as an injured party on 7 january 2000 and 23 november 2004. the third applicant raised civil claims on 25 september 2008 and requested that the persons responsible be identified and committed to stand trial. the relevant procedural steps taken in the main criminal investigation were described in association “21 december 1989” and others v. romania (cited above, §§ 12-41), and sidea and others v. romania ([committee] no. on 14 october 2015 the military prosecutor’s office issued a decision in respect of the offence of instigating illegal deprivation of liberty, concerning all the applicants, by closing the main criminal investigation on the grounds of res judicata in relation to the supreme court of justice’s decision of 10 may 1991 (see paragraph 7 above). in addition, the military prosecutor’s office closed the main investigation in respect of the offence of instigating improper conduct regarding the second applicant, as it fell under an amnesty law (see paragraph 8 above). no decision was adopted with respect to the injury and assault and battery complained of by the applicants. the decision of 14 october 2015 (see paragraph 11 above) was subsequently annulled by a prosecutor general’s decision of 5 april 2016, confirmed by the high court of cassation and justice on 13 june 2016. on 1 november 2016 the military prosecutor ordered the opening of a criminal investigation in rem for the offence of crimes against humanity in respect of the same factual circumstances. according to the information submitted by the parties, the main criminal investigation is still ongoing (see bănuțoiu and ștefoglu, cited above, § 12).
the applicant was born in 1964 and lives in vienna (austria). the applicant is a businessman associated with a major austrian financial and industrial group. under a complex corporate and contractual arrangement, he had an office in bratislava (slovakia). it was situated at the same address as premises of other entities belonging to the group. in the context of this investigation, the austrian prosecution service asked their slovakian counterparts to search the above-mentioned premises and to seize documents relevant to the investigation. the search took place in 2009 and business documents and electronic storage media were seized, including from the applicant’s office, and later handed over to the austrian authorities. on 6 september 2011 the pps asked the law firm representing the applicant in slovakia to specify whether they were entitled to receive on his behalf the items that had meanwhile been returned by the austrian authorities. a power of attorney to that effect was submitted on 12 september 2011. on 1 february 2012 the bratislava i district police directorate issued a decision restoring those items to the applicant, identifying them as six specific units of electronic storage media. the applicant claims, and this has not been disputed by the government, that the media to be returned to the applicant contained, inter alia, legal advice protected by lawyer-client privilege. on 27 february 2012 the pps summoned the applicant’s lawyer to its premises on 7 march 2012 with a view to restoring the above-mentioned possessions to the applicant. the record of this operation indicates that the applicant’s lawyer was informed that under article 89 § 1 of the code of the criminal procedure (“the ccp”) he was under a duty to surrender the objects in question and that he had been warned that if he did not do so, they could be taken from him under article 91 of the ccp and he could face a fine under article 70 of the ccp and a referral for disciplinary proceedings by a competent body, in response to which he surrendered the items voluntarily. the applicant lodged a series of requests, complaints and repeated complaints with all levels of the pps raising two groups of arguments. accordingly, he had had no possibility of being present in person. moreover, it was protected from seizure by lawyer-client privilege. lastly, the applicant argued that the austrian authorities knew about the items they had asked to be seized again exclusively from the results of their unlawful initial seizure. all the complaints were dismissed, of which the applicant and his lawyer were ultimately informed by letters of the office of the prosecutor general of 10 august and 31 december 2012. the reasons given were as follows:
all the seized items, of which the applicant was unquestionably the owner, had been returned to him. there was no duty to return all of the items at once. in any event, it was open to the applicant to assert his rights in that respect before the relevant austrian authorities. as the items in question had been returned to the applicant on 7 march 2012, the previous unlawfulness of their seizure had been rectified and there had been no obstacle to seizing them again. the re-seizure complied with all the requirements under the applicable statute and the relevant international rules and as such was lawful and justified. as the applicant had authorised a lawyer to receive on his behalf the items to be returned to him, it had been apparent that he had had no intention of participating personally in the dealings with the pps. had he manifested any wish to do so, this would have been taken into account. accordingly, he could not complain of being unable to defend his rights and interests adequately in relation to the re‑seizure. on 11 march 2013 the applicant lodged a fresh complaint under article 127 of the constitution, arguing that by failing to ensure full compliance with the constitutional court’s judgment of 7 december 2010 and seizing the restored items again, the slovakian authorities had been responsible for a violation of a number of his rights, including respect for his private life and correspondence and the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions and of failing to provide an effective remedy. on 16 may 2013 the constitutional court declared the complaint inadmissible. in the pertinent part of its decision, it quoted extensively from the letter of the office of the prosecutor general of 31 december 2012, pointed out that its task was to review the constitutionality but not the legality as such of the challenged decisions, and found no constitutionally relevant arbitrariness or other shortcoming in the position the pps had taken in his case. on 18 april 2012 the constitutional court declared inadmissible a complaint by which the applicant’s then lawyer had challenged in his own name the re-seizure of 7 march 2012. he had thereby been prevented from exercising his profession as a lawyer in relation to his instructions from the applicant.
the applicant was born in 1967 and lives in moscow. s. was the owner of a one-room flat located at 6-60, smolenskaya street, moscow. an unidentified person presenting a passport in the name of m. and claiming that she was s.’s sister and heir applied to g., a notary, seeking the recognition of her rights in respect of the flat. in support of her claim she submitted a copy of her birth certificate. on 18 march 2009 g. issued a certificate confirming, inter alia, m.’s title to the flat. the city authorities registered m.’s title to the flat in the state land register. on 19 may 2009 an unidentified person posing as m. sold the flat to the applicant. according to the documents submitted by the applicant, the purchase price was 6,499,999 russian roubles (rub). the city authorities registered the sale of the flat and the applicant’s title to it in the state land register. on an unspecified date the police opened a criminal investigation into the fraudulent acquisition of the flat. it was established that the document presented to the notary as m.’s birth certificate had been forged. on 23 september 2009 the police informed the department of housing and housing policy of the city of moscow (the “housing department”) of the pending criminal investigation. on 1 december 2009 the housing department brought an action seeking the transfer of the applicant’s flat to the city of moscow (“the city”). on 11 march 2010 the criminal investigation was suspended. on 27 december 2010 the presnenskiy district court of moscow allowed the housing department’s action. it reasoned that m. had died intestate with no surviving kin and that her flat should have been considered bona vacantia. it annulled the applicant’s title to the flat and ordered its transfer to the city of moscow. following an appeal by the applicant, on 14 july 2011 the moscow city court upheld the judgment of 27 december 2010. on an unspecified date the judgments of 27 december 2010 and 14 july 2011 were enforced. subsequently the city of moscow sold the flat to a private party under a social assistance scheme that permitted the buyer to pay the purchase price in instalments. on 12 october 2017 the criminal investigation into the fraudulent acquisition of the flat was reopened.
the applicant was born in 1947 and lives in sunzha, ingushetia. the applicant is the father of mr maskhud makhloyev, born in 1982. the applicant submitted that law-enforcement agents had searched his house again on 31 october 2008 and 5 january 2009. on the first occasion they had looked for weapons but had not found anything. the applicant submitted that police officers had visited his son in hospital and had threatened to kill him and his family members. having heard the noise, the applicant and his wife ran out of their house to the courtyard. the armed men pointed the guns at them and ordered them to stand up against a wall. they used portable radios to communicate with each other. they took his two daughters into the courtyard and put them next to their parents. during all that time his third son, a.m., remained in his room. after approximately ten minutes the men left. she had been unable to see the model of the fourth vehicle. on 29 october 2009 mr ibragim makhloyev underwent a medical examination which confirmed that he had sustained bodily injuries. an on-site investigation was conducted on the same day. the case file was assigned number 09600131. on 13 november 2009 the applicant was granted victim status and questioned. on the same date mr ibragim maskhudov was questioned as a witness. they both said that they did not know why their brother had been kidnapped; they were not aware of any conflict he might have had with anyone. on 17 november 2009 a medical examination of mr ibragim makhloyev was ordered. it would appear that no relevant information was gathered from the inspection of the call logs. on 24 november 2009 the prosecutor’s office informed the applicant that the investigation was ongoing and that the measures taken thus far had not been able to establish the whereabouts of his son or the identity of the alleged perpetrators. which was operating in sunzhenskiy district in ingushetia. on 10 december 2009 the ministry of the interior of ingushetia informed the prosecutor’s office that according to their information, mr maskhud makhloyev was a member of a criminal group called “caliphate” led by a.m.b.y. between 3 march and 15 june 2010 several of the applicant’s neighbours were questioned as witnesses. on 5 april 2010 the prosecutor’s office requested a copy of the case file and medical documentation concerning the incident of 14 august 2009 (see paragraph 12 above) from the ministry of the interior of ingushetia. were questioned as witnesses (see paragraph 32 above). it would appear that those instructions were not carried out. on 9 august 2010 he was informed that he could consult the case file on any day except at weekends. on 13 october 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal with the magasskiy district court of ingushetia (“the district court”) under article 125 of the code of criminal procedure against the decision of 10 august 2010 to suspend the investigation. on 1 march 2010 mr ibragim makhloyev was granted victim status.
the first applicant was born in 1975 and lives in moscow. the second applicant was born in 1960 and lives in irkutsk. on 20 february 2009, the first applicant, a lawyer at the time, was elected to be a member of the council of the irkutsk regional bar (“the bar”). on 24 october 2010 the members of the council conducted elections for the presidency of the bar. five members of the council voted for s. and the other five voted for the second applicant. on 25 november 2010 the second applicant issued an order appointing herself acting president of the bar. on an unspecified date a group of lawyers applied to the commercial court of the irkutsk region challenging the second applicant’s appointment. the court granted their request to enjoin the second applicant from fulfilling the functions of acting president pending the outcome of the proceedings. on 19 january 2012 the commercial court discontinued the proceedings. the final decision on the matter was taken by the supreme commercial court on 26 september 2012. on 11 february, 2 march and 5 april 2011 several members of the bar, including the applicants, lodged complaints with the president of the commercial court of the irkutsk region, to the supreme commercial court of the russian federation and to the supreme judicial qualifications board, alleging that judge r. had acted in contravention of the applicable laws on jurisdiction when she had accepted the claims concerning the second applicant’s appointment to the office of president of the bar for consideration. on an unspecified date in july 2011 the lawyers posted their complaints on the website of the president of the russian federation. they sent a copy of their complaint to the president of the supreme commercial court and to the public anticorruption committee. on 18 july 2011 the first deputy of the president of the regional commercial court informed the plaintiffs that their allegations had not been confirmed by the conducted investigation. on 27 july 2011 the president of the regional commercial court forwarded a copy of the lawyers’ complaint to the bar and the first vice‑president of the bar instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicants. on 31 october 2011 the council of the bar disbarred the first applicant. the council considered that (1)  the letters sent by the group of the lawyers to the judicial qualifications board and the president of the commercial court had not been a correct or permissible conduct in response to the actions of the judges of the commercial court; (2)  the complaints had contained untrue allegations damaging to the reputation and goodwill of judges b. and r., and s., a lawyer; (3)  the first applicant had been disrespectful towards them. the council concluded that (1)  the first applicant had violated the relevant legislation and the code of professional conduct for lawyers (кодекс профессиональной этики адвоката); (2)  the dissemination of information damaging the reputation and goodwill of judges and lawyers was incompatible with membership of the bar; (3)  the first applicant’s conduct had disparaged the bar and its members. on 8 december 2011 the kirovskiy district court of irkutsk dismissed a complaint lodged by the first applicant against the decision of 31 october 2011. on 11 march 2012 the irkutsk regional court upheld the judgment of 8 december 2011 on appeal. on 16 december 2011 the council of the bar disbarred the second applicant. the reasons underlying the council’s decision were identical to the one used in the first applicant’s case. on 27 december 2011 the kirovskiy district court of irkutsk dismissed a complaint lodged by the second applicant against the decision of 16 december 2011. on 19 april 2012 the irkutsk regional court upheld the judgment of 27 december 2011 on appeal.
the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in yerevan. on 19 february 2008 a presidential election was held in armenia, which was followed by daily protest rallies held at yerevan’s freedom square from 20 february onwards by the supporters of the main opposition candidate, mr ter-petrosyan. the applicant was the head of mr ter‑petrosyan’s election headquarters in the town of abovyan and regularly attended the rallies. on 1 march 2008 the assembly at freedom square was dispersed by the police, causing mass protests throughout yerevan. on 8 march 2008 the applicant was summoned to a local police station in abovyan where he was questioned about the leaflets that he had prepared and distributed among the demonstrators during the rallies. on 11 march 2008 the applicant was charged with organising mass disorder and an attempt to usurp state power. on the same date the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan (the district court) ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention for a period of two months, namely until 8 may 2008, taking into account the nature and the gravity of the imputed offence and the severity of the punishment prescribed for it. by the same decision the district court refused the applicant’s request to be released on bail. on 14 march 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal, arguing that the investigating authority had not presented any evidence to substantiate the need for his detention. on 21 march 2008 the criminal court of appeal decided to dismiss the applicant’s appeal, holding that the fact that the applicant had been accused of a grave offence punishable by up to ten years’ imprisonment increased the probability of his evading criminal punishment. furthermore, it was unacceptable to release the applicant on bail in view of the fact that, if at large, the applicant could abscond, obstruct the proceedings, commit another offence, evade responsibility and punishment, and continue to breach public order. as to the applicant’s good character, mentioned by him in his appeal, this was not sufficient to justify lifting the detention order. on 4 may, 2 july, 3 september and 30 october 2008 the district court extended the applicant’s detention on the same grounds, on each occasion by two months. on 19 may, 18 july, 19 september and 16 november 2008 the criminal court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeals against those decisions. on 10 december 2008 the trial court decided to set the case down for trial, ruling in the same decision that the applicant’s detention was to remain unchanged. on 22 june 2009 the district court found the applicant guilty of making public calls inciting a violent overthrow of the government, and imposed a two-year sentence. it further decided to absolve the applicant from serving his sentence under a general amnesty declared by the armenian parliament on 19 june 2009. the applicant was immediately released from detention.
the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in jrvezh. on 19 february 2008 a presidential election was held in armenia, which was followed by daily protest rallies held at yerevan’s freedom square from 20 february onwards by the supporters of the main opposition candidate. on 1 march 2008 the assembly at freedom square was dispersed by the police. the applicant, who was present at freedom square at that time, was arrested and later charged under article 316 § 1 of the criminal code (cc) with assaulting police officers. on 4 march 2008 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention for a period of two months, namely until 1 may 2008, on the ground that the applicant, if at large, might abscond and obstruct the investigation by exerting unlawful influence on the persons involved in the criminal proceedings. on 10 march 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal, arguing that there was no evidence to substantiate the need for his detention. he was a former high-ranking police officer and a law-abiding citizen who enjoyed trust and respect in society. on 21 march 2008 the criminal court of appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that the fact that the applicant was accused of a grave offence punishable by up to ten years’ imprisonment increased the probability of his evading criminal liability and punishment and was sufficient to conclude that the applicant, if at large, might commit a new offence. as to the applicant’s good character, mentioned by him in his appeal, this was not sufficient for lifting the detention order. on 29 april 2008 the indictment was finalised and the applicant’s case was sent to court for trial. the applicant remained in detention by virtue of article 138 § 3 of the code of criminal procedure (ccp). on 13 may 2008 the district court decided to set the case down for trial, ruling in the same decision that the applicant’s detention was to remain unchanged. on 11 june 2008 the district court found the applicant guilty under article 316 § 1 of the cc of assaulting police officers and sentenced him to a suspended term of one and a half years’ imprisonment.
the applicant was born in 1985 and lives in łatanice. the facts of the case may be summarised as follows. the applicant was detained in kielce remand centre from 6 september to 4 october 2012 (28 days). the applicant submitted that throughout his detention in kielce remand centre, he had been held in overcrowded cells in which the space per person had been below the polish statutory minimum standard of 3 m². in their observations, the government admitted that the applicant had been detained in an overcrowded cell. however, they emphasised that the space in each cell had exceeded 2 m² per person and that the hardship caused by staying in an overcrowded cell had been compensated by adding 30 minutes to his daily walk as well as additional cultural and educational classes or sports activities. in the course of civil proceedings instituted by the applicant, the domestic courts established that for twenty-eight days the applicant had been detained in an overcrowded cell (see also paragraph 13 below). regarding the conditions of detention, the domestic courts established that the overall conditions in cells were adequate. cells were equipped in compliance with the relevant law; they were properly ventilated and the toilet area had been separated from the rest of the living space in the cells. on 12 august 2013 the applicant brought a civil action against the state treasury for infringement of his personal rights and for compensation on account of his detention in overcrowded cells in various penitentiary facilities. he claimed 35,000 polish zlotys (approximately 8,750 euros) in just satisfaction. on 28 may 2014 the warsaw regional court (sąd okręgowy) dismissed the applicant’s action. it confirmed, however, that temporarily (from 6 september to 4 october 2012) the applicant had been detained in cells in which the space per person had been below the polish statutory minimum standard of 3 m², but not below 2 m². on 1 april 2015 the warsaw court of appeal (sąd apelacyjny) dismissed the applicant’s appeal.
the applicant was born in 1988 and is currently detained in warsaw służewiec remand centre. on 26 november 2010 the applicant was arrested by the police. on 27 november 2010 the warsaw wola district prosecutor (prokurator rejonowy) charged the applicant with possession of a significant amount of drugs and requested that the warsaw wola district court (sąd rejonowy) detain him on remand. on 28 november 2010 the court decided to detain the applicant on remand for a period of three months, in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had been in possession of a significant amount of drugs (iii kp 2159/10). the court applied this measure due to the high probability that the applicant had committed the offence with which he was charged, the severity of the maximum sentence provided by law for such offence (up to at least eight years’ imprisonment) and the fact that the likelihood of such a penalty might induce the applicant to obstruct the proceedings, as well as the fear that the applicant might influence other persons to present a version of events favourable to him. on 21 february 2011 the warsaw regional court (sąd okręgowy) extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention. the court noted that the applicant had also been charged with being a member of an organised, armed criminal gang and pointed out the actions that needed to be taken to conclude the investigation. between 18 march and 12 april 2011 the applicant partially served a prison sentence ordered in another set of criminal proceedings against him (iii k 203/09). on 23 may the warsaw regional court extended the applicant’s detention on remand. the court again relied on the severity of the anticipated sentence and possibly adverse consequences that the applicant’s release could have for the ongoing investigation. on 22 august 2011 the warsaw regional court again extended the applicant’s detention on remand. it listed the charges against the applicant, which included, apart from those mentioned above, battery, making a profit from prostitution of others and destroying property. the court expressly stated that it was not obliged to specify actions aiming to obstruct the investigation, because the sole gravity of charges allowed for the presumption that such actions might be undertaken. it also pointed out that, while at large, the applicant might hinder the investigation concerning other members of the same gang. on 16 september 2011 a bill of indictment against the applicant and fourteen other persons was lodged with the warsaw regional court (xviii k 297/11). the applicant’s detention on remand was extended by the warsaw regional court on 26 september 2011 until 30 march 2012. between 24 october 2011 and 24 october 2012 the applicant served the remaining part of the prison sentence ordered in case iii k 203/09, and from 24 october 2012 to 23 october 2013 he served a prison sentence ordered in another set of criminal proceedings against him (iii k 1027/07). in the meantime, the warsaw regional court extended the applicant’s detention on remand on 13 march, 4 july and 20 september 2012. the two latter decisions were upheld by the warsaw court of appeal (sąd apelacyjny) on 31 july and 4 october 2012 respectively. the warsaw court of appeal extended the applicant’s detention on 4 october 2012, 15 january, 13 june and 28 october 2013, 13 march, 29 july and 30 december 2014, 25 june and 22 october 2015 and on 26 january 2016. the court relied on a high probability that the applicant and other accused had committed the offences with which they had been charged and on the complexity of the case. the court also considered that the persons accused might take actions aiming at obstructing the proper course of the proceedings, because they had known other accused, and the charges against them included being members of an armed and organised criminal gang. the court of appeal also considered that there was a high likelihood of a severe sentence being imposed. the relevant decisions were often phrased in general terms and no particular instances of the applicant’s conduct during the investigation or at the judicial stage was provided to substantiate the extension of detention on remand. the applicant’s appeals against those decisions were unsuccessful. his numerous requests for release, including on bail, were dismissed. on 4 march 2016 the warsaw regional court gave judgment. the applicant was convicted of multiple offences and sentenced to six years’ imprisonment and to a fine of 8,000 polish zlotys (pln) (approximately 1,850 euros (eur)). on the same date the applicant’s detention on remand was lifted. on 12 may 2017 the warsaw court of appeal upheld that judgment in respect of the applicant.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in weinheim. he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an anti-abortion website. in december 2007 there was an on-going public debate on developments in human embryonic stem-cell research. as part of the debate the catholic bishop f. voiced criticism of human embryonic stem-cell research and a group of scientists at the university of bonn responded to that criticism. he emphasised that he had had absolutely no intention of casting such defamatory aspersions upon the scientists, but reasserted his belief that there was an urgent need for such vitally important ethical issues to be debated critically. he claimed that he had never wished to imply that there had been any link between stem-cell research and the ideological and historical context of the crimes committed by the dehumanising nazi system, which should not be relativised through comparison. on 18 december 2007, the applicant issued a press release for his initiative never again! ( stem-cell research in germany” (getroffene hunde bellen! stammzellenforschung in deutschland)
the press release was published on the internet and handed out as leaflets. the professors appear to have forgotten that these experiments were performed in nazi times by willing doctors and scientists. the present-day research takes place at an earlier stage of human life. the principle of human dignity does not apply only after a particular phase of growth has been completed, and people should not be allowed to experiment at will during this phase. the professors can spin it any way they want. the fact that others were responsible for performing these contract killings does not provide moral justification for working with this ‘human material’. the comments made by bishop f. [name abbreviated by the court], which were presumably addressed directly to prof. dr b. [name abbreviated by the court], were absolutely accurate. dr b uses embryos – people – for research purposes at the university of bonn that were murdered in israel and then sold to germany for significant sums of money. during nazi times, german scientists performed research experiments on jews and then murdered them. nowadays, the unborn children of people who follow the religion of moses – the jews – are murdered and sold to the ‘christian’ country of germany for research purposes, all with the blessing of both israel and germany! the comparison drawn by bishop f. was entirely justified! the time has finally arrived to overcome the spirit of auschwitz!!” on 12 november 2008 the weinheim district court convicted the applicant of insult and sentenced him to a penalty of thirty daily fines of 15 euros (eur) each. dr b.’s position as a doctor and scientist, this implication had been severely insulting. it further held that the majority of the statements in the press release had been value judgments and that therefore the press release had to be classified as a value judgment and not as a statement of fact. when examining contributions to a debate of public interest, however, there had to be a presumption in favour of freedom of speech. the regional court further found that the criterion for abusive criticism had not been met. criticism which was excessive or even aggressive in nature was not necessarily abusive. the relevant criterion was whether the main purpose of the criticism had been to defame an individual rather than to debate the relevant issue. the regional court took into account that the press release had represented the applicant’s contribution to the formation of public opinion, but believed that referring to prof. dr b. by name had been equivalent to linking his professional conduct to the atrocities committed by the nazis.
the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in limay. on 24 september 2008 the société générale bank lodged a criminal complaint against a person or persons unknown for forgery, uttering forged documents, and fraud, following complaints by mr nicolas sarkozy, the then president of france, about four fraudulent payments to mobile telephone companies from his bank account for a total amount of 176 euros (eur). on 25 september 2008 the preliminary investigation was entrusted jointly to the fraud squad and the serious crime squad. on the same day mr sarkozy himself filed a criminal complaint, which was joined to the investigation. during the judicial investigation mr sarkozy applied to join the proceedings as a civil party. on 11 june 2009 the investigating judge committed the applicant and six other individuals to stand trial before the nanterre criminal court on a charge of fraud committed as a premeditated joint enterprise. they were accused of having obtained 148 telephone lines, mobile telephones and the payment of subscriptions using the references of payment cards and bank accounts belonging to a third party. secondly, he contended that the president’s power to appoint judges and prosecutors under articles 64 and 65 of the constitution (see paragraphs 17, 22 and 25 below) cast doubt on the impartiality of the judicial proceedings to which he was a party. the court took the view, with reference to article 6 of the convention, that the president’s status before the court would entail a breach of the equality of arms principle because, as a civil party, he could not, for the duration of his term of office, be the subject of any sanction for bringing unjustified proceedings or be prosecuted for malicious or rash accusations, or be questioned or confronted with the defendant (ibid., in a judgment of 8 january 2010 the versailles court of appeal varied the judgment and sentenced the applicant to eight months’ imprisonment. it found the applicant guilty, based on his own confessions and the statements of other defendants, together with the material discovered during searches. contend that the special status of the head of state rules out, in the present proceedings, any summons, interview, confrontation, investigative act or adversarial debate concerning mr sarkozy. it is not so much the securing of equality in the factual or legal arguments which matters, but the equal opportunity, for each of the parties, to submit its own ‘arms’ and to discuss those of the other party. a fair hearing has thus been guaranteed, not only in the balance between the parties but also through the effectiveness of the adversarial debate. on that first point, the submissions by the public prosecutor of nanterre rightly observe that the criminal proceedings were brought by the public prosecutor’s office, which is not subject to any application for withdrawal, and the proceedings did not therefore depend on a civil-party intervention. on the second point, many civil or criminal courts, in particular in press-related matters, have, on many occasions, admitted proceedings brought by the serving president of the republic, who in that capacity is also chair of the national legal service commission, without at any time considering that he was in any way contravening his constitutional duties.” the court of appeal further sought to ascertain whether the impartiality of the tribunal could also be called into question in the light of the theory of appearances. the defendants have not demonstrated that they have suffered as a result of any breach by the french institutions of the principles which must govern a fair trial. in addition, even supposing that french judicial organisation and the convention are incompatible, only a reform of the constitution would be capable of resolving that contradiction. the applicant appealed on points of law and, in addition to complaining of a breach of his right to a fair trial, argued that article 2 of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 31 below) was unconstitutional as it did not preclude the president of the republic from joining criminal proceedings as a civil party. in a judgment of 10 november 2010 (bull crim., 180) the court of cassation decided not to seek a preliminary ruling on constitutionality on the following grounds:
“the question, which does not pertain to the interpretation of a constitutional provision that the constitutional court has not yet had occasion to apply, is not a new one. in his opinion before the court of cassation, the advocate-general called for the partial quashing of the judgment of the court of appeal in so far as it had not stayed its ruling on mr sarkozy’s civil action until the end of his term of office. secondly, the judgment observes that the appellant was found guilty on the basis of both his own confessions and the statements of other defendants, together with the evidence gathered during searches. thirdly, the court of appeal, in assessing, without contradiction, the particulars of the case, found that the public prosecutor’s action had not breached either the legitimate interests or the fundamental rights of the accused persons. fourthly, the judgment finds in precise terms that the guarantee of the right to an independent and impartial tribunal, under article 6 § 1 of the convention, applies only to judges and not to the prosecution. lastly, the mere fact that judges are appointed by the president does not render them subordinate to him, since once they have been appointed, they enjoy tenure and are not subjected to any pressure or instructions in the exercise of their judicial duties. after finding that each party was able to present its arguments and discuss those of the opposite party throughout the judicial pre-trial investigation and the hearings both at first instance and before the court of appeal, the judgment indicates that the defendant had not demonstrated that he had sustained a breach of his right to a fair trial on the part of the french institutions. the court of appeal thus rightly concluded that the principle of the equality of arms had not been infringed. ...” in a judgment of 24 january 2014 the versailles court of appeal set aside the applicant’s sentence, replacing it with a suspended term of ten months’ imprisonment.
the first applicant, mr s., was born in 1989. consequently, in addition to the copenhagen police, which was in operation as usual, an extra 186 police officers were called on duty. most of them wore uniforms throughout the day. the three applicants went to copenhagen to watch the match. the third applicant was detained from 3.50 p.m. to 11.34 p.m., a total of seven hours and forty-four minutes. the case was tried over three days, on 11 march, 6 september and 28 october 2010. the applicants argued that they had not been involved in any altercations; nor had they had any such intention. before the city court, chief inspector b.o. they had received information that danish and swedish groups had planned to collaborate ... police preparations had targeted different locations in copenhagen. he was the one who had made the decision to detain persons who could not be charged with an offence, that is, detention pursuant to the police act. the crucial factor had naturally been the individuals’ actual behaviour. they had done so deliberately that particular evening. the control room had been closed down shortly after midnight, when the observers around the city had reported that things were quiet and that people were on their way home/back to their hotels. the copenhagen police had asked for help from the police of other districts in denmark who were familiar with members of local factions. among the people they had seen were [the first and second applicants]. [ there had been a good atmosphere, and no violence. they had received reports that swedes and danes were to meet and fight. he and his colleagues had followed the group and reported back to the control room. the reason why [the second applicant] had been taken to the police station was that they had indeed seen him talking to a, combined with their prior knowledge of him. [ this had apparently succeeded because he had been present during the international match himself, and it had been obvious that the hooligans from aarhus had been missing someone to take control. when the group from the bar was being guided into the side street, a couple of people might have tried to disappear into the crowd, but the group had followed directions from the police. it was very clear that someone was in control. he and a colleague of his had been sitting observing in a car at axeltorv square, when a citizen, a man aged 40 to 45, holding his son of about five by the hand, had contacted them saying that three people, whom he had pointed out from a very short distance, were planning a fight as they had been calling various mates, telling them to meet up at the entrance to tivoli gardens and try to start a fight with some swedish supporters. the person in question was still talking on his mobile phone at that time. the person making the report did not look like a typical football supporter. based on the evidence, the court accepts as fact that the copenhagen police had received intelligence prior to the international football match between denmark and sweden on 10 october 2009 that danish and swedish hooligan groups had arranged to meet in connection with the match and that the police had seen the first large fight between danish and swedish football fans at amagertorv square at 3.41 p.m. this implied a concrete and imminent risk of disturbance of public order, and the police were under a duty to attempt to prevent such disturbance; see section 5(1) of the police act. according to the evidence given by police constable p.w., based on the evidence, the court accepts as fact that during the afternoon and evening, about 138 persons were detained, half of them being detained pursuant to the police act; that the unrest continued for the rest of the afternoon and all evening; and that the detention of the plaintiffs was ended as soon as the city centre had become quiet, in the assessment of the police, after a group comprising thirty-five danes was arrested towards midnight. it is stated in the second sentence of section 5(3) of the police act that detention must be as brief as possible and should not extend beyond six hours where possible. samt politiets adgang til at iværksætte midlertidige foranstaltninger) (see paragraph 33 below).
the applicant was born in 1987 in the netherlands and arrived in denmark when he was approximately 9 months old. he remained in denmark, together with his parents and three brothers. he was released on 10 july 2006 with two hundred and fifty-five days remaining, suspended for two years. moreover, the city court ordered the applicant’s expulsion, suspended with two years’ probation. by a city court judgment of 25 march 2010, he was convicted of theft and sentenced to thirty days’ imprisonment. the applicant was also charged with possession of arms, threatening a witness, drug offences and handling stolen property. the case was heard by the city court of copenhagen (københavns byret). the applicant was heard and pleaded not guilty to the robberies. he had never been to croatia or the former yugoslavia. the length of his legal stay in denmark was therefore calculated at approximately sixteen years and two months. he had stated that, for the past two years, he had had a girlfriend, and that his father, three brothers and about 80 family members lived in denmark. in this respect the city court stated:
“as regards the issue of expulsion, the court observes that it depends on an assessment of proportionality as established by the supreme court (højesteret) in a judgment reproduced on page 225 of the danish weekly law reports for 2012 ((ufr) 2012.225h), whether an offender is to be expelled. for instance, when an assessment is made of the nature and seriousness of an offence committed, it has to be taken into account whether the relevant person committed it as a juvenile or as an adult. when an assessment is made of the length of the person’s stay in the host country and the solidity of the ties with the host country, it evidently makes a difference whether the person concerned had already come to the country during his or her childhood or youth, or was even born there, or whether he or she only came to the host country as an adult. regard is to be had to the special situation of a person who has spent most, if not all of his or her childhood in the host country, was brought up there and received his or her education there (§ 74). both robberies were committed in october 2011. all his family, including his parents and his three siblings, are danish residents. he has no ties with croatia, has no family or friends there and does not speak croatian according to the information provided, but only roma in addition to danish. [the applicant] has not yet founded a family of his own as he is neither married nor the father of any children. even though he has lived in denmark all his life, he must be considered very poorly integrated into danish society. considering the fact that he has spent all his childhood and youth in denmark and has received all his schooling in this country, and since he has no ties with croatia, strict requirements must be met for the crime to result in expulsion. [the applicant] has been convicted of robbery on several previous occasions. the proceeds of both robberies were of minor value. moreover, several sentences have been imposed for other offences against property. altogether, the defendant, who is 25 years old today, has been sentenced to and has served 1,755 days in prison, corresponding to four years and ten months, since his 15th birthday. the offences for adjudication in connection with the case at hand were committed during the probation period of the most recent suspended expulsion order. by a city court judgment of 6 september 2016 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for three months and expulsion for violence against a fellow inmate. he appealed against the judgment to the high court. it is unknown whether the appeal proceeding have ended. it appears that the applicant was expelled from denmark in december 2017, after having served his sentence, and that he re-entered denmark shortly after, in breach of the ban.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in tallinn. born in 1984), had restricted active legal capacity (piiratud teovõime). ’s guardian to protect his interests in social and legal matters and in matters concerning property. criminal proceedings were initiated and o.t. was examined by a forensic psychiatric expert who confirmed, in an expert report dated 8 november 2010, the earlier expert findings (see paragraph 6 above). on 6 may 2011 the harju county court terminated the criminal proceedings and ordered that o.t. undergo coercive psychiatric treatment, which commenced on 6 june 2011. was being detained – dated 14 june 2012, which stated: “substantial contact [sisuline kontakt] with o.t. deficient [puudulik], his answers to questions are sparse, poses counter-questions. denies the committed offence, does not consider himself mentally ill. on 6 february 2013 the tartu county court dismissed the application. ’s attending doctor and the head of the coercive treatment department (dr s.k.), during the course of the interview his facial expression had become angry from time to time, he had laughed inappropriately, and he had faked psychotic experiences. was in need of continued psychiatric treatment. the court decided that no additional expert opinion was necessary, as under article 403 § 1 of the code of criminal procedure (kriminaalmenetluse seadustik – “the ccrp”) (see paragraph 21 below) the opinion of the medical committee sufficed as evidence. and a lawyer (advokaat) was appointed to assist him. the tartu county court re-examined the case at a hearing on 8 may 2013. it had at its disposal the medical committee opinion of 11 december 2012 (see paragraph 10 above). had not recovered: he did not have an understanding of what was going on, did not adhere to his treatment, and had accused his mother of poisoning him. himself stated that he did not understand anything and did not wish to make statements. had not recovered to such an extent that it would be possible to discontinue the coercive treatment or change from inpatient to outpatient treatment. the applicant appealed to the tartu court of appeal on 29 may 2013. posed a danger to himself or to society and that no independent expert assessment had been carried out. she considered the opinions given by the hospital’s own medical committee (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above and paragraph 22 below) to be superficial and repetitive in their wording. ’s health and adherence to the treatment had not improved and the discontinuation of his inpatient treatment or its replacement with outpatient treatment was in the doctors’ opinion excluded, ordering another expert examination would have been irrelevant. on 19 july 2013 the applicant lodged a further appeal with the supreme court, reiterating the complaints made in her first appeal. she also requested legal aid, since an appeal before the supreme court could be lodged only by a lawyer, for the hiring of whom she had no financial means. ’s rights – primarily his right to liberty. the supreme court noted that the legal aid lawyer appointed for o.t. on 18 september 2017 the government notified the court that the psychiatric treatment of the applicant’s son had been terminated, at the request of the applicant, by a decision of the tartu county court of 21 september 2016.
the applicants were born in 1980 and 1986, respectively, and were detained at the tekirdağ f-type prison when the application was lodged. on 28 and 29 october 2005 the applicants were arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of membership of a terrorist organisation. on 31 october 2005 the applicants were brought before a judge at the istanbul assize court which ordered their detention on remand. on 23 december 2005 the istanbul public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment against the applicants, accusing them, inter alia, of membership of a terrorist organisation and illegal possession of explosives. on 26 december 2005 the istanbul assize court held a preparatory hearing and ordered the continuation of the applicants’ detention. throughout the proceedings the trial court ordered the continuation of the applicants’ detention on remand. between the hearings, with regular intervals of one month, the court ex officio examined the applicants’ detentions on the basis of the case-file and decided to extend. at the end of the hearing held on 13 october 2008, the trial court decided once again to prolong the applicants’ detention. although the applicants’ lawyer was present at this hearing, the applicants were not brought from prison to the court. subsequently, their lawyer filed an objection against the decision of 13 october 2008. on 11 november 2008 the 13th chamber of the istanbul assize court dismissed the objection, without holding an oral hearing and based on the written opinions of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicants or to their representative. on 23 december 2009 the court convicted the applicants and sentenced them to imprisonment. the court also ordered the continuation of the first applicant’s detention and the release of the second applicant. on 24 march 2011 the court of cassation upheld the judgment of the first instance court.
the applicant was born in 1960 and lives in kragujevac. on 14 december 2006 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against the kragujevac clinical centre requesting damages. in the course of the proceedings eleven hearings were held, whereas five hearings were scheduled, but were not held. on 20 may 2011 the applicant’s claim was rejected as unfounded by the kragujevac court of first instance. on 26 december 2011 the kragujevac appellate court (“the appellate court”) quashed the decision of 20 may 2011 and remitted the case to the first instance court. in the resumed proceedings the applicant sought recusal of the acting judge twice, but both of his motions were rejected. on 4 october 2012, after three held hearings and two hearings which were not held, expert examination and the increase of the applicants claim, the case was transferred to the kragujevac high court (“the high court”). on 20 march 2013, following the applicant’s two other recusal requests, one of which was adopted, the high court rejected the applicant’s damages claim as unfounded. on 21 august 2014 the appellate court rejected the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of 20 march 2013. thereafter, the applicant filed an appeal on points of law, which was rejected by the supreme court of cassation only on 21 december 2016. in the meantime, on 7 february 2013, the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court complaining about the length of the pending civil proceedings, seeking non-pecuniary damages in the amount of 3,000 euros and publication of the decision of the constitutional court. the constitutional court transferred the case-file to the appellate court, as a competent court to deal with the length complaints of the pending cases, pursuant to article 8a of the law on the organization of the courts. however, on 23 september 2014 the appellate court established that it no longer had jurisdiction to deal with the applicant’s complaint since it found that the civil proceedings had been finished. the applicant’s case-file was thus returned to the constitutional court. on 6 november 2014 the constitutional court returned the case-file to the appellate court, which on 28 november 2014 again found that it had no jurisdiction to deal with the case. the appellate court then transferred the case-file further to the supreme court of cassation, as the competent court. on 22 january 2015 the supreme court of cassation rejected the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of 28 november 2014. it also partially adopted the applicant’s complaint concerning the length of the proceedings and awarded him 200 euros for non-pecuniary damage, whereas the rest of claim rejected. on 21 october 2015 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s appeal in regards to the length of the proceedings. the constitutional court established that even though the impugned proceedings had lasted seven years and eight months, they were very complex and the applicant largely contributed to its length, whereas the competent courts acted efficiently.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in bečej, where he was employed as a police officer. on 24 january 2003 the bečej municipal court (“the municipal court”) started judicial investigation proceedings against the applicant for the alleged commission of a number of criminal offences concerning the performance of his duties. on 26 may 2003 the competent directorate of the ministry of interior dismissed the applicant from the police force (effective as of 30 may 2003). the decision noted that the criminal proceedings had been instituted against the applicant and that article 45, in conjunction with article 34 (1)(2), of the ministry of interior act 1991, which was in force at the time of the dismissal, should be applied. according to this provision a police officer could be dismissed, at the discretion of the ministry of interior, if he no longer met the requirements for being a police officer, which included the requirement that criminal proceedings of a particular type should not be pending against him. the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision, but on 30 june 2003 his appeal was rejected and the dismissal thus confirmed. on 23 july 2003 the applicant lodged a claim with the municipal court seeking his reinstatement. on 31 october 2003 the municipal court partly discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant based on the applicable procedural prescription period. on 12 november 2003 the remainder of the criminal proceedings were discontinued because the public prosecutor had withdrawn the charges. on 30 december 2003 the municipal court annulled the decision on the applicant’s dismissal of 26 may 2003 by partial judgment, establishing that everyone charged with a criminal offence should be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a court of law, and that a broad interpretation of article 45 of the ministry of interior act 1991 in regards to the persons who were not found guilty could be only to their detriment. on 17 june 2004 the novi sad district court (“the district court”) upheld this judgment. the applicant’s former employer thereafter submitted an appeal on points of law. in the meantime, the applicant was reinstated to his previous post by decision of the ministry of interior of 13 january 2005. the decisions of 26 may and 30 june 2003 were also repealed. on 9 march 2005, however, the supreme court upheld the appeal on points of law, reversed the judgments of 30 december 2003 and 17 june 2004 and rejected the applicant’s claim for reinstatement. it found that the dismissal of 26 may 2006 had been in accordance with the article 45, read in conjunction with article 34 (1)(2) of the ministry of interior act 1991, and that the mere fact that the criminal proceedings had been pending against the applicant was sufficient reason for the applicant’s dismissal. on 4 july 2005 the applicant was thus again dismissed from his job, which decision was upheld on 11 august 2005 by the minister of interior. on 4 august 2005, the applicant brought another set of the proceedings for the annulment of his second dismissal. however, the municipal court, the district court and the supreme court, by their judgments of 27 october 2005, 10 may 2007 and 18 december 2007, respectively, all ruled against him and upheld his dismissal on the basis of article 45, read in conjunction with article 34 (1)(2), of the ministry of interior act 1991. on 14 march 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal with the constitutional court concerning the outcome, fairness and the length of the civil proceedings concerning his dismissal, the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and the “right to work”. on 17 february 2011 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s appeal. in regards to the court judgments of 31 october 2003, 17 june 2004 and 9 march 2005 the constitutional court established that the his complaints were inadmissible ratione temporis given that the serbian constitution had come into force on 8 november 2006, i.e. after the first set of the proceedings concerning the applicant’s dismissal. on the other hand, with respect to the judgments of 27 october 2005, 10 may and 18 december 2007, the constitutional court found that they were not arbitrary, and upheld the legality of the applicant’s second dismissal on the basis of article 45, read in conjunction with article 34 (1)(2), of the ministry of interior act 1991. in the constitutional court’s view, the fact that the applicant was ultimately dismissed on 4 july 2005, instead of on 26 may 2003, was only in the applicant’s favour, and that fact alone could not affect the legality of his “dismissal as such”. before this on 19 january 2011, the constitutional court rendered a decision in the case of stefanović v. serbia (už 753/2008), concerning the same legal issue in which it ruled in favour of the appelant in that case (see milojević and others v. serbia, nos. 43519/07 and 2 others, §§ 36-37, 12 january 2016).
the applicant was born in 1956 and lives in moscow. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. on 14 april 2006 the applicant was charged with verbal insult of traffic police officers, an offence punishable with a fine or with up to one year’s correctional work (“the first criminal case”). the applicant filed an appeal which was dismissed by the tsentralnyy district court in novosibirsk on 27 september 2010. on 8 october 2010 the applicant was charged with contempt of court and criminal libel of the judge who presided over the appeal proceedings in the first criminal case (“the second criminal case”). he referred to the applicant’s alleged failures to appear for interviews. in august 2008 the first criminal case was submitted for trial. on 13 november 2008 his request was refused; the judge held that the application of the travel restriction was justified on account of the applicant’s previous failures to appear. her decision was upheld on appeal by the district court on 27 january 2009 and by the regional court on 16 march 2009. accordingly, the appeal judgment ... is lawful, justified and well-reasoned; there are no grounds to set it aside.” in february 2009 the applicant reiterated his request to be allowed to leave novosibirsk. the investigator located and removed his desktop and laptop computers, a memory stick, two cds and a dvd. he examined the devices, copied the relevant contents onto a disk and put them sealed in the storage. he stated that “the investigation had no grounds to unseal physical evidence”. the applicant applied for judicial review. on 22 october 2010 the investigator decided to interview m. as an eye-witness to the offence of contempt of court that the applicant was charged with. m. refused to testify on the ground that she was the applicant’s lawyer. his complaint was rejected by the district court on 11 february 2011 at first instance and on appeal by the regional court on 6 april 2011. legal-aid lawyer s. was appointed to represent the applicant. after the case was submitted for trial, the applicant complained to the trial court about a breach of his right to be defended by a lawyer of his own choosing. at the preliminary hearing on 1 july 2011, the novosibirsk regional court accepted that the rights of the defence had been undermined by reason of the investigator’s failure to address the applicant’s objections to the participation of the legal-aid lawyer. the regional court returned the case to the prosecutor with the instruction to remedy the violation. on 22 august 2011 the criminal panel of the regional court rejected the appeal. as counsel m. had refused to testify, no conflict between the interests of the defendant and those of his representative could have arisen, and the investigator had not had any legal grounds to exclude her from the proceedings. towards the end of the pronouncement hearing, the investigator entered the room, accompanied by two bailiffs. the applicant insisted that his lawyer m. should be present. instead, legal-aid lawyer s. was called in to represent him (see paragraph 21 above). one hour later the district court granted the application. the applicant was taken to the hospital where he went on a hunger strike in protest against his involuntary placement. on 9 february 2011 the novosibirsk regional court dismissed his appeal in a summary fashion.
the applicant was born in 1964 and lives in štitare. on 30 may 2000 the belgrade third municipal court ordered a socially-owned company kmg trudbenik (hereinafter “the debtor company”), based in belgrade, to pay to the applicant a specified amount on account of salary arrears, plus the costs of the civil proceedings (judgment no. this judgment became enforceable on 19 june 2000. on 13 march 2002, upon the applicant’s request to that effect, the fourth belgrade municipal court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor company to pay the applicant’s enforcement costs (enforcement order no. on 7 october 2003 the enforcement proceedings were suspended due to the institution of compulsory settlement proceedings before the belgrade commercial court (“the commercial court”). on 9 december 2011 the commercial court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor company. on 6 march 2012 the applicant submitted his request for enforcement of the 30 may 2000 judgment (“enforcement request”) to the insolvency manager. the insolvency manager neither rejected the applicant’s claim nor forwarded it to the commercial court. on 24 february 2014 the applicant thus submitted his enforcement request with the commercial court, and on 1 october 2014 he supplemented it. on 6 august and 27 october 2014 the applicant complained about the inactivity of the acting judge in the insolvency proceedings. on 13 october 2014 the commercial court rejected the applicant’s enforcement request as having been lodged out of time. on 28 january 2015 the commercial appellate court rejected the applicant’s appeal, and upheld the commercial court’s decision of 13 october 2014. on 24 march 2015 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal, complaining of the decision of 28 january 2015. however, on 19 may 2016 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s appeal as unfounded.
the applicant was born in 1985 and lives in bratislava. on 20 december 2014 the bratislava iv district court ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention in the context of criminal proceedings in which he was prosecuted for committing the criminal offence of manslaughter. the reason for his detention was the risk of reoffending. on 3 march 2015 the applicant submitted a request to the district prosecution office for release from pre-trial detention. in it, he asked for his detention to be replaced with supervision by a probation officer. the request was received by the latter on 4 march 2015 and dismissed on 5 march 2015, following which it was transferred to the district court for a judicial determination. on 26 march 2015 the district court held a hearing and dismissed the applicant’s request for release. the written version of that decision was served on the applicant on 14 april 2015 and, after several unsuccessful attempts at delivery, was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 21 april 2015. the applicant’s lawyer lodged a written interlocutory appeal with the district court within the statutory three-day period, namely on 24 april 2015. the case file was transferred to the bratislava regional court on 29 april 2015 and the applicant’s appeal was dismissed in chambers on 7 may 2015. the written version of that decision was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 18 may 2015. on 1 june 2015 the applicant filed a constitutional complaint, relying inter alia on article 5 § 4 of the convention. he alleged that the authorities had not proceeded speedily with his request for release. he formally challenged the proceedings held before the district curt, the decision of the regional court of 7 may 2015 and the proceedings preceding this decision. he also requested compensation of 2,000 euros (eur) in addition to his legal costs and expenses. on 30 march 2016 the constitutional court declared the part of his complaint in respect of the proceedings held before the district court admissible and the remainder inadmissible. the constitutional court held that it had found no irregularities in the regional court’s decision of 7 may 2015. on 21 june 2016 the constitutional court found a violation of the applicant’s right guaranteed under article 5 § 4 of the convention. it did not award him any compensation or legal costs and expenses. the constitutional court scrutinised only the district court’s proceedings and concluded that they had lasted 44 days. the district court had therefore failed to deal with the applicant’s request speedily and to serve the written decision on him promptly. with respect to the financial compensation, the constitutional court referred to “the principle of fairness”, “the particular circumstances of the case”, the duration of the delays and the intensity of the interference, and concluded that the finding of a violation of the applicant’s right constituted a sufficient redress.

the applicant company is a private media company whose registered office is in ljubljana. according to the report, mr s., the direct marketing executive, explained to the officers that he was not authorised to accept and sign the inspection order or the order to initiate proceedings against the applicant company. the officers asked him to direct them to someone authorised or to the mailroom, so that they could serve the orders and start the inspection. mr s. took the officers to the mailroom but nobody was there. an employee who arrived at the mailroom at 9.25 a.m. refused to sign anything and said that she would call her superior. a moment later mr p., the deputy finance executive, arrived at the mailroom. it is stated in the report that in a loud voice he then asked the officers to leave, pointing with his hand in the direction of the exit and showing no intention to cooperate with the officers, despite being warned by them that refusal to cooperate would be regarded as an obstruction of the inspection, resulting in a fine. since none of the employees wanted to accept the orders, the officers eventually left them in the mailroom and the orders were thus deemed to be served. nothing had prevented them from carrying out the inspection. the officers had decided to leave and call the police of their own motion. the obstruction had been mr p.’s unwillingness to cooperate with officers and to immediately facilitate access to evidence and its preservation. on 22 march 2012 the applicant company brought an action and an application for an interim measure against the above order (see paragraph 10 above), reiterating the complaints it had raised before the office (see paragraph 9 above). it requested an oral hearing, maintaining that a direct examination of the evidence was required to properly establish the facts of the case. they would also show that the officers had not properly introduced themselves and had tried to enter the premises in an aggressive manner. at the time the obstruction had allegedly been committed, the officers had only asked for someone on whom they could serve the orders and had been subsequently politely asked to wait in the reception area. the applicant company argued that the officers could have freely continued with the inspection. since he was only in a contractual relationship with the applicant company, his allegedly illegal actions could not be attributed to it. meanwhile, in 2013 the competition protection agency (“the agency”) took over the office’s tasks and assumed full control of all its pending matters. on 26 november 2013 the supreme court dismissed the applicant company’s action (see paragraph 11 above). the court emphasised that although the applicant company had contested the facts as established by the office (see paragraph 10 above), it had not challenged the fact that the officers could not immediately after their arrival at the company’s premises secure the evidence. the only important fact was that the authorised persons could not immediately start securing the evidence. on 6 may 2015 the constitutional court refused to accept a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant for consideration, finding that it did not concern an important constitutional question or entail a violation of human rights which would have serious consequences for the company. on 15 september 2015 the tax authorities enforced the collection of the imposed fine from the applicant company. meanwhile, on 7 august 2012 the office issued a summary of the relevant facts (povzetek relevantnih dejstev), expressing the opinion that the applicant company had abused its dominant position in the television advertising market. on 24 september 2012 the applicant company commented on the summary of the relevant facts, requesting an oral hearing and for the examination of several witnesses to prove that it had not restricted competition. the agency also noted that the minor-offence proceedings that generally followed were separate from the administrative proceedings. it also requested that the supreme court examine the proposed witnesses at an oral hearing. on 3 december 2013 the supreme court dismissed the action (see paragraph 19 above). it held that the examination of the witnesses proposed by the applicant was unnecessary because the facts of the case had already been fully established by the agency, which had provided logical and convincing reasons for each of the central issues in dispute. consequently, it refused to hold a hearing.
the applicant was born in 1991 and lives in chișinău. on 15 june 2014 the applicant had an altercation with two persons, one of whom was in an advanced state of intoxication. during the altercation, the applicant pushed the intoxicated person and punched the other one. as a result, the intoxicated person fell to the ground and received a serious head trauma. the scene was witnessed by the wife of the intoxicated person and a neighbour. on the same day the applicant was arrested and placed in detention. the applicant appealed against the detention order and argued, inter alia, that he had a permanent abode, an employment and no history of violent behaviour. he also submitted that he could not influence any witnesses because they were in another village and that a restraining order to quit his town of residence would be sufficient to eliminate that risk. he also submitted that he had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning of the investigation and that he could not leave the country because his travel documents had been seized. on 11 july 2014 the ialoveni district court examined the prosecutor’s request for a prolongation of the applicant’s detention and a habeas corpus request lodged by the applicant. it found no reasons to detain the applicant in custody and ordered his immediate release under judicial control. the applicant had no right to leave the town without approval by the court and to communicate with the persons involved in the criminal investigation. on 22 july 2014 the chișinău court of appeal upheld the prosecutor’s appeal, quashed the above decision and ordered the applicant’s remand in custody for a period of thirty days. the applicant was not arrested and, according to him, was told to go home. on 25 august 2014 the applicant was arrested at home and placed in detention. on 1 september 2014 the applicant lodged a habeas corpus request with the ialoveni district court. he went home and nobody came after him until 25 august 2014. between 11 july and 25 august 2014 he had not attempted to abscond or interfere with the investigation. on 7 october 2014 the chișinău court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. on 17 october 2014 the public prosecutor’s office applied to the ialoveni district court for a prolongation of the applicant’s detention for another thirty days. one of the reasons relied upon by the prosecutor was that the applicant had absconded from investigating authorities between 22 july and 25 august 2014. on 22 october 2014 the applicant requested access to the casefile with a view to obtaining a copy of the materials filed by the public prosecutor together with his application of 7 october 2014. he argued that the public prosecutor’s application was accompanied by a set of documents, while he had only received a copy of the application. the applicant lodged on the same date a habeas corpus request. on 20 november 2014 the applicant lodged a habeas corpus request. the applicant was released from detention and ordered not to leave his town and not to interfere with the investigation. throughout his detention the applicant was held in prison no. according to the applicant, he was detained in overcrowded cells which lacked ventilation. the cells were equipped with squat toilets which were not properly separated. there was a sink with a rusted tap and the quality of water was very bad.
the first applicant was born in 1975 and lives in st petersburg. she sent him an email on 30 april 2013, indicating her whereabouts. since that date m. has allowed the applicant to see his son on average six days per month for two hours each time. however, sometimes she has not allowed the first applicant to see his son for weeks at a time or has taken him out of town for long periods without informing the first applicant about his son’s whereabouts. she was a part‑owner of her parents’ flat where she and her son occupied a room. firstly, considerable amounts of money would be spent by the first applicant travelling to nizhniy novgorod to visit his son. thirdly, the second applicant had been born in st petersburg and had lived there until taken away by m. he had his residence registration and his continuing paediatric and specialist care there and was on the waiting list for a local nursery school. indeed, while they had lived together, he had spent as much time with the child and had been responsible for his everyday care as much as m. they had a very strong mutual attachment. the first applicant’s father could not leave his wife alone and unassisted and could not therefore go to nizhniy novgorod either. it noted that m. had taken the child away and had for some time concealed his whereabouts from the first applicant. she had restricted the first applicant’s contact with the child. she was unemployed and had no income except the child maintenance paid by the first applicant. it found that m. had good living conditions and received child maintenance from the first applicant and financial help from her parents. m. co-owned the flat in nizhniy novgorod where she currently lived with x; that flat had everything necessary for a small child. m.] is on parental leave and devotes all her time to the child. [ m.]’s parents help her take care of and [financially] support the child. the first applicant appealed, repeating his previous arguments. in particular, the district court had not taken into account the opinion of 18 february 2014 of the st petersburg childcare authority. in any event, m. had returned to work in december 2014 and since then the second applicant had been taken care of during the day by his maternal grandmother. lastly, the first applicant argued that inherent in the concept of the child’s “best interests” was the right for a child not to be removed from one of his or her parents and retained by the other (he referred to maumousseau and washington v. france, no. there is no reason to doubt the impartiality of the examination and assessment of evidence ...”
the court also added that the issue of the child’s contact with his grandparents was to be examined in separate proceedings. on 13 march 2015 the nizhniy novgorod childcare authorities informed the first applicant that they had had a meeting with m. during which she had been told that she had to keep the child’s father informed about the child’s whereabouts and that the child was entitled to maintain contact with his grandparents and other relatives. x remained in nizhniy novgorod with his maternal grandmother. it determined the contact schedule as follows. the court also ordered that m. should inform the first applicant immediately by telephone if x were suffering from illness, and inform him two days in advance about any temporary change of residence. on 19 january 2016 a panel of psychology and psychiatry experts examined the applicants and m. and found that x was attached to both parents and was emotionally close to both of them. on 29 march 2016 the nizhegorodskiy district court found that the bailiffs service had not taken any actions to enforce the interim contact order of 29 september 2015 and ordered that the bailiffs service should redress the consequent breach of the first applicant’s rights. on 25 october 2016 the nizhniy novgorod regional court upheld the contact order of 27 april 2016 on appeal. on 13 march 2017 a judge of the nizhniy novgorod regional court refused to refer the first applicant’s cassation appeal against the contact order of 27 april 2016, as upheld on appeal on 25 october 2016, to the presidium of that court for examination, finding no significant violations of substantive or procedural law which had influenced the outcome of the proceedings. the first applicant pays child maintenance but does not give any other financial help.
the facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. his request was granted and he was registered as a person legally residing in denmark in november 1997. between 1997 and 2001, the couple had three children together. during those proceedings he stated that he would lose contact with his three children from his first marriage, since they would not be able to afford to visit him more than once a year. to this effect, relying on section 50, subsection 1, of the aliens act, the applicant claimed that material changes had occurred in his circumstances. his wife and her family had stayed illegally as refugees in jordan and had been fined therefor, so she would not be allowed entry. x was now a danish national, but was originally a stateless palestinian from lebanon. he wore a nappy and his speech and language were undeveloped. their daughter was probably the one who was most strongly attached to [the applicant], but their two sons were also very attached to him. the two youngest children had not been offered consultations with a school psychologist. for the sake of her children, she really hoped that [the applicant] could be allowed another chance. y also gave statements to the police on 7 and 12 september 2012. they had never married under the danish rules. they had three children together: a 9-year-old boy, an 8-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy. all of them were healthy and attended school here in denmark. y indicated that she could not go to jordan with him if he were deported to jordan. this was the reason why she could not return to jordan. he was still waiting and looking very much forward to [the applicant’s] release. the reason why he isolated himself was that he missed being part of a whole family. however, she did have one sister living in the netherlands. however, jordan had refused to accept her sister because there was an unpaid bill or fine linked to the family’s stay in jordan. if [the applicant] were deported to jordan, she would have to remain in denmark with the children, primarily for the sake of the children. his involvement in the case was neither random nor insignificant. with reference to that, and based on the information on the risk of double punishment, the court finds that there have been no such material changes in the applicant’s] personal circumstances as to satisfy the conditions for revoking the expulsion order. the applicant filed an appeal against the decision with the high court, before which the applicant and x were heard, and the ministry of foreign affairs was consulted anew. the latter had consulted a new legal source, which had confirmed the information obtained during the asylum procedure. the applicant submitted that in may 2013, thus before the district court’s decision of 3 june 2013 to refuse to revoke the expulsion order, he had divorced his wife, y, according to islamic law. it had not been decided whether she would follow him to jordan in case of expulsion. there would be no help in jordan for his disabled son. the applicant’s ex-wife, x, stated that it would not be possible for her to follow the applicant to jordan due to the son’s disability.
the applicants are joint owners of the property at number 274, republic street, valletta. initially, the property belonged to the applicants’ ascendants. according to the applicants’, the property’s market rental value (in 2014) was eur 269,100 annually. part of the property is utilised as a band club, and part of the property is operated as a restaurant and bar. in 2009, amendments were introduced to allow for increases in certain rents and to establish a cut-off date for existing protected leases relating to commercial properties, which are thus to come to an end in 2028. these amendments did not affect the applicants’ property which is rented out as a band club. the amendments however also gave the relevant minister the power to regulate conditions relating to clubs, thus allowing for the possibility of future amendments (see paragraph 19 below). in 2011, the applicants filed proceedings before the civil court (first hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction. the applicants claimed that their right to peaceful enjoyment of the property as protected under article 1 of protocol no. they claimed that they were being denied the use of their property without being provided with adequate compensation. the applicants further submitted that, in 2009, the law had been amended, allowing for an increase in rent and the establishment of a cut‑off date for existing “protected rents”, but the amendments in the law did not cover properties rented out as clubs. therefore, in contrast with other commercial rents, the annual rent for the club could not be raised, and the rent contract could not be terminated. the applicants claimed that the law was discriminatory and was therefore in violation of article 14 of the convention. on 8 october 2013, the civil court (first hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction found that the applicants had suffered a violation of article 1 of protocol no. 1 to the convention in so far as the interference with the applicants’ property rights had not been proportionate. the applicants had submitted that the property had a rental value of eur 269,100 a year, while the ag and the pm had submitted that the property had a rental value of eur 93,000 a year. keeping in mind the estimated rental values presented before the court, and the income that the kobc was generating from its bar, the court awarded eur 300,000 in damages to the applicants (to be paid half by the ag and the pm jointly, and half by the kobc). the court further concluded that the applicants had not suffered any discrimination as no satisfactory proof had been presented showing that they were discriminated against when compared to other owners leasing their property as a club. the ag, pm and kobc filed an appeal before the constitutional court. the constitutional court ordered that the costs of proceedings at both instances be paid by the applicants. however, in line with domestic case-law the constitutional court concluded that, because the agreement had been entered into voluntarily with full knowledge of the consequences it would lead to (that is, that the rent due could not be raised and the rent agreement could not be terminated), then the applicants could not allege a violation of their rights. this was so, even if due to the rate of inflation throughout the years, the rent due was now to be considered low. on 6 may 2015, the applicants filed an application for retrial. they noted that the protection given in law to clubs was introduced in 1955 while their predecessors in title had entered into a lease agreement in 1946. nevertheless, the applicants also instituted proceedings before this court on 20 july 2015. on 3 february 2016 the constitutional court rejected the applicants’ request for a re‑trial. the constitutional court held that, as the law stood, retrial could not be applied in regard to a case of a constitutional nature. the costs of the proceedings were to be paid by the applicants. as from 2015 the tenant also had to pay an additional rent calculated at the rate of 5% on the annual income derived by the club. as a result in 2015 the total annual rent paid to the applicants by the kobc was eur 2,876.

the applicant was born in 1933 and was detained in milan up to the time of his death in 2016. following a documented improvement in his condition, the gup ordered a new expert evaluation, which was carried out on 1 march 2013. by an order of 5 march 2013 the gup suspended the proceedings against the applicant. in addition to such monitoring, there is a record of physicians being called to examine the applicant when he complained about specific ailments, or when they were requested by the nursing staff. following an improvement in his overall condition, he was discharged on 19 october 2012. he concluded that no neurological deficits could be detected. the doctor further recommended that his cell be equipped with a bed with safety rails. on 15 december 2012 the duty nurse reported that the applicant had fallen out of bed while sleeping. on 17 december 2012 the duty nurse called the doctor, as the applicant was not responding to verbal or painful stimuli. however, there are no specific details about when that complaint was lodged, and no information was provided as to its outcome. following a consultation with an infectious disease specialist, he was prescribed treatment. the material on file indicates that, during this period of hospitalisation, the applicant had daily medical examinations, periodic visits from specialists, and diagnostic tests. the applicant was receiving artificial nutrition and hydration via a nasointestinal feeding tube which had been put in place on 6 september 2013 due to his confirmed inability to feed himself. he rarely uttered intelligible words or carried out elementary tasks when stimulated. on 9 april 2014 the applicant was transferred to san paolo hospital in milan, where he remained until the time of his death. in the doctor’s opinion, in the light of his current state of health, the applicant could only receive adequate medical treatment in a long-term care unit within a hospital. he was described as bedridden and was noted as being physically restrained because of his attempts to remove his feeding tube. various other reports were issued by doctors of san paolo hospital in milan between april 2015 and march 2016. by a decision of 3 may 2013 the bologna court responsible for the execution of sentences (“the bologna court”) held that there were no grounds for modifying the applicant’s sentence on health grounds. referring to the medical reports in its possession, the court noted that the applicant was responding positively to treatment and in the manner expected, given his advanced age and the nature of his medical conditions. as in its decision of 3 may 2013, the court further considered the danger that the applicant, a socially dangerous individual, could commit criminal offences in the event of his sentence being suspended. the applicant appealed against the decision before the court of cassation. it reiterated the bologna court’s findings to the effect that the applicant’s health conditions were being adequately monitored, and the necessary medical treatment was being administered in the correctional facility, with external hospitalisation when required. in making its assessment, the court relied on the content of the report by the two independent experts it had appointed (see paragraph 43 above). the order focused in particular on the findings of the dna, which outlined the applicant’s criminal profile as well as cosa nostra’s (the sicilian mafia) ongoing criminal activities, and called attention to the fact that one of the most prominent members of the applicant’s criminal organisation was still on the loose. the outcome of such investigations had also shed light on the means by which the applicant’s support network had enabled him to remain in hiding, the communication system between himself and prominent fugitives during their time in hiding, and his use of coded messages to convey the organisation’s strategies. on 31 march 2014 the applicant lodged an application against the minister of justice’s renewal order of 26 march 2014. the court also relied on reports from health-care staff in the hospital ward which indicated that the applicant had transient moments of lucidity alternating with moments of confusion, and that at times he replied to their questions in a comprehensible manner. on 23 march 2016 the minister of justice issued an order renewing the application of the special prison regime for another two years. as with the 2014 order, the minister of justice reiterated the regime’s rationale and purpose and provided an overview of information provided by different police bodies, prosecution offices, and the minister of the interior – information which had been requested with a view to ascertaining the persistence of the conditions justifying the extension of the regime.
the applicant was born in 1971 and lives in vienna. from january 2008 she held several seminars entitled “basic information on islam” (grundlagen des islams) at the right-wing freedom party education institute (bildungsinstitut der freiheitlichen partei österreichs). the applicant had not been involved in the selection of participants. one of the participants was an undercover journalist working for a weekly journal, n. 9. on 12 august 2010 the vienna public prosecutor’s office (staatsanwaltschaft wien – “the public prosecutor”) brought charges against the applicant, pursuant to article 283 of the criminal code, for inciting to hatred (verhetzung). this was partly because the public prosecutor had withdrawn the indictment concerning certain statements and partly because it could not be established that the applicant had made some of the other statements exactly – or at least approximately – as they were worded in the indictment. one of the biggest problems we are facing today is that muhammad is seen as the ideal man, the perfect human, the perfect muslim. this does not happen according to our social standards and laws. and, unfortunately, in al-bukhari the thing with aisha and child sex is written...
ii./ i remember my sister, i have said this several times already, when [s.w.] and me: “a 56-year-old and a six-year-old? one can never approve of something like that. eines der großen probleme, die wir heute haben, ist dass mohammed als der ideale mann, der perfekte mensch, der perfekte muslim gesehen wird. weil er war ein kriegsherr, hatte einen relativ großen frauenverschleiß, um das jetzt einmal so auszudrücken, hatte nun mal gerne mit kindern ein bisschen was. und er war nach unseren begriffen kein perfekter mensch. die wichtigsten von allen rechtsschulen anerkannten hadith-sammlungen: die allerwichtigste ist die sahih al-bukhari. in graz ihren berühmten sager gemacht hat, ruft mich meine schwester an und sagt: "um gottes willen. sie: "na ja, das muss man ein bisschen umschreiben, diplomatischer sagen." it stated that the applicant was referring to a marriage which muhammad had concluded with aisha, a six-year-old, and consummated when she had been nine. a balancing exercise between the rights under article 9 on the one hand and those under article 10 on the other needed to be carried out. the court stated that child marriages were not the same as paedophilia, and were not only a phenomenon of islam but also used to be widespread among the european ruling dynasties. however, the manner in which religious views were attacked could engage the state’s responsibility in order to guarantee the peaceful exercise of the rights under article 9. it had not been her intention to disparage muhammad. she had merely criticised the notion that an adult had had sexual intercourse with a nine-year-old child and raised the question whether this amounted to paedophilia. it had rightly made a distinction between child marriages and paedophilia. it had not based its findings on an unpredictable definition of the term “paedophilia” but on a common definition which was comparable to that used by the world health organisation. it concluded that the latter was the case as muslims would find the applicant’s statements – “he liked to do it with children”, “the thing with aisha and child sex” and “a 56-year-old and a six-year-old? wrong and offensive, even if muhammad had married a six-year-old and had had intercourse with her when she had been nine. on 6 june 2012 the applicant lodged her application with the court. where a conviction was based on article 188 of the criminal code, the principles developed under article 9 and 10 of the convention had to be considered when examining whether a statement was capable of “arousing justified indignation”. the court, whilst not misjudging the importance of the debate about sexual contact between adults and children, found that the applicant had not contributed to a debate of general interest because she had made her allegation primarily in order to defame muhammad.
the facts, as submitted by the parties, are similar to those in association “21 december 1989” and others v. romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 may 2011). the applicants or their close relatives participated in demonstrations and were injured or killed by gunfire during the events of december 1989 in bucharest, slobozia, târgoviște and reșița, which led to the fall of the communist regime. in 1990 the military prosecutor’s offices from several cities opened on their own motion criminal investigations into the use of violence against the demonstrators. the applicants’ injury and their close relatives’ deaths were investigated along with most of the cases in a main criminal investigation recorded in file no. the most important procedural steps were mentioned in association “21 december 1989” and others (cited above, §§ 12-41) and in sidea and others v. romania ([committee] no. subsequent relevant developments of the criminal investigation are as follows. on 1 november 2016 the military prosecutor ordered the initiation in rem of a criminal investigation for the offence of crimes against humanity in respect of the same circumstances of fact. up to february 2017 further steps were taken in gathering information from domestic authorities, the prosecutor’s office contacting 211 civil parties, questioning members of the political party which took over the presidency at the time of events, planning the taking of evidence from military officers and other participants in the events, verifying the activity of the relevant military units and the audio/video recordings broadcast by radio and television. from march 2017 the military prosecutor examined military and civilian archives, including the vast archives of the romanian senate. they also viewed and transcribed more than 400 hours of audio/video recordings. they proceeded with the re-examination of several witnesses. they questioned military personnel involved in the december 1989 military operations and fifty-one members of the political party which ruled at the time and of other authorities. they verified the documents indicating the military units’ actions from that period. at the date of the latest information communicated by the parties to the court (29 march 2018), the criminal investigation was still ongoing.
the first applicant was born in 1950 and lives in reykjavík. the second applicant was born in 1948 and lives in reykjavík. both applicants are attorneys practising in reykjavík. on 16 february 2012 y and z were indicted for participating in fraud and market manipulation along with two other individuals. on 7 march 2012, in accordance with article 31 of the criminal procedures act no. on 7 march 2012, the indictment of the prosecution against, inter alios, y and z was registered before the district court of reykjavík. at a preliminary hearing they pleaded not guilty to the charges laid against them. on 19 december 2012, after consulting the prosecution, the applicants and the other defence counsel, the district court judge decided that the trial would take place from 11 to 23 april 2013. shortly afterwards the judge replied with “merry christmas!”. on 24 january and 7 march 2013 the prosecution submitted further evidence in the case. by a decision of the same day the district court rejected the request. in a preliminary hearing on 21 march 2013, the prosecution and one defence counsel submitted further evidence. the applicants and the other defence counsel requested that the prosecution provide them with certain documentary evidence. in a preliminary hearing on 25 march 2013 the applicants and the other defence counsel requested again that the trial be postponed for 6-8 weeks to allow them to study new evidence presented by the prosecution. by decisions of 26 march 2013, the district court rejected both requests. they noted that they had discussed this with their clients and made clear that the latter approved of their decision. he reiterated that the trial would start on 11 april 2013 as previously decided. the applicants replied to the letter immediately, referred to their previous arguments and stated that they would not attend the trial on 11 april 2013. a new trial was held before the district court from 4 to 14 november 2013. in the meantime, the presiding judge had withdrawn from the case and a new judge had been appointed. by a judgment of 12 december 2013, y and z, along with the other two accused, were convicted. as regards the second complaint, the applicants argued, inter alia, that imposing fines on them as defence counsel had not been in accordance with the cpa as they had not been defence counsel at the time the district court judgment was delivered. furthermore, the applicants maintained that their conduct in question had not occurred during the proceedings as the cpa required. the applicants submitted documentary evidence along with their submissions to the supreme court. the supreme court held an oral hearing in the case where the applicants were represented by legal counsel. according to section 223 and 224 of the cpa the applicants could only be fined as “defence counsel” in a substantive judgment in the criminal case against their clients or as “others”, during the main trial in the criminal case against their clients. in its judgment the supreme court described the facts in detail. according to general rules the defendants in question must then be provided with the opportunity to defend themselves. when it became clear that [the applicants] would not fulfil their duty of attending the trial and the court was considering imposing fines on them, they should have been summoned to a special hearing and given an opportunity to present their case and submit further arguments to that end, beyond what they had already clearly raised in their correspondence with the district court. instead [the applicants] were relieved of their duties at the hearing on 11 april 2013 and a decision to impose fines on them was taken in the judgment delivered on 12 december 2013.
the applicant was born in 1969 and lives in kyiv. on 28 march 2007 and 23 october 2007 the kyiv regional court of appeal and the supreme court respectively upheld the applicant’s conviction. from 13 april 2007 to 17 june 2011 the applicant had been serving his sentence in boryspil correctional colony (“the prison”). on 17 june 2011 he was released on probation. inmates suffering from hiv and tuberculosis were kept together with healthy prisoners. the food and water provided to him and other prisoners were unsatisfactory and hazardous to their health. in his reply to the government’s observations, the applicant also submitted that the cells had been overcrowded. prisoners were often subjected to ill-treatment by guards, which included arbitrary solitary confinement in disciplinary cells, verbal and physical abuse and threats. some searches had been carried out at night. as a result, the applicant experienced fear and stress. no adequate medical assistance was provided to the applicant during his imprisonment. in particular, he did not undergo a thorough medical examination and no long-term strategy for his medical treatment was drawn up. he only received occasional and symptomatic treatment. he did not receive adequate remuneration for the work done. he therefore had to send some letters to the court via friends who were at liberty. however, those complaints were either not dispatched or were ignored. they contended in this respect that the applicant had failed to support the allegations with any evidence. the relevant medical tests were performed once a year to reveal those affected by this disease. the food and water were regularly checked and were of adequate quality. the heating functioned adequately and the temperature in the cell in winter was between 18oc and 20oc. the sanitary conditions were appropriate. in support of their account of the facts, the government submitted: information notes concerning living conditions in the prison, issued by the prison governor in reply to a request from the government; an extract from the applicant’s detention card concerning the provision of bedding; and records of completed disinfection operations carried out in the prison in july and october 2011. on 2 march 2009 the applicant was diagnosed with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and was provided with appropriate treatment. on 23 september 2008 and 29 april 2009 the applicant was found to be suffering from dermatitis and prescribed appropriate treatment. when he had refused job offers, he had assisted unpaid with different kinds of prison maintenance work, for no more than two hours a day. the government provided no information as regards the applicant’s allegation that his correspondence had been monitored by the prison administration. as regards the applicant’s communication with the court, they denied that all the letters sent to him had been opened. on 7 may 2008 the applicant lodged the present application with the court. by letters of 8 and 15 september 2008 the brovary town court, at which his case file was kept, informed the applicant, inter alia, that the case file did not contain his cassation appeals or any replies from or judgments of the supreme court. on 9 april 2009 the applicant was provided with a copy of the supreme court’s judgment in his criminal case and on 13 april 2009 he submitted it to the court.

“... after the european union’s ‘never make any progress’ report of 6 october 2004, it was expected, as a ‘conditioned reflex’, that those in the pay of the wild west (vahşi batının beslemeleri), almost all of whom are former ... communists, would follow their masters, and even surpass them. and there is another man whose life depends on the fact of eating and swallowing; the more dogfood he eats, the more applause he attracts ... a miserable spy and apostate. calm down a little, [you might scratch] the rolex on your front paw. carry on anyway with your bird-brain dividing, dismantling and growling. oh crack-voiced, short-breathed bootlicker! on 3 june 2009 the plenary assembly of the civil chambers of the court of cassation, upholding the arguments put forward in the cassation judgment of 31 january 2008, set aside the ankara regional court’s judgment.
the applicant was born in 1987 and lives in belgium. at the time of the events, he was studying at a university in constanţa, where he had been since october 2006. a student at the same university as the applicant, on suspicion of drug trafficking. at around 1.30 p.m. on 18 april 2008 o.d.a. was immediately taken to the tulcea county police station, where he gave a written statement saying that he had “had” the drugs from the applicant. he also said in his statement that he had been informed that he was entitled to a lawyer but had waived this right. on the same date the case prosecutor submitted to the tulcea county court a request to search the residences of o.d.a. had been extended to the applicant on suspicion of drug trafficking. i bought these drugs from a friend of a friend of mine ... he offered me a deal from someone he knew. he further stated that since he did not use lsd and had needed money he had decided to sell nine lsd tabs to o.d.a. lastly, he said that he had never sold any drugs before, that he was not a drug trafficker and that he was sorry for his actions, which he would never repeat. at the upper bottom of the front page the statement was signed and dated 18 april 2008 by a police officer. the applicant was then taken to the headquarters of diicot where, at 2.15 p.m. on 19 april 2008, the prosecutor informed him of the accusations against him, namely unlawful possession of, importing and trafficking drugs. at the same time the applicant was informed of his right to an interpreter and a lawyer of his own choosing and to remain silent. the applicant also said: “i have no complaints against the police authorities or the prosecutor”. in custody was rejected by the tulcea county court because the two men did not have a criminal record, were students and had been willingly cooperating with the investigative authorities. the tulcea county court considered the criminal case between september and october 2008. the applicant, who was assisted by two lawyers of his choice and did not contest the charges brought against him, raised numerous complaints before the court regarding procedural irregularities during the investigation. on 24 october 2008 the tulcea county court convicted the applicant of unlawful possession of, importing and trafficking drugs and gave him a three-year suspended sentence. he was fined 1,000 romanian lei ((rol) – approximately 270 euros (eur)). in february 2008 the applicant and his brother had travelled to belgium to visit their father and from there to amsterdam, in order to smoke thc. the court however held that the applicant could not claim that he had not been aware of the contents of his luggage since in his first statement (see paragraph 9 above) he had declared that he had personally packed the lsd in a black bag in his suitcase. according to his statements, he had bought approximately 40 grams of cannabis from the applicant on several occasions, and twelve lsd tabs that he had sold at a higher price. had been caught trying to sell the twelve lsd tabs. the applicant appealed against that judgment, reiterating his previous arguments. on 3 april 2009 the constanţa court of appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal as ill-founded. the applicant filed an appeal on points of law (recurs). he argued, among other things, that he had been held at the police station and at the prosecutor’s office without legal justification for an unreasonable length of time (twenty-two hours); he also stressed that his initial confession had been taken while he had been detained at the police station without an interpreter, in the absence of a lawyer and following threats by the police officer guarding him. in conclusion, the court considered that the proceedings, taken as a whole, had been fair. the remaining arguments raised by the applicant were dismissed by the court as not proved.
the applicant is the biological mother of four children. m. was later adopted in france and has no contact with the applicant. on 4 january 2011, after the applicant had given birth to e., the cerknica centre’s social workers visited her in the hospital, where the medical staff brought to their attention that the applicant was unable to take care of e. and needed constant supervision and help. the cerknica centre’s records of the phone call show that on 11 february 2011 it tried to telephone g. but was unsuccessful. on 30 january 2011 the applicant travelled to france to see her husband. on 18 february 2011, by way of an interim care order, the cerknica centre placed e. in the care of foster parents, who later adopted her (see paragraph 50 below). it does not appear that the applicant attempted to challenge the removal and/or care order in any way. her location was not always known to her family or the cerknica centre, which tried to reach her, unsuccessfully. since giving birth to e. she has been placed in a psychiatric hospital several times, including against her will on at least one occasion. the cerknica centre’s records of 9 april 2014 show that the cerknica centre offered services including counselling to the applicant, who refused this, arguing that she had already joined a self-help group and had monthly sessions with a psychologist and psychiatric examinations every three months. the cerknica centre’s records of the ipt’s meeting, prepared by a social worker, show that on 6 june 2011 the applicant visited the cerknica centre, enquiring about e. for the first time. on 5 july 2011 the first contact session with e. took place. following a request by the applicant of 4 july 2012, the fourth contact session took place on 11 july 2012. a social worker from the kranj social work centre who was supervising the contact session noted in her report that the applicant was tired during the contact session and stopped playing with e. after a couple of minutes. on 8 january 2014 the applicant asked the cerknica centre for contact sessions on a more regular basis. the report further found that after the constitutional court had confirmed the withdrawal of the applicant’s parental rights (see paragraph 48 below), the cerknica centre had properly considered that the contact had been forced upon e. and thus was not in her best interests. according to those records, she answered that she had been too busy with other things. she submitted that since e. was safe in foster care there was no urgency to divest her of her parental rights. in her view, the court should wait for her mental health – which at that point was poor – to improve before deciding the application. in his opinion of 16 may 2012 he submitted to the court that the applicant suffered from a disease on the schizophrenia spectrum, but had the capacity to be a party in the proceedings. with respect to g., who had not responded to the cerknica centre’s application for the withdrawal of his parental rights and had remained inactive in the court proceedings, the court noted that he had not shown any interest in e. and had clearly demonstrated that he was not going to take care of her. with respect to the applicant, it found that the applicant had abandoned e. and had seriously neglected her parental responsibilities. equally, her neglectful conduct in relation to e. when she had left her did not reflect the true will and conscious action of the applicant. the applicant subsequently asked the supreme state prosecutor to lodge a request for the protection of legality. it emphasised that foster care was a temporary measure and that a child needed a long-term placement which provided him or her with permanent loving care and intimacy from the same person. she requested that contact sessions take place every fortnight for three hours. the court held that it would allow contact between e. and the applicant if it established on a cumulative basis that e. was personally attached to the applicant, had a family-type relationship with her, and that the contact was in e.’s interests. in the applicant’s opinion, dr z. had failed to examine the possibility that progress in establishing a relationship with e. could have been made had the cerknica centre not arbitrarily suspended the contact more than a year and a half earlier. it found that the first-instance court had convincingly established in a well-reasoned decision that contact with the applicant was not in e.’s interests because of the applicant’s lack of emotional capacity to establish a relationship with e. and her negative attitude towards the adoptive parents. she did not appeal against that decision, nor did she lodge a constitutional complaint.
the applicants were born in 1979 and 1987 respectively. on 5 april 2009 general elections took place in moldova. the first applicant was asked to identify her bag. allegedly threatened her with death if she did not sign, after which she signed the arrest record. the applicants heard sounds of people being beaten from the adjacent room, following which a.c. took the applicants one by one to another adjacent room. each of the applicants was also ordered to do sit-ups while naked, while both officers smiled. no food was provided for them and they were not allowed to contact anyone outside the detention centre. on the morning of 9 april 2009 a prosecutor visited their cell and asked whether anyone had been ill-treated or had any other complaints. after finding their files and reading them for several seconds, the judge declared that five days of detention for each of the applicants would suffice. the entire “trial” took not more than five minutes. on the same day at around 11 p.m. the applicants and five other female detainees were ordered to enter the back section of a police minivan measuring 2.5 square metres and were taken to an unknown destination, without any explanation of the reasons for the move. following that the internal security department of the ministry of internal affairs conducted, in april-may 2009, an internal investigation into the matter in order to verify the allegations. n. noted that she had been taken by officer a.c. on 18 may 2009 a prosecutor interviewed the applicants, who repeated their statements made to the police. on 20 may 2009 the results of the internal investigation (see paragraph 15 above) were also submitted to the prosecutor general’s office. on 10 september 2009 the military prosecutor’s office, which had been tasked with examining all complaints of ill-treatment during the events of april 2009, decided not to launch a criminal investigation in response to the applicants’ complaint of 23 july 2009 to the prosecutor general’s office, in the absence of any evidence that an offence had been committed. (b)  criminal proceedings against the police officers 21. had ill-treated the applicants by means of psychological intimidation and forcing them to undress in front of persons of the opposite sex. was submitted to the centru district court for trial. to five years’ imprisonment, conditionally suspending the execution of both sentences for a probation period of five years. ’s imprisonment term to five years and maintaining all the other sanctions. 41704/02, 20 october 2009) and pădureţ v. moldova (no. during the criminal investigation and the trial v.d. when one young woman (n.) had looked away, he had hit the back of her head, as a result of which her forehead had struck the wall. had clearly exceeded his powers as a police officer, but that the applicants had not sustained such serious damage as to qualify as torture. in respect of whom the prosecution had continued to press criminal charges. they had thus been forced to sign documents which had subsequently led to their detention. with the criminal offence of excess of powers (article 328 of the criminal code, see paragraph 37 below), but had preferred to examine the case under the contravention code, with the effect of letting a.c. on 26 july 2010 the applicants challenged in court the decisions of 16 and 22 april 2010, as well as that of 10 june 2010.
the applicant was born in 1985 and lives in viljandi. at the time of the events at issue, the applicant was serving a prison sentence for robbery and violence against a prison official. according to the risk assessment contained in his individual management plan drawn up by tartu prison on 16 january 2013 (kinnipeetava individuaalne täitmiskava), the applicant had been punished five times for criminal acts and was assessed to be a danger to the public, prone to risks and impulsive. on 13 may 2013 the applicant requested prison leave to attend his grandmother’s funeral in tarvastu, viljandi county, which is located approximately 80 km from tartu prison. the applicant stated in his request that he was aware that the leave would entail him wearing handcuffs and that he would be accompanied by guards. permission for prison leave under supervision (lühiajaline väljaviimine) was granted on 14 may 2013. the decision (käskkiri) made reference to the fact that the applicant was considered highly dangerous and had received several disciplinary punishments which were still in effect. on 15 may 2013 the applicant and his brother (also a prisoner in the same prison), were to be transported to the funeral service in the same prison van. at 9.30 a.m. he was placed in a single occupancy compartment of a prisoner transport van. it was a volkswagen crafter van used by the prison since october 2010, which had one four-person compartment and four single occupancy compartments. each single occupancy compartment was at least 60 cm wide, 149 cm high and 85 cm long, with a floor area of 0.51 square metres. the compartment in which the applicant was placed was furnished with a plastic seat attached to the floor. the prison van reached the vehicle access gate of the prison premises. the applicant then decided not to go to the funeral and was taken back to the prison approximately twenty minutes later. his brother was thereafter transported to the funeral at 10.02 a.m. and reached the cemetery at 10.57 a.m. 11. he added that the van compartment had been too small and without safety equipment, making him fear for his life. the applicant also alleged he had suffered psychological trauma because he had been forced to forego attending his grandmother’s funeral owing to the above-mentioned conditions. on 4 december 2013, repeating the same complaints as those detailed above, the applicant lodged a complaint against tartu prison with the tartu administrative court. on 11 march 2014 the tartu administrative court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. the court referred to the legal basis for using hand and ankle cuffs and considered it justified. with regard to the conditions in the transport van, the court noted that the applicant had refused to be transferred and therefore had never been subjected to the conditions described. as the applicant had refused to go on prison leave of his own free will, no unlawful action could be attributed to tartu prison. the court considered it plausible that the applicant had decided not to attend the funeral because he had not wanted his relatives to have a bad impression of him. however, there was no sign that the prison authorities had particularly wanted to degrade him in front of his family by resorting to the use of hand and ankle cuffs. on 9 september 2014 the applicant lodged an appeal against the first-instance judgment with the tartu court of appeal. he claimed, inter alia, that there had been no reason to conclude that he would have been embarrassed to be in shackles in front of his family, and that the main reason he had decided not to go to the funeral had been the transport conditions. on 7 october 2014 the tartu court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. as the transfer van had never left the precincts of the prison, he could not claim compensation for something that might have happened or for any trauma that might have occurred had he taken the prison leave. on 10 november 2014 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, stating that he stood by the same submissions he had made to the lower courts. on 11 february 2015 the supreme court refused him leave to appeal on points of law.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in batman. it appears that there are also a number of private petrol stations in the vicinity. there is no further information in the case file as to any other action taken by the fact-finding commission. the owners of those properties were declared “disaster victims”. the commission for the discharge of chemicals of an unknown origin measured the levels of underground gas in the area and, where high levels of gas were detected, arranged for it to be discharged through pipes. it is not clear whether and when this report was made public. however, the interpretation of the available data suggested that pollution of such great magnitude could only have been caused over a long period by a facility with a high capacity of petroleum refining and storage in the vicinity, which pointed to the tüpraş refinery (a conclusion which was challenged by tüpraş and tpao representatives). in accordance with the proposal in the above interim report, on 17 august 2005 the local environment board of the batman governor’s office decided that no business or occupation permits should be granted in the area designated as the “red zone”, which consisted of an area of 200 x 300 metres where the contamination was at its highest, until the underground clean-up operation in the area was completed. according to a report dated 12 may 2004 prepared by experts from tüpraş, pressure tests conducted on the ant pipeline suggested the possibility of a leak in that pipeline. it was estimated that the leak had been ongoing for a very long time and that it involved some four to six thousand tonnes of phenol. the public prosecutor relied as evidence on the commission reports mentioned in paragraphs 10 to 24 above. at the first hearing held on 28 january 2005, a representative of the victims claimed that even if the oil leak which had caused the explosion had originated from the ant pipeline, tüpraş, as the supplier of the oil into that pipeline, remained responsible for the explosion. the tüpraş executives mainly made the following arguments in their defence statements. (vi)  all product lines at the tüpraş refinery were above ground and consistently monitored. (i)  the studies carried out so far were inadequate to determine the source of the leak. (iii)  the suspected corporations should normally have the technical means and manpower to detect any leaks originating from their facilities and take the necessary precautions. however, where leaks arose from breaches of pipelines or other equipment by malicious individuals for the purposes of theft, then these institutions could not be expected to uncover such incidents by their own efforts alone. on 7 november 2006 three other experts, all of whom were engineers who worked as work safety inspectors, issued a second report. they noted in the report that the studies undertaken thus far had not been able to reveal the source or sources of the leak. on 1 may 2008 the batman assize court delivered its judgment on the case. in the course of one of those sets of proceedings (case no. the judgment of the batman civil court, which was the first occasion on which the tüpraş refinery was publicly confirmed as the source of the leak by a court of law, was upheld by the court of cassation on 30 january 2007. in its response dated 19 december 2006, tüpraş claimed firstly that the applicant’s claims had become time-barred, as he had failed to lodge his action within one year of the date of the explosion. he reserved his right to subsequently increase his claim. the civil court held in its decision that both the original claims and the subsequent request to increase those original claims had been brought within the one-year time-limit set out in article 60 § 1 of the former code of obligations, bearing in mind that the relevant time-limit would only start running when both the damage and the tortfeasor responsible for that damage became known to the victim. the company also stressed that it had been held responsible for the explosion without any objective and tangible proof. bearing in mind that 132 similar civil actions had been brought against its refinery in connection with the explosion of may 2004, it now risked paying damages of over try 10 to 12 million, plus interest and court fees. the court of cassation held in this connection that the explosion at issue had taken place on 3 may 2004 and that, soon after that date, some of the property owners in toptancılar sitesi had brought compensation claims against tüpraş. on 25 september 2008 the 4th chamber of the court of cassation dismissed that request without providing any reasoning. on 28 may 2009 the 4th chamber of the court of cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court without responding to any of the applicant’s claims.
the applicant was born in 1972 and lives in barcelos. on 16 november 2010 the permanent council of the csm decided to open disciplinary proceedings against the applicant (disciplinary case no. was placed in charge of the investigation. drew up an indictment against the applicant, of which she was notified on 9 february 2011. the indictment stated, in particular, that in a letter to the csm dated 9 june 2010 the applicant had accused the judicial inspector h.g. and the applicant to appear before him to give evidence. they gave evidence on 22 and 23 february 2011 respectively. during the investigation various documents were examined and witnesses were questioned. as required by section 120 of the act, the indictment specified where the applicant or her lawyer could consult her disciplinary file. requested leave from the csm to stand down from the case, saying that he was the applicant’s “sworn enemy” following the accusations she had made against him in the context of her request for him to be withdrawn. in an order dated 3 may 2011 the permanent council of the csm granted judge f.m.j. ’s request to stand down and replaced him with another judicial investigator, judge a.v.n. in a final judgment of 21 march 2013 the judicial division of the supreme court unanimously dismissed the appeal. the supreme court may only assess the reasonable and coherent nature of the relationship between the facts as established by the authority [whose decision is contested] and the evidence on which its decision was based ...
the extent of the supreme court’s review of the facts is confined to ascertaining that the assessment [made by the authority whose decision is contested] was not defective; it cannot re-examine the evidence relied on and deliver a fresh judgment on the basis of that evidence. on 29 march 2011, following information received from the judicial investigator f.m.j., the investigation also concerned the witness in question. on an unspecified date judge r. was placed in charge of the investigation as judicial investigator. on 19 july 2011 the applicant lodged a complaint against this report with the judicial investigator. she requested that the indictment be set aside and that she be given additional time to prepare her defence. in an order of 31 august 2011 the judicial investigator dismissed the complaint on the grounds, in particular, that the applicant had not raised a plea of nullity in respect of the indictment in her defence pleadings (see paragraph 37 above). 333/10 the applicant had knowingly agreed to use testimony containing false statements concerning the acts of which she had been accused. in the event of such an omission it was empowered solely to set aside the disciplinary body’s decision and refer the case back to that body for any further steps in the investigation. in any event, in the present case, suspending enforcement of the penalty would have run counter to its purpose; and
(b)  that the penalty imposed had not been disproportionate. she admitted having had a private conversation with f.m.j., ’s testimony to be credible, he concluded on that basis that the facts were established and therefore proposed that the applicant be removed from office for acting in breach of her duties of loyalty and propriety. on 30 january 2012 the judicial investigator rectified various errors in the report. in a decision of 10 april 2012 the csm, sitting in plenary session, found that the applicant had acted in breach of her duties of loyalty and propriety. the supreme court held as follows:
“whether or not the provisions governing a special administrative action [ação administrativa especial] to set aside an administrative act permit the holding of a public hearing at an appellant’s request will naturally depend from the outset on the extent of the supreme court’s powers of review, as fashioned and regulated specifically by the status of judges act, with regard to the establishment of the facts and the taking of evidence in connection with the appeal. with regard to the evidence which the applicant proposed to produce during the hearing, the supreme court found that it was inadmissible and irrelevant, stressing in particular
(a)  that the applicant’s request for evidence to be heard from the witness had been aimed at establishing the content of the draft decision of the plenary csm in the applicant’s disciplinary case; this ran counter to the confidentiality of the proceedings leading to the final decision; and
(b)  that the documents submitted by the applicant went beyond the subject-matter of the disciplinary proceedings. the decision of 30 september 2014 was taken by a formation comprising twelve of the seventeen members of the csm (seven judges, including the president of the csm, and five non-judicial members).
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in podgorica. on 29 or 30 january 2013 the applicant telephoned the police and reported x for threatening him. some passers-by separated x from the applicant, after which x left the scene saying “i will bring a knife and a hammer to kill you”. the same day the applicant lodged a criminal complaint in written form against x, after which x was arrested. on 6 february 2013 x was charged with violent behaviour. and inflicting light bodily injuries on him. the proceedings on those two indictments were joined into a single set of proceedings. on 9 october 2012, and of violent behaviour against the applicant on 1 february 2013. the court also established that x had stabbed v.j. it transpires from the case file that after that attack, x had been arrested and then released, but there is no information as to the exact dates. that judgment became final on 20 june 2013. on 24 june 2013 the court of first instance requested the prison authorities to transfer x to a special hospital in kotor. on 12 april 2016 the court of first instance issued an order (nalog) directing x to undergo outpatient psychiatric treatment in a healthcare centre (dom zdravlja). he was readmitted to hospital between 22 august and 21 october 2016, apparently at his own request. owing to the failure of the state to undertake any preventive measure in respect of x, the applicant had been attacked by him and had suffered injuries. in the course of the proceedings, on 20 december 2013 the court heard z.ɖ., a police officer, who had been patrolling for more than ten years in the neighbourhood where x lived and where the applicant’s bar was located. had looked for x in order to talk to him but had been unable to find him for the next two days. after the applicant had been attacked, z.ɖ. he did not know, however, whether those complaints had been further processed. in addition, after the attack x had been criminally prosecuted and found guilty. therefore, there had been no lack of action and thus the state was not liable for the non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant. relying on section 148(1) of the obligations act, the court held as follows:
“the court dismisses as factually and legally unfounded the applicant’s submissions that the state ought to have hospitalised x before the event here in issue, as the state bodies did order his hospitalisation as soon as the conditions for that had been met. on 20 april 2015 the high court upheld the first-instance judgment. that decision was served on the applicant on 13 january 2016 at the earliest. on 28 june 2006 he was found guilty of setting his flat on fire and was ordered to undergo mandatory outpatient psychiatric treatment. that period of hospitalisation would appear to have been prompted by an attempt by x to commit suicide by taking a large quantity of medication. there is no information as to whether x had any treatment or a medical check-up thereafter. it is clear from the case file that between the periods of hospitalisation in 2008 and 2012, x had seen a psychiatrist on at least three occasions: on 1 november 2010, 22 september and 11 october 2011. on 13 december 2013 x was deprived of his legal capacity following a proposal to that effect by the local social work centre of 14 november 2013.
the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in istanbul. when his enquiries did not yield any results, the applicant informed the police that his sons were missing. he also informed the police that they had not had any disagreements or fights which could have prompted their disappearance. on the same day, the police informed the kartal public prosecutor of the disappearance of the applicant’s sons. she had noticed that aykan had looked somewhat anxious before leaving home, and that he had forgotten to wear his school tie and socks. although her son aykut had had a mobile telephone, he had left the telephone at home that day. based on the information obtained from the applicant and his wife, the police registered aykut and aykan as missing persons. on 27 november 2007 the kartal public prosecutor’s office asked the turkish telecommunication institution to provide a record of the individuals who had called aykut aka’s mobile telephone in the past three months, together with their complete identity information and addresses. an initial examination revealed no sign of violence on the body. it was decided to transfer the body to the forensic medicine institute for a full autopsy, without which the definite cause of death could not be established. on the same day, officers from the sarıyer security directorate prepared an incident scene report. when he had picked up the telephone, a woman unknown to him had asked why he had answered that telephone, and then had hung up. had denied any involvement with the message. words: aykan aka written by: aykan aka [and signature]. i am giving my life to his holiness azrael, this is wonderful”. the principal said that aykut had been talkative and a successful student. aykan, on the other hand, had not had good marks, and, according to his schoolmates, had not been very sociable. stated that he had met aykan some three months before at the start of the school year. aykan had been withdrawn, but he had not appeared to have any problems at school or home. he had once made a calculation and said that the doomsday would arrive in fifty two years and two hours, and had then said that it would not matter whether they died then or fifty two years later. a body was located at the sea floor some fifty metres from the coast. just like aykan, aykut was also wearing a rucksack filled with heavy stones. his rucksack was also attached to his body by a rope. the call records enclosed with that letter were not submitted to the court. however, a handwritten note on the letter, by an unknown author, indicates that no significant calls were detected in the records. the report also indicated that no toxic substances were found in their bodies, nor were any signs of trauma noted. on 1 april 2008 the applicant objected to the decisions delivered by the sarıyer public prosecutor. he had not fully investigated his sons’ telephone records or cctv footage that could have revealed information regarding their deaths, nor had he questioned his sons’ close friends. the lack of an effective investigation into the incident had impaired his trust in the justice system, which had compelled him to participate in a live tv show in the hope of gathering information that could shed light on the circumstances of his sons’ deaths. a number of viewers had called the studio with possible information on the incident, yet the public prosecutor’s office had not sought those individuals out with a view to getting official statements.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in villavente (león). he worked as a teacher, also acting as head of department, in a public school, the león school of arts and crafts (escuela de artes y oficios de león). one of his colleagues – a teacher in the same department – filed a complaint against him with the education authorities for psychological harassment in the workplace. the complaint was dismissed on the basis that there had been no harassment but mere disputes at work. on 20 june 2006 the colleague filed an administrative claim with the department of education of the regional government of castilla-león aimed at seeking redress for the malfunctioning of the public administration. she requested that the administration be found liable for the alleged psychological harassment in the workplace. the competent authorities did not render a decision within the requisite time-limit. on 25 january 2007 the colleague instituted judicial proceedings (recurso contencioso-administrativo) against the implied rejection of her request of 20 june 2006. she claimed that the applicant had subjected her to workplace harassment, from the academic year 2000/01 onwards in particular, and that the competent authorities had failed to take any measures to prevent it. she described a series of events in which the applicant had allegedly made false accusations against her and subjected her to discriminatory and humiliating treatment, disrespect, insults and death threats at work in the presence of students, parents and other colleagues. the colleague further requested compensation from the regional administration of castilla-león in the amount of 74,434.12 euros (eur), as well as reinstatement in her position as a teacher at the león school of arts and crafts, requesting that all appropriate measures be taken to prevent any possible risks, particularly psychosocial, in the workplace. on 19 december 2007, after notice of the aforementioned application was given, the respondent – the regional administration of castilla-león – contested the claims and requested the dismissal of the application. it concluded that the situation suffered by her amounted to workplace harassment and that the education authorities, despite being aware of the situation, had not taken effective measures to bring it to an end. although the court acknowledged that not all the acts or behaviour attributed to the applicant could be considered psychological harassment, it found that on the basis of the evidence collected a situation of psychological harassment in the workplace had been shown to exist. on 15 december 2011 the applicant requested to have access to the file and to become a party to the proceedings. he claimed to have learned of the judgment some days earlier through the publication of information in a león newspaper (diario de león). by a decision of 23 january 2012, the high court of justice of castilla-león granted the applicant access to the file but refused his request to be a party to the proceedings on the basis that he could not be considered to be an interested party in liability proceedings against the public administration. on 1 february 2012 the applicant lodged an appeal against the above-mentioned decision requesting the annulment of the proceedings. the high court of justice of castilla-león dismissed it by a decision of 2 march 2012. on the one hand, the court held that the request for annulment of the proceedings had been made outside the time-limit prescribed by law, since an “appeal for annulment” (incidente de nulidad) should have been submitted within twenty days of the date the applicant became aware of a possible breach of his rights. the court took into account that the applicant had claimed that he had learned of the judgment through the publication of information in a newspaper on 9 and 10 december 2011, and that in any case on 15 december 2011 (the date on which he had requested access to the file and to become a party to the proceedings) he had clearly known the decisive elements for his complaints. the court nevertheless decided on the merits. it stressed that the proceedings were aimed at determining liability for the damage suffered by the claimant as a result of the acts of the authorities and staff working for the public administration. therefore, in line with section 145 of law 30/1992 and the relevant subordinate legislation, within such proceedings neither the authorities nor civil servants could be sued nor, accordingly, could they be a party to the proceedings. lastly, the court stated that the public official concerned would only be considered to be an interested party in a recovery action (acción de repetición) under section 145(2) of law 30/1992, in which each and every one of the elements constituting the liability for which recovery was sought could be contested, including the acts attributed to him or her. the court thus concluded that the concept of an “interested party” in liability proceedings brought against the public administration should be understood as referring to those allegedly injured by the acts of public officials. the restriction on public officials being a party to such (administrative or judicial) proceedings was however justified by the special nature, purpose and scope of liability proceedings brought against the public administration. according to the court, such proceedings were set up to facilitate redress and compensation for those affected by the acts of public officials. he claimed that, despite his having a direct and personal interest in the proceedings on the basis that his rights and legitimate interests had been affected, he had not been summoned to appear and his request to become a party to the proceedings had been refused. the court declared the appeal inadmissible by a decision of 2 october 2012 (served on the applicant on 9 october 2012) on the grounds that it had not duly justified its special constitutional significance.
the applicants were born in 1958, 1977, 1956, 1981 and 1979, respectively (see appendix). he was also acquitted of the charges of unlawful assembly and association (reunión ilícita y asociación ilítica). in particular, the first applicant argued that during the oral hearing, and once the applicant had finished his statement, the presiding judge had asked him whether he condemned eta’s (euskadi ta askatasuna, the former armed basque nationalist and separatist organisation) violence. the first applicant had refused to give an answer. the presiding judge had then replied that she “already knew that he was not going to give an answer to that question”. on 2 february 2011 the supreme court ruled in favour of the first applicant, finding that the presiding judge’s declarations during the trial had cast doubts on the absence of prejudice or bias. the supreme court, assessing the proceedings as a whole, found that there were “objective reasons” to consider that the presiding judge (and judge rapporteur of the case) was expressing a prejudice against the first applicant about the significance that should be given to the phrases and words expressed by him, which had also led to a preconceived idea as to his guilt. thus, the applicant’s doubts as to the impartiality of this judge were “objectively justified”. consequently, the supreme court declared that the judgment was void and ordered a re-trial by a new panel formed by three other judges different from the ones that were part of the composition of that panel. as a result, a new and different composition of the fourth section of the audiencia nacional tried the applicant on the charge of encouragement of terrorism. on 22 july 2011 the audiencia nacional acquitted the applicant. the applicants were accused of being members of this terrorist organisation. the facts have been referred to as the “bateragune case”. these proceedings were allocated to the fourth section of the audiencia nacional, whose composition consisted of the same judges that had taken part in the first set of criminal proceedings followed against the first applicant, which ended with the judgment of 2 march 2010, finally declared void by the supreme court on 2 february 2011. this time the presiding judge was not the judge rapporteur. according to the first applicant, the bias previously shown by the presiding judge created an objective situation which contaminated the impartiality of the judges. this also created a subjective situation of mistrust on the section’s composition. according to the audiencia nacional, these new proceedings had a different object, i.e. his belonging to a terrorist organisation and the existence of strong and permanent links with eta, which had nothing to do with his previous charge of encouragement of terrorism. on 16 september 2011 the audiencia nacional delivered its judgment and sentenced the first and third applicants to ten years’ imprisonment for being a member and leader of a terrorist organisation. the second, fourth and fifth applicants were sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment for belonging to a terrorist organisation. all applicants were further disqualified from taking part in elections for the same length of time as their respective prison sentences. all the applicants brought a cassation appeal before the supreme court. the disqualification from taking part in elections was confirmed. according to the supreme court, there was no evidence apart from what happened in previous proceedings that supported the alleged partiality of the judges. two of the supreme court’s judges issued two separate dissenting opinions. according to the first dissenting opinion (which was endorsed, in substance, by the second dissenting judge), the applicants’ right to an impartial tribunal had indeed been violated, because the preconceived idea showed by the presiding judge in previous criminal proceedings against the first applicant also affected her judgment during subsequent proceedings. this lack of impartiality also had affected the other two judges of the panel. consequently, a new trial before a different panel of judges should have been ordered. on 27 june 2012 the first, second, fourth and fifth applicants lodged an amparo appeal with the constitutional court against these judgments, arguing, inter alia, that the panel composition of the fourth section of the audiencia nacional fell short of the requirements of an impartial tribunal. on 22 september 2014 the constitutional court ruled against the third applicant in a 4 to 2 decision.
the applicants are ukrainian nationals of roma ethnicity. they currently live in berezivka district, odessa region. it appears that this occurred in the course of an altercation between romany men and other youngsters from the village at a local bar or dancehall. according to the statement of the village mayor, mr m.s., a council member, d., stated that whatever the wording of the decision it would have no legal consequences and that legal action against drug dealers would also be ineffective. in fact, it was not possible to keep the situation under control. electricity and gas supplies to their houses were cut. subsequently, in the course of the night of 9-10 september 2002 a crowd of several hundred people, allegedly led by a certain mr o.m., a number of police officers were present but did not intervene to prevent the looting and apparently concentrated solely on preventing human casualties. the house where the first applicant lived had burned down. according to the government, the results of the expert analysis of the causes of the fire were inconclusive (see paragraph 118 below). in her statement (addressed to ms duducehava) and dated 13 june 2004 this applicant complained of having been expelled from her home but did not mention that she had personally witnessed any attack. however, they had not attempted to prevent or stop it, apparently concentrating solely on preventing casualties. the events were reported in a number of regional and national newspapers. on 10 september 2002 the ivanivka district police initiated criminal proceedings against persons unknown on suspicion of disorderly conduct committed in a group (хуліганство вчинене групою осіб). those neighbours stated that on the night of the attack they had seen around 150 and 300 people near the applicants’ houses. from 23 september 2002 to 27 january 2003 at least sixty village residents, including o.м. they had asked the officers not to interfere in their actions. they had entered the houses and asked the individuals there not to resist and to leave. on 4 february 2003 the police suspended the investigation for failure to identify the perpetrators. on 20 february 2003 the ivanivsky district prosecutor’s office (“the dpo”) refused to institute criminal proceedings against the village council’s officials for lack of constituent elements of a crime in their actions. on 1 april 2003 the regional police investigator suspended it again. on 31 december 2005 the head of the regional police informed mr stoyanov that the investigation had been suspended on 1 april 2003 and that the regional prosecutor’s office had examined the case and left the decision to suspend it in force. on 25 january 2006 the dpo informed mr stoyanov of the decision not to institute criminal proceedings against the village officials (see paragraph 34 above) and stated that mr stoyanov could obtain information about the situation in the hooliganism case from the regional police, who were in charge of it. on 27 january 2006 the ivanivka district police took over the investigation in respect of the hooliganism case and decided to resume it. on 25 september 2008 the dpo informed mr stoyanov that the investigation had been lawfully suspended and that the aggrieved parties could only examine the case file once the investigation had been completed. no reason for the alleged renewal was mentioned. the government argued that the letter was not genuine (see paragraphs 88 to 91 below). on 5 june 2008 the district court initiated proceedings concerning the claim brought by the first three and the fifth to nineteenth applicants under the code of criminal procedure in which they challenged the decision to suspend the investigation. on 19 august 2008 and 8 april 2009 mr stoyanov lodged additional complaints on behalf of the first to third, sixth to fifteenth and seventeenth to nineteenth applicants in these proceedings.
the applicant company, narodni list d.d., is a joint stock company incorporated under croatian law which has its registered office in zadar. it was the publisher of a weekly magazine, narodni list. on the morning of 23 november 2006 ms z.s.-k., who was at the time a judge of the zadar municipal court, reported to the police mr a.m., a photojournalist at narodni list, claiming that on that same morning he had secretly been taking photos of her in front of the municipal court building. he was immediately brought in for questioning by the police, after which he was released. he defended himself by saying that he had been photographing the court building and the court employees under the instructions of his editor-in-chief. lodged a criminal complaint against the journalist in question, stating that he had committed the criminal offence of making an unauthorised recording, as defined in article 131 of the criminal code. the day after, on 24 november 2006, the police again questioned a.m., after which they lodged a criminal complaint against him with the zadar municipal state attorney’s office (općinsko državno odvjetništvo u zadru). on the same day, 24 november 2006, a web portal, index, reported on the search of narodni list’s premises. the short article implicitly criticised the search by noting that judge z.s.-k. the next day index published a commentary defending freedom of the press and criticising the conduct of the police and judicial authorities in the matter. the article was accompanied by two photographs of the building in which another municipal and county court were located. the judge thereby again caught the attention of the journalists of narodni list. came to congratulate s. on starting a daily newspaper. on the basis of that authorisation a herd of policemen raided [the premises of] narodni list looking for photos of his colleague, judge s.-k. that [set] a precedent unknown in western democracies. asked the newspaper to publish an apology but it refused to do so. he argued that the article constituted an open invitation to lynch him and that it had harmed his reputation in that it called into question his moral and professional integrity by insinuating that he had broken the law while exercising his duties as a judge. throughout the proceedings the applicant company was represented by mr v.š. ( ...
... this court finds that the defendant [company], as the publisher, ... by publishing the impugned text entitled ‘judge b. should be put in the pillory’ and the [accompanying] photo of the plaintiff, exceeded the bounds of the freedom to publish information, to the prejudice of the plaintiff. [ by publishing that information the defendant company], without [presenting] valid arguments, and contrary to journalistic ethics, harmed the plaintiff’s reputation, honour and dignity as an individual and as a judge of the zadar county court. [ for these reasons the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for non-pecuniary damage sustained by the breach of his rights of personality [prava osobnosti] within the meaning of section 22(1) of the media act and section 1100(1) and (2) of the obligations act – that is to say to just financial compensation in the amount claimed by the action. by a judgment of 3 december 2010 the split county court (županijski sud u splitu) dismissed an appeal by the applicant company and upheld the first-instance judgment, which thereby became final. however, there is no justification for it. beginning with its headline (‘judge b. should be put in the pillory’) the impugned article does not use acceptable and normal ways of expression. in that sense the following statements are worth noting: ‘b’s arrival would have gone unnoticed had this judge not become ‘famous’ [even] outside croatia’s borders by illegally signing the warrant to search [the premises of] narodni list’ and ‘what b. is doing in journalistic circles is known only to the crew around s. in the western world journalists put such judges in the pillory’. [ it also relied on article 10 of the convention. it held that freedom of expression was not absolute and could be restricted for the protection of the dignity, reputation and honour of others, which rights were also guaranteed by the constitution. in particular, the constitutional court held that the ordinary courts had correctly applied the relevant substantive law and given sufficient reasons for their judgments.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in palaio faliro. she has worked as a kindergarten teacher for the greek ministry of education since 1983. on 23 august 2005, following her participation in a selection procedure, she was appointed educational coordinator of the hellenic republic at the general consulate of greece in chicago for a period of two years. on 14 august 2007 the ministers of education and foreign affairs issued a decision informing all educational coordinators abroad of the end of their term of service. on the same date, the minister of education issued a decision informing the educational coordinators that they were to remain in their posts until the completion of the next selection procedure. the applicant’s name was omitted from the second ministerial decision and the post of educational coordinator in chicago remained vacant. she applied to have the decision annulled, which the athens administrative court of appeal agreed to do as the applicant had been omitted from the decision without any specific reasoning (decision no. the applicant was therefore allowed to occupy the position until the successful completion of the next selection procedure. in the meantime, a call for applications for educational coordinators for the next two-year period was published on 27 november 2007. on 23 july 2008 the coordinators selection committee published a ranking of candidates in which the applicant, having received 48.00 points, was placed 13th among those who had chosen french as their foreign language. on 22 august 2008 the official gazette (εφημερίδα της κυβερνήσεως) published a decision by the ministers of foreign affairs and education to appoint the candidates who had been selected. that decision was revoked and replaced with a ministerial decision dated 29 august 2008 including the same content. on 24 september 2008 the applicant lodged an application for annulment of the ministerial decisions of 22 and 29 august 2008 on appointing the selected educational coordinators with the athens administrative court of appeal in so far as she had been omitted. the applicant complained that the ranking had not been published in the official gazette, as required by law, and that she had been erroneously awarded fewer points than she should have had. the hearing was scheduled to take place on 13 november 2009, but was adjourned to 5 march 2010. on 3 february 2010 the applicant submitted additional grounds of annulment. nevertheless, the hearing was again adjourned owing to the ministry’s failure to provide submissions. adjournments took place on 4 june, 17 september and on 8 october 2010. on 26 october 2010, the ministry sent its observations to the court, and a hearing took place on 10 december 2010, when the two-year term for educational coordinators and the contested ministerial decision had already expired. on 13 december 2010 the applicant submitted a memorandum requesting that the examination of her application for annulment be continued despite the expiry of the administrative act, arguing that she had special locus standi to continue to pursue the annulment process. in particular, she argued that if the contested act was annulled she would be credited with two more years of experience, which would improve her chances of being selected as a deputy coordinator of education in a future selection procedure. on 16 march 2011 the athens administrative court of appeal published decision no. 508/2011 rejecting the applicant’s arguments. as regards her first reason for continuing the proceedings, it held that she had already been awarded the maximum number of points allowed by law for experience abroad. as regards her chances of being selected as a deputy coordinator of education in a future selection procedure, the domestic court held that that was not a lawful reason to continue the procedure in court, because it concerned an uncertain, future administrative procedure. based on the above and on domestic law, the athens administrative court of appeal held that there was no need to adjudicate, on the grounds that the contested act was no longer in force (decision). as regards the applicant’s arguments that the eventual rejection of her application would violate article 20 of the constitution and article 6 § 1 of the convention, the domestic court held that the provision of article 32 § 2 of presidential decree no. 18/1989 served the legal aim of avoiding any unnecessary trials. the individual who had lodged the application was no longer in need of judicial protection as the contested act no longer had any unfavourable consequences. having also regard to the possibility provided for by law to continue the trial if the individual could prove that he or she still suffered from unfavourable consequences that could be removed only by the annulment of the contested act, the right to judicial protection remained intact.
the applicant was born in 1973 and lives in the village of akhaldaba. on two occasions, one two years earlier and the second earlier that year, the three accused attempted to rob and threaten his family, but he chose not to notify the police. one of the accused was holding a gun, while his brother and the applicant were shouting at him to fire another shot, which he did. first ran up to his son, whose body was shaking, and then ran home to bring his car back to help him. it appears that he later told the police that he had witnessed the crime. according to them, however, the victim passed by their plot at around 9 a.m. and they heard shots after about fifteen to twenty minutes. they rushed to the crime scene and found the victim dead. to the crime scene, without mentioning that he had witnessed the murder, or that he knew anything about it. he was not with the brothers at the time. a forensic biological examination report (no. 1700/10) ordered by a prosecutor and implemented by the forensic and special research centre of the ministry of justice between 7 september and 6 october 2004 provided an analysis of soil found on the brothers’ shoes in relation to soil at and around the crime scene. the brothers were convicted of aggravated murder and illegal possession of firearms, and were sentenced to seventeen and sixteen years’ imprisonment, respectively. it continued to note that at around 10 a.m., the applicant and the brothers had gone to the victim’s farm and killed him with a gun. the applicant’s argument that he had an alibi for the presumed time of the crime in the light of the statements given by some of the defence witnesses (see paragraph 10 above) was dismissed by the court. it noted that the statements in question were inconsistent, contradictory and aimed at shielding the accused from criminal responsibility. on 13 june 2006 only the applicant appealed against the judgment of 8 may 2006. he emphasised that unlike his co-accused, no piece of forensic evidence available in the criminal case file implicated him personally in the crime. on 21 september 2006 the supreme court, sitting as a court of second and final instance, held a hearing and upheld the lower court’s verdict. on an unspecified date in may 2016 the applicant was released from prison. the toilet in the cell was not separated from the living area. he also alleged that there were rodents in his cell. according to him, the conditions there were identical. on 16 december 2006 the applicant was transferred to rustavi prison no. it does not appear that the applicant lodged any complaints in that respect. the applicant’s submissions dated 29 january 2009 revealed that he had been seen by a neurologist on an unspecified date in october 2008. no complaints regarding headaches appear to have been raised following that date. as regards the other health-related complaints, on 28 october 2008 the applicant was examined and diagnosed with a chronic inflammation of the gallbladder. the interim measure was lifted on 8 february 2012. on 16 january 2009, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. on the same day, he was put on a dots (directly observed treatment, short course) programme, the strategy for the detection and treatment of tuberculosis recommended by the world health organisation.
he is currently serving a life sentence in marche-en-famenne prison (belgium). the applicant was assisted before the investigation division by a lawyer, ms a., of the douai bar. as shown by the police interview record, in accordance with article 47bis of the code of criminal procedure (code d’instruction criminelle) (see paragraphs 62-65 below), the applicant was notified that he was entitled to request the verbatim transcription of all the questions put to him and his answers, to request any investigative act or the conducting of any interview, and that his statements could be used in evidence. during the interview the applicant was also questioned about a statement made to the police by m.b. but denied that his intention had been to kill her as she had alleged. following her death, from a mobile phone belonging to him. those messages included one offering condolences for the death of m.b. the applicant denied having sent them himself. all subsequent records of his statements contained the same indications and were signed by the applicant. he confirmed his statements to the investigating judge. an arrest warrant was issued to the applicant on the same day and he was remanded in custody. it is not in dispute that the applicant was not allowed to communicate with a lawyer between the time of his surrender to the belgian authorities and the end of his period in police custody on 31 december 2007. he was only allowed to consult with a lawyer, in accordance with the applicable law, once the decision had been taken by the investigating judge to remand him in custody (see paragraphs 21 above and 55-56 below). in parallel to the investigation into the murder of m.b., when examined again by the investigating judge on 17 march 2008, the judge asked the applicant if he had chosen a lawyer. he replied in the affirmative and mentioned that he had been in contact with a lawyer at the brussels bar. ’s murder, the applicant confessed to having stolen a document from the case file, although the authorities had been unaware of this. on 25 march 2008 the criminal investigation police interviewed the applicant for the purposes of a morality and personality assessment. the two eyewitnesses took part in the reconstruction (see paragraphs 10 and 24 above). an arrest warrant was issued on 8 august 2008 extending the investigating judge’s remit, on the basis of the submissions of the crown prosecutor dated 23 may 2008 and 7 july 2008, to three additional offences: the attempted murder of m.b. namely robbery with violence or threats, and fraud. the applicant was examined on that subject by the investigating judge on 18 august 2008. he also expressed his wish that his lawyer should confirm his position. at the start of the trial in the assize court, on 1 february 2010, the applicant, assisted by his belgian counsel, filed a submission in which he requested that the records of the interviews conducted without legal assistance and the ensuing acts should be annulled and that the prosecution case should be declared inadmissible. 36391/02, echr 2008) and dayanan v. turkey (no. it explained that, in principle, defence rights would be irretrievably affected only where incriminating statements were made. furthermore, the assize court noted that the applicant had been committed to stand trial before it in the light of indications of guilt which stemmed primarily from material other than his own statements (see paragraph 36 above) and that he had availed himself of the right to request the performance of additional investigative acts. it also reproduced the various versions of the events that he had given during his police interviews and examinations by the investigating judge, explaining that those accounts were inconsistent with the investigators’ factual findings and were contradicted by the various witness statements. the jury also took the view that the acts committed by the defendant before going off towards the canal at the end of a long walk (simulation of a flat tyre, deliberate car crash, etc.) this does not appear to have been the case.
the applicants were born in 1977 and 1964, respectively, and live in voronezh. the applicants are lawyers practicing in russia. between 2008 and 2010 the applicants, within the group of lawyers, consulted several municipal organisations about various legal issues and provided other legal service. however municipal organisations did not pay for the service and the applicants instituted proceedings seeking to recover the debt. on 22 june 2010 the sovetskiy district court of voronezh granted the applicants claim against the municipal transport company and awarded them 40,020,000 russian roubles. the judgment was not appealed against and became final. it appears that the judgment was executed at the expense of the municipal budget. on 9 january 2013 the prosecutor of the voronezh region applied to the district court for the extension of the time-limits for an ordinary appeal against the judgment of 22 june 2010. on 13 june 2013 the district court refused to extend the time-limits. on 8 august 2013 the voronezh regional court quashed the decision of the district court and extended the time limit for an ordinary appeal. the court found that the public interest had been concerned as far as the judgment had been executed by means of the municipal budget. thus the prosecutor had the right to lodge an appeal. on 12 november 2013 the voronezh regional court granted the appeal lodged by the prosecutor and quashed the judgment of 22 june 2010 and ordered the reversal of execution. the judgment became final and was partially executed.
the applicant was born in 1967 and lives in muğla. on an unspecified date the applicant brought an enforcement order through a bailiff’s office against her former husband, g.f., to collect alimony in arrears and accrued interest. objected to that order by bringing a case against the applicant before the datça enforcement court. he requested that the court declare the enforcement order null and void on the grounds that he had made the payments in question in full. ’s representative requested the court to take out an expert report to determine whether the payments he had made corresponded to the alleged debt. the court adjourned its examination on the question whether an expert report would be sought to a hearing to be held on 10 may 2006. in that hearing, the applicant’s representative left it to the court’s discretion for an expert to be appointed concerning the determination of the amounts that were already paid. the court therefore ruled for an expert to be appointed and scheduled another hearing for 7 june 2006. in the meantime, but before the hearing of 7 june 2006, the applicant’s representative requested that he be excused from that hearing since he had another scheduled court hearing elsewhere. the court held the hearing as scheduled but noted that the applicant’s representative was excused. in that hearing, the court noted that the expert report had been submitted in the case-file and read its contents out in the presence of g.f. the latter asked the court to rule in accordance with the findings in the expert report, which had concluded that all the relevant alimony payments had been made. the court scheduled a hearing for 21 june 2006 holding that the absent party be notified. on 21 june 2006, in its final hearing, the court ruled against the applicant on the basis of the expert report in question. neither the applicant nor her representative was present at that hearing. there is no indication in the transcript of the hearing that suggests that the court examined whether the applicant’s representative had been notified in due time. on 31 july 2006 the applicant’s representative lodged an appeal before the court of cassation, arguing that the notice for the court hearing of 21 june 2006 had been served on him only on 26 june 2006, resulting in him and her client missing the opportunity to participate in the hearing and submit their observations on the findings of the expert report. he explained in that connection that the expert’s calculations had been erroneous and did not correspond to the bank transfer receipts in the case-file. on 5 december 2006 the court of cassation upheld the decision of 21 june 2006 without responding to the applicant’s arguments. the applicant’s rectification request against that decision was rejected on 13 march 2007.
the applicant was born in 1977 and is a life-sentenced prisoner. he has been detained in x prison since 2008. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. following a referral by the prison medical unit for the applicant to undergo a colonoscopy, the prison director issued an order on 9 november 2010 assigning a three-member escort team equipped with firearms, ammunition and bulletproof vests to take the applicant to y hospital. the escort plan also included a personal risk assessment. it was noted that the applicant reacted aggressively to lawful orders of the officials when he thought that they were being unreasonable and also in situations where he felt cornered. he did not respect the prison regime and was prone to self-harm. moreover, he was considered to become more dangerous in situations where he interpreted information in a manner expecting a favourable outcome for himself which nevertheless did not follow. the risk of his absconding was considered to be higher when outside prison. on the same day the applicant was transferred from the prison to a public hospital. according to the applicant, he was not allowed to wear his own clothes during the visit. they submitted an explanation given on 11 august 2016 by a doctor at y hospital, who noted that he did not remember the particular visit, but asserted that although members of the escort team would normally stay in the examination room, a screen would be placed between them and the patient. they stated that although it appeared from the note in the applicant’s escort plan that he had refused to see a doctor at the hospital because of his handcuffs and ankle cuffs, his medical file nonetheless revealed that a short meeting between the applicant and the doctor might have taken place. on 30 january 2012 the deputy director of the prison granted the applicant’s request to visit his newborn daughter (who had undergone surgery and was in a serious condition) in hospital. the applicant had submitted a request to be allowed to wear his own clothes during the visit. furthermore, he had wanted to touch his child and the doctors had given their permission, but the prison officers had stopped him from doing so. the prison officers had remained with him at all times and could overhear the conversation between the applicant and the doctor regarding his daughter’s health. according to the escort plan, the applicant had arrived at the hospital at 10.50 a.m. and the visit had ended at 11.15 a.m. 19. the government submitted an explanation drafted on 2 april 2012 by the head of the escort team on duty on the day of the visit. staff had to be careful that the information was not heard by anyone other than the person concerned. following the dismissal of his claims by x prison, the applicant lodged a claim with the tartu administrative court on 5 february 2012, alleging that the conditions and circumstances of the above-described visits had been unlawful. the court joined the two sets of proceedings. it held that the use of handcuffs and ankle cuffs had been permitted by law, based on preventive security considerations and, as such, had been proportionate. the court did not address these complaints in its reasoning part of the judgment. by a judgment of 26 august 2014, the tartu court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s complaint in full, but amended some of the reasoning provided by the first-instance court. the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s complaint about the prison officers’ presence during his hospital visits, as the prison officers had had a duty under the regulation of the minister of justice “prisoner escort duties and procedures” (see paragraph 36 below) to escort and guard him. the regulation also required that at least one member of the escort team maintain visual contact with the prisoner at all times. even if they had overheard a conversation between the applicant and the doctor, they had had an official duty to maintain the confidentiality of that information. the court did not address this complaint in its reasoning part of the judgment. he reiterated his complaints about the handcuffs and ankle cuffs and the presence of the prison officers during the visits.
the applicant was born in 1973 and is detained in sivas. according to a report drawn up by the police officers and signed by the applicant, on 19 november 2002 at 1.30 p.m., the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the hizbullah following an hour long armed conflict with the police officers during which he had resisted, had thrown a grenade and had fired back at the police officers. on the same day at 1.50 p.m. the applicant was examined at the silvan state hospital, in diyarbakır, by a doctor who observed the following on the applicant’s body: 2 cm-long scrape on his lower left chest, handcuff marks on his wrists, a traumatic scrape on the front side of his right leg. the doctor observed no unfitness for work. also on the same day at 5.45 p.m. the applicant was examined at the diyarbakır state hospital by another doctor who made similar findings as those mentioned in the first medical report. on 22 november 2002 the applicant was interviewed by police in the absence of a lawyer in the course of which he had allegedly sustained both physical and psychological ill-treatment. according to the applicant’s submissions, he was allegedly forced to sign some documents, as well as a declaration to waive his right to legal assistance. he further maintained that when he had wished to read the documents that he had been made to sign he had been threatened with further ill-treatment. on 23 november 2002 at the end of his police custody, the applicant was examined at the diyarbakır state hospital by a doctor who noted that there were no new signs of ill-treatment on the applicant’s body. according to the applicant, during the examination the police officers intervened and ordered the doctor to write that the applicant had some grazes on his wrists and ankles. on 23 november 2002 the applicant gave a statement to the public prosecutor in the absence of a lawyer in which he accepted the accusations against him. on the same day the applicant was brought before the investigating judge at the diyarbakır state security court, who took his statements in the absence of a lawyer in which he had accepted most of the statements he had given to the police. according to his submissions before the court, the applicant claimed that he had admitted being a member of the hizbullah before the public prosecutor and the judge on account of the duress and the intimidation exerted on him by the police. he further claimed that the police officers had threatened him with excessive length of proceedings and had told him that if he had accepted the charges they would help him and release him from detention. on 27 november 2002 the diyarbakır public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment, charging the applicant under article 146 of the former turkish criminal code with attempting to undermine the constitutional order of the state. on 19 march 2003 the diyarbakır state security court held the first hearing on the merits of the case. during the hearing, the applicant gave evidence without a lawyer in which he denied his previous statements and the accusations. he further stated, without providing any details, that he had been subjected to pressure while in police custody and that he had pressurised to sign his police statements without reading them. when asked about his statements before the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, the applicant stated that he had given self-incriminating statements as a result of the pressure from the police officers. at a hearing held on 18 september 2003 the applicant submitted, without providing any details, that he had been tortured during the preliminary investigation. 5190 of 16 june 2004, published in the official gazette on 30 june 2004, state security courts were abolished. therefore, the diyarbakır assize court acquired jurisdiction over the case. on 22 june 2007 the diyarbakır assize court found that, inter alia, on the basis of the applicant’s statements to the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge that the applicant had committed the offence under article 146 of the former criminal code and sentenced him to life imprisonment. relying on the medical report dated 23 november 2002, it also rejected the applicant’s contention that he had been tortured while in police custody. on 10 april 2008 the court of cassation upheld the trial court’s judgment.
the applicant was born in 1983 and lives in tianchang, the people’s republic of china. and m.), who were picnicking nearby, approached them to get some beer. m., who appeared less drunk than his friends, was friendlier and the applicant gave him a bottle of beer. all four drank the beer and returned for more. the last thing recorded was one of the chinese students, subsequently identified as w., taking two metal skewers out of a plastic bag. at some point a fight started between the two groups. none of the ukrainians expressed any suspicions about the applicant and he eventually left with his friends. on 2 may 2009 m. was questioned in hospital. he submitted that he had been stabbed unexpectedly in the back and that he had not seen who had done it. m. considered that, most probably, it had been the applicant who had injured him. during an identification parade conducted that day sa. pointed at the applicant as the one who had injured m. 16. only four of them, packed in a plastic bag, were discovered. on an unspecified date the investigation was declared completed and the kharkiv kyivskyy district court (“the kyivskyy court”) started the trial. considered the applicant guilty of injuring m., it was established in the court hearing that none of them had seen how that had actually happened. who had wounded m. and they had handed him over to the police. after being provided with an interpreter, he had maintained his innocence. the investigation had failed to make any assessment of that point. however, the court did not consider it credible and expressed the opinion that they had been trying to help the applicant. the prosecutor also lodged an appeal, considering the sentence to be too lenient. on which the first‑instance court had based the applicant’s conviction, had been contradictory, inconsistent and speculative. the appellate court also considered the accusation against the applicant to be too vague as it had never been established where exactly m. and the applicant were situated prior to the incident. following an additional round of pre-trial investigation measures, the case was sent to the kyivskyy court. the case was therefore remitted once again for further pre-trial investigation. on 24 july 2013 the kyivskyy court found the applicant guilty of murder and sentenced him to twelve years’ imprisonment. and d.] are consistent and corroborated by other evidence in these criminal proceedings.” he observed in particular that m. had been clear in his statement that the stabbing in his back had been a complete surprise for him and that he had never submitted that somebody had been “hanging on [his] back” as alleged by the witnesses. accordingly, he considered that the trial court should have been guided by provisions of the ccp 1960 when deciding on the admissibility of the evidence including the witness statements given by the chinese students. on 27 november 2013 the court of appeal upheld the findings and the reasoning of the kyivskyy court’s judgment. the higher specialised court was silent on the applicant’s argument on the admissibility of the defence evidence in the light of the ccp 1960.
the first applicant was born in 1949 and lives in strasbourg, france. the second applicant was born in 1984 and lives in grozny, chechnya, russia. their property was damaged in the course of a counterterrorist operation in 1999-2000. instead, they sought to obtain no-fault compensation provided for by government decree no. however, for administrative reasons their claims were not processed until september 2013. their individual situations can be summarised as follows. the first applicant’s flat was damaged during the hostilities in 1994‑1995, and then destroyed in 1999-2000. she received an acknowledgment of receipt of documents (no. 25 in the destroyed apartment block at 21 tereshkova street. in june 2010 the applicant was informed that her application had not been examined by the commission since the building in question had not been entered in the register of destroyed buildings. the register was to be updated by the technical unit of the federal authority on construction and municipal services (техническая группа федерального агентства по строительству и жкх по формированию перечня разрушенного жилья на территории чеченской республики, hereafter “the technical unit”). the first applicant complained to a district court about the commission’s failure to act. the first applicant’s subsequent attempts to obtain supervisory review were unsuccessful. in 2011 she was informed by the commission’s secretariat that the technical unit had not been operational since 2005 and that the commission did not know whether or when it would restart its work. 12 in an apartment block at 53 kavkazskaya street, grozny. the building was destroyed during the hostilities in 1999-2000. in november 2004 the second applicant applied to the commission and his file was assigned number 02/13975. in 2008 the applicant was registered as a person eligible for social housing because his flat had been destroyed during the hostilities. he was assigned number 1599 in the waiting list; in 2016 his number was 1579. the second applicant complained to a court. on 5 july 2010 the staropromyslovskiy district court of grozny rejected his complaint since the commission was unable to proceed in the absence of the technical unit’s register. on 10 august 2010 the supreme court of chechnya upheld the decision on appeal. the second applicant sought to obtain damages from the government of chechnya for the damaged property and for failure to compensate the damage by alternative means. 61), had rejected all claims lodged by the owners of property which had not been entered in the register of destroyed buildings. in respect of the first applicant, the letter stated that her house had been inspected by the technical unit, which had confirmed its destruction (without specifying the date or any reference to the inspection record); however, for unknown reasons the building had not been entered in the register. no additional documents were submitted by the government, and it is unclear whether the applicants were informed of the commission’s decision. in february 2008 the local district administration examined flat no. 12 at 53 kavkazskaya street, grozny, and concluded that it had been 100% destroyed. the applicant was issued with a certificate to that effect. on 24 may 2010 the local administration examined the building at 53 kavkazskaya street and found that it had been demolished.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in chișinău. at the time of the events the applicant was the owner of a company, incorporated in moldova, which ran an erotic video-chat business in chișinău. it employed young female models who provided erotic shows via webcam to customers outside moldova in exchange for payment. on 3 march 2015 the applicant was arrested and accused of pimping (proxenetism). on 7 march 2015, at the request of a public prosecutor, the centru district court ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody for a period of thirty days. the applicant appealed against the order and argued that his detention had not been based on a reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence. he submitted that he could not be accused of pimping, in that the female models employed by him had not been engaged in prostitution. he argued that the prosecutor and the court which had ordered his detention had applied an extensive interpretation of the provisions of the criminal code concerning the offence of pimping. he also argued that the existing case-law of the domestic courts did not contain anything which would enable erotic video-chat activity to be assimilated with prostitution and pimping. the applicant also contended that there were no relevant and sufficient reasons for remanding him in custody. on 16 march 2015 the chișinău court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and held that there had been grounds to believe that he might abscond or interfere with the investigation. the court did not respond to the applicant’s argument about a lack of reasonable suspicion and the allegation of extensive interpretation of the criminal law. on 31 march 2015 the centru district court upheld a request by the public prosecutor and prolonged the applicant’s detention for another thirty days. the applicant appealed on the same grounds as on the first occasion. however, his appeal was dismissed by the court of appeal on 7 april 2015. on an unspecified date the applicant lodged a habeas corpus request, which was upheld by the centru district court on 27 april 2015; the applicant was released from detention. during the proceedings the applicant explained that, prior to starting the video-chat business, he had consulted a lawyer to make sure that the activity was legal in moldova, and he had been assured that it was not illegal. he also submitted that he had seen numerous similar businesses in chișinău, which had strengthened his belief that the activity was not unlawful. on 30 december 2016 the centru district court found the applicant guilty as charged but ordered that the criminal proceedings against him be terminated on the basis of an amnesty law. one of the conditions for applying the amnesty law was for the applicant to admit his guilt and express remorse. the applicant did not appeal against this decision. in deciding the case, the court sought an opinion from the state agency for the protection of morality as to whether the acts committed by the female models employed by the applicant could be qualified as prostitution and, thus, whether the applicant’s activity could be qualified as pimping. the opinion of 21 october 2015, which was the key element in convicting the applicant and was subsequently used in other similar cases, stated that the actions of the female models employed by the applicant could be considered acts of prostitution, in that their clients could obtain sexual gratification as a result of the models’ performance and because the models were paid for those acts. thus, the fact that the applicant obtained revenue from the above activity could be considered pimping.
the applicant was born in 1977 and is a life-sentenced prisoner. he has been detained in x prison since 2008. during the relevant period he was detained in the increased surveillance wing of the prison. in january 2012 the applicant had been relocated from one section of the increased surveillance wing to another. the attacked prisoner was taken to hospital following the incident. according to the applicant’s explanation to the prison he had considered it necessary to punish his fellow inmate, as he had allegedly behaved arrogantly towards him. on 13 february 2012 the prison administration decided to impose additional security measures (täiendavad julgeolekumeetmed) on the applicant. it took into account the stabbing incident of 11 february 2012, the applicant’s history of aggressive behaviour and emotional characteristics (see paragraphs 12–13 below), and the need to ensure the health and safety of all those employed and detained in the prison. the decision stated that the measures were to be applied until the grounds for them ceased to exist, but for no longer than six months. the decisions indicated that they had to be served on the applicant. the decisions also referred to a personal risk assessment dated 20 september 2011, which stated that the applicant had a low tolerance to stress and low self-criticism, which was supported by the fact that expressing anger had previously helped him get his way. it was considered that he might pose a danger to the prison officers, particularly at the moment when the door was being opened, regardless of whether or not he was to be escorted outside of his cell. the measures were subject to review within no more than six months after being served on the applicant. on 30 september 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint with the tartu administrative court, seeking to have the decisions of 10 august 2012 annulled. the court noted that the prison had discretion in deciding whether to apply additional security measures and thus the judicial review of such decisions was limited. the unpredictable, aggressive and violent behaviour of the applicant had given grounds for a reasonable fear that he might pose such a danger. the court of appeal also took a decision regarding the judgment of the administrative court of 4 october 2013 in the third set of court proceedings (see paragraph 30 below). on 5 june 2014 it refused to examine the appeal. on 15 february 2013 the prison administration prolonged the application of additional security measures after giving the applicant the opportunity to express his opinion about the planned prolongation. on 28 february 2014 it adopted a judgment reversing the judgment of the tartu administrative court of 4 october 2013 in part. the court found that the aforementioned information gave x prison sufficient grounds to believe that, upon the lifting of the additional security measures, the applicant would pose a danger to other prisoners and the prison officers. the government provided photographs of the relevant cells and a list of the personal items the applicant had in his cells. according to the list, the applicant had had a television set in his cell since 26 july 2012. the applicant was authorised to wear his own clothes. on some occasions the visits were cancelled, as the visitors did not attend. the applicant had the right to make telephone calls and send letters. the applicant was under constant medical supervision. during the period from november 2006 to august 2016, he turned to the prison medical services with different health issues a total of 1102 times. in a certificate (tõend) dated 16 august 2013 a psychiatrist asked for the applicant to be relocated to a cell without a forest view. in an opinion dated 23 august 2013 a clinical psychologist discouraged his placement in such cells as they might increase his feeling of loneliness and isolation, particularly at night.
the applicant was born in 1953 and lives in zagreb. on 21 july 2000 the police temporarily seized the applicant’s vehicle, which had canadian number plates, suspecting that it had been stolen by an unknown perpetrator. on 24 july and 1 september 2000 police experts examined the car and established that its vehicle identification number (vin) was genuine. in the meantime, on 21 july 2000 the police asked the canadian interpol office to check whether the applicant’s car and two other vehicles were being sought by the police in canada, under whose name they had been registered, whether they had been registered for export, and whether the car documents were genuine. on 29 december 2000 the police asked the zagreb state attorney’s office (općinsko državno odvjetništvo u zagrebu) to decide on the status of the vehicle. on 23 march 2001 the zagreb state attorney’s office instructed the police to ask for the relevant information from the canadian interpol office. on 18 march 2002 the police asked the canadian interpol office to expedite the handling of their request for information. according to the available data, the canadian interpol office did not respond to the request of the police. by a decision of 2 may 2002 the zagreb state attorney’s office ordered that the car be returned to the applicant, whereupon, on 7 may 2002, the police did so. on 22 july 2003 the applicant brought a civil action for compensation against the state in the zagreb municipal court (općinski sud u zagrebu). he argued that the car had been returned to him in a state of disrepair because it had not been stored properly and, in any event, it had fallen in value during the two years it had been kept by the police, which had been an unreasonably long period. he sought 55,275.95 croatian kunas (hrk; approximately 7,126 euros (eur) at the relevant time) in compensation. the opinion of an expert obtained by the court during the proceedings suggested that the cost of repairing the applicant’s car amounted to hrk 35,275.95 and that its value had dropped by hrk 22,000. by a judgment of 16 december 2008 the municipal court dismissed the applicant’s civil action. its decision was upheld on 30 june 2009 by the zagreb county court (županijski sud u zagrebu). the courts held that the temporary seizure of the applicant’s car had been lawful as it had been based on articles 177, 184 and 218 of the code of criminal procedure, and that therefore the state could not be held liable for damages. the applicant then concurrently lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law with the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske) and a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske). in his appeal on points of law the applicant asked the supreme court to pronounce itself on a legal question which he considered important for the uniform application of the law, namely, whether the owners of objects temporarily seized for the purposes of criminal proceedings were entitled to compensation for the inability to use those objects, in a situation where, eventually, no criminal or minor-offence proceedings had been instituted. in his constitutional complaint the applicant argued that the judgments of the first and second-instance courts had been in breach of his right of ownership, guaranteed by article 48 of the croatian constitution. by a decision of 21 february 2012 the supreme court declared the applicant’s appeal on points of law inadmissible, finding that the legal question he had raised was not important for the uniform application of the law. on 23 january 2014 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint and served its decision on his representative on 7 february 2014. the court examined the case primarily under article 29 § 1 of the croatian constitution, which guarantees the right to fair procedure, and held that the contested judgments had not been arbitrary. as regards the applicant’s argument that his right of ownership guaranteed by article 48 of the constitution had been violated, the constitutional court held as follows:
“the constitutional court protects the right of ownership at the constitutional level in a manner that prevents any restriction or taking of [property] by the state authorities, unless the restriction or taking is provided for by law ...
... interferences with ownership by other legal subjects (natural or legal persons) are property disputes of a private-law nature. the constitutional court also examines such decisions by judicial and other authorities if it finds that the contested decision, having regard to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the constitution, is based on an unacceptable legal view or is so wrong and lacking in sound legal reasoning that it can be described as arbitrary. the constitutional court did not find any such circumstances in the complainant’s case. therefore, the complainant’s right of ownership guaranteed by article 48 of the constitution was not breached by the contested judgments.”

the applicant was born in 1972 and lives in zheleznodorozhnyy, moscow region. the applicant was a locomotive driver with russian railways in the moscow region. he was a member of one of the railway workers’ trade unions, rosprofzhel (“the trade union”). on 7 april 2008 the trade union entered into negotiations with russian railways, seeking a general pay raise and the introduction of long‑service bonuses for the relevant staff. as the negotiations failed, the trade union decided to organise a strike. on 25 april 2008 the trade union committee decided that the staff of russian railways in two suburban moscow sectors should participate in the strike as from 4 a.m. on 28 april 2008. the trade union committee’s decision referred to minimum services which would be provided during the strike, although the parties have not made any submissions in this regard. russian railways did not apply to the courts for the strike to be declared unlawful. on 28 april 2008 the applicant took part in the strike. he came to work but refused to take up his duties. the strike caused delays in circulation of the trains in the sector where the applicant worked. on 9 july 2008 the applicant was dismissed for two breaches of disciplinary rules. the first breach ascribed to him had had no relation to his trade union activities. ( a year previously, on 8 june 2007, the applicant had been officially reprimanded for having stopped the train 50 metres after the platform). the second breach was the applicant’s refusal to take up his duties during the strike on 28 april 2008. the applicant complained to a court that he should not have been dismissed for having participated in the strike organised by his trade union. on 19 august 2008 the case was heard by the meschanskiy district court of moscow (“the district court”). the court confirmed the lawfulness of the applicant’s dismissal for a repeated failure to properly perform his professional duties. regarding the applicant’s participation in the strike, the court relied on the railway acts of 1995 and 2003 (articles 17 and 26 (2) respectively – see paragraphs 15 and 17 below). the acts prohibited strikes of railway workers responsible, inter alia, for the circulation of trains, shunting, and services to passengers. the court stressed that those limitations were aimed at securing safety on the railway and that railway workers were subjected to stricter disciplinary rules than workers in other sectors of industry. the applicant was a locomotive driver; therefore, his work was directly linked to the circulation of trains, shunting, and the provision of services to passengers. the district court concluded that the applicant had been precluded from participating in the strike. relying on a report dated 29 april 2008 issued by the moscow interregional transport prosecutor’s office, the district court furthermore noted that the strike had caused a number of cancelled and delayed trains which had resulted in “massive violations of the rights and lawful interests of citizens, leading to their belated arrival at their workplaces and educational institutions, at medical facilities providing health care, [and] for long-distance trains, bus runs and flights”. the strike had also “contributed to the mass gathering of people on railway platforms, which [had] directly threatened their safety”. given the above and the applicant’s earlier transgression, his dismissal had been justified. the district court did not discuss the question of whether advance notice of the strike had been given or other issues related to the lawfulness of the strike of 28 april 2008. on 29 january 2009, following an appeal by the applicant, the moscow city court confirmed the judgment of 19 august 2008.

the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in seville. on that date, the applicant, along with other occupiers, participated in a protest against their eviction from the building. they had placed some rudimentary reinforcing in order to prevent the collapse of the structure. indeed they had introduced one of their arms inside one of the tubes and enchained their wrist to an iron stick which was fixed inside the tube. since the fixation system was not visible it was impossible for the authorities to know whether this was true or not. negotiations were held throughout the whole day, yet they were unsuccessful. in order to verify whether the applicant and r.d.p. that the building might collapse if heavy machinery were used to release them. informed the police officers and fire fighters of his intention to voluntarily release himself and asked them to untie him. at around 8.30 p.m. the applicant also decided to end his protest. were immediately arrested and brought before a judge. they were also taken to a public health centre where they underwent a forensic examination. no haematomata, abrasions or injuries on different explored areas. interview and patient history rule out any decrease of his cognitive or volitional abilities, [patient thus] fit to give statement at this very moment.” the physical torture was undertaken only by national police officers and was insanely observed by the fire fighters. they took the rope out of the tunnel and three national police officers ... pulled me with the same purpose ... the second act of torture was already physical and was perpetrated by national police officers. it was conducted at the end of the protest action, that is to say, the physical torture forced us to [release ourselves] from the tubes ... [t]he blood supply was cut off at the top, we could not move our fingers since the pain was very intense, we were like this for an hour, that is when fire fighters took the photograph because they did nothing else to us. as a result of the statements, on 21 december 2007 the delegation of the government of andalusia lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor, requesting the initiation of a criminal investigation before the seville investigating judge no. on 6 july 2011 seville criminal judge no. the criminal judge stated that authorities had acted in a proportionate manner. the criminal judge considered that the first action carried out by the police (that is to say fixing a rope to their waist and wrist, respectively, and using force in an attempt to pull them out) had been a proportionate technique with the purpose of verifying whether the applicant and r.d.p. were in fact attached to the concrete floor. according to the criminal judge the fire fighters also intimidated the applicant and r.d.p. the purpose behind this was to make them release themselves voluntarily. they would then be linked to accusations of torture, which, according to the criminal judge, had not taken place. in reply to the argument that the word “torture” had been used colloquially, the judge considered the following:
“[t]he applicant’s repetition of the word torture reveals that it was not an occasional and exceptional use of such word in place, but it was exposed and expressed in full awareness and repeatedly in order to get the message across to listeners, i.e., that the applicant had been subject to torture by police officers and fire fighters.” the audiencia provincial upheld the remaining elements of the first-instance judgment. additionally, it stated that the applicant’s statement could not be described as an act of public criticism of the intervention carried out by the police, nor had the applicant’s intent been to provide the public with information. this type of expression could not be limited by strict criminal-legal definitions. the applicant further stated that the term “torture” contained several meanings apart from the strictly criminal one.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in berlin. on 13 march 2010 there was a fight in the applicant’s apartment between the applicant, s. (the applicant’s flatmate at the time) and s.’s guests. by letter from the police of 18 march 2010, the applicant was notified that preliminary proceedings against him had been initiated and that he was accused of having insulted s. and of having pushed and punched him in the face, resulting in bruising to s.’s skull and jaw problems. the letter also stated that he was given the opportunity to submit written or oral comments and that he was free, at any time, even before being questioned, to consult defence counsel to be chosen by him. the applicant, who had applied for access to, and been given copies of the file prior to the issuance of the penal order, lodged a timely objection against that order and asked to be given access to the file again, which was granted. on 9 may 2011 the district court admitted s. as private accessory prosecutor (see paragraph 18 below), represented by counsel paid for by s. himself. on 12 may 2011 s.’s lawyer, in the context of the criminal proceedings, lodged civil claims for compensation under articles 403 et seq. of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 19 below) and applied for legal aid to be granted to s. for the pursuit of those claims. the applicant was given the opportunity to submit written comments on this and made use of that opportunity. on 24 may 2011 the berlin tiergarten district court granted legal aid to s. and appointed his lawyer to represent him in the pursuit of the civil claims in the context of the criminal proceedings. the following day the main hearing took place, lasting for some 75 minutes. the district court orally heard s. as well as b. and m., the latter two having been present at the event in question, as witnesses and also evaluated a medical certificate concerning the injuries sustained by s. it convicted the applicant of libel and two counts of assault and sentenced him to a fine of 90 day-fines of eur 15 each. in respect of the civil claims, it also ordered him to pay eur 430 in damages (eur 400 in respect of non‑pecuniary damage and eur 30 in respect of pecuniary damage) plus interest to s. s.’s lawyer had been given leave to address only the civil compensation claim. the applicant had made written submissions setting out his position prior to the hearing and was orally heard by the district court. on 26 may 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal on facts and law. on 4 july 2011 the judge presiding over the competent appeals chamber of the berlin regional court informed the public prosecutor’s office of his intention to appoint defence counsel for the applicant. that same day, mr förster, the applicant’s lawyer in the convention proceedings, gave notice that he now represented the applicant. in addition to complaining of a wrongful application of law to the merits of the case, he alleged a procedural error because no defence counsel had been present for the applicant throughout the trial before the district court. he claimed that representation by defence counsel had been necessary, given that the private accessory prosecutor s. had been represented by counsel who had been present at the main hearing. on 14 march 2012 the berlin court of appeal dismissed the appeal on points of law, save for allowing the applicant to pay the fine in instalments. it found that the conditions for mandatory appointment of defence counsel under article 140 § 2 of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 20 below) were not met. the legislature had deliberately chosen to limit the presumption that an accused cannot defend himself to cases where the competent court had appointed counsel for the victim for the private accessory prosecution in accordance with articles 397a and 406g §§ 3 and 4 of the code (see paragraph 20 below). in such a scenario, the individual circumstances of the case had to be assessed in order to determine whether defence counsel had to be appointed. turning to the circumstances of the case, the court of appeal concluded that the applicant was capable of effectively defending himself without counsel and had indeed done so. it considered that the applicant had knowledge of the parts of the file relevant for the decision, which did not give rise to factual or legal difficulties, that the nature of the offences and the potential sentence at stake were not significant, and that the factual background and the taking of evidence were easily understandable. counsel for s. had only acted in respect of the civil claims. the applicant’s written submissions, including his timely appeal against the district court’s judgment, showed that he was capable of safeguarding his legal interests on his own. on 30 april 2012 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s request to be heard. on 18 september 2012 the federal constitutional court declined to consider the applicant’s constitutional complaint (no. 2 bvr 1377/12), finding that it was inadmissible because he had not applied for the appointment of defence counsel before the district court.
the applicant was born in 1946 and lives in yerevan. two elderly sisters, were found dead in v.g. ’s apartment, where they lived together following which the prosecution started an investigation into their death. it appears that the applicant had known v.g., had died as a result of acute heart failure brought about by low body temperature while opinion no. on 9 february 2007 the prosecutor decided to terminate the investigation. relying on forensic medical opinions nos. on 14 february 2007 the applicant submitted v.g. ’s will to the notary and gave his acceptance to inherit her apartment. ’s niece applied to the prosecutor’s office, stating that although v.g. had bequeathed the apartment to her by the will certified by a public notary back in 1991, she had been informed that the applicant had submitted another will in respect of the same apartment according to which the apartment was to pass down to him. it appears that on 11 july 2007 additional post-mortem forensic medical examinations following the exhumation of the bodies of m.g. 22 and 23 had correctly determined the causes of their death and, if not, whether it was possible that they had died as a result of having been poisoned. whom he knew, had visited him in his home to hand over some documents to him, namely a will and other documents from the notary informing him that she had bequeathed her apartment to him. 13/631/k and 14/630/k according to which both sisters had died as a result of poisoning by compounds containing phosphorous. on 26 september 2007 the applicant was charged with fraud and two counts of murder committed for gain. on 21 december 2007 a forensic technical and toxicological examination was completed. gave expert statements on 6 december 2007, 25 january and 5 february 2008 respectively. were ordered, and they were completed on 27 june 2008. confirmed the presence of phosphorous compounds in the bodies of the two victims. on 8 july 2008 the applicant’s case was transferred to the yerevan criminal court for trial. at the hearing of 26 august 2008, the opinions of all expert witnesses were read out aloud. the judge reasoned this decision by stating that as the subsequent expert opinions already explained the content of the first opinion issued by a.d., it was not necessary to call the expert witnesses. on 21 october 2008 the yerevan criminal court found the applicant guilty of two counts of aggravated murder committed for gain and sentenced him to life imprisonment. in doing so, it mostly relied on the trial statements of the victims’ relatives and neighbours, who confirmed that the applicant had visited the sisters in their apartment several times; on the expert opinions; and on material evidence seized from the applicant’s apartment, namely the originals of the ownership certificate in respect of v.g. ’s will drawn up on 5 april 2006 and a duplicate of v.g. on 12 february 2009 the criminal court of appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal without addressing the complaint about his inability to have the experts examined during his trial. on 2 july 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, raising similar complaints as before. on 28 july 2009 the court of cassation declared the applicant’s appeal inadmissible for lack of merit.
in 2005 to 2006 the applicant was prosecuted for various crimes. he was eventually found guilty of aggravated robbery and sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment, the final decision having been adopted on 19 september 2006. from 27 may 2005 to 3 october 2006 the applicant was detained at a pre-trial detention centre (sizo) in kropyvnytskyi (then named kirovograd). from 4 october 2006 to 20 march 2008 the applicant was detained at correctional colony no. 6 in kropyvnytskyi (hereinafter “the first colony”). according to the applicant, he was held in a dormitory measuring 6 by 8 sq. m and containing twelve double bunk beds. the government submitted that the dormitory concerned measured 41.68 sq. they submitted photographs supposedly corroborating their submissions in that regard. the applicant alleged that electricity in the colony had been regularly switched off. the government submitted that electricity was supplied round the clock but, to reduce power consumption as part of a nationwide energy‑saving strategy, the voltage of the general lighting in the institution had been reduced from 220 to 110 v. the applicant submitted that that meant that, even when the lighting had been on, the cell had been dimly lit and the light insufficient for activities such as reading and sewing. the applicant also alleged that he had not been given the essential items and that he had been “beaten, humiliated, tortured [and] placed in a disciplinary cell”. in particular, he alleged that he had been beaten on arrival at the colony on 4 october 2006 and that the guards had tried to place him into a psychiatric clinic in march 2007. 78 in the village of raikivtsi, khmelnytsk region (hereinafter “the second colony”), where he stayed until his release on 25 may 2012. the applicant alleged that the food in the correctional colonies had been inadequate and of a poor quality. he alleged that at both correctional colonies the sanitary conditions had been inadequate in that there had been cockroaches and sometimes mice and rats. they submitted that the food supply had been in accordance with the relevant regulations and regularly checked. in support of their submissions they submitted a number of logs and reports from the prison authorities showing that portions compliant with the regulations in force had been distributed to the prisoners, and that the sanitary conditions had been checked and found to be appropriate. they also submitted several statements from inmates who alleged that they had served time with the applicant and stated that the conditions of their detention, particularly in terms of the provision of food, clothes and sanitary conditions, had been appropriate. the applicant alleged that he had been repeatedly ill-treated by prison guards, that the prison authorities had intercepted, reviewed, blocked and delayed his correspondence, particularly that with the court and the parliamentary commissioner for human rights, and had persecuted and threatened him for having applied to the court. it appears from the documents submitted by the parties that the applicant complained many times to various domestic authorities, notably the prosecutor’s office, alleging, in general, ill-treatment and persecution by the prison authorities. in may and august 2010 he withdrew two of his complaints, stating that they had been lodged in a state of heightened emotions. registers of incoming and outgoing mail from the correctional colonies submitted by the government show that, in the period from 17 june 2008 to 1 december 2011 – the only period of the applicant’s detention for which specific information in this regard is available – the applicant sent and received more than sixty letters to and from various public entities, most notably various domestic courts, disciplinary commissions of judges, members of parliament and the presidential administration. under domestic law (see paragraph 21 below) this correspondence was subject to monitoring by the prison authorities. the prison registers show that the applicant also corresponded extensively with other entities, namely prosecutors, the parliamentary commissioner for human rights and the court. this correspondence was, under domestic law, exempted from monitoring. the government also submitted a number of cover letters prepared by the prison authorities relating to the letters sent out by the applicant. after sending the court an authority form empowering mr markov to represent him, the applicant sent the court two letters, in april 2014 and april 2015, informing it that he wished to revoke the lawyer’s authority. he said that the lawyer, by seeking to derive financial benefit from the case, had demonstrated conduct unworthy of his status. in subsequent correspondence between the registry, the applicant and the lawyer it transpired that the applicant was apparently upset about the lawyer’s inability to help him with matters unrelated to the proceedings before the court, such as sending him various goods and representation in unrelated domestic judicial and pardon proceedings.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in novosibirsk. the applicant was charged with and subsequently found guilty of murdering his father and uncle. in particular, he alleged that he had not been provided with legal assistance in the appeal proceedings (application no. on 26 march 2007 the court gave notification of the application to the russian government. on 29 november 2007 the supreme court held a new appeal hearing in which the applicant took part by means of a video link and was represented by state-appointed counsel, a. the court upheld, in substance, the applicant’s conviction. noting that the applicant had been unable to enjoy effective legal assistance before the appellate court, it found a violation of article 6 § 1 of the convention taken in conjunction with article 6 § 3 (c) thereof. on 23 november 2011 the presidium of the supreme court granted the president’s request, quashed the judgment of 29 november 2007 and remitted the matter to the appellate court for fresh consideration. on an unspecified date the supreme court appointed ms k., a lawyer practising in moscow, to represent the applicant. on 22 march 2012 the applicant communicated with his lawyer by means of a video link. the applicant was also alone in the video conference room. on 5 april 2012 the supreme court upheld, in substance, the applicant’s conviction on appeal. she did not submit fresh grounds for appeal and made submissions to the court that appeared to be based on the grounds for appeal originally filed by the applicant and counsel a. the applicant, who was detained in novosibirsk, took part in the hearing by means of a video link. he had agreed to be represented by counsel k. and confirmed that he had been provided with sufficient time to communicate with her to discuss his case. according to excerpts from the remand prison population records submitted by the government, he was held in the following cells:
cell no. period of detention
cell size (square metres)
number of sleeping places
number of inmates
322
from 7 to 8 february 20. according to the government, the cells in which the applicant was detained were furnished with a sink, a table, a bench, a cupboard for storing food products, a coat stand, a mirror, a drinking water tank, a rubbish bin, wash basins, a heater, an electric plug and an alarm button. there was a toilet cabin which ensured complete privacy for the person using it. the windows in the cells had small vents, which could be kept open to ensure access to fresh air. there were no grilles or shutters on the windows preventing access to daylight. during the daytime the cells were lit with a 95-watt electric bulb. the central heating system was always in a good working order. the temperature in the cells was maintained at +22 to +25oc in the summer and +19 to +21oc in the winter. the bed sheets were changed each time the inmates took a shower. 48 and 18 were overcrowded throughout the time he was detained there. 48 he was not always provided with an individual bed. he did not have bed sheets, cutlery or toiletries. the dining table was too small to accommodate all inmates. the table was located 1 metre away from the toilet. on 15 march 2012 the applicant brought a civil action against the remand prison, alleging that he had been detained in inhuman and degrading conditions there. on 14 march 2013 the dzerzhinskiy district court of novosibirsk dismissed the applicant’s claims.
the applicant was born in 1953 and lived in martin. in 2006 she was recognised as “severely disabled” with 60% “functional impairment” pursuant to the relevant national laws. her monthly disabled person’s allowance payments in 2010, 2011 and 2012 were 325.40 euros (eur), eur 336.20 and eur 346.30, respectively. prior to the above, in 2004, the applicant had lodged a claim with the martin district land office (obvodný pozemkový úrad) for restitution of a suite of real property consisting of several plots which came under special legislation provisions on restitution. this type of action required mandatory legal representation. accordingly, the action was submitted through a lawyer. the applicant also sought an order for costs. the latter claim was calculated under the applicable national rules as pertaining to two “acts of legal assistance” (úkon právnej služby), in particular a first consultation with a lawyer, and the formulation of the action. eur 130 was claimed in respect of one such act along with an associated lump sum for overheads; the whole claim came to some eur 260. on 2 january, 29 february and 23 march 2012 the applicant made further submissions. in the former two, she proactively informed the court that the land office had taken decisions in respect of her restitution claim on 23 december 2011 and 12 january 2012 and contended that these decisions did not determine her claim in relation to all the plots concerned and that they had been taken with the aim of creating a false impression that there had been no unjustified delays in the proceedings. the latter submission was made in response to a request by the court to specify the plots in respect of which the applicant’s restitution claim was still outstanding. on 10 april 2012 the regional court granted the action and made an order for costs. it found that the applicant had correctly calculated the value of the act of legal assistance and that the undertaking by her lawyer of those acts had been justified. accordingly, it allowed the claim in respect of those three acts of legal assistance. there is no reference in the regional court’s decision to the remaining two acts of legal assistance in the summary of the applicant’s claim, in the courts’ reasoning, or in the operative part of its decision. the regional court’s decision was not amenable to appeal. on 18 may 2012 the applicant challenged the ruling on costs before the constitutional court. as she had been fully successful in the case, she normally should have been compensated in respect of the costs of all justified acts of legal assistance received. a reduction of the award could only have been based on exceptional circumstances within the meaning of article 150 of the code of civil procedure. on 14 june 2012 the constitutional court declared the complaint inadmissible. it noted that it was essentially aimed at the fact that the regional court had provided no explanation for deciding on and granting compensation in respect of three acts of legal assistance only. it observed that, as such, the complaint concerned a decision on costs rather than on the merits of the applicant’s action. it referred to its established case-law to the effect that decisions on costs could violate fundamental rights and freedoms only exceptionally, in particular if there were an extremely serious interference with such rights and freedoms. it was true that the decision contested in the applicants’ case was “challengeable under the criteria of lawfulness”. however, it was necessary to take into account that the value of the remaining two acts of legal assistance was only some eur 270. this was less than three times the statutory minimum wage, the limit that was otherwise applicable to admissibility of appeals on points of law. if the amount at stake was this negligible, the jurisdiction of the constitutional court could only be engaged in very exceptional circumstances and no such circumstances had been established in the applicant’s case. accordingly, her complaint was rejected as manifestly ill-founded. the decision was served on 3 august 2012 and no appeal lay against it.
the applicant was born in 1971 and lives in çorum. was appointed by the bar association to represent him. he arrived at the police station where the applicant was being held. had a private meeting to discuss the case that lasted for eight minutes. at the anti-terrorist branch of the istanbul security headquarters. he did not admit to any affiliation to the organisation. following the last question, the applicant stated that m.k., one of the alleged members of the tdp at the time, had asked him to provide him with a fake identity card in order to escape abroad and he had provided him with the identity information of his brother. as a result, the lawyer did not sign the interview record. the applicant once again denied his affiliation to an illegal organisation. had stayed at his house on several occasions. subsequently, the applicant had allowed them to visit the friend together. on 21 march 2004 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and investigating judge respectively. he exercised his right to remain silent before the public prosecutor. he then gave statements to the investigating judge in the presence of a lawyer and retracted his police statements, alleging that he had been compelled by police officers to make self-incriminating statements. on 22 march 2004 the applicant’s detention was ordered in absentia. on 29 march 2004 the public prosecutor at the istanbul state security court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, charging him with aiding and abetting an illegal organisation under article 169 of the former criminal code. on 20 april 2004 the applicant was remanded in custody. however, he denied his statements to the police, stating that they had frequently recorded things he had not said, as a result of which his lawyer had confronted them and had then been removed from the interview. at the same hearing, the court noted that the investigation file relating to the allegations that the police officers had ill-treated the accused and had not allowed them to see their lawyers had been sent to the fatih public prosecutor’s office. it accordingly decided to request a copy of that investigation file. at a hearing held on 24 december 2007 the applicant, at his request, made his final submissions to the erzurum assize court about the decision of the court of cassation. at the end of the hearing the court notified him that the next hearing would take place on 27 december 2007. criminal proceedings against the police officers 26. on 22 october 2004 the fatih public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment against the relevant police officers, accusing them of ill‑treatment and misconduct in office. the prosecutor stated that they had ill-treated the applicant and other suspects in police custody between 17 and 21 march 2004. at a hearing held on 2 march 2005 before the fatih criminal court of general jurisdiction, the applicant’s officially appointed lawyer a.e.d. subsequently, during the course of the applicant’s interview when he had informed him that he had the right to remain silent, one of the officers had shouted at him saying that he was “ill-mannered” (terbiyesizlik). 765) and article 223 of the new code of criminal procedure (law no. the parties did not appeal and the judgment became final on 14 december 2010.
the applicants, who are brothers, were born in 1964 and 1962 respectively and live in mardin. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. at the time of the events giving rise to the application, the applicants held teaching posts with the ministry of education and were employed as primary school teachers. on 26 january 2000 he was questioned by the police. claiming that he had never been in contact with hizbullah, he stressed that the cv shown to him as evidence by the police during questioning differed from the one he had seen at the time of his detention a week earlier, and that they both contained inaccurate information about his background. on 29 february 2000 the public prosecutor filed an indictment with the diyarbakır state security court, accusing the applicants of membership of an illegal armed organisation. the cases against the applicants were therefore transferred to the diyarbakır assize court. it thus suspended the criminal proceedings against the first applicant. the decision became final on 31 october 2007. on 7 december 2007 the diyarbakır assize court reclassified the charge against the second applicant as aiding and abetting an illegal organisation and discontinued the proceedings in respect of that charge on account of the expiry of the five-year prosecution period. it further acquitted him of the remaining charges for lack of sufficient evidence. owing to the fact that they were being prosecuted on charges of membership of an illegal organisation, the applicants were suspended from their positions. in respect of the second applicant, the teachers said that they knew him to be religious but that they had not witnessed him engaging in any ideological propaganda at school. the applicants denied the allegations and stated that they wanted to return to their duties as soon as possible. the investigators therefore recommended the applicants’ dismissal on those grounds. in separate submissions the applicants denied all the allegations against them. in that respect he submitted that the conclusion reached by the disciplinary authorities was not grounded on facts but solely on accusations and rumours. it therefore held that he could not be dismissed from public service for membership of a terrorist organisation without a final conviction. the case was remitted to the diyarbakır administrative court. despite the fact that the criminal proceedings against the applicant [on charges of membership of a terrorist organisation] have been suspended, it is an established principle of case-law that exoneration from criminal liability does not preclude the finding of a disciplinary offence. on 21 june 2005 the first applicant appealed against the judgment of the diyarbakır administrative court to the supreme administrative court, requesting a stay of the decision ordering for his dismissal from service. c.  proceedings before the administrative courts against the dismissal of the second applicant 29. on 4 march 2002 the diyarbakır regional administrative court ordered a stay of execution of the dismissal decision. the regional administrative court then went on to examine the different types of offences that may be committed by civil servants, differentiating between acts amounting to disciplinary offences exclusively, acts considered to be offences under both disciplinary and criminal laws and, lastly, acts defined as offences only under the criminal code. bearing in mind that the relevant criminal proceedings were still pending before the diyarbakır state security court, the regional administrative court concluded that the second applicant could not, for the time being, be lawfully dismissed from the civil service on account of membership of a terrorist organisation. the ministry of education appealed against the decision. referring to the second applicant’s statements given to the police, his cv obtained from the hizbullah safe house in istanbul and the bill of indictment filed against him by the mardin public prosecutor, the supreme administrative court then found it established that the second applicant was a member of a terrorist organisation who in addition had recruited members to the organisation and pursued the ideology of the terrorist organisation in the classroom. it continued that even if his colleagues had not witnessed such action on the part of the second applicant at the school, his dismissal had still been justified under a different subsection of section 125 (e), namely subsection (g), which authorised the dismissal of civil servants who were found to engage in “disgraceful and shameful conduct incompatible with the position of a civil servant”. on 24 november 2009, complying with the decision of the supreme administrative court, the mardin administrative court upheld the disciplinary decision ordering the second applicant’s dismissal from the civil service under section 125 (e) (g) of law no. on 17 september 2010 the supreme administrative court dismissed a request for leave to appeal lodged by the second applicant.
on various dates in the 1990s the employer of the adult male applicants (applicants 1, 3, 5 and 10), the security service of the ministry of finance, provided them with accommodation in its dormitory building in moscow. they were registered as living in the building on a temporary basis. in 2001 the right of operational management in respect of the dormitory building was transferred to the federal treasury (“the treasury”). between 2003 and 2009 applicants 2, 6, 7, 9 and 12 were born and started living in the dormitory building with their parents. according to the government, the first applicant was dismissed from the security service in 2014. the tenth applicant is still employed by the security service. the adult male applicants are registered as living in the dormitory building on a permanent basis. each family occupies a room in the building. the treasury submitted that the respondents had moved in unlawfully, without its permission. having regard to the above, the district court concluded that articles 53 and 54 of the old housing code and articles 69 and 70 of the new housing code, which allowed tenants under a social tenancy agreement to move members of their families into a property, were not applicable to the adult female applicants, and therefore they had to be evicted from the occupied housing without any alternative accommodation being provided. in january 2008 bailiffs instituted enforcement proceedings. in march 2008 those proceedings were terminated, as the creditor recalled the writ of execution. on 5 february 2009 new enforcement proceedings were instituted. in 2009 the treasury brought new eviction proceedings against the adult female applicants. this time, the treasury sought to evict them from the dormitory building, regardless of which rooms they were occupying. the treasury claimed that those applicants had started living on the premises without its permission. the applicants concerned lodged a counterclaim, seeking to have their right to occupy the dormitory building premises recognised. they submitted that they had been residing in the building lawfully as spouses of the persons to whom the housing had been provided, and in any event, under domestic law (article 20 of the civil code, and articles 31 and 54 of the family code (see “relevant domestic law” below), they had a right to live together with their husbands and children. they claimed that the applicants who were minors were registered as living in the dormitory building and lived there with their families. the local authorities asked the district court to take the interests of the minor applicants into account when making its decision and to dismiss the eviction claims. they also submitted that, by taking the decision to evict them, the district court had breached their right to respect for their family life. on 24 november 2010 the city court upheld the eviction order. the city court referred to the findings of the district court in the judgments of 14 september 2007 and 14 april 2010. on an unspecified date the applicants were put on the municipal housing list. those applicants brought proceedings on their own behalf, but also in the name of and on behalf of the minor applicants. on 17 august 2011 the district court granted the claims of the adult male applicants and the minor applicants in part. in particular, the court established that the adult male applicants had been moved into the dormitory building by their employer, the security service of the ministry of finance, between 1990 and 1995. on 16 february 2012 the city court upheld that judgment. on 15 august 2017 the applicants informed the court of changes in their family situations. in particular, on 28 june 2012 the youngest son of the popov family, grigory, was born, and the ozerov family had twin daughters, valeria and maria, on 15 june 2012, and a son, maxim, on 7 october 2015.
the applicant was born in 1960 and lives in istanbul. on 11 december 1995 the applicant, a traffic control officer, was hit by a car while on duty. he suffered bodily injuries as a result of the accident. an official disability report indicated that he had a reduced working capacity of 60%. on the basis of this report the applicant, while reserving the right to increase his claims in due course, made an initial request for compensation to the ministry of interior, claiming 20,000 turkish liras (try) in pecuniary damages and try 5,000 in non-pecuniary damages. following tacit dismissal of the claim by the ministry, the applicant brought a case for compensation before the istanbul administrative court for the amounts he had specified in his request to the ministry. during the course of the proceedings, the court decided of its own motion to order an expert report to determine the exact amount of pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant. the report, which was submitted to the court on 26 september 2005, indicated the applicant’s pecuniary damages as 157,077 try. the applicant did not submit a request to the court to increase his initial claims in the light of that report. the istanbul administrative court in its decision delivered on 15 february 2006 only awarded him the amounts initially requested by him.
the second applicant was born in 1957 and lives in prilep. on 8 november 2008 seven persons, including the second applicant, founded the applicant association. the founding members adopted several documents concerning the applicant association, including its charter, the relevant parts of which read as follows:
article 1
“the church of real orthodox christians of macedonia [hereinafter “the church”] is a voluntary association of individuals, who exercise, through their religious beliefs and doctrinal sources, the freedom of religion ... through preaching; prayer; religious rituals; and other forms of expression.” article 3
“the seat of the [applicant association] is [the street name].” ...”
article 9
“as part of its activity, the church will publish literature with orthodox content and establish funds, in particular, for:
-  publication of bulletins and periodicals ...;
-  publication of chronicles concerning the work of the members;
-  publication of books;
-  creation of funds for financial aid.” article 11
“the publication and humanitarian activity of the church, as well as the funds that it will establish, shall be financed by:
-  sponsors;
-  donations;
-  contributions;
-  funds gained by its own economic activities.” article 27
“the church will be financed by:
-  economic activities;
-  sponsorship;
-  donations;
-  voluntary contributions and funds, and so forth.” on 26 november 2008 the ministry of justice granted permission to the applicant association to use the word “macedonia” in the name. on 3 december 2008 the second applicant, acting as an authorised representative of the applicant association, submitted an application for its registration as a religious association. as stated in the application, it appended, inter alia, evidence that its founding members were macedonian nationals. by a letter of 19 december 2008, the skopje court of first instance (“the registration court”) acknowledged receipt of all appended documents and requested that the applicants complete the application by specifying the organisational form under which the applicant association sought registration. on 5 january 2009 the applicants replied that the applicant association sought registration as a church. on 6 march 2009 the registration court rejected the application as incomplete. whereas it confirmed that nationality documentation was in the file, the court held that it was unable to establish whether the application for registration had been submitted in good time. that decision was quashed on appeal by the skopje court of appeal, which found no reasons why the registration court had not sought that the applicants complete the application in that respect by its request of 19 december 2008. on 10 may 2010 the registration court dismissed “the application of the applicant association” for registration, finding that it had requested registration as a religious entity under the legal status of churches, religious communities and religious groups act (“the 2007 act”) only for formal reasons, while in practice it would operate as an association of citizens to which the association of citizens and foundations act applied. in this connection, the court held that: (a) the text of article 1 of the charter was not identical to the text of section 2 of the 2007 act; (b) articles 9 and 10 of the charter specified that the applicant association would publish literature with religious content and would create funds, which, according to the court, was contrary to the aims specified in section 2 of the 2007 act. in this connection it was noted that articles 11 and 27 of the charter specified that the applicant association would be financed, inter alia, by economic activities (стопанска дејност), which was contrary to sections 30-33 of the 2007 act; (c) there was no evidence that the founding members and the second applicant were macedonian nationals; and (d) despite the fact that the founding members had adopted the required documents for registration of the applicant association, they had not discussed the issues specified in section 13(1)(2-6) of the 2007 act. the second applicant lodged an appeal with the skopje court of appeal in which he complained on behalf of the applicant association that the reasons given by the registration court were unclear and contradictory. in this connection he argued, inter alia, that he had submitted copies of nationality documentation for the founding members; that section 31 of the 2007 act provided that religious entities could publish relevant literature; that the sources of income provided for in the charter corresponded to those set forth in the 2007 act; and that the registration court had not explained how and why the registration of the applicant association would affect the religious beliefs and managing bodies of other registered religious communities. on 16 december 2010 the skopje court of appeal upheld the lower court’s decision, finding that the reasoning contained therein was clear and consistent. it held that article 11 of the charter provided that the applicant association would be financed from funds obtained from economic activities, which implied that it would be for-profit, contrary to section 33(2) of the 2007 act. furthermore, the permission granted by the ministry of justice of 26 november 2008 (see paragraph 6 above) concerned “the church of real orthodox christians” and not “the church of real orthodox christians of macedonia”. lastly, it established that there was no evidence in the case file regarding the nationality of the founding members and the second applicant. the court did not address the remaining complaints.
the applicant was born in 1969 and is detained in verona, italy, in connection with criminal charges unrelated to the present case. in the early morning of 22 july 2005 a sales clerk, g., was attacked in a shop in kharkiv where she worked. she suffered multiple cuts, including a penetrating chest wound, which led to pneumothorax. she was hospitalised in an intensive-care unit. according to the subsequent findings of the domestic court which convicted the applicant of aggravated robbery (see paragraph 18 below), the applicant had attacked g., whom he had known previously, and seized a certain amount of cash belonging to her employer, the company that ran the shop. according the applicant’s account, which he maintained throughout the proceedings before the domestic courts and before this court, g. owed him money and he had gone to the shop to collect the debt. when the shop’s alarm had gone off, he had taken the money and run away. allegedly, his request for a lawyer was ignored. in a statement (объяснение) dated 22 july 2005 taken by a police officer, the applicant gave the account of events as set out in paragraph 9 above. on 17 october 2005, at the opening of the trial before the kharkiv kyivsky district court (“the trial court”) the applicant stated that he wished to defend himself and waived his right to legal assistance. also in the course of the trial the applicant asked the trial court to call certain witnesses, without clearly identifying them. the trial court considered those allegations to be an obfuscation tactic on the part of the applicant and pointed out that his girlfriend, with whom he had lived for two years, did not know of any debt. on the contrary, she had testified that he had had no money to lend. he raised, notably, various matters concerning the assessment of the evidence. he asked the court of appeal to provide him with a lawyer. on 6 january 2006 the applicant reiterated the latter request. the applicant was free to hire such a lawyer himself. on 4 december 2006 the applicant lodged a handwritten appeal on points of law with the supreme court. following his arrest, in july and august 2005 the applicant was allegedly held in a police station, a hospital and a police temporary detention facility. on 17 august 2005 the applicant was transferred to the kharkiv pre‑trial detention centre (“sizo”). according to him, he was held in a cell that had twenty-four sleeping places, with more than fifty other inmates. dates

former nuns in the macedonian orthodox church (“moc”), founded the applicant association. the minutes of the constituent assembly (записник од основачкото собрание) included the following statement:
“... nuns gathered at the assembly do not accept the teaching of the macedonian orthodox church, (which) they consider wrong and unorthodox. ( consequently) they do not want to have any canonical communication with episcopes and priests of the macedonian orthodox church. not only is (that) church in dispute (раскол) with all other orthodox churches, it is not recognised by anyone. this is so because all other churches consider its teaching heretical and wrong. we ... do not want to waste our life in religious doubt ... to be led by immature and non-religious people ... we would be offended on religious grounds if we are associated with another religious community ...” 5. on the same date, the founding members created the following official documents: (a) a founding decision; (b) decisions authorising o.m. to represent the applicant association and submit an application for its registration; and (c) the charter (статут) of the applicant association. the relevant parts of the founding decision read as follows:
article 1
“this decision serves (the purpose of) the registration of stavropegic monastery of saint john chrysostom in the register of churches, religious communities (верски заедници) and groups (религиозни групи) in the republic of macedonia, as a voluntary, non-profit association of christians who do not belong to any religious community and, in particular, have nothing in common with the macedonian orthodox church. ” article 3
“because it is a christian religious community ...” 7. the relevant parts of the charter read as follows:
article 1
“the stavropegic monastery of saint john chrysostom is a voluntary association of individuals who exercise, through their religious beliefs and doctrinal sources, freedom of religion ... through preaching, prayer, religious rituals, and other forms of expression.” article 2
“the stavropegic monastery of saint john chrysostom is a religious community founded by nuns (completely devoted to god) and private citizens (световни лица), whose religious beliefs correspond to the old and new testament (the bible). ” submitted an application for registration of the applicant association “as one of the religious communities” to the skopje court of first instance (“the registration court”). the above‑mentioned documents were appended to the application. on 10 december 2008 the registration court requested that the applicant association submit evidence concerning the nationality of its founding members, a requirement with which the applicant association complied. on 18 february 2009 the registration court refused to register “the voluntary association of physical persons named in the application as stavropegic monastery of saint john chrysostom”. it found that the application for registration did not meet the requirements laid down in sections 1 and 2 of the 2007 act on the legal status of a church, religious community and association (“the 2007 act”, see paragraphs 14 and 15 below) in that (a) it referred to a form of voluntary association of physical persons which was not covered by the act and (b) the registration of the applicant association “would violate the freedom of religion ‑ provided for in the convention and the constitution ‒ of other lawfully registered voluntary associations of physical persons”. as to the former, the court held that the 2007 act provided for the registration of churches, religious communities and groups but not of other religious entities, in this case a “monastery” (манастир), as specified in article 1 of the applicant association’s charter. the court did not elaborate further on the second ground on which it based its decision. the applicant association complained about that decision, arguing that it had sought to be registered as a religious community under the name specified in the founding documents, which was evident from the application for registration. it also submitted that non-registration was a very drastic measure (in this connection it argued that the court should have indicated any shortcomings that were to be rectified). the court had failed to explain whose religious beliefs would be affected by its registration. assuming that it referred to the followers of the moc, the court had not explained how its registration would violate their rights. the applicant association pointed out that in 2002 the registration court had refused to register it as a non-governmental organisation and had ruled that an association with such a name should seek registration under the legislation regulating religious communities and associations that was in force at the time. on 29 april 2009 the skopje court of appeal dismissed the applicant association’s appeal and upheld the lower court’s decision, endorsing the reasons given therein. lodged an appeal with the constitutional court complaining of a violation of freedom of thought and discrimination on religious grounds owing to the refusal by the registration court to register the religious community with which she was associated. by a decision of 9 september 2009 the constitutional court rejected the constitutional appeal, finding that o.m. had not sought protection of her rights and freedoms but “had complained on behalf of the religious community with which she was associated”. it also held that the complainant “had sought protection of freedoms and rights only formally... without submitting any arguments, evidence or facts ...”. lastly, the court stated that the complainant had requested that it review the application of the law by the registration court in the proceedings for the registration of the religious community, which, according to the constitutional court, was beyond its jurisdiction (u.br.189/09).
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in chevelcha. on 14 november 2004 – at 8.30 a.m. according to the applicant – the applicant was taken by the police from her home to the orzhytsya police station (“the police station”) to verify her possible involvement in the above-mentioned criminal offences. she was also made to spread her legs as widely as possible while standing and threatened with a beating if she fell down. the applicant signed a record of the explanation of procedural rights to her; in that record she stated that she did not wish to be legally represented at that stage. thereafter, the applicant was questioned as a suspect in the absence of a lawyer. according to the record, the applicant confessed to a number of cattle thefts in 2003 and 2004, committed as a part of a group, and provided some details in this respect. no questions were put or remarks made by the investigator. according to the applicant, no such meeting was ever ensured and v. was, in fact, excluded from the hearing. on 17 november 2004 the applicant was transferred to the lubny temporary detention facility (ізолятор тимчасового тримання – “the itt”). the admissions register of the facility suggests that upon her admission the applicant was found to be suffering from abrasions on her chin, left elbow and hip, a bruise on her right hip and a scratch mark on her left knee. on 18 november 2004 v. unsuccessfully tried to meet the applicant in the orzhytsya itt as he had not been informed of her transfer to the lubny itt. on the same date v. complained to the prosecutor about this fact. she was then questioned as an accused in this respect. on 3 december 2004 a new investigator was appointed to the criminal proceedings concerning the applicant. on 22 december 2004, on being notified of her procedural rights in the case concerning the theft committed during the early morning of 2 november 2004, the applicant expressed a wish to be represented by v. on the same date, the investigator admitted v. to these proceedings. the latter furthermore submitted that on 22 december 2004 his meeting with the applicant had been interrupted and she had been taken out of the meeting room. on an unspecified date criminal proceedings concerning all instances of theft were joined into a single case. on the same day the investigator refused the lawyer’s request as unsubstantiated and having been raised in only general terms. similar statements were made by the applicant’s co-defendants. on 18 april 2007 the district court found the applicant and her co‑defendants guilty as charged and sentenced them to different terms of imprisonment. the applicant was given a four-year suspended sentence. lastly, the applicant stated that she had been unlawfully deprived of legal assistance between 14 and 24 november 2004 and that all the evidence on which her conviction had been based, in particular her confessions, had been obtained during that period. she submitted in this respect that the courts had deliberately ignored evidence proving the fact that she had had bodily injuries shortly after her arrest. no copy of that decision has been made available to the court. as regards the defence rights, it was also noted that under the decision of the orzhytsya district court of 17 november 2004 lawyer v. had been granted permission to have a meeting with the applicant (see paragraph 19 above). she also denied her guilt of any criminal offence and asked for a medical examination of her to be conducted in order to identify and treat the injuries that she had been suffering from as a result of her ill-treatment by the police and to protect her from fresh beatings. on 26 november 2004, after having a meeting with the applicant and being given the results of the aforesaid medical examination, lawyer v. again complained to the prosecutor’s office of the applicant’s ill-treatment by the police and requested, inter alia, that she be given another forensic medical examination in his presence. on 29 november 2004 the applicant was transferred to the poltava temporary detention centre (“the poltava sizo”). on 21 december 2004 lawyer v. complained to the poltava prosecutor’s office about the lack of any response to the complaints lodged regarding the applicant’s ill-treatment; the failure to conduct a medical examination of her in the absence of police officers and in the presence of her lawyer; and violations of her defence rights. it noted, inter alia, that the case file contained no explanations by the officers from the orzhytsya and the lubny itts and no information regarding whether the applicant had been provided with medical assistance when in the poltava sizo and whether she had undergone a medical examination with a view to establishing whether she had bodily injuries.
the applicant was born in 1978 and is currently detained in the centre for persons in preventive detention on the premises of straubing prison (hereinafter “the straubing preventive detention centre”). on 29 october 1999 the regensburg regional court convicted the applicant of murder and, applying the criminal law relating to young offenders, sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment. it found that in june 1997 the applicant, then aged nineteen, had strangled a woman who had been jogging on a forest path by use of considerable force with a cable, a tree branch and his hands, had partly undressed the dead or dying victim and had then masturbated. from 17 july 2008 onwards, after he had served his full prison sentence, the applicant was remanded in provisional preventive detention under article 275a § 5 of the code of criminal procedure (see paragraph 61 below). on 22 june 2009 the regensburg regional court, with judge p. sitting on the bench, ordered the applicant’s subsequent preventive detention under section 7(2)(1) of the juvenile courts act, read in conjunction with section 105(1) of the juvenile courts act (see paragraphs 56 and 59 below). on 9 march 2010 the federal court of justice dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law against the regional court’s judgment. on 4 may 2011 the federal constitutional court, in a leading judgment, allowed the applicant’s constitutional complaint. on 5 may 2011 the applicant requested that the regensburg regional court order his immediate release. he claimed, in particular, that his provisional preventive detention was unlawful. on 4 july 2011 the regensburg regional court refused to amend its decision of 6 may 2011. on 16 august 2011 the nuremberg court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal as ill-founded. on 29 august 2011 the nuremberg court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s complaint regarding a breach of his right to be heard and his objection to the decision of 16 august 2011. the decision was served on counsel for the applicant on 6 september 2011. he further requested that the execution of those decisions be stayed by way of an interim measure until the federal constitutional court delivered its decision. the decision was served on counsel for the applicant on 30 may 2012. by a decision of 28 november 2011 the regensburg regional court upheld the applicant’s provisional preventive detention as ordered on 6 may 2011. on 2 january 2012 the nuremberg court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against that decision. even assuming that the applicant could reasonably consider the sense of the words “thank you” in the above context as meaning that the applicant could commit a violent offence, it had to be noted that the regional court, including judge p., had just established that the applicant still suffered from fantasies of sexual violence and that there was at that time a high risk that he would again commit serious offences against the life and sexual self‑determination of others. it did not suggest in any way that judge p. had not been ready to take an impartial decision in the present proceedings, more than two years after the impugned remark and following the conclusion of a new main hearing. the fact that judge p. had previously dealt with the applicant’s case did not in itself render him biased. having regard to the findings of these experts, as well as to those of several medical experts who had previously examined the applicant since his arrest following his offence, the regional court was satisfied that the applicant has had violent sexual fantasies involving the strangulation of women since the age of seventeen. in an appeal on points of law against the regional court’s judgment of 3 august 2012, the applicant complained of the unlawfulness of his “retrospective” preventive detention and of the fact that the judgment had been delivered with the participation of a biased judge, p. 39. on 11 april 2013 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the federal constitutional court. he complained, in particular, that the “retrospective” order for his preventive detention had infringed the prohibition on retrospective penalties under the constitution and article 7  § 1 of the convention. the applicant is currently still in preventive detention. moreover, he had turned down proposals for a further therapeutic programme in straubing prison. as a consequence, the applicant lost the privileges reserved for persons in preventive detention. in particular, he was no longer able to undergo any kind of therapy. on 13 september 2011 he was transferred back to, and once again detained in, the preventive detention wing of straubing prison until 20 june 2013, where he was offered social therapy. that institution, which is situated in a separated fenced-off compound on the premises of straubing prison and can house up to 84 detainees, has more staff than straubing prison, namely one psychiatrist, seven psychologists, one general practitioner, four nurses, seven social workers, one lawyer, one teacher, one prison inspector, forty-four general prison staff members and four administrative staff members, providing for the detainees.
the applicants are russian nationals who, at the material time, were living in the chechen republic. the perpetrators have not been identified by the investigating bodies. on 5 may 2005 the first applicant asked the shali district prosecutor to resume the proceedings. it appears that the investigation is still pending. on 10 january 2003 the acting head of the criminal investigation department of the ingushetia ministry of the interior reported to the investigators that on 29 november 2002 the united group alignment had confirmed that mr sultan saynaroyev had been detained by servicemen of the fsb, but that the fsb in a letter of 3 january 2003 had denied any involvement in the incident. on 23 april 2003 the deputy minister of the interior of ingushetia informed the applicants that operational search activities had indicated that fsb servicemen had been involved in the abduction of mr sultan saynaroyev. she immediately took a taxi and followed the apcs until they reached the premises of the military commander’s office. got out of the taxi and was approaching them on foot when a niva car pulled over. the whereabouts of mr usman magomadov remain unknown. immediately after the abduction the applicants informed the authorities thereof and asked that a criminal case be opened. on 14 june 2002 mr v.s., a police officer who had been manning the checkpoint on the day of the abduction, was questioned. on 19 june 2003 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators. specifically, the investigation was resumed on 25 december 2003, on unspecified dates in april and september 2004, and on 6 february and 5 june 2007. on 3 march 2003 the vedeno district prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. a week later the investigators examined the crime scene. on 19 february 2007 the applicant asked the head of the chechen parliament to assist in the search for her husband and to expedite the investigation. on 30 april 2007 the investigation was suspended. on 5 may 2007 the investigators questioned mr v.t., 30136 under article 126 of the cc (abduction). at around 12 a.m. on that day (in the documents submitted the time was also given as 9 a.m.) a group of armed servicemen in balaclavas and camouflage uniforms arrived at the applicants’ house in serzhen-yurt in four apcs and one uaz vehicle with no registration numbers. on 28 september 2011 the investigators resumed the proceedings. on 5 july 2002 the grozny town prosecutor opened criminal case no. on 13 january 2012 investigators from the prosecutor’s office questioned mr lom-ali akhilgov’s brother, an eyewitness to the abduction, who confirmed the account of the events given by the applicants. it appears that the applicants were not informed thereof. on 11 december 2009 the court allowed the complaint, stating that for more than six years the investigation had been unlawfully suspended and that the applicant was entitled to review the entire contents of the case file. on 12 november 2008 the twelfth applicant lodged a complaint with the achkhoy-martan district court challenging her lack of access to the investigation file and the investigators’ failure to take basic steps. the fourth applicant is the father of mr timerlan akhmadov, who was born in 1980. their letters were forwarded to the chechnya ministry of the interior. the supervising authorities instructed the investigators to question witnesses to the abduction. on 10 november 2008 the first applicant was granted victim status in the criminal case.
she was in a stable relationship with r. she had two children with him: the second applicant, m.i., born in 2006, and the third applicant, i.i., after 5 may 2014 (see paragraph 9 below) contact between them became even more scarce, and after 6 june 2014 (see paragraph 11 below) all contact stopped. on 25 november 2013, the first applicant instituted custody proceedings against r. before the bucharest district court (see paragraph 26 below). she feared that they were showing signs of emotional abuse caused by their father. the reports concluded that no signs of abuse had been identified. deciding in the interim proceedings (see paragraph 6 above), in a final decision of 5 may 2014 the bucharest county court ordered that the children should reside with their mother and that r. should pay monthly child support of 1,000 euros (eur) for each child until the end of the custody proceedings. on 4 june 2014 the first applicant applied to the bailiff’s office for enforcement of the decision of 5 may 2014. r. showed up as well and became abusive towards the first applicant. advised by the school administration, she returned on 9 june to pick them up, but on that day the children were absent. in a letter of 26 june 2014 the bailiff asked r. to comply with the court order and to return the children to their mother within ten days. the bailiff scheduled a second meeting for 14 august 2014. they alleged that she used to shout at them and had occasionally beaten them when they had lived together. on 2 october 2014 the district court allowed the request made by the bucharest child protection authority. the social assistant asked the father to take the children for a psychological evaluation. the plan required cooperation between the social assistant responsible for their case, a psychologist, the school administration and the two parents. he demanded to know on what grounds the children continued to be subjected to psychological counselling. (2)  because they are involved in the parental conflict, the children exhibit emotional and behavioural indicators frequently associated ... with psychological abuse. ... his behaviour may also be connected to a profound aversion to, and hostility towards, the children’s mother, which has more to do with the relations between the adults than with their parenting abilities. according to the specialised literature, the alienated parent also plays a role in losing his or her ties with the child. parents must be aware that parental alienation has negative consequences for the children’s development; without specialised intervention and the conscious participation of both parents, children can develop emotional or behavioural problems. it is recommended that the two children be no longer involved in the conflict between the parents. r. contested the enforcement proceedings, but on 9 november 2016 the bucharest district court dismissed his complaint. an appeal lodged by him was also dismissed in a final decision of the bucharest county court on 18 september 2017. r. appealed, but on 18 january 2016 he informed the bucharest county court that he did not wish to maintain his appeal. the constanţa directorate general for social welfare and child protection (“the constanţa child protection authority”) visited r. and the children in the new location and kept in touch with the bucharest child protection authority. on 16 august 2016 the first applicant asked the prosecutor to extend the investigation to also cover allegations of ill-treatment of minors, arguing that r. was subjecting the children to psychological abuse. on 17 august 2016 r. had applied for physical custody of the children. on 20 march 2017 the bucharest district court decided that the children should live with their father. the court notes that the first-instance court’s decision to set the children’s home with their father on the grounds that they were attached to him by strong affection and that they refused to communicate with [the first applicant], is the direct consequence of the non-enforcement of decision no.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in znamensk. the applicant is a former military officer. he performed his military service and lived with his family in znamensk, a closed administrative unit (закрытое административно-территориальное образование) of the astrakhan region. since 1975 he was registered at the place of residence at 71 the 9th may avenue, apartment 18, in znamensk. in 1998 he was dismissed from military service and registered as a person in need of housing in the city of his choosing, moscow. in 2002 the applicant’s family of two was included in the list of persons entitled to the receipt of a housing certificate. the applicant challenged the refusal in court. on 9 april 2007 the znamensk town court of the astrakhan region granted his claim, having found the reference to the legislative changes inapplicable to the applicant’s case. the court confirmed the applicant’s and his four family members’ right to housing provision in the form of the housing certificate, to be performed at the expense of the federal budget and at the place of the claimants’ registration as persons in need of housing. the court ordered the moscow housing commission to include the applicant’s family of five in an “order list” (список-заявка) for receipt of a state housing certificate. the judgment became final on 20 april 2007. it appears that the debtor authority’s representatives were not present at the hearing and asked to examine the case in their absence, on the basis of their written submissions. the court registry kept the transmission record stating that the fax passed “normally”. the court file contained no further documents evidencing the receipt of the judgment by the respondent. according to the applicant, on 26 march 2011 he sent the requisite documents to the authority by mail. he submitted a copy of the request of 10 february 2011 and the postal receipt dated 26 march 2011 and containing the requesting authority’s address in the “destination” part, in support of his submissions. on 5 may 2015 the city property department of the government of moscow informed the representative of the russian federation to the court that at some point they had examined the applicant’s unspecified application concerning the housing issue. the applicant’s address specified in the letter read as follows: 71 the 9th may avenue, apartment 118. despite several reminders, the applicant had failed to provide the requisite documents. accordingly, on 3 july 2012 the department of housing policy and housing fund of moscow had decided to strike the applicant’s family off the lists of persons in need of housing. there had been no grounds to provide them with housing. the authority had not received a copy of the judgment of 9 april 2007 for execution. according to the letter of 22 august 2016 by the department of the housing policy and the housing fund of moscow to the representative of the russian federation to the court, the authority has not received a copy of the judgment of 9 april 2007, and the applicant had not applied “with documents” for a housing certificate. the authority further stated that, pursuant to a decree of the moscow government of 14 february 2012 no. 43-пп on housing provision to some categories of citizens, as of that date the provision of housing certificates had been ensured by the housing provision department of the ministry of defence. on 1 november 2011 the administration of the closed administrative unit znamensk of the astrakhan region concluded a social tenancy agreement with the applicant in respect of the three-room flat in znamensk (see paragraph 7 above). the agreement stipulated that five applicant’s family members, namely, his son, his daughter, his son’s wife and their two children moved into the flat together with the applicant. in 2016 the applicant’s son divorced from his wife. on 6 february 2017 a domestic court granted the applicant’s request to discontinue the son’s ex-wife and their children’s use of the flat. on 20 june 2017 the social-tenancy agreement of 1 november 2011 was amended to specify that the three family members (the applicant’s wife, son and daughter) moved into the flat together with the applicant.
the applicant was born in 1971 and lives in malyn, zhytomyr region. on 17 november 1993 m. gave birth to a baby girl, k. given that the applicant had had relations with m. at the relevant time, on 2 december 1993 he accepted paternity of k. by submitting the relevant declaration to the authorities. on 23 march 2000 the applicant married m. they divorced in 2006. in july 2006 the applicant instituted proceedings in the malyn district court against m., challenging the paternity of k. the applicant claimed that, even though he had been married to another woman at the relevant time, he had had relations with m. and he had been sure that he was the father of the child and so accepted the paternity. however, in 2005 he had reason to doubt his paternity. on 24 march 2008 the district court found for the applicant, relying on a genetic expert’s opinion which excluded the possibility of the applicant being k.’s biological father. the court noted that the applicant had a right to challenge his paternity given that there was no evidence in the file to suggest that he had known that he was not the father of the child when accepting paternity of k. 9. m. appealed, stating that from january 1993 she and the applicant had lived together without being married and that she had never had any doubts about the applicant’s paternity of k. she argued, inter alia, that the genetic expert’s opinion was not reliable. on 29 may 2008 the zhytomyr regional court of appeal quashed the first-instance court’s decision and held that, under article 56 of the family and marriage code, the applicant had not had a right to challenge his paternity because at the time that he accepted paternity of k., he was aware that he was not k.’s father. in support of that finding the court of appeal noted that before k.’s birth, the applicant and m. had not been married, they had not lived together (noting, in particular, that between february and april 1993 the applicant lived in another town), and the applicant had been married to another woman at the relevant time. the applicant appealed on a point of law, contending that there were no grounds for the court of appeal to find that at the material time he was aware that he was not the biological father of the child. no such evidence was available in the file and the regional court of appeal had exceeded its powers in drawing such a conclusion. on 9 september 2008 the supreme court of ukraine rejected the appeal by the applicant as unfounded.
the first applicant was born in 1968 and is detained in lukiškės remand prison; the second applicant was born in 1975 and is detained in vilnius correctional facility. in march 2014 the commission decided not to examine the first applicant’s petition as it was not clear enough. in march 2014 the first applicant lodged a new petition with the commission. addressing the first applicant’s proposal that article 96 § 1 of the code for the execution of sentences be amended so that it would permit inmates to receive electronic items from their acquaintances or friends, as well as from their spouses, partners or close relatives, the commission held that the existing regulation was aimed at preventing inmates from receiving items acquired by criminal means – for example, by their accomplices in crime. it appears from the information provided by the government that from 2007 onwards the first applicant had a computer game player, a computer game, and a television set; moreover, in november 2014 he purchased a laptop with his own money. it also appears from the information submitted by the government that the applicant has a sister, a brother, an aunt, an uncle and a cousin (that is to say close relatives). he alleged that he had been confined to the prison hospital from 22 march until 4 april 2010, from 25 february until 4 march 2011, from 21 until 27 september 2011, and from 17 until 24 january 2014. he subsequently provided a specified complaint (patikslintas skundas – that is to say a complaint in which he clarified certain issues). on 19 may 2014 the vilnius regional administrative court ascertained that the second applicant had been confined to the prison hospital from 22 march until 13 april 2010, from 25 february until 4 march 2011, from 21 until 27 september 2011 and from 17 until 24 january 2014. the court also applied the three-year statutory time‑limit to part of the second applicant’s complaint. it held that the second applicant had been placed in overcrowded wards for fifteen days and awarded him 100 lithuanian litai (ltl – approximately 29 euros (eur)) in compensation for the fifteen days that he had spent in overcrowded wards during the periods from 21 until 27 september 2011 and from 17 until 24 january 2014. the second applicant’s other grievances were dismissed as unsubstantiated. the second applicant appealed, and on 9 december 2014 the supreme administrative court upheld the first-instance decision. however, it held that the first-instance court had erred in determining the relevant amount of personal space. the court held that under domestic regulations, a person confined to the prison hospital had to have at least 5.1 square metres of personal space. the court recalculated the number of days and held that between 25 february 2011 and 4 march 2011 the second applicant had had 4.05 square metres of personal space at his disposal, and that between 17 and 24 january 2014 he had had 2.83 square metres of personal space. it then ruled that he had not had enough personal space for twenty days in total. however, he had been able to move around the prison hospital from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m., and he had also been able spend time outside. on 15 july 2013 the second applicant lodged a request with the administration of vilnius correctional facility to be allowed to receive a portable digital music (mp3) player from j.g., in july 2013, the second applicant lodged a complaint about the above‑mentioned refusal with the prison department, which replied in august 2013 that the administration of vilnius correctional facility had acted in accordance with domestic law. on 20 august 2013 the second applicant lodged a complaint with the vilnius regional administrative court regarding the refusal of the administration of vilnius correctional facility to allow him to receive an mp3 player from someone to whom he was not related. however, as the person who had offered to bring him the player did not fall within the category of such persons, the refusal of the vilnius correctional facility administration had been lawful. the court had no doubts about the relevant provisions of domestic law and observed that they were designed to motivate inmates to work, to communicate with their relatives and to enhance their social ties. the court furthermore observed that (among other items) mp3 players did not constitute essential items but rather entertainment items. the court held that the second applicant had not denied that he had close relatives, but had simply submitted that they were not visiting him. the second applicant found himself in the same position as that of other inmates. his right to have an mp3 player had not been denied, as he could have purchased one. it was not prohibited for persons other than close relatives to give money to convicted inmates; thus, the second applicant could have received money with which to buy an mp3 player. on 5 may 2014 his request was refused because domestic law did not provide the possibility to send items to inmates by post. it appears from the information provided by the government that the second applicant received a personal computer in january 2011 (which he returned to his relatives in june 2011); another personal computer, a monitor and headphones in june 2011 (which he returned to his relatives in july 2016); and a usb key (which was destroyed at the second applicant’s request in december 2016) and a laptop in august 2016.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in luhansk. she has had a first-degree disability since childhood. her injuries included concussion, a fractured jaw and nose, and numerous cuts on her face. on 8 may 1998 the slavyanoserbskiy district prosecutor’s office of the luhansk region (прокуратура слов’яносербського району луганської області  “the prosecutor’s office”) refused to institute criminal proceedings against two asylum employees (orderlies), n. and l. when questioned about the incident, the orderlies testified that on the morning of 2 april 1998 they had been cleaning the rooms when they had heard someone crying. they had found the applicant on her bed with her face smashed. on 9 december 2004, within civil proceedings (see paragraphs 11–16 below), the applicant’s representative requested that the first-instance court reopen a criminal investigation into the incident. on the same date the request was rejected. moreover, b. had died and therefore, in accordance with the law in force, no criminal proceedings could be instituted against her. the ruling was upheld by the luhansk regional court of appeal and the supreme court of ukraine on 3 august 2005 and 31 march 2006 respectively. following the entry into force of a new criminal procedure code, on 26 december 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint with the police, alleging negligence by the orderlies. on 19 february 2013 both investigations were merged. on 30 june 2013 the proceedings were terminated by a police investigator of the slyavyanoserbskyy district police department (слідчій слідчого відділу слов’яносербського районного відділу гумвс україни в луганській області). on 9 october 2002 the legal capacity proceedings were terminated because the prosecutor failed to appear at the hearing. on 3 october 2006 the zhovtnevyy district court of luhansk awarded the applicant 30,000 ukrainian hryvnias (uah) in compensation for non‑pecuniary damage (approximately 4,500 euros (eur) at the material time). in a court hearing the asylum’s representative submitted that in his view the applicant had initiated the conflict with b. herself and thus there had been no negligence on the part of the asylum’s employees. the court further referred to the decision of the prosecutor’s office of 8 may 1998 (see paragraph 8 above) and held that harm had been inflicted on the applicant as a result of negligence by the asylum employees (orderlies). the applicant lodged an appeal challenging the refusal of the court to award her pecuniary damages but later withdrew it. the decision of 3 october 2006 thus became final and enforceable. there is no information to suggest that the asylum complied with the demand. on 22 november 2007 the complaint was allowed by the court. on 18 february 2008 the applicant instituted a new set of proceedings against the asylum, seeking compensation for loss of labour capacity and expenses for medications which the applicant permanently needed. on 15 june 2012 the zhovtnevyy district court allowed the claim. referring to its judgment of 3 october 2006 (see paragraph 15 above), the court established that harm had been inflicted on the applicant as a result of negligence by the asylum employees. on 23 october 2012 the luhansk regional court of appeal upheld this decision. on 30 january 2013 the higher specialised civil and criminal court of ukraine, following an appeal by the defendant, quashed the decisions of the lower courts and remitted the case to the first-instance court for fresh consideration. it held that since b. “ha[d] not been declared to be without legal capacity” (не була визнана недієздатною), she had been partially responsible for the incident and thus the lower courts should have considered the extent of her liability. on 27 september 2013 the first-instance court allowed the applicant’s claim in part and awarded her uah 44,130 (around eur 4,140 at the material time). no particular grounds for that assessment were given. both parties appealed against this judgment. on 17 february 2014 the higher specialised civil and criminal court of ukraine rejected the applicant’s request for leave for appeal as unsubstantiated.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in klaipėda. on 2 july 2013 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs with intention to distribute. on 9 july 2013 the applicant was brought to šiauliai remand prison and was held there until 31 may 2016. in judgment of 23 december 2015 the applicant was sentenced to four years imprisonment by the klaipėda district court. following an appeal by the applicant, the judgment became final on 25 may 2016. the applicant was then transferred to alytus correctional facility and after serving his sentence was released on 30 june 2017. he complained of: overcrowding; of there being no partition wall between toilets and cells; of insufficient ventilation; of insufficient time in the open air; of insufficient time for showering; of the presence of cockroaches; of inmates smoking in the cells; of no long-stay or short visits; of the fact that he had not been allowed to go home; of the low energy value of the food provided; of the prohibition on receiving food from relatives and friends; and of the prohibition on having his own blanket and a music player. on 27 june 2014 the šiauliai regional administrative court held that for 135 days the applicant had been housed in cell no. 53, and the personal space available to him had varied between 1.87 and 3.12 sq. m. this had been a clear violation of domestic norms. for eighty-seven days the applicant had been held in cell no. m, and it had come close to a violation of domestic norms. the court further held that the presence of toilets in the applicant’s cell had not corresponded to the requirements of domestic law, that the lighting had been insufficient and the temperature had been too low, and that the food provided had had insufficient energy value. the court noted that inmates could buy food and other necessities in the shops of the facility. the applicant’s other complaints were dismissed as unsubstantiated. as regards the prohibition on having his own blanket and a music player, the court held that the use of personal blankets was not allowed in accordance with domestic norms. as for music players, inmates could use television sets, computers, computer-game devices, discs that could not be rewritten, other memory cards of up to 4gb and bedding (except for a pillow, a mattress and a blanket) that could be given to them by their spouses, partners or close relatives. as regards long-stay and short visits, the court held that remand prisoners did not have a right to long-stay visits but he had a right to short visits of up to two hours. the applicant asked for a long-stay visit but on 20 january 2014 the prosecutor decided not to allow him such a visit. the court also held that inmates could be allowed to go home for up to five days in the event of the death or serious illness of a spouse, partner or close relative, or in the event of a natural disaster that had caused serious pecuniary damage to the inmate, his or her spouse, partner or close relatives. however, in his request of 31 january 2014 the applicant did not indicate any of those circumstances. as a result, the applicant was awarded 1,200 lithuanian litai (ltl – approximately 348 euros (eur)) in compensation for inadequate material conditions of detention for 222 days during the period between 9 july 2013 and 3 april 2014. the court thus decided to increase the compensation to eur 1,500. in october 2014 the applicant lodged a new complaint concerning his material conditions in šiauliai remand prison. he complained of overcrowding, low temperature, dampness, insufficient lighting, prisoners smoking in the cells, that his partner had not been able to pay him a long‑stay visit and that he had not been allowed to “take holidays”. it appears that the applicant had asked the prison management to allow him to receive a long-stay visit from his spouse and his sister on 28 april 2014. as regards long-stay visits, the court agreed with šiauliai remand prison and stated that the applicant had not been entitled to them under domestic law; he could have had short visits but, however, he had never asked for them. the court accepted the argument of the šiauliai remand prison that remand detainees had been held in prisons or correctional facilities for short periods of time and they were not in a similar situation to convicted inmates. the court awarded the applicant eur 869 in compensation for the material conditions of his detention. the applicant appealed, and on 21 september 2015 the supreme administrative court upheld the first-instance decision in its entirety.

the applicants were born in 1963, 1960 and 1959 respectively. the first applicant lives in balzan, the second applicant in naxxar and the third applicant in sliema. the applicants are owners of apartment no. 3 situated at 94, melita street, valletta. this apartment was inherited by the applicants from their father, who died in september 2006. initially, the apartment belonged to the applicants’ late father and his brothers. on 4 august 1981, the late father of the applicants and his brothers entered into a contract granting a temporary emphyteusis for seventeen years to couple s. the seventeen year temporary emphyteusis was to commence on 12 august 1981 and the ground rent to be paid was set at 120 maltese liri (mtl) (around 280 euros (eur)) annually. according to the applicants, in 1992, their late father had entered into negotiations with couple s., in order to reach a new lease agreement and increase the rent. couple s. did not accept the terms of the new lease and did not pay outstanding arrears. on 17 october 1994, a deed of partition was signed by the siblings and the apartment in question was assigned in its entirety to the late father of the applicants. on 11 august 1998 the temporary emphyteusis came to an end. as a result, couple s. could in practice reside indefinitely in the applicants’ premises. the rent established at the time, calculated in accordance with the law, was mtl 170.70 (around eur 397.62) annually and was to be revised every fifteen years (according to articles 12 and 13 of the housing (decontrol) ordinance). the next revision of the rent was scheduled for 2013 and the rent then would be eur 568.06. neither the applicants, nor their late father ever accepted any rent paid by couple s. on the following grounds: the rent due as calculated according to the law was far less than the rental market value of the apartment; the law in question (article 12 of the housing (decontrol) ordinance) was in breach of their rights as stipulated in article 1 of protocol no. constitutional redress proceedings
(a)  first-instance 15. on 18 october 2012, the applicants filed proceedings before the civil court (first hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction. they alleged that their predecessors had no alternative but to enter into a contract of temporary emphyteusis in order to prevent the apartment from being requisitioned, and once that contract of temporary emphyteusis had been converted into an indefinite lease, by imposition of the law and against their will, the applicants had lost the property for an indefinite period and had no means of recovering it. however, due to the change in law (brought about by act xxii of 1979), couple s. had remained therein rendering it impossible for the applicants to regain possession of their apartment. the applicants requested that the court provide them with the necessary compensation for the damage they had suffered. 47045/06, 15 september 2009 in connection with the laws pertinent to this case), the court noted that neither the convention nor the constitution established an absolute right of property. furthermore, the rent payable to the applicants did not reflect the value of the property in question ‑ the court‑appointed expert had established that the rental value of the apartment in 2014 was eur 3,000 annually, and that the rental value of the apartment in 1998 had been eur 2,000 annually. on 31 january 2014, the applicants appealed the above decision. on 6 february 2015, the constitutional court dismissed the applicants’ appeal and upheld the decision of the first‑instance court. the constitutional court ordered the applicants to pay for the costs of the appeal proceedings. the constitutional court observed that when the temporary emphyteusis agreement was entered into, two architects had been present alongside the applicants’ predecessors (then owners of the apartment). therefore, the applicants could not argue that their predecessors had not known the value of the apartment. in consequence they were aware that the rent would remain relatively low, like the ground rent had been. furthermore, the constitutional court argued that the owners could have requested a higher ground rent. nevertheless, they didn’t and they had entered the contractual relationship voluntarily fully aware of the consequences that would ensue.
the applicant was born in 1983 and lives in palanga. on 22 november 2013 the director of company m. lodged a complaint with the klaipėda police, alleging that the applicant’s wife, who had been providing accounting services to company m., had unlawfully transferred large amounts of money from that company’s bank account to other companies. the director claimed that company m. had not obtained any services from those companies and that he had not pre-approved those transfers. on 25 november 2013 the klaipėda police opened a pre-trial investigation into allegations of embezzlement and falsification of documents, under article 184 § 1 and article 300 § 1 of the criminal code. the director of company m. was questioned as a witness and stated that in may 2012 he had entered into a contract for accounting services with company a., of which the applicant was the director. in accordance with that contract, the applicant’s wife had begun providing accounting services to company m. in the beginning he had been happy with her work, but later he had noticed certain bank transfers which appeared suspicious to him. one such suspicious transfer had been a payment of 120,000 lithuanian litai (ltl) (approximately 34,750 euros (eur)) to company a. 8. on 4 december 2013 the applicant’s wife was granted the status of a “special witness” in the investigation; in line with the code of criminal procedure (hereinafter “the ccp”), she was questioned about her own possibly criminal activity and was exempted from liability for refusing to testify or giving false testimony (see paragraph 27 below). she stated that all the transfers from company m.’s bank account which she had carried out had been pre-approved by its director. she also stated that the transfer to company a. had been made by mistake, and the entire amount had been returned to company m. within a week. on 9 april 2014 the applicant was called as a witness. he refused to give testimony in relation to his wife’s actions and the payment of ltl 120,000 received by company a. from company m. 10. on 26 may 2014 a prosecutor from the klaipėda regional prosecutor’s office gave the applicant a fine of ltl 650 (approximately eur 188) for refusing to testify, as provided for in article 163 of the ccp (see paragraphs 31 and 32 below). the applicant lodged a complaint with a senior prosecutor. he argued that the status of a “special witness” was similar to that of a suspect, and therefore he should not have been compelled to testify against his wife, who had such status. he relied on article 31 of the constitution, which prohibits compelling a person to testify against his or her family members (see paragraph 18 below). on 9 june 2014 a senior prosecutor from the klaipėda regional prosecutor’s office dismissed the applicant’s complaint on the grounds that, in accordance with the ccp, only the family members of a suspect or an accused were exempt from liability for refusing to testify, but the ccp did not extend such a privilege to the family members of a “special witness” (see paragraph 19 below). the applicant lodged a complaint with the klaipėda district court, raising essentially the same arguments as those which he had raised before (see paragraph 11 above). he also asked the court to refer the matter to the constitutional court for a ruling on whether the ccp provisions which exempted the family members of a suspect or an accused from liability for refusing to testify, but not the family members of a “special witness”, complied with the constitution. on 9 july 2014 the klaipėda district court dismissed the applicant’s complaint and upheld the reasoning in the prosecutor’s decision (see paragraph 12 above). it stated that the applicant’s right not to testify against his wife would have been breached only if his wife had had the status of a suspect and not that of a witness. it also considered that the applicant’s request to refer the matter to the constitutional court was “subjective and legally unfounded”. that decision was final and not open to any further appeal. subsequently, the applicant lodged an appeal with the klaipėda regional court, but on 22 july 2014 that court refused to examine it, on the grounds that there was no provision for such an appeal in law. the applicant then lodged an application to reopen the proceedings with the supreme court, but on 23 september 2014 the court ruled that it had no authority to reopen proceedings concerning procedural penalties imposed under article 163 of the ccp. on 11 september 2014 the applicant was questioned as a witness in the pre-trial investigation. he stated that he was the director of company a., which provided accounting services to other companies. his wife worked as the financial director of company a., and from may to november 2012 she had provided accounting services to company m. the applicant stated that he had not known how or why ltl 120,000 had been transferred to the bank account of company a. he knew only that that entire amount had been returned to company m. within a week, in a transfer carried out by his wife. on 22 september 2014 the klaipėda regional prosecutor’s office discontinued the pre-trial investigation on the grounds that no criminal offences had been committed. it appears that that decision was not appealed against and became final.

“i hereby inform you that on 16 april 2017, at 12.15 p.m., at the medininkai border checkpoint ... a russian national [m.a.] ... who had arrived on foot ... was refused entry into lithuania. at 12.45 p.m. the alien was returned to belarus. the applicants were returned to belarus on that same day. they did not appeal against the decisions refusing them entry into lithuania. on 11 may 2017, around noon, the applicants arrived at the kena checkpoint on the border between lithuania and belarus. they submitted to the court that they had told the border guards that they were seeking international protection and asylum and that the first applicant had been tortured in chechnya. however, asylum proceedings were not initiated. the decisions were written in lithuanian. the sbgs issued decisions on refusal of entry in respect of all seven applicants, with the same content as before (see paragraphs 10 and 15 above). the first and second applicants signed the decisions concerning them, but those concerning the children (the remaining applicants) were not signed. the decisions were written in lithuanian and it was not indicated on them whether they had been translated into russian. the court has not been informed if a similar report was drawn up with regard to the first applicant and the other two children. the applicants’ stay in belarus was legal until 10 july 2017. in december 2017 a summons was delivered to the first applicant in belarus. he went to a police station there and was told that all the applicants had to leave belarus. they returned to russia at the end of december 2017. soon afterwards the first applicant was detained. in january 2018 the second applicant and the remaining applicants went to belarus again and managed to submit asylum applications on the polish border. they were admitted to a refugee reception centre in poland to await the decision on their asylum applications. in february 2018 the first applicant was released from detention in russia. he submitted that he had not known where he had been held and that he had been beaten up by the staff at the detention facility.
the applicant was born in 1953 and lives in vilnius. according to the most recent information available to the court, the exact plot of land he had owned was 6.0961 hectares. it appears that they did so following an application lodged by the applicant to have her right to a plot of land of 0.32 hectares transferred from vilnius to the vilnius region. it was indicated in the decision that her rights to the remaining 0.2884 hectares would be restored later. on 26 february 2018 the nls held a meeting to consider the location where the applicant had chosen four plots of land. it appears that this request was the change of her initial wish as regards the form of restitution (see paragraph 8 above). on 27 june 2005 the vilnius county administration (“the vca”) restored the applicant’s property rights to 0.0973 hectares of her father’s land by transferring to her a plot of land in vilnius for the construction of an individual house. on 10 february 2006 the vca restored the applicant’s property rights to 0.0544 hectares of her father’s land by transferring to her eleven plots of land in the former pylimėliai village. on 2 may 2012 the applicant informed the authorities that she would not accept monetary compensation as a form of restitution and that she wanted to restore her property rights to her father’s land in natura. she also asked what actions she had to take in order to receive the land. on 19 july 2016 the nls restored the applicant’s property rights to 0.0042 hectares of land by returning to her in natura four plots of land measuring 0.0042 hectares in total. on 4 november 2004 the vilnius regional administrative court examined a claim lodged by the applicant that the vca had been protracting the adoption of a decision on the restoration of her property rights in vilnius. she asked the court to oblige the vca to return to her 0.7730 hectares of land. on 11 october 2005 the supreme administrative court upheld the first-instance decision. the court held that the applicant had submitted several requests in 2006 asking the vca to proceed with the restoration of her property rights; however, the latter had refused to act. moreover, the authorities’ decision of 19 may 2006 (see paragraph 10 above) had remained unenforced. it was explained to the applicant that several measures had yet to be carried out in order to proceed. the court held that the applicant had to be included on the list of citizens wishing to receive land in didžioji riešė, but that due to the authorities’ inactivity, she had not been included on the list. as regards compensation, the court awarded the applicant eur 579 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. on 14 june 2010 the supreme administrative court found that the first-instance court had made some mistakes in calculating the time-limits for submission of a claim, and remitted the case for fresh examination. on 8 december 2011 the vilnius regional administrative court carried out a fresh examination of the applicant’s complaint (see paragraph 26 above). the court stated that 5.44 ares of land had been returned to the applicant in natura in total and that the applicant’s property rights to 0.6223 hectares of her father’s land had not been restored. nor could it order the vca to transfer 1.72 hectares of land in the vilnius region because the plot of land the applicant had indicated belonged to someone else. however, she had received a plot of land measuring 0.0973 hectares. she had received 0.5124 hectares in 2001 (see paragraph 9 above). in 2001 she had applied for the restoration of her property rights to 0.2 hectares of land in vilnius (see paragraph 16 above), and in 2003 she had asked for the remaining land to be returned in kind (see paragraph 17 above). as regards the plot for the construction of an individual house, the court held that a decision to restore the applicant’s property rights to 0.0937 hectares of land had been issued in 2005 and had not been challenged. in the court’s opinion, the authorities had not acted unlawfully and there were no grounds for awarding the applicant compensation. the applicant appealed against the first-instance decision and on 7 april 2015 the supreme administrative court decided to reopen the case for examination on the merits in order to receive some additional documents. on 19 june 2015 the supreme administrative court upheld the first‑instance decision.
the applicant was born in 1983 and lives in bucharest. according to a police report drawn up on 21 june 2005, the police division responsible for fighting organised crime and drug trafficking (“the police”) received information from an undisclosed source that an individual called “ursu-degweed” was a member of a network of dealers that was trafficking drugs in constanţa. the police initiated an investigation of their own motion. at the time of the events, the applicant was a student; d. was an acquaintance of the applicant, studying at the same university. d. called the applicant and asked him to provide her with some drugs. she informed him that a common friend, l., could help him to find a dealer, set the price for the drugs and sent the money by mail (postal order) on 23 june 2005. on 25 june 2005 the applicant called d. and set up a meeting at the constanţa railway station for the same day. the applicant was accompanied by three friends. the applicant also stated that d. had called and had asked him to buy twenty ecstasy tablets for her. she had sent the money for the drugs by post and had informed him that a common friend, l., could help him to find a dealer. l. had given him the number of a dealer, b., who had sold him seventeen tablets. he had received two tablets as a gift; he had kept one for himself and had given the other one in exchange for the cannabis resin, found in his possession at the search. he intended to spend his holidays in constanţa with his friends at d.’s invitation. d. had also promised to offer him accommodation. the applicant maintained his allegations in a statement given in the presence of two lawyers of his choice on 19 july 2005. he added that he had accepted to provide d. with the ecstasy tablets in the hope of having an intimate relationship with her during his stay in constanţa. several hearings were held before the constanţa county court. the applicant denied his involvement in drug trafficking and claimed that he had been entrapped by the police. on 5 june 2007 the constanţa county court convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to one and a half years’ imprisonment suspended on probation. the court dismissed his allegations that he had been entrapped. it confined itself in noting that the activity of the informer, d., had been lawful, without referring to the question whether she had been authorised to act as an undercover agent. the activity performed by the undercover informer was in line with law no. in convicting the applicant, it relied on his own statements, corroborated by the statements made by the friends who had accompanied him on his trip to constanţa on 25 june 2005, as well as on reports produced by the undercover agent and the police following the police operation organised on 25 june 2005 when the applicant had been caught in the act of committing a crime. the applicant appealed against the judgment of 5 june 2007. his lawyers reiterated that he had been entrapped by the police and that d. should be heard by the court. on 22 october 2008 the constanţa court of appeal noted that d. had never given evidence as a witness before the investigating authorities and that her name had only been mentioned in the reports drafted by them. on 24 october 2008 the court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the county court’s findings. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, reiterating his complaints. he claimed that he had been unduly incited by d. to commit the offence of which he had been found guilty and that throughout the proceedings he had not had an opportunity to have her questioned. it upheld the reasoning of the two lower courts.
the applicants were born in 1951 and 1948 respectively and live in makiyivka. b.’s car collided with another car being driven by br., who sustained serious bodily injuries and was taken to hospital. on the same day the makiyivka town police inspected the scene of the accident and questioned m., who was br. ’s passenger at the time of the accident. on 4 and 5 february 2002 forensic medical experts identified the injuries on the applicants’ son’s body and noted that there was ethyl alcohol in his blood and urine. between 5 february and 8 april 2002 the police conducted technical vehicular examinations and questioned br., the applicants, and several other witnesses. ’s car, which was moving in the opposite direction. the expert therefore concluded that the applicants’ son had contravened traffic rules and thus caused the road accident. the police also conducted several on-site accident reconstructions, questioned witnesses, and took other investigative measures. the investigating authorities found that the surviving driver, br., had previously been employed in a police security company, but that he had resigned before the accident happened. in the course of the above investigations, on 4 november 2003 the chief department of investigations at the ministry of internal affairs issued instructions as to the manner in which the case was to be investigated. ’s car had not been seized; the circumstances of the accident had not been noted carefully; and the witnesses had not been identified. on 2 july, 4 september and 29 october 2004 the criminal case was terminated because the investigators considered that it had been the applicants’ son who had contravened traffic rules and caused the accident resulting in his own death. numerous investigating instructions were given. between 2005 and 2007 the investigators ordered two more technical expert examinations and a vehicular trace examination, three medical forensic expert examinations of the applicants’ son’s body, and a medical forensic examination of br. on 5 november 2007 the investigator ordered a new technical expert examination, which was completed on 19 june 2008. the applicants objected to the grounds on which the case had been terminated, because their son had not been exonerated. on 29 september 2009 the investigator asked the gornyanskyy district court of makiyivka (“the district court”) to close the criminal case concerning the traffic accident in which the applicants’ son had died. in particular, the investigator was instructed to prepare a bill of indictment. on 3 september 2010 the investigator closed the criminal case by his own decision, on the grounds that the person responsible for the accident had died. that decision was quashed on 3 december 2010 by a supervising prosecutor for failure to follow the court’s instruction of 23 june 2010. on 28 january 2011 the investigator referred the case to the district court for a further decision on discontinuing the proceedings. the applicants appealed, arguing that the investigation had not been thorough and that the available evidence had been contradictory. on 24 april 2012 the donetsk regional court of appeal quashed the decision of 31 january 2012 as unlawful, finding that the first-instance court should carry out a full examination of the case and give judgment, either finding the applicants’ son guilty or acquitting him. on 26 december 2013 the district court found the applicants’ son guilty of causing a traffic accident, but the sentence was not imposed owing to his death. on 7 april 2014 the donetsk regional court of appeal quashed the above judgment, finding that the first-instance court had violated the applicants’ right to defence, and remitted the case for a fresh examination by the same court. ukrainian government forces launched a military anti-terrorist operation against them.
the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants are siblings who were born in 1949, 1944, 1947, 1952, 1955 and 1954 respectively and live in vilnius. the seventh applicant is the first applicant’s daughter; she was born in 1968 and also lives in vilnius. in 1991 the fifth applicant applied for restoration of his property rights to his late father’s land, which had been nationalised by the soviet regime. in that application he indicated that the first, second, third, fourth and sixth applicants, as well as their mother, p.m., and brother, n.m., were also possible candidates to have their property rights to that land restored. by giving them all joint ownership of 5.80 hectares of agricultural land and 3.20 hectares of forest in naujakiemis, an area in the vilnius city municipality. had died by then, the applicants inherited their share of the land. however, final sale agreements were not concluded and the seventh applicant did not become the owner of the plots. on 29 august 2008 the prosecutor of the vilnius region (hereinafter “the prosecutor”) lodged a claim with the vilnius regional court, seeking to have the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants’ property rights to the nine hectares given to them annulled. the prosecutor submitted that the two plots given to the applicants were covered by forest which, being situated within a city, was considered a forest of national importance and could therefore only be owned by the state (see the relevant domestic law cited in beinarovič and others v. lithuania, nos. 70520/10 and 2 others, §§ 86-89, 12 june 2018). according to the information provided by the prosecutor, forests of national importance covered the entire plot of 3.20 hectares, as well as 1.37 hectares of the other plot (see paragraph 7 above). in view of the circumstances, the vca’s decision had to be declared unlawful and its effects annulled. the prosecutor asked that after annulling the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants’ property rights to the two plots, their preliminary agreements with the seventh applicant (see paragraph 8 above) also be annulled. the applicants and the vca disputed the prosecutor’s claim. however, on 1 september 2009 the vilnius regional court allowed the claim. 89-91) and therefore the vca’s decision had to be annulled. the applicants and the vca lodged appeals against that decision. however, on 22 april 2010 the court of appeal dismissed the appeals and upheld the lower court’s decision in its entirety. the applicants were informed of the forms of restitution provided for by the domestic law (ibid., § 92) and asked to inform the authorities of their preferred form of restitution. on 8 and 30 may 2012 the first applicant sent letters to the nls on behalf of all the aforementioned applicants, asking that land in the original location which was not covered by forest be returned to them. 92) and to inform the authorities of their choice. it is unclear whether the applicants replied to that letter. on 19 august 2012 the second applicant died (see paragraph 4 above). the third applicant was issued with a certificate of inheritance with respect to the second applicant’s estate on 12 december 2012. on 19 february 2015 the nls approved a list of candidates to receive plots of land in several areas around vilnius, including naujakiemis. the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants were included in that list as candidates to receive two plots measuring a total of 4.4115 hectares. the decisions stated that the rights to the remaining 4.5885 hectares would be restored at a later date. on 28 august 2017 the nls adopted decisions to restore the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants’ property rights to the remaining 4.5885 hectares by means of monetary compensation of eur 5,307, corresponding to the indexed value of the land (that is to say, the value established by relevant public authorities).

2 7. the government further submitted that from 21 october to 11 november 2009, from 14 to 18 december 2013, and from 5 october to 26 december 2016 the applicant had been detained in correctional colony no. according to the applicant, the inmates are housed in double or single cells. the double cells measure approximately 18 m² and the single ones approximately 4 m². since 2007 the applicant has been assigned to different cells, his conditions of detention remaining unchanged. there is no water supply or sewage system on the colony premises. the inmates are given buckets, to compensate for the lack of a toilet, which they have to empty every morning in a cesspool located some two metres away from the recreation area. each day the inmates receive 10 litres of river water for their personal needs. they are allowed to take a shower once a week. the windows in the cells are covered with three layers of metal bars or screens. the food is not fresh, lacks variety and is of poor quality. the milk is often sour, and the fruit juices are diluted with water. the applicant has been housed in single cell no. the temperature in the cell does not exceed +120c during the winter. he is confined to his cell 22 hours a day and is entitled to one and a half hours’ outdoor exercise per day. the recreation area is divided into exercise yards measuring 7 m². the yards are covered with metal bars and screens. from july 2007 to december 2016 the applicant was not allowed to grow a beard or to have his hair longer than 0.5 cm. his hair was completely shaved off 2 to 4 times a month, and he had to shave his face 2 to 3 times a week. on an unspecified date the applicant complained to the prosecutor about the compulsory shaving. on 13 december 2013 the prosecutor replied that the compulsory shaving of the head and beard to which the applicant had been subjected had been unlawful, and that the prosecutor’s office had informed the administration of the correctional colony where the applicant was serving his prison sentence. the prosecutor also informed the applicant of his right to appeal either to a higher-ranking prosecutor or a court. it appears that the applicant took no further action.
the first applicant was born in 1937, the second applicant was born in 1930, the third applicant was born in 1934, the fourth applicant was born in 1945, the fifth applicant was born in 1930, the sixth applicant was born in 1954, the seventh applicant was born in 1926 and the eighth applicant was born in 1929. on various dates in 1991 the first, second, third, sixth, seventh and eighth applicants applied for restoration of their property rights to land which had been nationalised by the soviet regime. the fourth and fifth applicants did so in 2000. between 1995 and 2001 the administrative authorities or courts acknowledged that the first, second and third applicants had the right to have their property rights restored in respect of plots of land in gudeliai, and that the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth applicants had the right to have their property rights restored in respect of plots of land in kriaučiūnai. gudeliai and kriaučiūnai were former villages which had become part of the vilnius city municipality in 1996. since those forests were situated in a city, they were considered forests of national importance (valstybinės reikšmės miškai) and could therefore only be owned by the state (see the relevant domestic law cited in beinarovič and others v. lithuania, nos. 70520/10 and 2 others, §§ 86-89, 12 june 2018). as a result, the prosecutor argued that the vca’s decisions restoring the applicants’ property rights to such forests had to be declared unlawful and their effects annulled. in all of the applicants’ cases, the courts upheld the prosecutor’s claims. the final decisions were taken by the supreme administrative court between january and march 2010. by virtue of those decisions, the applicants’ property rights were annulled with respect to the following plots:
- the first, second and third applicants – 3.66 hectares;
- the fourth and fifth applicants – 0.52 hectares;
- the sixth and seventh applicants – 1.22 hectares;
- the eighth applicant – 1.2 hectares. it does not appear that they received any answers from those institutions. on 9 november 2011 the nls adopted a decision to restore the seventh applicant’s property rights by giving her 0.251 hectares of agricultural land. the applicants were informed of the forms of restitution provided for by the domestic law (ibid., § 92) and asked to inform the authorities of their preferred form of restitution. the applicants again received similar letters from the nls in july 2012 stating that there were 4,806 other candidates waiting to receive plots for the construction of an individual home in the vilnius city area, and thus the restitution process would take a long time. the decision stated that her rights to the remaining 0.7581 hectares would be restored later. the fourth applicant replied to that letter by stating that she had never agreed to be given land in that area, and asked the nls to stop any preparation in that regard. in august 2012 all the applicants sent letters to the nls in which they asked, inter alia, to be allocated plots of land for the construction of individual homes in vilnius in the order of priority, or to receive compensation in respect of the pecuniary damage which they had sustained as a result of the annulment of their property rights. the eighth applicant’s representative took part in that meeting and chose two plots. the fifth applicant took part in that meeting but did not choose any plots. on 17 june 2016 the nls informed the first, second and third applicants (or their heirs – see paragraphs 5 and 6 above) that their property rights to 3.66 hectares would be restored by monetary compensation of 2,646 euros (eur). however, the applicants did not agree to this proposal, and it was not carried out. in february 2017 the nls sent a letter to the seventh applicant, asking her to indicate the area in which she wished to receive a plot. the seventh applicant’s heir (see paragraph 3 above) replied that same month, indicating her choice. the fifth, sixth and eighth applicants took part in those meetings but did not choose any plots. on 9 january 2018 the nls held a meeting for candidates to receive plots of land in certain areas around vilnius, including kriaučiūnai. the seventh applicant’s heir (see paragraph 3 above) took part in that meeting but did not choose any plots. in january 2018 the first, second and third applicants (or their heirs – see paragraphs 5 and 6 above) sent a letter to the nls stating that they had expressed their wish for their property rights to be restored in kind and not by monetary compensation. at the date of the latest information provided to the court (12 october 2018), the applicants’ property rights had still not been restored with respect to the following plots:
- the first, second and third applicants – 3.66 hectares;
- the fourth and fifth applicants – 0.52 hectares;
- the sixth and seventh applicants – 1.22 hectares;

the applicant was born in 1968 and has been serving a prison sentence in lukiškės remand prison since 16 january 2002. on 16 may 2014 the applicant lodged a civil claim against the state, alleging that he was being detained in overcrowded and unsanitary cells. he also complained that toilets were not properly partitioned from the rest of the cells and thus the prison staff could see him use the toilet. he submitted that his health had deteriorated as a result of the inappropriate conditions of his detention and claimed 450,000 lithuanian litai (ltl, approximately 130,300 euros (eur)) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. on 19 january 2015 the vilnius regional administrative court allowed the applicant’s claim in part. it firstly held that the time-limit for claiming damages was three years after the damage arose, and accordingly dismissed the part of the applicant’s claim concerning the period before 16 may 2011 as time-barred. on the basis of documents provided by the prison administration, the court found that from 16 may 2011 to 15 may 2014 the applicant had spent 1,082 days in lukiškės remand prison. during that period, for thirteen days and one afternoon he had had 3.24 sq. m of personal space and on one afternoon he had had 2.65 sq. m of personal space, in breach of the domestic standard of 3.6 sq. m. for the remaining time the personal space available to him was found to be in compliance with the requirement of 3.6 sq. the court also quoted the report of the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (“the cpt”) on its visit to lithuania in 2012. according to that report, nearly all the inmates in lukiškės remand prison were confined to their cells for twenty-three hours per day, with no out-of-cell activities other than outdoor exercise lasting one hour in small and dilapidated yards (see paragraph 13 below). the court noted that the prison administration had not provided any evidence that the situation in the prison had changed. furthermore, the court ruled that toilets had not been partitioned from the rest of the cells in the manner required by relevant domestic regulations. it stated that, in accordance with accepted social norms, inability to use the toilet in private was degrading and humiliating to the individual. the court considered that the applicant had not proved that his health had deteriorated as a result of the conditions of his detention. it awarded the applicant eur 80 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, taking into account the “scope, intensity and duration” of the violation of his rights and the economic conditions in the country. the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision, arguing that the first-instance court had erred by dismissing part of his claim as time-barred, that the conditions in lukiškės remand prison had not improved and that his health had deteriorated because of them. on 10 november 2015 the supreme administrative court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance court’s decision in its entirety.

the applicant was born in 1972 and lives in i̇zmir. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents submitted by them, may be summarised as follows. the applicant and his brother sell building materials. the police officers then told him that he had been driving erratically and asked him to get out of the vehicle. the police officers then became agitated and started hitting the applicant’s brother. then one of the police officers put his fingers in the applicant’s nostrils and pulled him up and the applicant tried to push that police officer away. the applicant then heard one of the police officers cocking his pistol. at that moment, one of the police officers, c.u., fired three rounds towards the applicant. although the applicant’s brother asked the officers to take the applicant to a hospital, they did not listen to him. instead, the applicant and his brother were taken to a police station, where they were placed in custody. the applicant’s brother had shouted and asked the custody officers to take his brother to a hospital. the applicant was subsequently taken to the accident and emergency ward of a hospital, where he underwent surgery. it was also stated in a medical report that his injury would prevent him from working for a period of forty‑five days. three neurosurgeons who examined the applicant stated in their report of 11 december 2009 that they had observed atrophy (wasting away of the muscle) of the applicant’s thigh muscles and sensory loss on the front of the thighs. on 22 may 2008 a prosecutor filed an indictment with the i̇zmir criminal court of first instance and charged officer c.u. with the offence of intentionally causing a life-threatening injury. the same day the prosecutor also decided not to bring any proceedings against officer c.u. could be reclassified as “attempted murder”, and forwarded the case file to the i̇zmir assize court, which had jurisdiction to deal with such offences. in the course of the investigation and the trial, officer c.u. the forensic medicine institute concluded that the applicant had not been shot at close range. contrary to what was claimed by officer c.u., it also found that, although officer c.u. had not attempted to kill the applicant, he had used disproportionate force and caused an injury which had threatened the applicant’s life. to five months’ imprisonment but suspended the pronouncement of his conviction under article 231 of the criminal code of procedure (see “relevant domestic law” below). the objection was rejected by the second chamber of the i̇zmir assize court on 7 june 2010. the ministry of the interior appealed against the decision. on 21 april 2014 the supreme administrative court upheld the i̇zmir administrative court’s decision insofar as it concerned the pecuniary damage but quashed the part of the decision concerning the non-pecuniary damage because it considered that the applicant had also been partly responsible for the incident. the case file was returned to the i̇zmir administrative court which decided on 24 february 2016 to award the applicant try 20,000 (approximately eur 6,200 at the time) plus statutory interest in respect of non-pecuniary damage. the appeal lodged by the applicant against this finding is currently pending.
the applicant was born in 1940 and lives in pervomayskiy, the krasnodar region. in 1967-95 the applicant worked in the far north of russia. the program was adopted on 10 july 1995 by the government of russia, in accordance with the decree of the president of the russian federation no. it provided, inter alia, for construction of housing for persons wishing to resettle from the far north to various russian regions. the program was financed by the federal and regional budgets. and the state unitary enterprise “united direction for construction of the kamchatka region” (the gup) concluded a co‑operation agreement. undertook to build an apartment block in inzhavino of the tambov region, provide assistance with residence registration and compensate 30 per cent of the flats’ price in case they were occupied. the gup undertook to pay for the housing. the gup undertook to provide the applicant with the flat and to transfer it to the applicant’s ownership once it was accepted for exploitation, and the applicant was to pay the price of the flat. built the flats and transferred them to the gup, which was acting for the administration of the kamchatka region, to be registered as the administration’s property. on 22 june 2001 the expert examination was ordered by the court, and in december 2001 the expert report was submitted to the court. on 13 february 2002 the inzhavinskiy district court of the tambov region (“the district court”) rejected the claim. on 15 july 2002 the district court again rejected the claim. it quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case for a new examination. on 11 september 2002 the district court allowed the claim in part and ordered the defendant to pay the applicant an amount of money. on 23 october 2002 the regional court granted the applicant’s appeal and found that the lower court had raised and examined issues falling outside the scope of the applicant’s claims. on 22 july 2003 the district court supplemented its judgment of 20 june 2003. the applicant applied for supervisory review proceedings. on 20 april 2006 the presidium of the regional court granted his request, quashed the judgments of 5 may and 27 july 2005 as issued in breach of procedural and substantive law, and ordered that the case be re‑examined by the first-instance court. the applicant modified the scope of the claims. by a judgment of 17 july 2006 the district court allowed the claim in part. it established that the flat built for the applicant by the company did not comply with the sanitary and technical requirements. on 20 december 2006 the regional court upheld the judgment of 17 july 2006. on the same date the enforcement proceedings were opened. however, the money returned to the company as the account had been closed in the meantime. on 6 february 2009 the applicant provided the requested information. the company, incorporated as a unitary enterprise at the material time, had “the right of economic control” (право хозяйственного ведения) over the assets allocated to it by the administration in order to carry out its statutory activities. it appears that at the material time the gup was involved in the construction of socially-important objects in the kamchatka region. it used to be a client for construction, major overhaul and reconstruction, represented the regional administration in the respective transactions and was in receipt of the relevant budgetary funds. since august 2004 the company was “a regional state client” (областной государственный заказчик) in respect of the housing subsidies’ allocation for citizens leaving the far north areas.
the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in chernivtsi. in october 2002 the zalishchytskyy local court of ternopil region issued a writ of enforcement in a case against a private company, u. the parties did not provide any documents related to the proceedings against company u. 7. under that writ in march 2005 the state bailiffs’ service seized, among other property items which belonged to company u., an industrial construction (a 2,000 sq. meters metallic shed) of a declared worth of 98,000 ukrainian hryvnas (uah) equivalent at the material time to around 13,950 euros (eur). in december 2005 the state bailiffs’ service concluded an agreement with a private company m. to hold an auction in order to sell the seized shed. on 3 april 2006 the applicant participated in this auction and bought the above construction for uah 26,000 (at the material time around eur 4,200). the applicant submitted copies of the bills according to which he had paid the above amount in full. on 10 august 2006 the applicant sold the shed to a private person t. for uah 50,000. on an unidentified date, a third person s. lodged an administrative claim against the bailiffs and the applicant seeking to declare the bailiff’s seizure and sale of the shed unlawful as in fact it belonged to him. in view of this claim, in october 2006 the sales contract between the applicant and t. was annulled by the parties and the applicant returned the money to t. on 23 november 2006 the zalishchytskyy local court of ternopil region found that the shed belonged to s. and thus the bailiffs had unlawfully seized and sold it. there is no information as to whether there was an appeal against this decision. in parallel, criminal proceedings for abuse of office were initiated against bailiff d. in charge of the respective enforcement proceedings. on 16 march 2007 the applicant was given victim status in these proceedings. in the relevant resolution it was noted that the applicant sustained pecuniary damage and had not been reimbursed the money he had paid at the auction. the amount of the damage aggravated the charges against the bailiff. on 2 august 2007 the zalishchytskyy local court convicted the bailiff as charged. in the text of the sentence the applicant is referred to as a witness. apparently, no civil claim was submitted by the applicant in the course of these criminal proceedings. there is no information whether there was an appeal against this sentence. in may 2008 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against the bailiffs’ service and the local department of the state treasury claiming compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. the applicant referred to provisions on compensation of damage of the civil code of ukraine, in particular article 1174, and to article 11 of the law of ukraine “on the state bailiffs’ service” according to which damage caused to an individual by actions or omissions of a state official, in particular, by a bailiff during enforcement proceedings, had to be compensated by the state (see paragraphs 19 and 21 below). on 1 december 2008 the sadgirskyy district court of chernivtsi found for the applicant based on the above legislative provisions. it awarded the applicant uah 60,262 (equivalent to around eur 6,884) which comprised: i) cost of the shed (uah 26,000); ii) bank commission (uah 262); iii) lost income (uah 24,000) and iv) non-pecuniary damages (uah 10,000). following the defendant’s appeal, on 12 march 2009 the chernivtsi regional court of appeal quashed this decision and rejected the applicant’s claims as unsubstantiated. the court held that since the applicant was not a party to the enforcement proceedings in the case against company u. he could not claim damages from the bailiffs under article 11 of the law of ukraine “on the state bailiffs’ service” (see paragraph 21 below). the court of appeal did not examine the applicability of the civil code provisions, relied upon by the applicant and the local court. the court further noted that the applicant failed to demonstrate that the shed had been in fact seized from him without any compensation, or that the sales contract with company m. in charge of the auction had been dissolved. the applicant appealed in cassation stating that he no longer owned or used the shed as its seizure and sale were found unlawful by the court decision of 23 november 2006 (see paragraph 11 above) and it had been returned to s. he noted that the money he paid at the auction had not been reimbursed. to support his claim the applicant reiterated again the civil code provisions. on 23 july 2009 the supreme court of ukraine refused to open cassation proceedings finding the cassation appeal ill-founded.
the applicant was born in 1976 and is detained in poarta albă prison. on the same day the prosecutor’s office attached to the high court of cassation and justice authorised the police division responsible for combatting organised crime and drug trafficking to use an undercover agent in order to identify members of the network. the authorisation for the operation was extended three times, on 18 august, 17 september and 16 october 2007 respectively. the meetings between the applicant and the undercover agent were recorded. he sold to the undercover agent on that occasion 1.59 grams of cannabis, 0.23 grams of hashish and a cigarette containing cannabis. at the undercover agent’s request they met again on 25 july 2007. the undercover agent asked for more drugs. he subsequently bought two ecstasy pills from c.b.s. and on 27 july 2007 he met the undercover agent and sold him the pills. and handed them over to the undercover agent on 2 august 2007. the applicant was immediately remanded in police custody. the applicant gave a statement in the presence of a lawyer appointed on his behalf. he pleaded guilty to the accusation of drug trafficking. he stated that initially he had only been a user (but not a seller) of drugs. in 2003 he had decided to stop using drugs. on several occasions he had gathered the cannabis and sold it to different buyers. in that file another undercover agent and his collaborator were authorised to operate. he partly maintained the statement that he had given earlier, during the criminal investigation. on 14 may 2008 the county court heard evidence from the undercover agent, in the presence of the applicant who was assisted by his lawyer. the undercover agent stated that he had been introduced to the applicant by a drug user, who had informed him that the applicant had been trying to find buyers for hashish and cannabis. he also stated that it had been the applicant who had proposed that he obtain a large quantity of ecstasy pills for him. he had merely called the applicant several times and asked him to sell him different drugs. accordingly, the court concluded that the use of the undercover agent in the case had been lawful. had been caught red-handed with 102 ecstasy pills when taking delivery of a parcel received by post. he also contended that he had merely been a drug user and not a drug dealer. it reduced the applicant’s sentence to four years’ imprisonment, suspended, and placed him on probation. the applicant submitted that – as was clear from the transcripts of the recorded phone conversations – all the drug transactions had taken place at the initiative of the undercover agent. he argued that prior to 19 july 2007, when he had been approached by the latter (see paragraph 10 above), he had not been known as a drug dealer. he also claimed that even though he had been under police surveillance between july and november 2007, no buyer other than the undercover agent had been identified. it considered the applicant’s plea of entrapment to be unfounded.
the applicant was born in 1974 in khabarovsk and is serving a life sentence in the sverdlovsk region. from 25 may 2012 to 10 april 2014 the applicant was held in penal colony ik-56 in the sverdlovsk region. he was able to have five short visits in 2013 and one short visit in 2014. on 15 july 2013 the applicant asked the governor to allow him a short meeting with four adult relatives, his mother, sister and two cousins. he also asked for the meeting to be held without a glass partition between him and his visitors or the presence of a prison officer. the governor signed his decision on the petition: “rejected. not allowed under the code of execution of sentences”. from 15 may to 16 july 2014 the applicant was transferred to remand prison sizo-1 in khabarovsk – where his family still lived – to take part in another investigation. on the day after his arrival at the prison, he asked the prison governor to authorise a short meeting with four family members – his sister, two cousins and aunt – without a physical partition between him and the visitors or the presence of prison officers. by a letter of 21 may 2014, the governor rejected his request. he pointed out that, pursuant to section 18 of the pre‑trial detention act, visits are subject to written authorisation from the official or authority in charge of the criminal case. furthermore, the rules of internal order in remand prisons required that visiting rooms be equipped with a physical partition and that visits be supervised by a prison officer. on 3 june 2014 the applicant asked the governor to authorise a long meeting with his mother and sister. he relied on article 89 of the code of execution of sentences (ces) and emphasised that the remand prison was equipped with rooms for long-stay visits which could be used by convicted prisoners serving their sentence in that prison. three days later the governor replied that the applicable law did not make a provision for long-stay visits in respect of remand prisoners. he referred the applicant to article 77.1 of the ces. the applicant subsequently asked the authorities in charge of the criminal case to authorise short visits from his family members. on 11 june and 1 august 2014 the investigator and the deputy head of the investigations department, respectively, rejected his request. they informed the applicant that “the authorities in charge of the investigation were not preventing [him] from having short visits from his family members as long as it did not contradict russian law, including the code of execution of sentences”. the applicant challenged the restrictions on family visits before a court of general jurisdiction. according to the information from the government, all of his challenges were dismissed as unfounded. according to a certificate issued by the governor on 27 april 2017, the applicant did not have any short or long-stay visits during his time in the khabarovsk remand prison.
the first applicant was born in 1978 and lives in washington dc, the united states of america (hereafter “the usa”). x, the second applicant, was born in 1998 and lives in moscow. the first applicant lodged the application on his own behalf and on behalf of his daughter, who was underage at the material time. until 2008 the first applicant had been living in moscow together with his wife e. and their daughter, x. 8. the first applicant returned to moscow in march 2009. however, b. and s. refused to take x to moscow. during the following months the first applicant applied to the russian consulate in uzbekistan, to the russian embassy in uzbekistan and to the russian ministry of international affairs for assistance in recovering his daughter. b. had told the officials that the first applicant had not visited his daughter. x told them that she missed her father but preferred to live with her grandparents. if b. and s. prevented him, he should apply to an uzbek court. he had a comfortable income and a spacious flat. he had bought medical insurance for x and had enrolled her in the best school in the area where he lived. on the same day the moscow childcare authority questioned b.’s representative, who stated that the first applicant lived in the usa, often travelled for work and could not therefore take care of his daughter. they were taking good care of their granddaughter and supported her financially because her father did not pay any child maintenance. x’s return to her father against her will would traumatise her. the next hearing was scheduled for 24 january 2011. it found that, given that the parents had priority rights over anyone else in raising their children, x should be returned to her father. on 2 february 2011 the applicant appealed against the decision to discontinue the proceedings. on 28 april 2011 the cheremushinskiy district court resumed the proceedings and scheduled the next hearing for 27 may 2011. on 20 july 2011 the russian ministry of justice forwarded the request to their uzbek colleagues. on 24 october 2011 the ulugbekskiy district court of tashkent questioned x. assisted by a specialist from the childcare authorities and by her guardian, s., x stated that her grandparents did not prevent her from contacting her father. they could not therefore attend the hearing. on 27 february 2012 the childcare authority issued a new opinion on the case. it found that x should remain with her grandparents. on 27 february 2012 the cheremushinskiy district court rejected the first applicant’s request for x to be returned to him. on 26 march 2012 the first applicant lodged appeal submissions. her social network account had been inactive since january 2009. by contrast, he had had the same telephone number and email address for at least ten years and x knew them. it had sent two requests for assistance to a competent russian court, asking it to collect the first applicant’s submissions; the russian court had however replied that it was impossible to obtain the first applicant’s submissions because he did not live at his registered place of residence. the first applicant had not taken part in her upbringing and had not supported her financially.
the applicant was born in 1950 and, at the time of the last communication from him to the court, was detained in torez correctional colony. the applicant, represented by a lawyer, stood trial before the kerch court on charges of engaging in sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter, a. (born in 1999), over the period between march 2006 and april 2007. the applicant denied the charges, asserting that he may have broken a.’s hymen by accident while bathing her. on 27 july 2007 the trial court found the applicant guilty of rape and sentenced him to eleven years’ imprisonment. the judgment was based, in particular, on
(i) the victim’s statements made at the pre-trial stage;
(ii) the statements of a number of witnesses (comprising nannies, a classmate and a psychologist) made during the court hearings, who had reported incriminating statements that a. had made to them. witness k. had testified that, in the relevant period, she had had sexual relations with the applicant;
(iii) the conclusions of experts who had examined the applicant and the victim. the experts had concluded that the victim’s hymen had been broken and it was unlikely that that had been caused by unintentional actions; the victim and the applicant both had a fungal infection on their genitalia; the examination of the applicant’s genitalia had not revealed any obstacle to his having sexual relations; the victim suffered from a light mental retardation and the applicant did not suffer from any psychiatric illness. according to the applicant, the trial court had refused to order an additional expert examination to determine whether, because of any disease of his “internal sexual organs”, he had been unable to engage in normal sexual intercourse at the relevant time. on 11 september 2007 the crimea court of appeal upheld the applicant’s conviction. the applicant lodged an appeal in cassation with the supreme court. he argued that there had been insufficient evidence of his guilt. the appeal contained the following statement:
“the court’s conclusion as to my guilt is based only on indirect evidence and on the statement of a minor [a.], made in the course of the pre-trial investigation and who, according to a psychiatric expert’s analysis, was suffering from mental retardation” (вывод суда о моей виновности сделан судом только на основании косвенных доказательств, а так же [sic] на показаниях малолетней [a.], которые она дала на досудебном следствии, и которая, согласно заключению судебно-психиатрической экспертизы, страдает умственной отсталостью). the applicant submitted that the breaking of a.’s hymen was explained by the fact that he had accidentally penetrated her with his finger while bathing her. however, even if such a penetration had been intentional, it would not have constituted the offence of rape. the applicant further complained of the trial court’s refusal to order an additional expert examination to determine whether he had any diseases of his “internal sexual organs” which would have prevented him from sustaining an erection and engaging in sexual intercourse. the applicant asked the supreme court to reclassify his actions as “abuse of a minor” (розбещення неповнолітніх), a lesser offence than rape, and to impose a non-custodial sentence. on 9 june 2008 the supreme court refused to consider the case in cassation and upheld the lower courts’ findings. on 27 november 2008 the court’s registry asked the applicant to provide copies of his appeal, his appeal in cassation and the decision of the supreme court in his case, to supplement his application. he accordingly requested those documents from the trial court, the court of appeal and the supreme court. on 19 january 2009 the court of appeal advised the applicant that he needed to address his request for the copies to the trial court. on 26 january 2009 the trial court informed the applicant that it was not empowered to send him the requested copies. on 28 january 2009 the supreme court informed the applicant that it was not the court’s practice to issue copies of appeals in cassation or of its decisions.
the applicant was born in 1983 and currently lives in paris. she was then taken to a police station to have her identity verified. in the meantime she was dismissed by her employer because of her unauthorised absence from work. he also found a flat for her, where he visited her on several occasions. in the course of the examination the explosives were destroyed. the police also found several photographs of an escalator in the okhotniy ryad shopping centre in the centre of moscow. the next day an investigator granted the motion in the part concerning the questioning of a., questioned him and informed the applicant about the decision on her motion. on 2 december 2004 the applicant received a copy of the case file for review. on 22 december 2004 the applicant’s trial began before the city court. the applicant was represented by two lawyers of her own choosing, u. and s. 27. in their conversations the applicant had glorified terrorism and had approved of suicide bombings and the methods and targets of the chechen insurgents. on 3 march 2004 the applicant had told v. and ku. asked by the prosecutor to explain her contradictory statements, v. stated that she was not sure whether the applicant had really attended a terrorist training camp. during her cross-examination at trial, ku. in particular, the applicant had taken photographs of the escalator and the people on it. they had simply wanted to reside together to pray, read and live free from parental supervision. further stated that the applicant’s acquaintance, a., was a policeman and that he had paid for the flat where the three of them had lived. she denied having given her pre-trial statements under pressure. the policemen took her to a police station. p. further explained that he had stopped the applicant “because it had been unclear where she had been going to”, because she had “resembled a girl from a wanted persons notice”, and because she was “a person of caucasian ethnicity [that is to say from the north caucasus region]”. about the manner in which the attesting witnesses were chosen. she further stated that the six photographs of the escalator that had been seized from her flat had been taken by her. however, she had been photographing people at random in the shopping centre, rather than the escalator, and she had done so for recreational purposes. the applicant’s lawyer argued that her words had been misinterpreted and that there had been nothing in them demonstrating a link to any terrorist activity. immediately after viewing the videotape the applicant’s lawyer s. submitted oral motions to summon attesting witnesses b. and k. and police officer a. the relevant part of the trial records reads as follows:
“lawyer s.: i request to summon the attesting witnesses who were present during the personal search of murtazaliyeva, that is, b. and k., in order to determine the relevant circumstances [and] whether or not plastic explosives were planted. lawyer s.: i agree to the reading out of his statements. the records of the search of the applicant’s residence and her personal search;

the applicant was born in 1949 and lives in juodšiliai in the vilnius region. in 1991 the applicant’s mother applied for restoration of her property rights to land which had been nationalised by the soviet regime. as the applicant’s mother had died in 1995, the applicant was issued with a certificate of inheritance in respect of the plot on 13 march 2003. on 4 december 2008 the prosecutor of the vilnius region (hereinafter “the prosecutor”) lodged a claim with the vilnius regional court, seeking to have the applicant’s mother’s property rights to the six hectares given to her annulled. the prosecutor submitted that, according to the data provided by the state forest management service, 5.59 hectares of the plot was covered by forest. since that forest was situated in a city, it was considered a forest of national importance and could therefore only be owned by the state (see the relevant domestic law cited in beinarovič and others v. lithuania, nos. 70520/10 and 2 others, §§ 86-89, 12 june 2018). the applicant and the vca disputed the prosecutor’s claim. the applicant and the vca lodged appeals against that decision, arguing that the restoration of the applicant’s mother’s property rights had complied with the relevant legislation. the applicant also submitted that he was being deprived of his property without any compensation. however, on 1 june 2010 the court of appeal dismissed the appeals and upheld the lower court’s decision in its entirety. it is unclear whether he replied to this letter. on 24 july 2012 the applicant received another letter from the nls which stated that there was a possibility for the applicant to receive a plot of land for the construction of an individual home in the vilnius city area but as there were 4,806 other candidates waiting to receive plots in the area, the restitution process would take a long time. the applicant was asked to consider an alternative form of restitution, such as a plot of land in a rural area, a plot of land for the construction of an individual home in a different city, or monetary compensation (ibid., § he was also informed that there might be some vacant land in pagiriai, so if he wished to receive a plot in that area, his request would be considered when the land plan was being prepared. on 21 august 2012 the applicant sent a letter to the nls. in the applicant’s view, being put on the list with 4,806 other candidates and being made to wait for an undetermined period of time for restitution was unacceptable. if he could not be given such a plot, he wished to receive compensation of ltl 251,217. the applicant also stated that he would only be able to decide whether he wished to receive a plot in pagiriai after being presented with a plan of a specific plot. he stated that he did not wish to choose any other form of restitution. on 7 october 2013 the nls approved the list of candidates to receive plots of land in several areas around vilnius, including pagiriai. the applicant’s mother was included in that list as a candidate to receive six hectares of land. on 22 october 2013 the nls held a meeting in which candidates were offered plots in the relevant areas and the applicant took part in that meeting. according to the minutes of the meeting, which were approved by the nls, he stated that the question of the restoration of his property rights was pending before the european court of human rights, that he was dissatisfied with the available vacant land and that he refused to choose any plots (žemės sklypų nesirinko). on 22 april 2016 the nls held another meeting in which the applicant took part. according to the minutes of the meeting, which were approved by the nls and signed by the applicant, he asked to be shown the plots which had been offered to him at their location and not just on a plan. the applicant examined the land plan but did not make any decisions with regard to the available plots (jokių sprendimų nepriėmė), stating that he would “seek solutions from organisations of a higher instance”. he therefore “saw no possibility of choosing any plots” (žemės sklypų pasirinkimo galimybių nemato). he again stated that he had lodged an application with the european court of human rights and wished to receive that court’s decision  only then would he decide “what to do with the land which had not been returned to him”. at the date of the latest information provided to the court (13 february 2018), the applicant’s property rights to six hectares of land had still not been restored.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in komotini. m plot of farmland near komotini; one-half of a 127 sq. 12.785/2003 of 10 june 2008 the komotini court of first instance, on the basis of a next-of-kin certificate submitted by the applicant, approved the will presented before it. on 6 april 2010 the applicant accepted her husband’s estate by notarised deed. the treasury was notified and the applicant registered the property transferred to her with the komotini land registry, paying the corresponding registration fees. it does not appear from the case file that the applicant had to pay any inheritance tax on the property transferred to her. on 12 december 2009, meanwhile, the deceased’s two sisters had challenged the validity of the will before the rodopi court of first instance. they asserted a claim to three-quarters of the property bequeathed. under islamic law, where the deceased was survived by close relatives, the will only served to complement the intestate succession. the court emphasised that even if it should be inferred from section 5(2) of law no. the incompatibility in the present case had stemmed from interpreting the islamic law of succession in such a way as to deprive the persons concerned of some of their civil rights, against their wishes. the court added that although the application of sharia law was based, inter alia, on international law, and in particular on the combined effect of articles 42 and 45 of the treaty of lausanne, it should not result in the islamic law of succession being applied in such a way as to curtail the civil rights of greek muslims, because the aim of the treaty had not been to deprive the members of that minority of such rights, but to strengthen their protection. the court pointed out that a greek muslim contacting a notary in order to draw up a public will was exercising his right to dispose of his property, in anticipation of his death, under the same conditions as other greek citizens. upholding the claimants’ arguments would thus amount to introducing an unacceptable difference in treatment among greek nationals on the grounds of their religious beliefs. on 16 june 2010 the deceased’s sisters appealed against the aforementioned judgment. on 28 september 2011 the thrace court of appeal dismissed the appeal (judgment no. furthermore, the mufti had no jurisdiction over the testator’s wishes, which could not be circumscribed. 1862/2013 of 7 october 2013 and on the basis of a provision of international law, namely article 11 of the 1913 treaty of athens, and provisions of domestic law, namely section 4 of law no. 2345/1920 (enacted pursuant to the 1913 treaty of athens) and section 5(2) of law no. 1920/1991 the court of cassation allowed the appeal. the court of cassation remitted the case to the thrace court of appeal. it pointed out that the law applicable to the deceased’s estate had been sharia law, because the property bequeathed belonged to the “mulkia” category, and that consequently the public will at issue was devoid of legal effect because sharia law did not recognise any such institution. 1920/1991 and of article 45 of the treaty of lausanne. since an appeal on points of law was lodged against that judgment, it was not immediately enforceable. she put forward a number of grounds of appeal. 556/2017 of 6 april 2017 the court of cassation dismissed the appeal on points of law. it did not refer to the convention in its reasoning. as regards the applicant’s first ground of appeal, it declared it inadmissible, finding that it was based on the extent of the deceased’s religious sentiment as a muslim, a criterion that had no legal effect. as a result of the whole proceedings, the applicant was deprived of three-quarters of the property bequeathed. they submitted that the will was contrary to turkish public policy.
the applicant, a turkish national, was born in 1980 in neustadt/weinstraße (neustadt) and lives in speyer. he has a daughter of german nationality, born in 2009, who lives with her mother. the applicant’s parents had migrated to germany. after the death of his mother, the applicant lived and grew up, together with his sister, with his grandparents in neustadt. he was partly accommodated in a daytime clinic and attended a special needs school, from which he was expelled, without a school certificate, for physical violence against a teacher. since 1996 the applicant has repeatedly been convicted of criminal offences. on 20 july 2000 the same court convicted him on twenty counts of drug trafficking and sentenced him to a juvenile sentence of ten months, again suspended on probation. in august 2008 the sentence was again deferred and the applicant was again admitted to a specialist clinic for the purpose of receiving drug therapy. on 9 december 2010 the frankenthal regional court convicted him of drug trafficking and acquisition of drugs and sentenced him to four years and three months’ imprisonment. in may 2014, the clinic still considered the applicant’s risk of relapse to be significant. on 22 april 2003, the competent committee on legal affairs (hereafter - “the committee”) rejected the application for administrative review of the expulsion order. on 18 october 2003 the neustadt administrative court rejected the appeal. 1/80 of the eec/turkey association council of 19 september 1980 (see paragraph 30 below). moreover, the applicant could refer to exceptional life circumstances, in particular the violent death of his mother. it referred to the numerous previous criminal offences, in particular those after 14 january 2005, and concluded that the applicant posed a sufficiently significant risk to the public. the applicant applied for administrative review of that decision. on 4 june 2009, shortly after the applicant had acknowledged paternity of the child j. expected at that time, the city committee suspended the proceedings. the applicant’s daughter was born out of wedlock on 23 september 2009. as of that day, j. exercised sole custody rights. in the following weeks, the applicant lived with his daughter and j. in a common apartment, until he was taken into pre-trial custody in november 2009 (see paragraph 13 above). he was a chronic offender with a high potential for aggressive behaviour. the same was true for the relationship with his family of origin, in particular his sister. since he lacked the necessary vocational training, his prospects of finding a job were still rather slim. making explicit reference to article 8 of the convention and the court’s case-law, the administrative court established that the reasons at the heart of the expulsion were sufficient to justify it, even though the expulsion might cause hardship for the daughter, who did not live with the applicant. the applicant also lacked economic or social integration. he had never worked and essentially lived on social benefits. also, other oral communication in turkish had been established, for example two telephone calls with his father from prison. he would not be without support in turkey, even though the relationship with his father might be tense and other contact in turkey could only be established through his sister. on 25 march 2015 the rhineland-palatine administrative court of appeal rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal, endorsing the administrative court’s assessment, while also taking into account the developments that had taken place since. an attempt to deport the applicant on 9 october 2015 was unsuccessful, because the applicant did not possess a valid passport.
on 13 june 2006 an investigation was opened into an alleged robbery committed against d.g., an offence under article 178 § 2 (a) of the criminal code of georgia. was formally granted victim status and questioned in connection with the incident. on 14 june 2006 a photo identification parade was organised. it appears that later an investigator made a note on the identification record that the victim had identified the person on photo no. there was no explanation as to why there were contradictory notes. 2, and an order for his arrest was issued. on 15 june 2006, following the applicant’s arrest, an identification parade was organised. a personal search of the applicant and a subsequent search of his home did not reveal any unlawful items. a shop assistant who had witnessed the whole incident. he requested that the victim and the investigator be examined again before the second-instance court. in the meantime, the appeal court had allowed the applicant’s application for the investigator to be examined again. as he had noticed that mistake only after she had left the police station, he had made a note to that effect. the applicant was prescribed drug-based treatment and discharged on 4 november 2006 in a satisfactory condition. he underwent blood and urine tests there and was seen by various doctors, including an ophthalmologist. the ophthalmologist confirmed the applicant’s diagnosis of an acute cataract in his left eye and prescribed drug-based treatment. on 3 march 2007 the applicant was transferred back to the prison hospital, this time with an additional diagnosis that he had developed haziness of the vitreous body in his right eye. she claimed that he was suffering from a serious visual impairment of his left eye. 5, where the applicant was detained at the material time, yet no reply followed. in the period april-may 2007, acting at the request of the applicant’s lawyer, a private eye clinic called mzera eye clinic examined the applicant’s medical file and confirmed the diagnosis of a uveal cataract in his left eye. the expert recommended drug-based treatment followed by surgery, namely the implantation of an artificial lens. on 25 june 2007 his treating ophthalmologist requested that the prison hospital organise for an eye surgeon to see the applicant. it appears from the case file that, despite the above request, the applicant was not seen by an eye surgeon at that time. on 24 january 2008 the applicant was transferred to the prison hospital, where he stayed for almost two weeks. according to the entries made in his medical file, he regularly complained of a loss of vision in his left eye. on 2 may 2008 the applicant completed his treatment for tuberculosis. no entries were made in his file concerning his ophthalmological treatment at the material time. on 28 october 2008, relying on rule 39 of the rules of court, the applicant asked the court to indicate to the government that he should be transferred to a medical establishment where he could access appropriate medical examinations and treatment, and have an operation to prevent him from losing his eyesight. on 18 november 2008 the government submitted the applicant’s medical file to the court, and also gave an account of the treatment which he had been receiving in prison as of january 2007. on 24 march 2009 the applicant was released on probation.
the applicant was born in 1955 and lives in rustavi. on 6 may 2007 an investigation was opened into a murder. on 24 may 2007 an identification parade was carried out. the eyewitness to the crime identified the applicant’s son, g.t., was convicted of murder and sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment. on 28 january 2009 an appeal on points of law by g.t. was declared inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. while he was at those facilities, nor has the applicant suggested otherwise. he was examined by a duty doctor, who suspected tuberculosis. with tuberculosis, and recommended that he be transferred to a specialist facility. was placed in a facility in ksani for prisoners with tuberculosis. continued to have treatment under the dots programme. was resistant to the first-line drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis. was transferred to the prison hospital in view of a further deterioration in his health. the medical records relating to his time at that facility show that he was suffering from cachexia, and from early march 2009 onwards he complained that he was unable to walk. he continued to receive the previously prescribed anti-tuberculosis treatment with the first-line drugs pending the results of the second susceptibility test. on 24 april 2009 it was decided that g.t. on 19 may 2009 the investigative department of the ministry of prisons opened a preliminary investigation into premeditated murder. ’s treatment under the dots programme had been adequate. had died of a natural complication of his tuberculosis. on 19 november 2009 a prosecutor from the chief prosecutor’s office who was supervising the investigations carried out by the investigative department of the ministry of prisons forwarded the applicant’s appeal against the investigator’s refusal to grant her victim status to the director of that department, “for an appropriate response”. on 22 february 2010 the applicant was granted victim status. an undated document signed by the prosecutor instructed the investigator to question experts from the national centre for tuberculosis and lung disease and obtain records concerning g.t. on an unspecified date the investigator sent g.t. ’s medical file to the state regulation agency for medical activities to be assessed. his sister had allegedly met a doctor at rustavi prison no. ’s official diagnosis and had given him some strong drugs intended for her brother on the basis of an unsigned and undated prescription. on an unspecified date the investigation was reopened. it was closed again on 15 october 2010 after g.t. ’s sister’s allegations were manifestly ill-founded.
the applicant was born in 1984 and is currently serving a prison sentence in rubtsovsk, altai region. on 2 march 2011 the applicant was arrested. on an unspecified date he was charged with extortion and the murder of vos. on an unspecified date a trial by jury was opened in the applicant’s case in the altai regional court. on an unspecified date the jury returned a guilty verdict against the applicant and three other defendants. by a judgment dated 17 may 2012 the regional court sentenced the applicant to nineteen years’ imprisonment. on 6 september 2012 the supreme court of the russian federation quashed the verdict on appeal, in view of contradictory conclusions contained in the jury’s verdict, and remitted the matter to the trial court for fresh consideration. on 30 january 2013 the jury returned a guilty verdict in respect of the applicant and three other defendants. on 19 february 2013 juror v. made a statement addressed to the trial judge. vos’s mother, had repeatedly talked to the jurors during the adjournments. had informed the jurors that it was the second trial and that the applicant and other defendants had already been found guilty of her son’s murder. had also advised the jurors to check out the information concerning her son’s murder on the internet. v. had done so and, as a result, had been influenced by this information when finding the defendants guilty. it appears that the trial judge ordered an inquiry in response to v.’s allegations. submitted a written statement denying v.’s allegations. on 26 february 2013 jury foreperson g. signed a statement in which she indicated that she “had not been aware” of any instances of undue influence on the jury by ch. on 27 february 2013 the regional court sentenced the applicant to nineteen years’ imprisonment. on 28 february 2013 the trial judge asked the bailiffs’ service to conduct an inquiry in response to the statement made by juror v. 15. on 18 march 2013 the deputy head of the bailiffs’ service responded to the trial judge as follows:
“it follows from the reports submitted by the bailiffs ... and the bailiffs’ group supervisor that on the relevant dates the jurors were supervised by the bailiff ... while they were in the courtroom or in the jurors’ room. none of the jurors contacted [the bailiffs’ service] as regards the [jurors’] security or interference with the fulfilment of the jury’s duties.” following an appeal lodged by the applicant and two other defendants, on 8 august 2013 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the applicant’s conviction. as regards the applicant’s argument that ch. had exerted undue influence on the jury, the court stated as follows:
“[the court] rejects as unsubstantiated the argument ... that the jury’s verdict was ... a result of unlawful influence exerted by ch. according to the trial record, the jury members were selected in compliance with the requirements set out in [the rules of criminal procedure]. the materials in the case file show that ... ch. did not exert undue influence on the jurors. [the court] discerns no violations of the rules of criminal procedure, including those alleged by [the defendants], that would justify the quashing of the verdict.”
the applicant was born in 1988 and lives in moscow. 74568/12, §§ 7-65, 5 january 2016) and yaroslav belousov v. russia (nos. 2653/13 and 60980/14, §§ 7-33, 4 october 2016). the parties’ submissions on the circumstances directly relevant to the present case are set out below. to control the crowd, a police cordon forced the protesters to remain within the barriers. there were numerous clashes between the police and protesters. it took them about two hours to clear the protesters from the square. the applicant took part in the demonstration on 6 may 2012 at bolotnaya square. she was arrested at the venue of the event and taken to a police station, where she was charged with an administrative offence. after a night in detention the applicant was released; on 8 may 2012 she was convicted as charged but exempted from administrative liability. she conducted herself peacefully and did not take part in any acts of violence prior to her arrest. at 6 p.m. she was arrested by the police and at around 9 p.m. was taken to taganskiy district police station of moscow. according to the government, the applicant was arrested at 6 p.m. at bolotnaya square because she had been participating in breaking the police cordon. it contained no mention of the date or time of her release. she signed an undertaking that she would attend court if ordered by the judge to do so. after that an on-duty officer drew up an administrative-offence record on the basis of the reports and explanatory notes of g.s. the police officers who had arrested the applicant. she told the police that she was the mother of a fifteen-month-old child left at home with a babysitter and requested that her family be notified of her arrest, but this was also refused. her passport contained no information about her baby. she had no access to drinking water and was given no food. at some point she had been arrested and taken to the police station, even though she had not chanted any slogans. according to the applicant, she was released at about 10 p.m. that day. she signed an undertaking that she would attend the court hearing of the administrative case. on 8 may 2012 the justice of the peace of circuit no. 100 of the yakimanka district examined the charges against the applicant. the justice of the peace issued her a warning. on 26 july 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint under chapter 25 of the code of civil procedure with the dorogomilovskiy district court of moscow about her allegedly arbitrary arrest on 6 may 2012 and detention until 7 may 2012, the termination of the rally at bolotnaya square and the conditions of her detention at the police station. on 3 september 2012 the court refused to examine the complaint on the grounds that the contested acts of the police had been the matter of the administrative proceedings and could not be challenged separately. it did not examine the complaint about the conditions of detention. on 28 february 2014 the moscow city court upheld that judgment.
the applicant was born in 1945 and lives in cluj-napoca. he is a university professor and contributor to various magazines and newspapers, mainly of an economic and financial nature. at the time of the relevant events he had already published more than 180 articles in various local or national publications. prior to parliamentary elections held at the end of november 2008, the applicant wrote an article about m.i.-i., who was standing as a candidate for one of the national parties. it read as follows:
“after five rounds of free parliamentary elections, ordinary people, who are politically active only when they vote, have come to an uncontroversial conclusion: there is something wrong with people who become candidates for various political functions. without even knowing exactly what [is wrong], most people of good moral and professional character often choose not to vote any more. it is therefore no longer surprising that the romanian parliament is the institution that enjoys the least public confidence. time has consolidated the public’s belief that most candidates want to become parliamentarians so that they can for a couple of years take advantage of the privileges they grant themselves or of those informal benefits which come through the development of the system of relationships associated with their functions. there are candidates who do everything to become parliamentarians in order to shield their criminal record from the [criminal] acts they committed before becoming senators or deputies. among the many cases of that type, i today present you one. this gentleman is in good physical condition, especially after living a comfortable life as a manager at r. cluj [a public company], and now wants to use his skills in parliament. decided not to repay the loan thus contracted, after imploring the creditor to have mercy, to postpone and not enforce the contract. even though he knows that the contract weighs against him, he is relying on that defect of romanian justice of postponing the adjudication of cases. brought a case before a court which had no jurisdiction to assess the case. but he hopes in the near future to be able to invoke his immunity as a member elected by the nation, just like his spiritual guardian, who left us without a maritime fleet. that is why i say that we must be careful about what mr m.i.-i. for the following day he might no longer admit to anything, he may switch to another political party, if he is given more, he may even sell part of the electoral district where he ran and if nobody wants it, he can go to smirnov because it is warmer in tiraspol than in huedin.” he alleged that all the material had been meant to discredit him as a candidate. the applicant confirmed that he was the author of the article in question and that everything he had written had been true, as proved by documents from the arbitration tribunal of the cluj chamber of commerce, which would become available to the court. on 20 july 2009 the cluj-napoca court of first instance allowed the claims lodged by m.i.-i. and held that the article of 6 november 2008 had contained defamatory statements about him. the court held that the applicant had not proved that his statements were true. had been partially granted on 7 april 2009, as the repayment deadline had been set for 30 april 2010. the court further noted that the applicant’s statements had been reproduced in electoral leaflets, which had been distributed in several public places, in bus stations and private mailboxes. the applicant appealed, arguing before the cluj county court that the publication of the article in question during a parliamentary election campaign had had the role of informing the public, in good faith, about a political figure. he argued that during election campaigns the press had the essential role of informing the public about future members of the romanian parliament. in a final judgment of 21 january 2010 the county court essentially upheld the reasoning of the lower court. the county court confirmed that the lower court had correctly estimated that it had been necessary to balance the right to private life on the one hand and freedom of expression which contributed to a debate of public interest on the other, holding that:
“to insult, to defame a person cannot be justified and legitimate when one party aims to unilaterally expose in the press private litigation of a commercial nature involving two private parties. nevertheless, the county court allowed the applicant’s appeal in part and reduced the damages to eur 5,000, considered to be more proportionate to the damage sustained by m.i.-i.
the first applicant was born in 1963 and the second applicant was born in 1965. they live in dogana and faetano, respectively. when the applicants lodged their applications they were serving their prison sentences in san marino. at the time of the facts the first and the second applicant were officials responsible for the supervision of safety on construction sites (sicurezza antinfortunistica). the commission produced a report, chapter two of which was devoted entirely to criminal collusion between company f. and various officials. it highlighted the existence of a well‑established corrupt practice of representatives or employees of certain named construction companies which bribed public officials responsible for overseeing construction site safety (sicurezza antinfortunistica) to omit to carry out compulsory safety checks on companies allegedly connected with the above‑mentioned company f. 9. further details about the commission’s work and the relevant investigation and trial are set out in berardi and others v. san marino ((dec.), the first and second applicants were charged in respect of events up to 1 january 2010. on 19 september 2014 the first‑instance judge found all the accused, including the applicants, guilty of the continuing offence of bribery. the applicants were sentenced to five years and six months’ imprisonment, a four‑year prohibition on holding public office and exercising political rights, and a fine of 25,000 euros (eur). in particular, the judge considered b. as being the de facto dominus of the companies under investigation and found that he had been responsible for giving orders and instructions to the various formal directors of the companies to bribe the first and the second applicant in order to avoid safety checks at his companies’ construction sites. the fact therefore that the applicants had agreed to refrain from exercising their discretionary powers or to do so in an aberrant way in exchange for money constituted direct bribery. as to the penalty, the judge stated, in general terms, that he had calculated it on the basis of parameters such as the number of acts of bribery, the type of acts which had been the subject of the bribery, the role of each accused person and the time‑frame in which they had carried out the criminal act. on 13 february 2015, the applicants appealed. they complained, inter alia, that before the passing of law no. thus, at most they should have been charged with indirect bribery (corruzione impropria), which carried a lighter penalty (by one degree/punishment bracket). however, they had been accused of bribery inducing omission in relation to facts which had arisen before the law had come into force. it was noted that the bank account deposits made by the first and second applicants indirectly indicated their guilt. the evidence adduced by the applicants, or that which they had asked to submit but which had not been allowed at first instance, was not sufficient to disprove any inferences based on the apparent situation. in the light of the clear evidence of payments having been made to the first and second applicants, there was no need to enter into a detailed analysis of their role on the construction sites. in connection with the applicants’ complaint concerning the principle of nullum crimen sine lege, the judge of criminal appeals noted that the case did not concern multiple crimes. the only crime at issue was bribery resulting from the pact struck (patto corruttivo) between b. and the applicants. that pact had involved, on the one hand, a promise not to create problems for the construction companies in question, that is, favourable treatment for friends, and, on the other hand, it had been done in exchange for the making and receiving of regular payments of money. such favouritism had had specific corresponding rewards according to comparative tables adjusted for the purpose. however, it had consisted of one crime (unicità di reato) perpetrated over time, as each payment resulting from the original pact meant the renewal of the pact. the court noted that if the acts ascribed to the applicants had amounted to bribery inducing omission (that is, a private “corruptor” had paid the public officials to fail to do their duty), then it was true that such acts could have been considered as not constituting a crime at the time, or more precisely, that they had constituted the offence of indirect bribery, covered by paragraph 2 of the old law. however, that was not the case as the applicants had been paid also to carry out acts which were contrary to the duties of their office, which was covered by the “old” article 373 [§ 1]. according to the judge of criminal appeals, the amended article 373, which expressly provided for the crime of direct bribery to include the promise of an omission or payment for a past omission, did not create a new crime but amounted solely to a more serious legal classification of acts which already constituted a crime. the change in the law was therefore irrelevant in the applicants’ case. in doing so, they had been acting contrary to the duties related to their office in the interests of a private corruptor.
the applicants, petra wunderlich, who was born in 1967, and dirk wunderlich, who was born in 1966, are married to each other. the applicants are the parents of four children: m. (born in july 1999), j. (born in september 2000), h. (born in april 2002) and s. (born in september 2005). the applicants reject the state school system and compulsory school attendance and wish to homeschool their children themselves. in 2005 their oldest daughter, m., reached school age. the applicants refused to register her in a school. the applicants accepted these decisions and paid the fines, but did not change their behaviour. between 2008 and 2011 the applicants lived with their children abroad. in 2011 they returned to live permanently in germany, but did not register their children with any school. it considered that the persistent refusal of the applicants endangered the best interests of the children. in the oral hearing, on 6 september 2012, the applicants stated that they had paid the administrative fines imposed on them for not sending the children to school and that, despite the state sanctions, they would continue to homeschool their children. the court found that the children needed to be exposed to influences other than those of their parental home to acquire those skills. lastly, the court concluded that no less severe measures were available. owing to the persistent refusal of the applicants to send their children to school, only withdrawing parts of parental authority could ensure the children’s continual attendance at school and would prevent them suffering harm on account of them being educated at home. the applicants appealed against that decision. in a letter dated 15 november 2012 the youth office informed the applicants that it intended to assess the children’s knowledge on 22 november 2012 and asked the applicants to have their children ready to be collected on that day. the applicants submitted statements to the education authority in which they informed the latter that the children did not wish to participate in the assessment. however, staff of the education authority were not allowed to enter the family home when they arrived for the appointment in january 2013. the father spoke to the members of staff and explained that he believed that the family court’s decision had been unlawful and that he alone was authorised to decide whether his children attended school or not. as to the law, the court outlined that the decision to withdraw parts of parental authority under articles 1666 and 1666a of the civil code (see paragraphs 25 and 26 below) presupposed a significant endangerment of the best interests of the children, which the parents were unable or unwilling to prevent. the education they were receiving from the applicants could not compensate for not attending school. in addition, the children were also not members of any sports club, music school or similar organisation where they could acquire other skills important for their education. moreover, by their persistent refusal they were also teaching the children that they did not need to comply with the rules of community life if they found them disagreeable. consequently, the withdrawal of parts of parental authority by the family court had been correct. on 9 october 2014 the federal constitutional court refused to accept the applicants’ constitutional complaint for adjudication, without providing reasons. the decision was served upon the applicants on 16 october 2014. on 19 september 2013 the court heard testimony from the applicants, their children and a member of staff of the education authority. on 16 may 2014 the education authority lodged a criminal complaint against the applicants for failing to comply with rules on compulsory school attendance. on 25 june 2014 the applicants again withdrew their children from school. on 15 august 2014, in parallel proceedings, the frankfurt am main court of appeal transferred the right to determine the children’s place of residence back to the applicants. the court held that, as pointed out in its decision of 25 april 2013 (see paragraph 15 above), the applicants’ persistent refusal to send their children to school constituted child endangerment and that neither their temporary schooling nor the learning assessment of the children had changed that conclusion.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in sofia. the applicant’s grandfather owned part of a real estate. he donated his part to the applicant’s cousins in 1997. the applicant’s grandfather died on 16 january 2003. on 13 february 2004 the applicant brought proceedings under section 30 of the inheritance act 1949 before the sofia district court. she claimed that, by donating his part in the immovable property in 1997, her grandfather had infringed her right to a “reserved share” in his inheritance, given that the immovable property in question represented his entire estate. in a decision of 2 march 2005 the court upheld her claim by diminishing the part of the estate donated to the applicant’s cousins and restoring the applicant’s “reserved share” in her grandfather’s inheritance. following an appeal by the other party, on 20 september 2007 the sofia city court quashed the first instance court’s judgment and rejected the applicant’s claim for restoration of her “reserved share” in her grandfather’s estate. in particular, referring to interpretative decision no. 1 of 4 february 2005 by the supreme court of cassation (“scc”), the court found that the applicant had not complied with the statutory requirements for claiming her reserved share. the court held that, given that her cousins to whom the real estate had been donated could not be considered “heirs-at-law”, the applicant should have claimed the reserved share of the inheritance by means of an “inventory”. following a cassation appeal brought by the applicant, on 24 march 2009 the scc upheld the sofia city court’s findings in full in a final decision.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in baku. the applicant worked as an investigative journalist since 2005. in addition, she worked as a regional coordinator for the organised crime and corruption reporting project, where she trained journalists in investigation techniques and cross-border reporting. she has received a number of international awards for her journalistic activity. in august 2010 and june 2011, before the events giving rise to the present case, the applicant had published and contributed to articles concerning the alleged involvement of the president’s daughters in various commercial ventures. in particular, on 3 may 2012 she published an article on the above-mentioned mining consortium. on 9 march 2012 the applicant reported the above-mentioned letter to the prosecution authorities and lodged a formal request for an investigation, arguing that the letter amounted to blackmail related to her recent journalistic activities. the same article was published in the newspaper i̇ki sahil on 15 march 2012. müsavat is a political opposition party, which indicated that it had nothing to do with the website and condemned the posting of the video. the article spoke about a number of scandals in which various opposition politicians had been involved. several more articles attacking the applicant were published later in səs. while the investigation in connection with the threatening letter and the posting of the first video was under way (see below), in july 2013 another video of the applicant and her then boyfriend filmed in the applicant’s bedroom was posted on “ictimaipalatka.com”. as noted above, on 9 march 2012 the applicant reported the threatening letter received on 7 march 2012 to the ministry of internal affairs and the prosecutor general’s office, complaining that it was blackmail in connection with her journalistic activity, and asking the prosecution authorities to ensure her safety, to investigate the matter, and to hold those responsible for the threat and the video accountable. on 17 march 2012 the applicant found out, with the help of friends, that as well as the camera in the bedroom there were multiple other hidden cameras installed in her flat. and arranged to meet him in her flat the same day. and his assistant, to be present during the meeting. he had also heard other people at work with the wires inside the flat. appeared to be recording the engineer’s statements. according to the applicant, despite her objections, he did not include mr n.j. ’s statements in the investigation case file and did not mention in the investigation record that there had been a meeting with mr n.j. the government did not submit any expert reports or other documents relating to the above-mentioned decisions. no further documents concerning the investigative steps taken have been made available to the court by the parties. instead, on 26 april 2012 the prosecutor general’s office and the baku city prosecutor’s office published a joint public statement on the status of the investigation (“the status report”). the letter further stated that a number of investigative steps, including various expert examinations, had been taken, and that the investigation was under way. on 28 august 2013 the applicant lodged another complaint with the sabail district court under the judicial supervision procedure, with content similar to that of the previous complaint of 12 august 2013. on 30 august 2013 the sabail district court rejected the complaint, for the same reasons as in the decision of 13 august 2013. on 9 september 2013 the applicant appealed. on 19 september 2013 the baku economic administrative court no. in all, the report gave the full names of fifteen people, as well as the professional occupations of most of them. by a judgment of 27 july 2012 the sabail district court dismissed the applicant’s claims, finding that the purpose of the status report had been to counter the possibility of the public forming a negative opinion about the investigating authorities as a result of the applicant’s public complaints that the investigation was ineffective.
the applicant was born in 1980 and lives in vrbovec. it also asked that he be placed in a psychiatric hospital in accordance with the protection of individuals with mental disorders act. he was detained on 30 november 2013 and on 2 december 2013 he was placed in the zagreb prison hospital for treatment. during the proceedings, his pre‑trial detention was extended several times. on this basis, the court ordered his internment in a psychiatric institution, in accordance with the protection of individuals with mental disorders act. the court also decided that he would remain detained until the judgment became final. he also challenged the decision to detain him until the judgment became final. took part in this decision as a member of a three‑judge panel. was sitting, dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the first-instance judgment of the municipal court, which thereby became final. the applicant challenged the judgment of the velika gorica county court by lodging a request for extraordinary review of a final judgment with the supreme court (vrhovni sud republike hrvatske) and a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske). on 4 june 2014 the supreme court dismissed the applicant’s request for extraordinary review on the grounds that there was no reason to call the impartiality of judge lj.b into question. on 20 may 2015 the constitutional court upheld these findings and dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as unfounded. after the criminal court’s judgment became final, on 19 march 2014 the file was forwarded to the zagreb county court (hereinafter “the county court”) as the court with competence to rule on the applicant’s involuntary placement in a psychiatric hospital under the protection of individuals with mental disorders act (see paragraphs 34 and 36 below). the file also contained submissions made by f.ž., the applicant’s lawyer in the criminal proceedings. on the same day the county court opened the proceedings for the applicant’s committal to a psychiatric hospital. on 30 july 2014 the judge conducting the proceedings visited the applicant in the hospital. according to a note of the visit, it was possible to communicate with the applicant, he was engaged in therapeutic activities, his mother had been visiting him and he wanted to be given the possibility to take occasional therapeutic leave from the hospital. there is no indication that she asked any questions or otherwise addressed the applicant or the judge during the meeting. on 7 august 2014 the county court ordered an expert report from s.h., was of the opinion that short-term therapeutic leave from the hospital could be granted. he stressed that all his previous attempts to contact the hospital had been to no avail. this letter appears to have only been received by the county court on 18 december 2014. those present at the hearing agreed that the applicant should be granted short-term therapeutic leave. at the same time, the county court granted the applicant therapeutic leave for the period between 28 and 31 august 2014. the applicant’s father, on behalf of the applicant, challenged the decision on his son’s further involuntary hospitalisation before a three-judge panel of the county court. on 19 december 2014 a three-judge panel of zagreb county court dismissed the appeal as ill-founded on the grounds that a lawyer had been duly appointed to represent the applicant in the proceedings concerning his involuntary hospitalisation. the applicant’s father then lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court, arguing that the legal aid lawyer appointed for his son in the proceedings before the county court had acted as an extended arm of the institutions rather than a lawyer protecting his interests. in the meantime, on 22 may 2015 the applicant, through his chosen representative f.ž., on 24 august 2015, following a further examination of the applicant’s situation, the county court ordered the applicant’s conditional release from the hospital.
the applicant was born in 1981 and lives in the ventspils district. on 6 december 2001 the applicant was convicted of kidnapping, aggravated murder and aggravated extortion and sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment. this judgment was upheld at two levels of appeal and took effect in 2002. on an unspecified date the applicant was transferred to the medium‑security level of that closed prison. male inmates who had been convicted of serious crimes started serving their sentences in closed prisons, while female inmates who had been convicted of the same crimes started serving their sentence in partly-closed prisons. on 30 september 2008 the applicant was informed that his father had died. on the same day the prison director replied that he had no authority to allow the request, as the applicant was serving his sentence at the medium-security level of a closed prison. in the years 2012-2015 the applicant was granted one prison‑leave day per year. the case file contains no information as to the type of prison and security level in which the applicant served his sentence during this time. on 11 september 2015 the applicant was conditionally released. it referred to sections 504(1) and 505(1) of the sentence enforcement code and observed that the legislature had chosen to create different legal frameworks in respect of sentence execution for men and women. he observed that closed prisons hosted male convicts who had been sentenced to deprivation of liberty for having committed serious or especially serious crimes, as well as convicts who had been moved from partly-closed prisons for grave or systematic breaches of the regime under which they had been held. in closed prisons convicts were subjected to tightened security and maximum surveillance. it followed that the persons placed in those prisons were particularly dangerous to the society. hence, the restriction imposed on the applicant was proportionate and necessary in a democratic society. on 9 july 2008 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint, arguing that section 504(1) of the sentence enforcement code was discriminatory on the grounds of sex, in breach of article 91 of the constitution. as women convicted of the same crimes started serving their sentence in partly-closed prisons, they were entitled to more and longer visits, more phone calls and could progress to more lenient security levels more rapidly. in addition, women could be granted leave from prison for up to seven days per year, whereas no such right was provided for men. on 29 july 2008 the constitutional court, relying on section 20(6) of the law on the constitutional court, declined to institute proceedings. in particular, the applicant had failed to specify why the difference in treatment between men and women should not be acceptable. on 7 august 2008 the applicant lodged a second constitutional complaint, adding that men and women who were convicted of serious and especially serious crimes were in the same circumstances in that they were both imprisoned. yet, despite the prohibition of discrimination requiring men and women to be treated equally, their rights were restricted to a different extent. on 5 september 2008 the constitutional court again declined to institute proceedings. with respect to the first sentence of article 91 of the constitution, which addressed the principle of equality, the constitutional court pointed out that the following criteria had to be examined – the existence of comparable groups, a difference in treatment between those groups, and a lack of objective and reasonable justification for that difference in treatment. as the legal reasoning advanced by the applicant was based on the assumption that men and women who had committed similarly grave crimes were in comparable situations, the constitutional court considered this reasoning evidently insufficient for the claim to be allowed. thus, in relation to this part of the application, legal reasoning had not been provided (nav sniegts juridiskais pamatojums) and the formal requirements of a constitutional complaint had not been met. in a third constitutional complaint of 20 october 2008, the applicant added that on 2 october 2008 he had been refused permission to leave prison to attend his father’s funeral. he had thereby been discriminated against on the basis of sex, as women in his situation would have been able to attend the funeral. it noted that the application contained no reasoning as to why men and women who had been convicted of serious and especially serious crimes and given prison sentences would need to be subjected to the same rules of sentence enforcement – namely, how men and women were in comparable situations. on those grounds, the legal reasoning included in the constitutional complaint was held to be evidently insufficient for the claim to be allowed.
the applicant, mr fabian gjini, a croatian citizen of albanian origin, was born in 1972 and lives in crikvenica, croatia. on 22 august 2008 the applicant was arrested by the serbian police on suspicion of having attempted to pay a toll at tovarnik border crossing (a border crossing between serbia and croatia) with a counterfeit ten‑euro (eur) banknote. according to the applicant, the ill-treatment and humiliation started immediately. rather, they thought that he had been placed there to spy on them and find out about their crimes. the cellmates threatened the applicant by saying that they would stage his suicide if he told anyone what was happening in the cell. at night, the applicant was put in the toilet. the situation worsened after the applicant’s cellmates found out about his origin. they filled a bucket with water and put the applicant’s head in it. this test was performed over and over again. after he said that he did not know any, they taught him some and forced him to sing them for several nights. on that day his cellmates shaved him and shaved his eyebrows. according to the applicant, the prison guards were perfectly aware of what was happening to him. in particular, all the events happened while one guard – who appeared to be a school friend of one of the applicant’s cellmates – was on duty. the applicant was afraid to say anything to his lawyer. after his relocation, the applicant was no longer ill-treated. on 1 september 2009, the applicant amended his proposal, adding a request for compensation for the ill-treatment he had suffered during the period of detention. however, owing to the nature of the applicant’s complaints, the domestic court decided that the applicant had to be present at hearings. who had represented the applicant in the criminal proceedings and was familiar with the events in prison; and (iii) m.č., and the applicant used to talk during the morning walks in the prison. the applicant had a strange look in his eyes and seemed very scared. could not remember whether someone had screamed at night. confirmed that shaved eyebrows in prison meant that the person had been raped. the guards knew what shaved eyebrows meant. the applicant was moved to another cell after his lawyer urged the prison authorities to relocate him. the applicant seemed frightened and confused. the case was remitted to the court of first instance for reconsideration. given that such an evaluation was not carried out in this particular case, the findings of the first-instance court that it had not been proved that the claimant had been ill-treated and molested by other cellmates during his time in detention – causing him to sustain different types of non-pecuniary loss for which the [state] could be held responsible as defined in article 172 of the obligations act (zakon o obligacionim odnosima) – cannot be accepted with any certainty.” in the reopened proceedings, the court of first instance re-examined the applicant’s first lawyer, d.ž., the court also considered reports produced by a psychologist and a psychiatrist from rijeka, croatia concerning the applicant’s current mental health and emotional distress. on 18 january 2014 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal.
the applicant was born in 1968 and was detained in lpu-3, chelyabinsk. on 1 november 2004 the conviction was upheld on appeal. on 28 september 2007 the applicant arrived at medical detention facility no. he entered the corridor, turned to face the wall and took up a spread-eagle position leaning against the wall. at the same time another warder started kicking and hitting the applicant on the back and head. the beatings intensified and the applicant was pushed to the floor. on the same date the applicant was examined by a prison doctor. the prosecution’s case was that on 2 october 2007 the applicant had refused to be subjected to a body search and had waved his hands to prevent the search. on 2 september 2008 the chelyabinsk regional court, by a jury verdict, acquitted the applicant. having established that he had hit warder l. once and had split his lip, the jury nevertheless concluded that the applicant had caused the injury in an attempt to protect himself. the relevant part of the judgment read as follows:
“the jury has established in a verdict that two injuries to mr l.’s lower lip were caused by [the applicant] with a single punch to mr l.’s face. [ the applicant] who had stayed with his face to the wall, had been subsequently kicked and punched, and hit with rubber truncheons a number of times, at least ten, on various parts of his body, head [and] limbs. [ the beating] had been accompanied by verbal assaults. on 18 november 2008 the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the judgment on appeal. after the acquittal had become final, the applicant lodged a complaint with the prosecutor’s office of the chelyabinsk region, providing his version of the events of 2 october 2007 and complaining of ill‑treatment. the investigators questioned the applicant along with fourteen witnesses and conducted three cross-examinations. on 28 september 2009 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the alleged perpetrators. on 22 december 2009 the criminal proceedings against the prison warders were discontinued and the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the alleged perpetrators. on 8 november 2012 the criminal proceedings against the warders were reopened. on 19 november 2012 the investigation was suspended again for failure to identify the alleged perpetrators. therefore, the use of rubber truncheons had been justified. the investigator found that the warders had not abused their powers and had acted in accordance with the law. on 1 june 2012 the metallurgicheskiy district court of chelyabinsk held to discontinue the proceedings as the decision of 28 september 2008 had been quashed on 18 november 2009. (b)  challenging of the investigator’s decision of 22 december 2009 and other decisions 25. on 9 november 2012 the metallurgicheskiy district court of chelyabinsk discontinued the proceedings on the applicant’s claim. it ordered that the violations found be remedied. he also sought apologies from the implicated officials. on 11 august 2011 the tsentralnyy district court of chelyabinsk awarded the applicant 15,000 russian roubles (rub) (353 euros (eur)) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage and dismissed the remaining claims. the district court held the hearing in the applicant’s absence. the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision.
the applicant was born in 1969 and is now serving his sentence in a detention facility at nizhniy tagil. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. on 7 november 2013 a group of nine detainees, including the applicant, was scheduled for a transfer from a police station to a remand prison. a gazel prison van was available for transfer. it was designed to transport a maximum of seven prisoners, but police major v., who was in charge of the transfer, took the decision to take all nine prisoners at once to save fuel. the prison van was manned by four officers. driver g. and major v. were seated in the front, and officers k. and d. were riding in the rear part of the cabin next to the prisoner cells. five prisoners were placed in the large cell in the van, and three prisoners in individual cells. as the applicant was a former law-enforcement officer, the transfer regulations required that he should be separated from the other detainees. approximately half way to the destination, prisoners sa., kicked out the door of the large cell and attacked the convoy officers. overpowered officer d. and seized his holster containing a handgun. grabbed officer d. from behind, and a second shot was fired. meanwhile, officer k. pushed prisoner ma. aside, drew his gun and told everyone to freeze or he would shoot. were still struggling with officer d. for the gun. major v. came running to the back of the van and opened the door. released the gun and threw it out of the van. the applicant was taken to a local military hospital where his wounded leg was put in a cast. on the following day he was discharged and transferred to a prison hospital. on 9 january 2014 an investigator with the bashkortostan regional division of the investigations committee refused to open a criminal case. he found no indications of gross negligence arising from the decision to transport two prisoners in excess of the van’s design capacity and that not putting the applicant in a cell had been motivated by “considerations of budgetary austerity and saving money allocated for the purchase of fuel”. on 4 december 2014 a deputy prosecutor of the kirovskiy district in ufa rejected the applicant’s complaint against the investigator’s decision. on 20 july 2015 the supreme court of the bashkortostan republic rejected an appeal against the district court’s judgment. ten days later the investigator refused to institute criminal proceedings:
“... it does not appear possible to establish with certainty that the bullet which hit [the applicant] was shot from the handgun of officer v., rather than from [the handgun of] officer d., while it was in the possession of prisoner mu. on 5 may 2016 the supervising deputy prosecutor of the bashkortostan republic set the decision aside and ordered a forensic assessment of the applicant’s injury. on 6 june 2016 the investigator with the central investigations department in ufa again refused to institute criminal proceedings, noting that the applicant’s medical record could not be located. it had been sent to the facility where he was serving his sentence and that facility had not responded to the investigator’s request for a copy. of attempted escape from prison and sentenced them to five years’ imprisonment each. convoy officers k., d. and v. had been given the status of injured parties in those proceedings.
details concerning the applicants can be found in the appendix. the first applicant owns one seventh undivided share thereof. on 31 march 1962 for a period of seventeen years at a yearly ground rent of 45 maltese liras (mtl), approximately 105 euro (eur). in march 1979 when the temporary emphyteusis came to an end c.c. the rent under the new lease regime was mtl 86.54, approximately eur 200 annually. on 9 april 1986 the property was requisitioned by the state and c.c. he handed in the keys to the housing department on 29 september 1986. on 30 october 1986 the housing department allocated the property to d.l. there was no pressing social need for such an allocation. the owners informed the authorities of this but no action was taken. on an unspecified date, following the death of d.l. ( they offered the occupants a smaller property in the vicinity as part of a settlement proposal. ’s husband also died and on 30 january 2002 their son l.l. rent continued to be paid on the terms mentioned above. the owners complained to the ombudsman who, on 29 october 2003, considered that the authorities had not given sufficient attention to the owners’ complaints. when the owners became aware that this application had been lodged, they filed, on 21 february 2007, an objection to the proposed development. they complained of a breach of article 1 of protocol no. pending proceedings, on 11 february 2010, the property was derequisitioned; however the government admitted that although the property had been abandoned by the occupants the government had not recovered the keys. on 28 april 2011 the civil court (first hall) in its constitutional competence found in favour of the owners. it also awarded eur 7,535 in compensation, with costs against the government. in establishing compensation, the court had regard to the rental value submitted by the owners’ expert [in a report of 2007] of mtl 250 (approximately eur 582) a month, in other words mtl 3,000 (approximately eur 6,988) yearly, which however included a room which was not subject to the requisition order and thus its rental value had to be deducted. had vacated the premises and offered to return the keys, the government had failed to recover the keys. as to the compensation it found that the amount awarded by the first-instance court had been low. indeed the award of eur 7,535 reflected the sums that the owners would have been entitled to as rent for the premises according to the provisions of chapter 158 of the laws of malta, and thus it was not an award in compensation for the violation of their property rights, nor did it reflect an award for the occupation of the premises at undervalued rents. thus, in total it awarded compensation of eur 12,535 covering both pecuniary and non‑pecuniary damage, without prejudice to any claims the owners may have for material damage caused to the property, and it ordered that the costs of the proceedings at both instances be split equally between the contending parties. pending these proceedings, on 21 october 2013, l.m., predecessor of the second and third applicant, died. the applicants claimed that the property was not habitable and the works started by l.l. they considered that the government’s lack of regard towards the situation had contributed to the degeneration of the property and that a considerable expense would have to be incurred and relevant permits obtained to reinstate the building for habitation. the estimated rental value of the property (in an unspecified state) in 2014 was eur 665 a month (eur 7,980 a year).
the applicants were both born in 1968 and live in marsalforn and naxxar, respectively. the applicants are owners (each own a half undivided share) of the property at number 85, st. no reason for the requisition was set out in the order. the contract of emphyteusis expired in 2007. however, given article 12a, of the housing (decontrol) ordinance, chapter 158 of the laws of malta (see relevant domestic law), which provided for the automatic conversion of the emphyteusis into a lease, mr and ms a. continued to occupy the property by title of lease. mr and ms a. paid the applicants eur 279.52 annually by way of rent pursuant to the rent control legislation. however, the applicants did not accept this rental amount on the ground that it was insignificant when compared to the rental value which the property would have fetched on the open market. due to this refusal the rent was to be deposited with the court registry. on 9 march 2009 the applicants filed proceedings before the civil court (first hall) in its constitutional competence. the applicants claimed that their rights, as protected under article 1 of protocol no. 1 to the convention, were being violated because they had not received adequate compensation for the forced occupation of their property and because the authorities had failed to properly look after the property after taking possession of it. on 26 march 2013 the court decided in favour of the applicants. the costs of the proceedings were to be paid by the housing authority and mr and mrs a. 13. furthermore, a disproportionate and excessive burden was being imposed on the applicants, since they had been required to bear most of the social and financial costs of supplying housing accommodation. the court‑appointed architect estimated that it would require 25,000 maltese liri (mtl) (equivalent to eur 58,234) to make the property habitable again and he estimated the property’s sale value on the market (in 2010) to be eur 139,800 and its rental value (for the same year) to be eur 4,893 annually. the applicants made submissions in reply to the appeal lodged by the defendants, and asked the constitutional court to confirm the first‑instance judgment. on 18 july 2014 the constitutional court upheld the first‑instance judgment in part. it confirmed that the requisition order constituted an interference with the applicants’ property and amounted to a violation of the applicants’ rights under article 1 of protocol no. one‑fifth of the costs of the appeal were to be borne by the applicants. it further noted that the court‑appointed architect had described the property as having been neglected for a long time and left without ordinary maintenance; it was (at the time of the judgment) uninhabitable. the deterioration of the property also caused damage to the owners as substantial costs would have to be incurred in order to carry out repairs. this was even more so given that the housing authority did nothing, and did not appear to have the will to do anything, to remedy the damage done to the property. nevertheless the court considered that mr and ms a., could still be protected through the lease agreement. as to redress, the constitutional court observed that the first‑instance court had awarded compensation in the light of the court‑appointed architect’s valuations of the property and the expenses required to rehabilitate the property. once the requisition order was annulled (by means of a judicial review procedure), the applicants had other remedies to deal with both the eviction of mr and ms a. and the award of material damages before the ordinary courts. in relation to practical measures, the constitutional court considered that since the applicants still had a remedy under article 469a, by means of which they could attack the requisition order before the ordinary courts, it was not for it to annul the requisition order. on 5 august 2014 the housing authority derequisitioned the property of the applicants. no keys were returned to them and they had no means of taking possession of the property unilaterally. according to the applicants, the housing authority failed to reply. the authorities refused to co-operate and informed the applicants that if they wished they could draw up a report at their own expense.
the applicant, who was born in 1972, lives in i̇zmir. on 29 november 2004 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of a terrorist organisation. on 3 december 2004 the applicant was brought before the judge at the istanbul assize court who placed him in detention on remand taking into consideration the nature of the offence, the state of evidence and the risk of absconding. on 7 december 2004 the istanbul public prosecutor filed an indictment with the istanbul assize court, charging the applicant with membership of a terrorist organisation. on 14 march 2006 the istanbul assize court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to six years and three months’ imprisonment. the court ordered the continuation of his detention. on 24 january 2007 the court of cassation quashed the judgment on procedural grounds. the case was accordingly remitted to the istanbul assize court. on 19 july 2007 the 10th chamber of the istanbul assize court held a further hearing, in which both the applicant and his lawyer were present. at the end of that hearing, the court ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention. on 25 july 2007 the applicant’s lawyer filed an objection against the decision of 19 july 2007. on 7 august 2007 the 11th chamber of the istanbul assize court dismissed this objection without holding a hearing. in delivering its decision, the court took into consideration the written opinion of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative. on 6 november 2007 the istanbul assize court once more convicted the applicant and sentenced him to six years and three months’ imprisonment and ordered his release. on 30 january 2012 the court of cassation upheld this decision.
the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in chișinău. her duty was to count cash money brought in bags from the bank’s branches. on 18 september 2015 the applicant came to work at around 7.40 a.m. and started counting money in bags of cash. after having counted the money from four bags she went to the toilet and, upon her return, she heard one of her colleagues saying that one of the uncounted bags lacked its seal. she did not pay much attention to that, since that was not the first time when a seal was missing. it appeared that forty-seven thousand euros (eur) was missing from that bag. another superior was called in and a search of the premises was carried out. the branch from which the bag of money came was contacted; however, its employees stressed that the bag had been sealed upon its dispatch. later, the applicant went again to the toilet and then left for lunch. on 2 october 2015 a search was carried out at the applicant’s home but nothing of interest for the investigation was found. on the same day, the applicant was arrested and placed in detention. on 5 october 2015 the applicant was charged with the offence of theft in the amount of eur 47,000. it was alleged that, together with other employees of the bank, she had stolen the aforementioned amount of money from the bag in question. the indictment order did not point to any evidence capable of proving the applicant’s involvement in the offence. it appears that one of the applicant’s colleagues was also accused of the same offence. on the same date, namely on 5 october 2015, the prosecutor in charge of the case applied to the buiucani district court for the applicant’s remand in custody for a period of thirty days. the prosecutor alleged that there was a risk that the applicant could tamper with evidence, influence witnesses and reoffend, which therefore warrant her detention on remand. on 5 october 2015 the buiucani district court found that the prosecutor in charge of the case did not specify in his application the reasons giving rise to the suspicion that the applicant might have committed an offence. nevertheless, the court noted that during the hearing the prosecutor had indicated that the other co-accused had stated that the money could have been stolen by the applicant because she had taken bags from the stack of bags in which the unsealed bag had been found and she had had a suspicious behaviour. moreover, the security camera in the room was turned away from the place where the applicant was sit. the court concluded that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed an offence. the court noted that some thirteen days had elapsed since the day of the theft. the applicant had a permanent abode, a job, family and no criminal record. there were no reasons to believe that she would hinder the investigation in circumstances in which her involvement in the offence was unclear. therefore, the court ordered the applicant’s house arrest for a period of twenty days. on 15 october 2015 the chișinău court of appeal upheld the appeal lodged by the prosecutor. the court considered that there was a risk of absconding, interference with the investigation and collusion with the other co-accused persons. the court observed that unjustified manifestations of clemency would encourage anti‑social behaviour of the sort and would affect the peoples’ trust in the law enforcement organs and that the measure of pre-trial detention was called to punish and discourage anti-social behaviour. the next day the applicant was arrested and placed in detention. it appears that the criminal investigation into the circumstances of the alleged theft of 18 september 2015 is pending to date.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in lipetsk. on 18 september 2007 the applicant signed a private contract for the purchase of a flat in lipetsk. acting on behalf of herself and her daughter maria, a minor. the contract stipulated that the property was not “mortgaged, encumbered by any claims of third parties, disputed or charged”. the flat in question had been allocated as social housing to ms e.m.t. they had lived there with their four children: yelena, mikhail, dmitriy and maria. mikhail and dmitriy were given long prison sentences in 1998 and 2004 respectively and were still serving them at the material time. yelena moved out in 1997 to continue her studies in dagestan. in 2006, ms e.m.t and maria became the sole owners of the property by way of privatisation, while mr v.a.v., mikhail, dmitry and yelena declined in writing to exercise their right to obtain their shares of the privatised flat. delayed submitting the contract for state registration, the applicant sought a court order upholding her full title to the property. she submitted that she was unable to move out because the purchase of the new flat for herself and her daughter maria had not yet been finalised. failed to appear in court, on 2 april 2008 the oktyabrskiy district court in lipetsk struck out the counterclaim and granted the applicant relief in the form of an order compelling state registration of her full title to the property. on 12 november 2008 the title was registered. the applicant then sued the former owner ms e.m.t. and members of her family, seeking termination of their right to use the flat, annulment of the registration of their residence at that address, and their eviction. on 7 april 2009 the oktyabrskiy district court allowed her claim in part. and maria, as they were no longer owners of the property, but dismissed the claim in respect of yelena, mikhail and dmitriy on the following grounds:
“according to the parties, the contested property contains personal belongings and chattels of the defendants [mikhail, dmitriy and yelena]; it appears from their written statements that, in declining their shares of the contested property during its privatisation, they did not intend to stop using the flat. since there was no arrangement between the owner of the contested property and the defendants regarding the discontinuation of the right to use the property, the court considers that [mikhail, dmitriy and yelena] had a right of use over the flat which was identical [in its scope] to that of the owner; accordingly, there are no legal grounds for allowing [the applicant’s] claim to declare their right of use over the flat terminated. a change in ownership of the contested property cannot serve as an independent ground for terminating [their] right to use the flat ...
the plaintiff’s argument to the effect that [mikhail, dmitriy and yelena] do not actually live in the contested property cannot serve as an independent ground for terminating [their] right of use over the flat ...
since the defendants’ right of use over the flat is not terminated, there are no grounds for ordering their eviction ...” 11. on 27 may 2009 the lipetsk regional court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, endorsing the district court’s judgment.
the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in chișinău. the applicant has been involved in numerous protests against alleged acts of corruption and abuse committed by police officers, prosecutors and judges. he was himself the victim of police abuse, ill-treatment and prosecutorial inaction (see mătăsaru and saviţchi v. moldova, no. each year during the professional holiday of the prosecutors or the police he stages protests involving live animals, toilets, caricatures and masks. on 29 january 2013, the professional holiday of prosecutors in moldova, the applicant conducted a one person demonstration in front of the prosecutor general’s office. according to him, the aim of the protest was to draw public attention to the corruption and the control exercised by politicians over the prosecutor general’s office. the first sculpture represented an erect penis with a picture of the face of a high-ranking politician attached to its head. the sculpture had a white collar and a tie and measured two metres. the second sculpture represented a large vulva with pictures of several high‑ranking prosecutors between the labia. the applicant also inflated balloons in the form of male genitals and attached them to the nearby trees. the demonstration was observed from the beginning by several police officers and numerous journalists approached to interview the applicant. at 11 a.m. a police van approached, the sculptures were removed by police officers and the applicant was taken to a police station. later the applicant was charged with the criminal offence of hooliganism. on 2 march 2015 the râșcani district court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment. the sentence was suspended for a period of three years. in deciding on the sanction to be applied, the court took into consideration the fact that the applicant had previously been sanctioned with fines for similar deeds and that those sanctions had proved to be inefficient. the court considered that the applicant’s deeds had been immoral because he had exposed obscene sculptures in a public place where they could be seen by anyone, including by children. the court based its findings on the statements of several prosecution witnesses who had stated that they had disliked the sculptures exposed by the applicant and had considered them to be indecent and obscene. the court also stated that assimilating public officials with genitals went beyond the acceptable limits of criticism in a democratic society and was therefore not an act protected under article 10 of the convention. moreover, the accusations meant to be made by the applicant by means of his protest against the officials concerned lacked a factual basis and had been contrary to the principle of presumption of innocence. the applicant appealed against the above decision arguing, inter alia, that it ran contrary to his rights guaranteed by articles 10 and 11 of the convention. on 2 november 2015 the chișinău court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. he also argued that the sculptures exposed by him could not be considered obscene. in any event, at the time of his protest, children were normally at schools and kindergartens. the fact that some of the prosecution witnesses disliked what they saw was not sufficient to hold him responsible for a criminal offence. the applicant admitted that the form of the protest chosen by him had been striking, however he considered this manner of protesting as the only way possible to make himself heard in a society which was oversaturated with subjects of discussion. he pointed to the fact that the first-instance court had admitted to having pursued the goal of discouraging his future involvement in protests. by the application of a suspended sentence, he had in fact been forced to abstain from organising further protests for a period of three years or risk being imprisoned. on 20 april 2016 the supreme court of justice dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law and upheld the judgments of the lower courts. the decision was notified to the applicant on 19 may 2016.
the applicant was born in 1934 and lives in bogdany. on 26 january 2004 the applicant obtained from the state a deed of title to an agricultural plot of land (an official land registry title) based on a decree issued by the varvynska local administration on 22 december 2003. this amounted to the official registration of her title to the land in accordance with the domestic procedures. at that point the applicant had not filed a request for the boundaries of the plot to be marked out and was not farming the land. on 26 july 2004 the local administration concluded a lease agreement with the private company b., according to which the company would rent the applicant’s land and pay the rent to the local administration. the applicant was not informed about this agreement. she learnt of the lease agreement only in september 2004, after the private company b. had planted seeds on the land. on 4 october 2004 the applicant requested the local administration to allow her to establish the boundaries of her land. in this connection, on 19 october 2004, the local administration ordered the termination of the lease agreement with company b. and authorised the applicant to carry out work to mark out of the boundaries of her land. in july 2005 the company removed its crop from the applicant’s land. on 25 july 2005 amendments were introduced to the lease agreement of 26 july 2004, excluding the applicant’s plot of land from the list of leased lands. from then on the applicant’s land ceased to be a leased property, and company b. has not used it since. in the same month the boundaries of the applicant’s land were established. on 20 january 2006 the applicant lodged a civil claim with the domestic courts against the local administration and company b. claiming that the lease agreement of 26 july 2004 infringed her property rights and should have been declared invalid, she sought compensation for the use of the land by company b. she argued that the amount of compensation to be paid to her should correspond to the value of the crop that had been harvested from her land. on 2 june 2006 the varva local court of chernigiv region allowed the applicant’s claim. in particular, the court found that once the applicant had received a title to the plot of land in question, the local administration should not have concluded any agreement concerning the land with other parties. as to the boundaries, the court found that the local administration had unlawfully linked their establishment with the existence of the applicant’s ownership rights. it also noted that despite the fact that the boundaries had not been marked out, the local administration should have learned about the applicant’s title to the land in question from the land registry and local land plans. the court added that after lodging her request on 4 october 2004 for the boundaries of the plot to be marked out, the applicant had tried to accelerate the process by applying to the local administration and other authorities, to no avail. the court concluded that the lease agreement of 26 july 2004 had violated the applicant’s property rights and was to be declared invalid. the court also held that under domestic law the applicant was entitled to compensation for the use of her property equal to the value of the crops taken from her land (29,210 ukrainian hryvnas (uah); 4,493 euros (eur) at the material time). the compensation, in the court’s view, should have been paid to the applicant both by the local administration and by company b., as they were jointly and severally liable for the unauthorised use of the applicant’s land. on 12 september 2006 the chernigiv regional court of appeal quashed the above-mentioned judgment. the court noted that the use of the applicant’s land by company b. had been lawful since it had been based on the lease agreement. the court further stressed that under article 125 of the land code of ukraine, the right of the owner of a plot of land to use it arose only once its boundaries had been marked out and after receipt by the owner of the document certifying that right. the appellate court concluded that the applicant was not entitled to compensation as the boundaries of her land had been marked out only in july 2005; as she could not have used the land before that date, she could not claim an interest in the harvested crop. on 4 january 2007 the supreme court of ukraine refused to examine the merits of the applicant’s appeal on points of law, finding that it was frivolous. on an unspecified date the applicant lodged another civil claim against company b., claiming the value of the land that had been used by b., as well as rental charges for the use of her land. on 7 june 2006 the varva local court of chernigiv region left this claim unexamined because of the applicant’s attitude, citing the fact that she had been absent from the court hearings in her case on numerous occasions without good reason.
the applicant, is a company specialising in air transportation. at the time of the events it had a valid air operator certificate (an “aoc”) issued by the moldovan civil aviation state authority (the “casa”). on 1 june 2007 the casa issued an order banning all flights of aircraft registered in moldova to iraq and afghanistan, with effect from 15 july 2007. between 4 and 8 june 2007, all moldovan aviation companies were subjected to a check by the european union safety committee. as a result, some irregularities concerning compliance with the european norms in the field of aviation safety were detected. the european union safety committee also found that some aviation companies did not comply with the rule according to which the companies have to have their principal place of business in the state of registration. one of the conclusions set down in the visit report drawn up by the european union safety committee was that the casa failed to demonstrate the ability adequately to enforce and implement the relevant safety standards. according to the report, the casa had undertaken to remedy the situation within three months. on 18 june 2007 the casa sent the applicant company aviation instruction no. 2584 and asked it to present by 21 june 2007 a plan for remedying the irregularities found by the eu safety committee. the corresponding plan was sent by the applicant company to the casa on 21 june 2007. also on 18 june 2007 the casa sent the applicant company aviation instruction no. 2585 requesting it to undertake measures with a view to remedying some of the irregularities before 20 july 2007 and other irregularities before 20 september 2007. on 21 june 2007 the casa issued order no. 102/gen withdrawing the applicant company’s aoc, and thereby terminating its activity. the casa relied on the fact that the applicant company flew to destinations such as iraq, afghanistan, congo, sudan, sierra leone, kosovo, new zealand and united arab emirates. the casa argued that those destinations involved security risks and that it had no resources to ensure flight security in those territories. on 22 june 2007 the applicant company wrote to the casa and asked it to reverse its decision on the grounds that it had not explained exactly what irregularities formed the basis for the withdrawal of the aocs and that the casa had not afforded it enough time to remedy the alleged irregularities. the casa refused to reverse its decision, and on 28 june 2007 the applicant company challenged it in the chişinău court of appeal. the applicant submitted, inter alia, that according to section 23 of the law on civil aviation, the casa was entitled to suspend or withdraw the aocs only if the companies failed to remedy the irregularities found by the casa within the prescribed time-limit. it also made reference to section rac‑aoc 0170 from the regulations in the field of civil aviation according to which an aoc could be revoked only after being initially suspended. since the casa had not observed those legal provisions, its actions were unlawful. on 3 december 2008 the chişinău court of appeal rejected the applicant company’s action, finding that the casa had been entitled to withdraw its aoc because serious irregularities threatening the safety of the flights had been found by european experts, and because those irregularities had not been remedied. the court of appeal did not indicate the irregularities to which it referred. the court also found that the applicant company had failed to comply with the casa’s order of 1 june 2007 prohibiting flights to iraq and afghanistan as of 15 july 2007. the applicant companies challenged the decision before the supreme court of justice. on 29 april 2009 the supreme court of justice dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of the court of appeal after finding that the casa was entitled to revoke the aoc since the applicant company had failed to comply with its instructions concerning the ban on all flights of aircraft registered in moldova to iraq and afghanistan, with effect from 15 july 2007.

the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in batumi. on 2 september 2008 at 10.05 a.m. the applicant was arrested (together with his friend z.b.) in batumi on suspicion of possession of illegal drugs, by members of the special operations unit (სოდის სამმართველო) of the ministry of internal affairs (“the mia”). according to the report of his detention and personal search, he physically resisted the arrest. as a result he sustained injuries to his face and both legs when being forced out of his car and on to the ground. the applicant signed this report without making any written comments. at 5:35 p.m. on the same day the applicant underwent an external visual examination at the batumi no. a report drawn up thereafter recorded multiple injuries on the applicant’s body, including bruises and abrasions on his face and head, both legs, and the waist area, and black and swollen eyes. a note was made to the effect that the applicant could not remember in what circumstances he had sustained those injuries and that he had no complaints about the arresting officers. soon afterwards an ambulance was called for the applicant. he was pre-diagnosed as suffering from possible concussion and was recommended for a transfer to a medical establishment. an hour later an ambulance was called again. after the applicant had been examined, he was diagnosed with a closed head injury and concussion; bruises were noted on his chest and waist area and it was recommended that he undergo inpatient treatment in a hospital neurosurgery department. after a brain tomography examination and other medical check-ups the diagnosis of a head injury was not confirmed. he was diagnosed instead with a fracture of the maxillary sinus on the right side, multiple bruises, and excoriations on his face and body. he was then taken back to the temporary detention centre. on the same date the investigator dealing with the case ordered a forensic examination of the applicant. on 4 september 2008 the applicant was questioned in connection with the circumstances of his arrest. he maintained his allegations of ill treatment, claiming that he had been beaten during the arrest as well as after he was transferred to the special operations unit at the mia. he further dismissed the accusation that he had resisted arrest as untrue. on 6 september 2008 the investigator questioned two employees of the batumi no. they both confirmed that the applicant had had multiple injuries when he had arrived at the detention centre, and that in reply to their question he had claimed that he had sustained those injuries during the arrest. he had not provided any additional details, and had not made any complaints against the arresting police officers. on 17 november 2008 the investigator decided to continue the investigation under article 333 § 1 of the criminal code of georgia (abuse of power). he complained about the fact that no identification parade had been carried out: this would have allowed the applicant to identify the police officers who had ill-treated him during the arrest. nor was this done in respect of the time after he was transferred to the special operations unit, where he had stayed for about seven hours. he also noted that he had requested footage from the video surveillance cameras in the street where the arrest operation had taken place, but that his request had received no response. by a letter of 15 january 2009 the prosecutor dealing with the case informed the applicant’s lawyer that the investigation was still pending, and that in view of the conflicting evidence it was impossible to establish whether the force used against the applicant during the arrest had been proportionate or not. on 18 march 2009 the batumi city court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to fourteen years and three months’ imprisonment and a fine. his conviction was confirmed by the kutaisi court of appeal and the supreme court of georgia on 23 september and 18 november 2009 respectively.
the applicant was born in 1987 and lives in skopje. at birth the applicant was registered as a girl, with a clearly female name. the applicant submitted that from an early age he became aware that he was male rather than female. a medical certificate dated 20 september 2010 included a recommendation that the applicant pursue hormone treatment with a view to eventual genital reassignment surgery. the applicant started taking hormones to increase his testosterone levels. on 1 june 2011 the applicant applied for a change of his first and family name. in a decision of 7 june 2011 the ministry of the interior allowed that application, registering the applicant under a clearly male forename (the applicant also changed his surname). soon after, it issued the applicant with a new identity card bearing his new name. however, the sex/gender marker and numerical personal code (composed of ten digits, some of which indicate the person’s sex) remained the same, identifying the applicant as a female. on 5 july 2011 the applicant lodged an application to have the sex/gender marker and the numerical personal code on his birth certificate corrected (корекција) to indicate that he was male. the applicant appealed to the ministry, alleging that there was no statutory provision that regulated the matter in hand. sex reassignment surgery was unavailable in the respondent state and unjustified in his case. furthermore, such a requirement would subject him to unwanted medical treatment and sterilisation, in breach of his rights. he argued that he had already been diagnosed as transsexual, which was sufficient to obtain legal gender recognition. in a decision of 17 october 2011 the ministry dismissed the appeal, finding that the impugned decision had been based on section 23 of the civil status registration act (закон за матичната евиденција) (“the act”; under the 2016 amendment this provision became section 22(2) – see paragraph 25 below) and that the evidence produced had not been “sufficient and relevant” in respect of the alteration (промена) sought. on 28 february 2013 the administrative court quashed the ministry’s decision. since the applicant’s request had not been in the case file, the court could not ascertain whether the applicant had sought the rectification or alteration of the sex/gender marker only or also of the personal code, the latter having not been addressed in the impugned decision. lastly, the court found that the ministry had neither established the relevant facts nor provided adequate reasons for its decision. in this connection it held that section 23 of the civil status registration act did not specify any requirement to have the sex/gender marker changed; it only contained an instruction to administrative authorities regarding the evidence to be adduced and assessed in such proceedings. on 11 june 2013 the applicant underwent a double mastectomy (breast removal) in belgrade and continued his hormonal therapy. in the resumed proceedings, the registry instructed the forensic institute (институт за судска медицина) to examine the applicant. as reported in the registry’s decision (see paragraph 17 below), on 20 june 2014 the forensic institute drew up a report, which stated: “[o]wing to his mastectomy and on-going hormonal therapy, [the applicant] displays male sexual characteristics which affect his everyday life. in reply, the ministry of health stated that the sex alteration procedure was not specified in health-related regulations and suggested that evidence regarding prior medical intervention in respect of the applicant should be taken into consideration. the applicant appealed against that decision. on 16 october 2015 the ministry dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of the registry. he furthermore submitted that the registry had authority to administer civil-status records and accordingly to decide on the matter. the applicant also referred to the court’s case-law on the matter. on 28 april 2017 the administrative court set aside the ministry’s decision since it had failed to forward the case file. on 13 july 2018 the state commission, which had become competent to decide such issues in second instance, upheld that decision. the proceedings before the administrative court are underway.
the applicant was born in 1987 and was detained in prison in rustavi at the material time. on 3 december 2007 a taxi driver reported to the police that he had been robbed of a mobile phone and twenty-six georgian laris by two young men at knife-point. he claimed that he could identify both of them. on the next day, the applicant was arrested on suspicion of the armed robbery of the taxi driver. neither a body search of the applicant nor a search of his apartment revealed any unlawful items. on the same date an identity parade was held, during which the taxi driver identified the applicant as one of his assailants. in particular, he claimed that he had spent that evening with his girlfriend and her friend out walking the streets and that he had been seen by several people in the area. on 7 december 2007 the applicant’s lawyer wrote to the investigator in charge of the case requesting that he question twelve persons who could confirm the applicant’s alibi. by a decision of 9 december 2007 the investigator rejected the request as unsubstantiated. in his reasoning he noted that the applicant’s girlfriend and her friend had an interest in the outcome of the case. as for the remaining potential witnesses, according to the investigator, they had not been with the applicant at the time of commission of the offence in question. the rejection of the applicant’s request was confirmed on appeal by a supervising prosecutor. her request was granted and the hearing was re-scheduled for 6 may 2008. she noted that the applicant’s alibi should have been verified and she requested, in that connection, on the basis of article 468 of the code of criminal procedure (“the ccp”), that seven witnesses be questioned. in support of her request she submitted written statements for those witnesses. the next day, at the hearing of 6 may 2008, the prosecutor asked the trial judge to dismiss the defence’s application as out of time. in reply, the lawyer noted that she had only been instructed in the case on 29 april 2008 and accordingly could not have filed any requests beforehand. having heard the parties, the trial judge rejected the request of the defence on the basis that it did not comply with article 475 of the ccp. on 22 may 2008 the tbilisi city court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to seven years and six months’ imprisonment. the applicant’s conviction was based on the evidence given in court by the taxi driver, the investigator in charge of the case, the results of the identity parade and the results of two forensic examinations. the report stated that both fibres had a similar nature, colour, colour tonality, fibre structure and type of dye. the second expert examination was an odour recognition examination which established that the samples of the odour trace taken from the taxi corresponded with the odour sample taken from the applicant. the court also relied on the report on the examination of the crime scene, and the reports on the arrest and the searches of the applicant’s person and his apartment. the applicant appealed against his conviction. he reiterated his request for the examination of the witnesses. on 15 july 2008 the appeal proceedings started. none of the defence witnesses was questioned during the appeal proceedings. as for the applicant’s version of the events, the court concluded that it had been fabricated with the sole purpose of evading criminal liability. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. he claimed in that connection that he had been put in a disadvantageous position vis-à-vis the prosecution and had been prevented from proving his innocence.
the applicants are russian nationals who, at the material time, lived in the chechen republic. it appears that the proceedings are still pending. they put him in a grey vaz vehicle without registration plates and drove him away. mr v. also submitted that he had heard that mr dmitry kulishov had been taken to the chechen ministry of the interior and then transported to an unknown destination. it appears that the investigation is still pending. on an unspecified date, the applicant lodged a complaint with the leninskiy district court in grozny, alleging that the investigation had been ineffective and that the investigators had failed to take basic steps. on the same day two rovd officers, mr d. yasayev and mr i. makayev, confirmed that mr askhab soltagirayev had been detained there until at least 2 p.m. and then taken to the premises of a department of the federal security service. the applicants have not seen mr askhab soltagirayev since his abduction. 35035 under article 126 of the cc (abduction). on 21 april 2008 the investigation was resumed. on 18 march 2009 the first applicant asked the investigators to allow her to study the case file. on 21 march 2009 her request was refused. on an unspecified date the first applicant lodged a complaint with the gudermes district court in chechnya regarding the investigators’ refusal to allow her to access the case file. the applicant is the brother of mr anzor tangiyev, who was born in 1978. at about 4 a.m. on 25 may 2000 about twenty armed men in camouflage uniforms and balaclavas broke into the flat, took both mr anzor tangiyev and mr a.d. from a conversation he had overheard between the servicemen and from the noise of nearby helicopters mr a.d. on 5 october 2003 the urus-martan district prosecutor opened criminal case no. the replies received were in the negative. thereafter, the men forced mr bachakov into one of the uaz vehicles and drove off to an unknown destination. on the same date, 9 october 2001, the applicants formally informed the authorities of the abduction and requested that a criminal case into the incident be opened. the first applicant was informed of that decision. on 26 november 2010 the proceedings were suspended. on 5 june 2003 the second applicant was granted victim status in the criminal case. on 11 april 2003 the proceedings were resumed. on 6 june 2009 the investigators resumed the proceedings and sent a number of requests to various authorities, including law-enforcement bodies, concerning mr movsarov’s whereabouts, but no positive replies were received. on 11 april 2002 mr adlan moltayev’s relatives informed the authorities of his abduction. according to the copies of their statements furnished by the government, the road police officers confirmed the passage of two apcs on the night of the abduction. on 1 june 2004 the investigation was suspended after it had failed to establish the identity of the perpetrators. between july and august 2007 the investigators sent a number of requests to law-enforcement authorities asking whether mr bashkuyev and mr arsayev had been suspected of criminal activities and arrested on that account. subsequently, the proceedings were suspended on 27 january 2011, 10 september 2012 and 28 november 2013, and resumed on 30 august 2012 and 28 october 2013.
the first applicant was born in 1973 and lives in horná kráľová. the second applicant was born in 1980 and lives in nitra. on 14 march 2014 a judge of the nitra district court remanded the applicants in detention pending trial on the charge of continuous criminal offence of insurance fraud. this followed their arrest on 11 march 2014. with respect to the first applicant, the district court decided that there were reasons to suspect that he would influence witnesses, reoffend and continue to make illegal financial gains. with respect to the second applicant, the district court concluded that there was a reason to suspect that he would interfere with witnesses and his co-accused to influence the evidence they would give. on 21 march 2014 both applicants lodged an interlocutory appeal, arguing that no specific factual elements had been relied on in the district court’s decision to justify their pre-trial detention. on 1 april 2014 the nitra regional court dismissed the applicants’ interlocutory appeals, referring to the findings of the district court. on 24 april 2014 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint alleging that the decisions on their detention lacked specific reasons justifying their pre-trial detention. they each requested just satisfaction of 5,000 euros (eur). the constitutional court joined their complaints and on 24 september 2014 found a violation of their rights under article 5 §§ 1 and 4 of the convention. it quashed the relevant part of the decision of the regional court and awarded each of the applicants eur 1,000 as just satisfaction in addition to their legal costs and expenses in the amount of eur 284. the constitutional court noted that where the ordinary courts used only formal and standard phrases in their decisions on detention (as was the case with the applicants), suspicion arose as to whether they had looked properly at the specific circumstances at hand. it concluded that even though the ordinary courts had referred to some specific facts, which allegedly justified the applicants’ detention, they had failed to explain them in their decisions. furthermore, the regional court had not dealt with some of the applicants’ core arguments and thus had not remedied the shortcomings of the district court’s decision. in view of the above, the constitutional court concluded that the applicants’ pre-trial detention had been based on an arbitrary decision lacking proper and sufficient reasoning. in the meantime, on 30 may 2014 the applicants had been released and placed under supervised probation.
the applicant was born in 1962 and lives in costesti. on 16 july 2008 the ialoveni district court found the applicant guilty of disrespectful conduct towards a police officer and sentenced him to five days’ administrative arrest. on 12 august 2008 the chișinău court of appeal quashed the above‑mentioned judgment and returned the case for a re‑examination on the merits. on 11 february 2009 the ialoveni district court discontinued the proceedings against the applicant as a result of the expiry of the time-limit for applying an administrative sanction. meanwhile, the applicant had already served his sentence. on 13 march 2009 the chișinău court of appeal quashed the judgment of the district court and discontinued the administrative proceedings in respect of the applicant for lack of corpus delicti. the applicant brought an action under law no. 1545 seeking 300,000 moldovan lei (mdl) (the equivalent of 18,750 euros (eur)) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. on 11 may 2011 the supreme court of justice concluded that the applicant’s administrative arrest had been unlawful and thus awarded him mdl 8,000 (equivalent to eur 500) as compensation for the damage caused.
the applicants are fifty russian nationals. their dates of birth and places of residence are listed in appendixes i, ii, iii and iv. the applicants are former military servicemen. they all obtained final court decisions in their favour ordering military units to provide them with housing before their dismissal from military service. in some cases the defendants were subsequently replaced by the housing provision department of the ministry of defense. the judgment in case of mr nazarov has remained unenforced to date. the judgments in favour of other applicants were enforced on the dates listed in the appendixes below. pursuant to the judgment in favour of mr medinskiy (appendix iii) the authorities decided to allocate a flat to the applicant on 6 november 2015. according to the transfer and acceptance act, the applicant accepted the flat on 20 november 2015. on 11 january 2016 he registered his title to the flat. since 1999 mr nazarov owned a ¼ share in a flat (15 sq.m.) in 2007 the housing commission of the military unit considered his housing situation, noted his title to a share in the flat and decided to put the applicant on the list of persons in need of housing. on 27 january 2011 the same court replaced the defendant by the housing provision department of the ministry of defense. on 25 april 2013 the hosing department of the ministry of defense found that overall size of the applicant’s living premises (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above) exceeded the housing norms for the respective region. on 24 february 2014 the military court of the moscow garrison and on 26 june 2014 the appeal court upheld lawfulness of the above decision. in the meantime, the defendant twice applied to the domestic courts with a request for termination of the enforcement proceedings, as the applicant’s name had been removed from the list of persons in need of housing, and there had “no longer been a possibility to enforce the judgment”. on 29 november 2013 the presnenskiy district court allowed the request. on 14 april 2014 the moscow city court quashed the lower court’s decision on appeal and issued a new ruling dismissing the request in full. the court found that the first-instance court had incorrectly interpreted the applicable law. there was no evidence that the judgment in the applicant’s favour could no longer be enforced. a “loss of a possibility to enforce” should have been “of an objective nature” and could not be conditional on the circumstances depending on the debtor itself. the courts gave the same reasons for the refusal as in the previous round of the similar proceedings. in 2016 the defendant again requested the court to terminate the enforcement proceedings, the application being lodged this time with a military court. the notifications had not been delivered as the flat was closed. the applicant was not present at the hearing. the decision specified that he had been duly notified of the date and time of the examination of the case. the proceedings were held in written form. further, on 20 december 2016 he was informed of the date and the place of the hearing by phone. the court also noted his reply in the telephone conversation that he had no longer lived at the address he had provided to the court, as well as his refusal to provide his new address, and rejected the complaint. on 20 july 2017 a judge of the supreme court of the russian federation refused to grant leave for the second cassation appeal against the decision of 21 december 2016.
the applicants are russian nationals who, at the material time, lived in the chechen republic or in the republic of ingushetia. the events concerned took place in areas under the full control of the russian federal forces. the next day the prosecutor summoned mr u.ts. it was suspended on 28 february 2005, 27 november 2006 and 4 june 2007 respectively. on 10 june 2006 and on 9 october 2008 the applicant asked the investigators to resume the proceedings and to allow her access to the case file. there is no information about further developments. they confirmed the account of the events as described by the applicants in their submissions to the court. on 23 january 2002 the investigators opened criminal case no. their requests were dismissed on 1 and 18 february 2007 respectively. at the material time the applicants and their sons were temporarily residing in ingushetia as refugees. about a month after the abduction, a man visited the second applicant and told her that mr murad zakriyev was detained at the main military base of the federal forces in khankala, chechnya. on 17 september 2003 the investigators questioned mr m.t., the first applicant was the mother of mr akhdan (also known as chingiz) akhmetkhanov, who was born in 1977. from the yard the applicants saw the service personnel walking away with mr akhdan akhmetkhanov towards the road to the town of urus‑martan. was abducted under similar circumstances. on 10 march 2010 the proceedings were resumed. the first applicant is the wife of mr magomed mestoyev, who was born in 1964. then the service personnel took him away for an identity check. the abductors told the head of the local council, ms n.a., on 11 august 2009 the applicants complained of an ineffective investigation to the chechen president and a number of local authorities. then the armed men broke into the house, took mr magomed umarov outside and drove him to an unknown destination in a grey uaz vehicle. on 25 june 2010 the court left the complaint without consideration because the investigation had been resumed. certain city districts were cordoned off with military vehicles. on 26 december 2004 the applicant was granted victim status in the criminal case. on 11 january 2005 the investigators questioned mr mayr-khadzhi gerikhanov’s sister, who stated that the commanding officer of the shali district had established that mr mayr-khadzhi gerikhanov’s abductors’ car had had the registration plate a452ax and that it had been seen entering the premises of military regiment no. her request was forwarded to the investigators. 44046 under article 126 of the cc (abduction). some of them had been wearing balaclavas and had spoken unaccented russian. the men asked mr abdula demelkhanov to show his identity documents. on 1 july 2016 the court rejected her claim, finding that the decision to suspend the investigation had already been annulled by the investigating authority.
the applicants claim to be the owners of the land at issue in the present case. it appears from the documents in the case‑file that the applicants along with two other persons own one third undivided shares of part of that property. a similar letter dated 26 february 1969 was notified to the applicants’ father sometime later. the latter concerned another piece of land consisting of around 22,480 square metres close to the sea (plot 60 ‑ hereinafter referred to as land b). sometime later pc was notified with an offer of compensation in the amount of 4,492 maltese liras (mtl), approximately 10,464 euros (eur) in respect of the six plots of land mentioned above. he refused to accept the amount of compensation. subsequently the commissioner of land (col) started the procedure before the land arbitration board (lab), in order to transfer the land and establish the amount of compensation to be paid. a part of the six plots of land were used for the purposes of the malta freeport (hereinafter land a). however, parts of the same six plots were not used for this purpose and land b remains unused to date. according to the government they were not left unused but simply not built, as they were used as a buffer zone for security purposes. in 1997 pc instituted constitutional redress proceedings concerning part of those six plots of land which had been taken but remained unused (land c). by a final judgment of 28 december 2001, the constitutional court found in favour of the applicants and declared the government’s declaration in respect of that land (which was outside the freeport zone) as without effect from the date of the first‑instance judgment, 9 april 1999. as a result of the constitutional court’s judgment, the proceedings before the lab were ceded by the col on 8 april 2003. as a result of the col’s action, no compensation was ever determined for the taking of the applicants’ remaining land (a and b). the freeport was eventually privatised in 2001 and sold to an international company in 2004. the government thus requested the court to determine the confines of the expropriated land, and thereafter the title of the applicants to the land in question. the government noted that both elements were necessary to define the juridical interest of the applicants. the parties agreed that they would attempt to find relevant documentation to this effect. according to the conclusions of a technical report drawn up on the matter by a court‑appointed architect in june 2009, land b as shown on the plans which were submitted by the applicants with the application to the civil court (first hall), included a piece of land which pc had already sold to a third party, the remaining parts which were expropriated were the property of the applicants. by a decree of 30 september 2010 the applicants as heirs of their parents who passed away intervened in the proceedings in their stead. by a judgment of 2 october 2013, the civil court (first hall) in its constitutional competence rejected the government’s objection as to non‑exhaustion of ordinary remedies and found in favour of the applicants in part. it found that there had been a violation of the convention provisions invoked in connection with land b which had remained unused in so far as the taking lacked any public interest. it thus declared the governor declaration in that respect to be null and void. it however rejected the applicants’ claims in connection with land a, which it considered had been taken from the applicants in the public interest. both the applicants and the defendants appealed. by a judgment of 30 may 2014 the constitutional court upheld the government’s appeal and rejected that lodged by the applicants. as to compensation in respect of land a, it considered that the applicants had not raised, before the first‑instance court, a complaint about a lack of proportionality, and thus they could not raise this matter on appeal. it followed that no compensation was due in that respect. as to land b, the constitutional court acknowledged that the government had not made any objection in the sense that the applicants were not the owners of the property, nor that proof was required as to ownership of that land. the latter court had, nevertheless, proceeded to give judgment, instead of allowing the applicants some time to institute a relevant procedure to determine their ownership of the property.
the applicant company has its registered office in essingen, germany. from the 1990s onwards the applicant company regularly purchased scrap metal from a. safaryan and associates llc, a limited liability company registered in armenia (“the llc”). the contract of 2 april 2003 contained the following dispute resolution clause:
“... 7. arbitration 7.1  the parties agree that any disputes and differences arising out of the performance of this contract shall be resolved through negotiations in order to reach a mutually beneficial resolution. 7.2  if it is not possible to settle such disputes amicably, these matters shall, with the exception of those falling within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts, be referred to the arbitration tribunal of the chamber of commerce of the country of the respondent. on 8 april 2002 kbks and the applicant company concluded an assignment agreement whereby kbks transferred all its contractual rights, including those towards the llc, to the applicant company. the purpose of the loan was to assist the llc in paying off a bank loan. it appears that it was not paid back to the applicant company. according to this agreement, the llc undertook to repay the debt in five instalments, with the first payment due by 15 december 2005. in subsequent correspondence, the director of the llc acknowledged the debt but deferred its repayment, each time providing different reasons. it also requested a waiver of the court fees. on 7 november 2007 the llc requested the commercial court to leave the applicant company’s claim unexamined on the grounds that the contracts of 8 february 1999, 10 april 2000 and 2 april 2003 contained a dispute resolution clause whereby disputes concerning their performance would be resolved by the arbitration tribunal of the chamber of commerce of the country of the respondent. on 16 november 2007 the commercial court granted the request and decided to leave the applicant company’s claim and the counterclaim lodged by the llc unexamined. it found that, as the contract of 2 april 2003 contained an arbitration clause, the agreement of 28 october 2005 was also subject to arbitration. on 10 december 2007 a three-judge bench of the commercial court rejected the complaint submitted by the applicant company. translations into armenian of extracts of the contracts containing the arbitration clause and copies of the two decisions of the commercial court were enclosed with the letter. on 1 august 2008 the president of the arbitration tribunal replied that the question of whether the arbitration clause stipulated in the contracts concluded between the parties was sufficient for it to accept the claim for examination could only be determined once the claim had been lodged. according to the applicant company, its representative told the registrar that the conclusion with the llc of this type of new agreement was at that point impossible and unreasonable, since the commercial court had already found that the arbitration clause contained in the contracts was sufficient to start arbitration proceedings. on 17 september 2008 the applicant company lodged a claim with the arbitration tribunal, seeking to recover eur 116,600, the amount of the loan and interest. on 7 october 2008 the president of the arbitration tribunal informed the applicant company that its request to start arbitration proceedings would not be granted. in view of the fact that the commercial court had been abolished by that time, on 17 october 2008 the applicant company lodged a claim with the yerevan civil court, seeking to recover eur 116,600 from the llc, representing the amount of the loan and interest. on 13 march 2009 the district court accepted the case for examination. the district court further referred to the previous findings of the commercial court to conclude that the claim should be left unexamined. on 25 june 2009 the applicant company lodged an appeal. it argued, in particular, that the arbitration tribunal had been provided with the decisions of the commercial court and the contracts concluded between the parties. having examined them, it had concluded that it had no jurisdiction to determine the dispute. in its reply to the applicant company’s appeal, the llc submitted, inter alia, that the applicant company had failed to provide the arbitration tribunal with copies of the relevant extracts of the contracts that contained the arbitration clause and the relevant decisions of the commercial court. therefore, the tribunal had refused to accept the claim. on 21 july 2009 the civil court of appeal upheld the decision of 16 june 2009. in doing so, it stated the following:
“... as for the letter of the president of the arbitration tribunal of the chamber of commerce of 7 october 2008 concerning non-acceptance of the claim lodged by [the applicant company], it was based on the grounds that [the applicant company] had not submitted the original arbitration agreement or a certified copy, as required by the commercial arbitration act and [the provisions contained therein], in the absence of which arbitration proceedings could not be started.
the applicant was born in 1925 and lives in brighton. in 2005 the applicant began participating in demonstrations organised by smash edo. serious disorder and criminality were features of a number of smash edo protests. smash edo protests therefore attracted a substantial policing presence. sixty‑six entries from nominal records for other individuals and information reports which incidentally mentioned him, concerning incidents between march 2005 and october 2009, were disclosed to him. in some cases his appearance was also described. in august 2010 the applicant asked the association of chief police officers (“acpo”) to delete entries from nominal records and information reports which mentioned him. in september 2010 acpo declined to do so. following the judicial review proceedings, the applicant wrote to the police to make a further subject access request. of the four additional records, two concerned references to the domestic legal proceedings by third parties. the government indicated in their submissions that one of those has since been deleted. there is no indication of whether there was any police presence or arrests at that event. the government stated that the police could not provide any explanation of why the reports were not disclosed previously. however, they were investigating the matter. with the agreement of the parties, the commissioner of police of the metropolis was joined as a defendant. the applicant was granted permission to appeal by the court of appeal on 31 october 2012. following a two day hearing during which legal representatives for the applicant, an ngo, the nhri for england and wales, acpo and the secretary of state presented their arguments, the court of appeal unanimously allowed the appeal in a judgment of 14 march 2014. it is striking that [the national coordinator] does not say that the information held on mr catt over many years has in fact been of any assistance to the police at all. it should not be overlooked that the burden of proving that the interference with mr catt’s article 8 rights is justified rests on the respondent. this is very much a live issue given the relatively vague nature of some aspects of the regime contained in the mopi code and guidance and the criticisms voiced by the divisional court in c (paragraph [54]) [see “relevant domestic law and practice”, below] and by the strasbourg court in m.m. lord sumption delivered the leading opinion for the majority. he set out the applicable legal framework for collection and retention of data. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 99, echr 2008, he concluded that the interference was in accordance with the law. lord sumption then turned to consider the proportionality of the interference. while the information stored was personal information because it related to individuals, it was in no sense intimate or sensitive information. rather, it was information about the overt activities in public places of individuals whose main object in attending the events in question was to draw public attention to their support for a cause. referring back to the national coordinator’s statement (see paragraphs 18 to 20), he identified three reasons for the need to retain such data: (1) to enable the police to make a more informed assessment of the risks and threats to public order; (2) to investigate criminal offences where there have been any, and to identify potential witnesses and victims; (3) to study the leadership, organisation, tactics and methods of protest groups which have been persistently associated with violence. lord toulson, dissenting, agreed that the collection and retention of the data by the police was in accordance with the law. as to the suggestion that it would place too great a burden on the police to undertake frequent reviews, lord toulson pointed out that there was no evidence from the police that this would be over-burdensome. on the contrary, he said, the thrust of the evidence was that they did carry out regular reviews so there was nothing to indicate that deleting their historic records of the applicant’s attendances at protest events would create any real burden.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in buseck. in january 2005, the applicant and the owners of the other three properties instigated independent evidentiary proceedings before the regional court against the property developers on the basis of alleged defects in the residential property units, in particular the water drainage system. wrote a report dated 16 july 2005 and presented his findings to the court, most recently in a hearing held on 30 march 2007. who had already been involved in the independent evidentiary proceedings. on the following day, it sent the case file to h.k. the parties several times exchanged submissions and suggestions regarding the basis for a friendly settlement. informed the parties that another onsite visit was necessary; this finally took place on 22 october 2008. on 5 january 2009 the regional court requested h.k. replied to that request by stating that he needed to undergo urgent medical surgery, which he assumed would result in a delay of at least eight weeks. the regional court informed the parties of this and invited them to submit comments. on 12 may 2009 the regional court asked the chamber of commerce to suggest potential replacement experts. on 2 july 2009 the applicant’s representative returned the file to the court. on 25 september 2009 the regional court amended the decision to order an expert opinion (see paragraph 10 above) and ordered an expert opinion from g.k. ( the following four months were dominated by a dispute between g.k., the dispute lasted until the middle of january 2010. on 10 august 2010 the regional court again asked g.k. invited the parties to participate in another onsite visit, which was scheduled for 28 october 2010. however, the visit had to be rescheduled several times – once because the defendants were unable to attend and three times because the applicant was unable to attend; eventually the visit took place on 17 january 2011. on 4 may 2011, the applicant complained about the length of time it was taking for the expert to prepare his opinion. on 8 august 2011 the regional court forwarded the expert opinion to the parties and asked them to submit comments within five weeks. on 11 may 2012 the regional court asked h.k. for his views on the comments of the parties regarding his expert opinion. ’s wife informed the regional court that he had fallen ill, again, and that it was unclear when he would recover. on 22 june 2012 the applicant applied for an extension of the deadline for the submission of comments. on 12 october 2012 the oral hearing took place and the parties agreed on a friendly settlement. on 23 july 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint with the court of appeal in which she sought compensation, alleging that the civil proceedings had been excessively lengthy. the court of appeal ruled that any assessment of the reasonableness of the length of proceedings had to start with the principle that a court must conduct proceedings expeditiously. lastly, an overall assessment of whether the length of proceedings had been reasonable had to be carried out, with regard being paid to the circumstances of the case – in particular the complexity and difficulty of the proceedings. in application of these principles, the court of appeal assessed all phases of the proceedings and reasoned that the regional court had generally expedited the proceedings sufficiently and that it had caused a delay only in the summer of 2010 because it had failed to sufficiently instruct the expert at the time in question and had failed to undertake the measures necessary to ensure that the expert submitted his opinion in good time. furthermore, it had to be taken into account that the proceedings had been complex; this had in particular been due to the complexity of the relevant facts and the difficulty in gathering evidence.
the first applicant is the widow and the second applicant is the son of the late john demjanjuk. they were born in 1925 and 1965, respectively, and live in ohio, the united states of america. on 12 may 2011 the munich regional court ii, after 91 days of trial, convicted john demjanjuk on 16 counts as an accessory to the murder of at least 28,060 persons. it found it established that he had, in his capacity as a guard in the sobibór extermination camp, aided and abetted the systematic murder of persons who had been deported to the said camp in 16 convoys between 27 march 1943 and september 1943. it sentenced him to a total of five years’ imprisonment for these crimes. the judgment ran to 220 pages plus appendices. both the accused and the public prosecutor filed appeals on points of law against that judgment. defence counsel submitted a brief containing the grounds for the appeal on points of law in november 2011 and subsequently submitted four additional briefs, the last of which was received by the regional court on 12 january 2012. on 24 february 2012, the public prosecutor’s office instructed that the file, along with the submissions by the public prosecutor’s office in response to the defence counsel’s submissions, be transferred to the federal court of justice, which was competent to examine the appeal on points of law. at that time, the federal court of justice had not yet received the case file. by decision of 5 april 2012 the munich regional court ii discontinued the proceedings in accordance with article 206a § 1 of the code of criminal procedure due to the death of the accused (see paragraph 14 below). the regional court reasoned as follows:
“... the accused had been convicted on 16 counts as an accessory to murder after 91 days of trial with a comprehensive taking of evidence. the conviction was based on a thorough examination of the evidence as to the facts and an assessment of all relevant legal aspects. even though the conviction could not become final in the absence of a decision on the appeal on points of law, article 467 § 1 of the code of criminal procedure did not apply. the procedural impediment occurred after the judgment convicting the applicant had been handed down. the duration of the trial, which had lasted for almost one and a half years, was attributable, to a significant degree, to the time-consuming strategy pursued by the defence. likewise, the defence had filed more than twenty complaints alleging bias with regard to each of the professional judges sitting on the case, again often repeating arguments and considerations that had already been ruled on. it would have been possible to conclude the trial within a few months, while fully respecting defence rights, if the defence had exercised its procedural rights in a targeted, structured and technical manner. it would thus have been possible to conclude the proceedings, with a final verdict, during the lifetime of the accused. on 17 april 2012 counsel submitted powers of attorney from the applicants in the present case. on 4 october 2012 the munich court of appeal dismissed the immediate appeal as inadmissible due to a lack of standing. the procedural status as an accused in criminal proceedings was personal in nature and could not be transferred, including by way of inheritance. in respect of the late accused, it had ceased because of his death. the court of appeal went on to state that the immediate appeal was, in addition, ill-founded. article 6 § 2 of the convention had not been breached. 123, it considered that the decision not to reimburse the late accused’s necessary expenses did not breach that provision, as it did not contain a finding of guilt, which the decision itself explicitly stated. it was permissible, in view of the establishment of the late accused’s guilt by the trial court, to find that there continued to be, at the time the proceedings were discontinued, a state of suspicion against the late accused, and to apply article 467 § 3, second sentence, number 2, of the code of criminal procedure on that basis. on 12 october 2012 counsel filed a complaint to be heard, which the court of appeal dismissed as ill-founded on 15 november 2012. on 18 december 2014 the federal constitutional court declined to consider the applicants’ constitutional complaint (no. 2 bvr 2397/12), without providing reasons.
the applicant was born in 1973 and lives in glendale, california, the united states of america. the applicant worked in the british council’s armenia office (hereinafter “the british council”) as a project manager on a full-time, permanent contract starting from 25 november 2002. in the course of her employment the applicant had two children, born on 27 march 2008 and 7 may 2010. the applicant spent her maternity leave in the united states and regularly sent requests to extend that leave every six months for the duration of her absence. in particular, she sent such requests in march and september 2009 as regards her first child and then in april and september 2010 as regards her second child. it appears that the applicant’s maternity leave was extended, based on those requests. in march 2011 her leave was further extended until 1 september 2011. according to the applicant, on 19 august 2011 she requested another extension of her maternity leave. she handed an envelope with her written request to that effect to her friend h.k., who was to return to armenia on 17 august 2011 after a visit to the united states. on 30 september 2011 the applicant received notice of termination of her employment contract prior to its term. the notice referred to the change in volume and conditions of work at the british council, as well as the need to reduce the number of staff. in addition, the notice stated the following:
“... [your] employment contract shall be terminated based on [the relevant provisions] of the labour code of the republic of armenia. it appears that the applicant sent emails to the management of the british council in relation to the early termination of her employment. a lawyer and a representative of prudence, a law firm which provided legal services to the british council, replied to the applicant on behalf of that body. in particular, the email stated that the termination of the applicant’s employment had been in full compliance with domestic law and the terms and conditions of the british council. on 30 december 2011 the applicant brought a claim against the british council before the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan, contesting the order of 1 december 2011 and seeking reinstatement. according to a power of attorney executed by a notary public in london on 12 january 2012, the british council authorised, inter alia, ar.m. another lawyer with prudence, to represent jointly or separately its interests before courts of all instances in armenia. on 16 january 2012 the british council was notified by the district court of its taking over of the examination of the case and the judge appointed. it appears that during the whole trial before the district court, k.b. the british council denied that the applicant had submitted a request to extend her maternity leave for another six months as of 1 september 2011. furthermore, the law firm prudence, of which ar.m. were senior associates, had been founded by d.m., ’s elder sister, and was managed by her husband, e.m. the government claimed that no such issue had been raised, nor had any evidence to support such a claim been provided. on 28 september 2012 the civil court of appeal upheld the district court’s judgment. in doing so, the court of appeal did not address the applicant’s arguments regarding the alleged lack of impartiality of judge a.m. in the proceedings before the district court. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, raising similar arguments to those submitted in her previous appeal. on 28 november 2012 the court of cassation declared the applicant’s appeal on points of law inadmissible for lack of merit.
the first applicant, mr aleksandr viktorovich ivanov, is a ukrainian national who was born in 1956. on 10 july 1997 the supreme court of ukraine upheld that judgment and it became final. according to his medical file, that result was confirmed following further tests on 29 march and 1 april 1996. according to the applicant, no further examination or medical treatment was carried out following the above-mentioned test. in the course of those examinations he did not raise any health complaints. he was recommended to undergo an in-depth clinical immunology examination. there is no information in the case file as to whether that recommendation was followed up. the examination revealed that he was apparently in good health. on 25 june 2008, following a regular medical examination by a specialist in infectious diseases, the applicant was diagnosed with stage 2 hiv infection (the cd-4 count was 176 cells). he was prescribed a course of antiretroviral therapy(“the art”). he was diagnosed with hiv infection (second clinical stage with a cd-4 count of 437 cells) and chronic hepatitis c with minimal activity. the parties did not inform the court about the treatment the applicant was provided with after december 2011. the second applicant, mr vladimir mikhaylovich kashuba, was a ukrainian national who was born in 1958. at the time of his death (8 january 2018 – see paragraph 6 above), he was serving a life sentence in ladyzhynka colony no. on 7 september 2000 the second applicant was arrested on suspicion of aggravated robbery and murder. on 8 september 2001 the applicant was transferred to the vinnytsya sizo. upon arrival at the lutsk sizo in september 2000, the second applicant was examined by the sizo medical personnel and placed under monitoring as a person who had suffered tuberculosis (tb). according to the applicant, in march 2003 he underwent a medical check and was diagnosed with tb. from june to august 2003 he did not receive any treatment. the parties did not specify the nature of that treatment. on 30 march 2004 he was examined by another tuberculosis specialist and was diagnosed with spontaneously cured tb (спонтанно вилікуваний туберкульоз), and tuberculoma of the upper part of the left lung. the parties did not specify whether the applicant had been prescribed and had received any treatment during the above-mentioned period of time. he was prescribed some treatment, the nature of which was not specified by the parties. on 3 september 2007, 29 february and 1 september 2008, 1 march and 1 september 2009, and 26 february 2010 the applicant was prescribed a season’s course of anti-relapse treatment and a special diet. the second applicant submitted that he was forced to remain in a bent position with his arms handcuffed behind his back during regular searches of his cell, for outside walks, and on the way to take showers. he provided the following description of the above-mentioned events. upon completion of the search, the applicant was taken back to the cell, the handcuffs were removed and he was allowed to stand up straight once the cell door had been closed. the inmates were escorted by a group of prison guards and dogs. the water in the shower was sometimes cold and the shower itself lasted five minutes. the applicant was provided with 100 grams of soap per month for his hygiene needs.
according to the most recently available information, at the time of the events in june 2016 the applicant was detained in kirovograd pre-trial detention facility no. in january 2013 the applicant started serving a sentence of ten years’ imprisonment for murder. in april 2014 the applicant’s health deteriorated. he complained of fever, abdominal pain and vomiting. following his examination in kirovograd regional hospital, the applicant was diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis (calculi within the gallbladder) and acute chronic gastroduodenitis. on 11 april 2014 the applicant complained of feeling unwell to the prison medical unit. according to the case-file material, he was not prescribed medical treatment. on 22 august 2014 the applicant further complained to the prison medical unit of feeling unwell. he was diagnosed with acute chronic gastroduodenitis and was prescribed dietary treatment for three days. on 6, 8 and 13 october and 5 november 2014, and 6 march 2015, in response to further complaints by the applicant, he was prescribed outpatient treatment. according to the government, the outpatient treatment consisted of medicine, which was administered to the applicant in various combinations, notably, papaverine, co-trimixazole, azithromycin, and bromhexin. the parties did not inform the court whether the applicant had undergone the recommended examination. from 2 to 29 may and from 3 to 11 june 2015 the applicant underwent inpatient treatment for acute chronic gastroduodenitis in the prison medical unit. according to the government, he was administered the prescribed medication and his state of health improved. on 10 july 2015 he was examined by a general practitioner of kirovograd city hospital, who confirmed the earlier diagnoses and recommended inpatient treatment and dietary treatment. the applicant alleged that the treatment which he had received there had been inadequate and had led to an aggravation of his condition. he also alleged that surgery for his calculus cholecystitis had been scheduled but had not been performed owing to lack of funds. on 21 september 2015 he was transferred back to the prison. in the meantime he had been detained in the kyiv sizo and the odessa sizo. furthermore, he allegedly had no mattress to sleep on. on 30 december 2015 he was early released from the disciplinary cell. on 12 october 2015 the applicant’s lawyer complained to the kirovograd regional prosecutor’s office that the applicant was not receiving the requisite medical care in detention. he submitted, in particular, that the surgery which the applicant required had been postponed owing to the lack of funds. he prescribed the applicant medication and recommended elective surgery. on 9 november 2015 the prison service of kirovograd region sent a request for the applicant’s placement in the hospital in bucha prison no. on 9 december 2015 this request was refused owing to the lack of available places in the hospital. on 27 january 2016 the prison service took a decision on the applicant’s transfer to the hospital for the required surgery. on 12 february 2016 the applicant informed the prison governor that he had refused the treatment offered to him in the hospitals within the dnipropetrovsk and kharkiv sizos because of lack of trust in the doctors of those facilities. on the same day the applicant gave his consent to receive treatment at any other medical institution. the government did not provide documentary evidence in respect of that statement.
the applicants were born in 1976, 1981, 1995 and 1989 respectively and live in karcsa. on 3 september 2013 the applicants, riding in a car driven by the first applicant, arrived at a petrol station in sátoraljaújhely, at about midnight. when the first applicant produced his id, the officers made derogatory remarks about the applicants’ roma origin. two additional police cars arrived and the applicants were transported to the sátoraljaújhely police station. at the police station, the second applicant’s trousers were pulled off and his testicles squeezed; he was repeatedly hit and kicked and his back was injured with a sharp object. the fourth applicant was handcuffed, led to a round table inside the police station, his handcuffs were attached to a leg of the table and his leg was then kicked so that he fell under the table, where he was repeatedly kicked or hit in the head. as a result of the beating, his wrist broke. when the first applicant asked for a doctor, this was refused by the officers who said that he could have a doctor once he was dead. intimidated, the other applicants signed the waiver. the applicants were yelling gross insults at them. all applicants were then transferred to the police station where they were held until after 3 a.m. 17. similarly, the criminal complaint filed by the applicants had not contained any reference to what the first applicant stated in his subsequent testimony, namely that he had been kicked in the head – his left temple – on the flight of steps leading to the entrance of the police station. according to the first applicant, his son, the third applicant, had also seen this. however, the latter had not been able to corroborate this in his testimony. furthermore, the fourth applicant alleged that he had suffered a fracture of his left scaphoid bone after he had fallen under the table following being handcuffed to the table leg, where one of the police officers had kept kicking him every ten to fifteen minutes for four to five hours, from the beginning of his detention until his release. he alleged that most of the kicks had hit his head and that there had even been a footprint on his head. the third applicant stated initially that he had been hit by one of the officers at the petrol station, and that his arm had then been tightly squeezed while he had been escorted to the patrol car. later however, he alleged that he had been hit on the back of the head and his arm while inside the patrol car but had not otherwise been assaulted. he could not give an acceptable explanation for this contradiction. in their testimonies, both the first and the second applicants said that they had been placed in two adjacent detention rooms and repeatedly assaulted every ten to fifteen minutes by several officers for hours on end, involving many blows. the applicants were examined at sátoraljaújhely hospital at about 6 p.m. on 4 september 2013. the second applicant sustained suffusions on his neck and right upper arm, abrasions on his back and lower right arm, and erythema on both wrists. the case was investigated by the miskolc investigation office and, subsequently, by the debrecen bureau of the central prosecutorial investigation office. on 16 april 2014 the independent police complaints board, which had been approached by the applicants’ lawyer in parallel to the proceedings outlined above, issued a report on the first applicant’s case. it found that handcuffing him had not been justified in the circumstances and had been contrary to human dignity, especially since his hands had been handcuffed behind his back. with regard to the remainder of the issues, namely the first applicant’s rights to health, human dignity, equal treatment and non-discrimination, the board identified no breach of his fundamental rights, essentially for want of conclusive evidence and because there had been differing versions of events that could not be reconciled. its conclusions were similar to those in the first applicant’s case. as regards the broken scaphoid bone, the expert found that it was an inveterate lesion that had occurred at least six to eight months prior to the incident. on 21 august 2014 the investigation office discontinued the prosecution against the police officers. it pointed out that the witness testimonies and the audio recordings refuted the applicants’ allegations of racist motivation and utterances.
the applicants were born in 1997 and 1999 respectively and live in bucharest. on 20 july 2010 x, the applicants’ sister, nine-year-old at the time, was grievously injured in a car accident. she was immediately admitted to hospital where, after four days of intense suffering, she died. a criminal investigation for involuntary manslaughter was initiated against the driver of the car. it was established that while driving at about ninety‑two kilometres per hour (when the speed limit was fifty kilometres per hour) she lost control of her car and mounted the pavement where the applicants’ sister was situated. on 26 september 2010, during the pre-trial investigation stage, the applicants, their mother and their older brothers brought a claim for damages in the criminal proceedings. on 24 october 2011 the bucharest district court severed the civil claims from the criminal proceedings. on 6 december 2011 the bucharest district court awarded each civil party (including the applicants) 100,000 euros (eur) in compensation for non‑pecuniary damage. it ordered the driver’s insurance company to pay the damages. the court held that between the civil parties and the nine‑year‑old girl there had been a strong emotional relationship and the girl’s violent death had caused intense pain to her family. the wording of the court judgment read as follows:
“...the brothers of the deceased suffered non-pecuniary damage, consisting of the pain caused by the loss of their nine-year-old sister in violent circumstances and by their sister’s suffering in the hospital until her death; from the evidence adduced before the court (the statements of the civil parties were corroborated by the statements of three witnesses) it can be determined that between the civil parties and the nine-year-old girl there was a strong emotional relationship. therefore, having regard to the negative consequences, the importance of the infringed moral values, the way in which they were perceived by the civil parties, and the impact of their loss on the stability of their family, the court will grant to each civil party the equivalent of 100,000 euros”. all the parties appealed against the judgment. no new pieces of evidence were adduced before the bucharest court of appeal. on 9 april 2012 the bucharest court of appeal allowed the appeal on points of law lodged by the insurance company. it ordered the driver of the car to pay the damages, holding that the insurance company’s liability was only contractual and therefore subsidiary. the court further dismissed the applicants’ claim for non-pecuniary damages on the ground that at the time of their sister’s accident they had been younger than fourteen and had therefore been unaware of the negative consequences of her death. in relation to the claims lodged by their older siblings, the court decreased the awards to eur 25,000 each. the wording of the court judgment read as follows:
“the court will dismiss the civil claims lodged by cosmin mihai deaconu and alexandru bogdan deaconu on grounds other than those invoked by the insurance company. in the present case, the applicants’ situation should be assessed in a different way, having regard to the fact that at the time of their minor sister’s accident they were younger than fourteen and therefore they were not aware of the negative consequences of her death. this aspect was apparent to persons who had a close relationship with the deceased’s family; thus, witness n.g.g. contended in her statement before the court that the younger brothers were less aware than their older brothers, who suffered...” 14. the court also decreased the award for their mother in respect of non‑pecuniary damage to eur 50,000.
from 22 july 2016 the applicant was held in the chernigiv pre-trial detention centre (“the sizo”) as a suspect in respect of a crime. on 8 september 2016, while being held at the sizo, the applicant suffered acute myocardial infarction. he was treated at kozeletsk town hospital from 8 until 19 september 2016. on 27 september and 6 october 2016 the applicant underwent examinations at the chernigiv regional cardiological centre. he was diagnosed with ischemic heart disease; acute myocardial infarction; third‑stage hypertonic disease; a hypertensive heart; and second-degree heart failure. the applicant was prescribed outpatient medical treatment and a further heart examination. on the last mentioned date he was recommended to undergo a cardiac ventriculography test. on 7 february 2017, in response to a request for information lodged by the chernigiv regional prosecutor’s office, chernihiv city hospital (“the hospital”) noted that the applicant’s state of health posed a high risk to his life. on 15 march 2017, the hospital informed the sizo authorities that the cost of a cardiac ventriculography test was 4,000 hryvnias (uah – approximately 140 euros (eur)). there is no information regarding whether that test was undertaken. following a deterioration in the applicant’s health, on 23 may 2017 the court indicated to the government under rule 39 of the rules of court that they should immediately ensure that the recommended treatment was available and provided to the applicant and that the applicant was placed in a specialised medical institution for medical treatment – including surgery, if appropriate. on 23 may 2017 the applicant was transported to the hospital, where the previous diagnosis was confirmed (see paragraph 8 above). on the same day he was returned to the sizo and provided with outpatient treatment. on 25 may 2017 the hospital informed the sizo that in order for the applicant to be provided with qualified medical advice, he needed a cardiac ventriculography test. in view of the complexity of the applicant’s state of health, before the cardiac ventriculography test the hospital requested that the applicant have an additional consultation at the amosov cardiology institute. according to the government, the sizo administration offered the applicant transportation to the kyiv sizo in a prison van with a view to his undergoing a further medical examination at the amosov cardiology institute. on 16 june 2017 the applicant refused that offer, arguing that he could not be transported in a prison van owing to his state of health. the case file contains a statement by the applicant dated 16 june 2017 addressed to the head of the sizo, according to which he did not refuse transportation but insisted on it being in a form that was compatible with his state of health. following a further deterioration in the applicant’s health, on 22 june 2017 the ambulance took him to the hospital, where the previous diagnosis (see paragraph 8 above) was confirmed, electrocardiography and cardiac ventriculography tests were recommended, and he was prescribed some medication. the case file contains an extract from the applicant’s medical file bearing no date and signed by the head of the sizo medical unit; according to the extract, the sizo had no cardiologist on its staff and high-quality medical treatment was not possible at the sizo. the applicant did not receive the prescribed medication in full owing to a lack of funds. the extract furthermore stated that he remained under the supervision of the sizo medical staff and did not require inpatient medical treatment. on 10 july 2017 the court reiterated its previous decision (see paragraph 11 above) indicating that the authorities were to ensure that the applicant was transported promptly, and in conditions commensurate with his state of health, to a specialised medical institution to undergo the necessary medical examinations, such as a cardiac ventriculography test, in order that a correct diagnosis could be made and the applicant could receive medical treatment, if necessary. on 8 august 2017 the government submitted that the applicant had not been transported to a specialised medical institution, as had been indicated by the court, owing to his refusal of 16 june 2017 (see paragraph 14 above). according to the available information, from august 2016 until september 2017 the applicant underwent more than fifteen examinations, both within the sizo and at civilian hospitals, and an ambulance was called twelve times to provide him with urgent treatment. on an unspecified date the applicant was released from custody. on 7 november 2017 he underwent an examination at the amosov cardiology institute. according to the results of the examination, he was diagnosed with ischemic heart disease, exertional angina (class iii), postinfarction cardiosclerosis, and atherosclerosis of the aorta and of the coronary arteries. it was recommended that he undergo surgery for his ischemic heart disease, together with further inpatient treatment. there is no information regarding whether the applicant has undergone the recommended surgery and treatment.
the applicant company is a legal entity registered in mažeikiai. the investigation covered the applicant company’s activities between 2002 and 2004. it argued that the competition council had committed procedural violations and that it had also made mistakes in defining the scope of the market and the scope of the geographical market, and that its ruling that the applicant company had abused its dominant position on the fuel market had thus been unjustified. the applicant company was also dissatisfied with the level of the fine and was of the view that that it had been disproportionate. on 28 june 2008 the vilnius regional administrative court stated the following. the court found that the competition council had committed some procedural violations and decided to annul parts of its decision. the court also examined the case on the merits. in order to establish the scope of the market, it was necessary to investigate further. the court thus decided to return the case to the competition council for additional investigation (grąžinti bylą konkurencijos tarybai atlikti papildomą tyrimą). it submitted that the investigation of the applicant company’s activities had covered the period between 2002 and 2004. although the initial investigation had not mentioned the end date of the actions examined, it could be presumed that the last investigated action had been undertaken on 31 december 2004. on 25 may 2009 the vilnius regional administrative court dismissed the applicant company’s complaint. the applicant company lodged an appeal, which was dismissed by the supreme administrative court on 13 may 2010. in order to comply with the decision of the supreme administrative court of 8 december 2008 (see paragraph 11 above), on 16 december 2010 the competition council carried out an additional investigation into the applicant company’s activities. the applicant company raised an issue regarding the limitation period, claiming that it had expired and that the competition council therefore had to terminate the investigation. the competition council was of the view that a limitation period had to be calculated from the time at which the economic entity in question had ceased engaging in unlawful activity. one of the breaches committed by the applicant company had started in 2002; one had started in 2003; and the rest had started in 2004. there was no information that the applicant company had ended its unlawful activities (except for one of them). thus, the three‑year limitation period had not even started to run. otherwise, it would have been impossible for the competition council to rectify the shortcomings in its decision owing to the length of the court proceedings. the calculation of the limitation period provided by the applicant company was favourable to other economic entities that had breached the law on competition. such economic entities would only have to behave in such a manner as to ensure that the court proceedings in respect of their own behaviour lasted for a long time. the competition council decided that the provisions of the code of administrative offences had to be applied in the applicant company’s case and that – irrespective of the rules of the law on competition – the time-limit had to be calculated from the day on which the supreme administrative court had adopted its decision. the applicant company argued, inter alia, that the law on competition set the most serious economic sanctions of all those provided under the lithuanian legal system and that such high fines threatened the continuity of the activities of economic entities and that because of that it was logical that the law provided that the limitation period could not be suspended or renewed. the competition council was of the view that the limitation period had not started running before 22 december 2005 and that even if it had, it must have stopped when the competition council had adopted its decision (see paragraph 8 above). the applicant company appealed, raising the issue of the limitation period. on 21 january 2013 the supreme administrative court upheld the arguments of the vilnius regional administrative court (see paragraph 18 above). it added that there was disagreement between the parties about the dates on which the applicant company had committed violations. moreover, the circumstances of the instant case and the one in which the decision of 21 june 2012 has been adopted, are not the same or so similar that they could be examined similarly. the court did however lower the fine to ltl 7,819,450 (approximately eur 2,264,669).
the applicants are shareholders of two savings banks, namely kinizsi bank zrt. (“ mohácsi bank”), and of one savings cooperative, pátria takarékszövetkezet (“pátria cooperative”). kinizsi bank and mohácsi bank were established in 1958 and used to operate as savings cooperatives. their clientele was mostly from the local community. with the active support of the hungarian state and the phare program of the european union, they entered into an integration agreement. otiva, on the one hand, improved the security of deposits placed with the savings cooperatives by supplementing the national deposit insurance fund (országos betétbiztosítási alap – “oba”), and, on the other hand, served to prevent crisis situations and improved the stability of savings cooperatives. they however remained members of otiva and part of the above-mentioned integration. furthermore, ninety-one cooperative credit institutions were obliged to commit reserves, in eight cases a serious crisis situation was established and some required a capital injection from the integration organisation (see paragraph 18 below). according to the government, basing its findings on the data collected after the integration act came into force, considering the capital/loan ratio, thirty-nine cooperative credit institutions would not have been in a position to ensure profitable operations without the new measures. cxxxv of 2013 on the integration of cooperative credit institutions and the amendment of certain laws regarding economic matters (“the integration act”) entered into force. it was then amended in several aspects, including by act no. it made the cooperative credit institutions ipso jure members of the integration organisation and shareholders of the savings bank. apart from the cooperative credit institutions, the savings bank and the hungarian development bank (magyar fejlesztési bank zrt. – “ due to the changes in the ownership of the savings bank pursuant to the integration act (see in particular, sections 13 and 20, cited in paragraph 39 below) the shareholding of kinizsi bank and mohácsi bank in the savings bank changed. while the two banks previously possessed 0.15% and 2.27% respectively in the savings bank, they had a 0.12% and 1.83% stake respectively following the implementation of the integration act. the integration organisation’s assets are included in the consolidated own funds of the savings bank and the cooperative credit institutions. in july 2013 banks could leave the integration if they were each able to provide an additional huf 2 billion, approximately eur 6 million, as for the creation of a new bank. moreover, following the amendment of the integration act, the cooperative credit institutions were obliged to deposit an amount equivalent to the value of the share capital they had had at the time of the establishment of their membership in the integration organisation to a separate account at the savings bank for 730 days (sections 11(7) and (8), and 20/a(12) and (13) of the integration act; see also paragraph 43 below). at least one bank, to which the integration act applied, decided to exit the system and this decision was accepted by the supervisory authority. following the entry into force of the integration act, the savings bank’s capital was increased by huf 654,986,000 to huf 3,389,704,000 (approximately eur 10 million) from the previous amount of huf 2,735,038,000. in 2014 its stake in the savings bank was sold, through a bidding process, to one company. minutes of the general meetings and meetings of the board of directors of the cooperative credit institutions must always be submitted to the savings bank, and minutes of the supervisory board meetings must be sent to the savings bank in certain cases. the integration organisation is entitled to suspend the voting rights of the shareholders of the cooperative credit institution for one year if they threaten the reliable and secure operation of the cooperative credit institutions (see section 17/c(5), cited in paragraph 39 below). these cases did not concern kinizsi bank or mohácsi bank. however, the shareholders of the two banks who disagreed with the resolution adopting the aforementioned memorandum challenged it in court. on 12 march 2015 the pécs high court found for the plaintiffs in the case brought by the mohacsi bank’s shareholders. on 30 march 2015 a similar judgment was given by the veszprém high court in a case brought by the shareholders of kinizsi bank. however, both banks were able to comply with the new requirement. the applicants submitted that the required data had been submitted in due time. the government averred that several further sets of proceedings were pending before hungarian courts in which kinizsi bank or mohácsi bank or their shareholders had sought a remedy against certain decisions of the savings bank or the integration organisation.

the applicant was born in 1935 and lives in the town of snizhne, donetsk region. on 14 january 2004 the applicant’s son, born in 1967, was found dead in the applicant’s barn. on the same day police officers inspected the scene and reported that the man had committed suicide by hanging. on 24 january 2004 the investigator of the snizhne prosecutor’s office, following the pre-investigation inquiries, refused to initiate criminal proceedings on the grounds that no elements of a crime had been established in relation to the death of the applicant’s son. on 11 february 2004, following a forensic medical examination, an expert concluded that the applicant’s son’s death had been caused by strangulation by a loop of rope, possibly as a result of the applicant’s son’s body weight pulling against the rope. on 5 april 2005 the donetsk regional prosecutor’s office quashed the decision of 24 january 2004 (see paragraph 6 above) as premature and unfounded, finding that further pre-investigation inquiries were necessary given that the possible reasons for suicide had not been examined, and other relatives as well as acquaintances of the deceased had not been questioned either. numerous investigating instructions were given. in the course of further pre-investigation inquiries, between 2005 and 2012, the investigators took measures to establish the circumstances of the applicant’s son’s death. they questioned various persons, and ordered numerous additional medical examinations of the corpse of the deceased. at a certain point medical experts noted that the applicant’s son’s body had numerous fractures. the experts opined that all those fractures had been inflicted after the applicant’s son’s death, possibly during the exhumation of the body. the applicant’s husband informed the authorities that when he had seen his dead son in the barn, the corpse of his son had been in a sitting position and the rope loop had not been tightened. the applicant argued that it had not been suicide but a violent murder. she advanced different theories, suspecting notably: police security guards who had allegedly taken the applicant’s son from a local bar, following which he had been found dead; a local police officer who had engaged in a dispute with the applicant’s son; a woman who had been employed by the applicant’s son in his textile business and her husband; the applicant’s son’s brothers-in-law; a business partner of the applicant’s son; and people from a local gambling club (the applicant’s son had been engaged in transporting money from the club to another town). on 25 april 2005, 26 march 2006, 20 august 2008, 17 february and 12 december 2011, 15 february 2012 and 17 september 2012, following the pre-investigation inquiries, the investigators refused to initiate criminal proceedings on the grounds that no elements of a crime had been established. those decisions were quashed as unsubstantiated by the supervising authorities, which found that further investigative measures were necessary. numerous investigating instructions were given. on 7 december 2012 the applicant, relying on the new code of criminal procedure of 2012, requested that an investigation be opened in respect of the alleged murder of her son. on the same day criminal proceedings were instituted. on 24 december 2012, 22 july and 30 september 2013 the criminal proceedings were terminated because no elements of a crime could be established. those decisions were quashed by the supervising authorities as unsubstantiated and further investigations were ordered. in particular, on 5 december 2013 the snizhne town court quashed the decision of 30 september 2013 after finding that the investigation had not been thorough and comprehensive. the court noted the theory of the possible involvement of the local police had not been properly examined, the role of the applicant’s son’s brother-in-law had not been clarified even though he might have been the first to find the dead body, the applicant had not been questioned on all the issues which were relevant to the case, and the evidence relating to the applicant’s son’s suicidal tendencies had not been assessed. on 1 april 2014 the criminal proceedings were closed one more time on the ground that no elements of a crime could be established.
the applicant was born in 1925 and at the time of the introduction of the application lived in dublin. after her sixteenth birthday she had sent a letter to him, which remained unanswered. she claimed that in 1978 on having knowledge that the applicant was going to be in malta she went to meet him at the airport – on that day she had seen him arrive with his family, and noted the resemblance between herself and one of the applicant’s daughters. on that occasion she had not approached him, but they met some time later before a lawyer. she stated that the applicant greeted her warmly and that, after that, they met various times. according to x. the applicant had told her that he would not inform his children about her in order not to disrupt their schooling and she agreed. at that stage the applicant had given her the keys to another property for her to reside in. she remained in close contact with him until 1985. in 1998 she was evicted from the property and thereafter their relationship deteriorated. x. explained that during the eviction proceedings the applicant had promised her a sum of money to leave the premises peacefully, she accepted the deal but he never paid up. the applicant had bought her a place where to stay and they used to meet there, since he was married. y. claimed that she had always been faithful to him as she feared him, given that he was a powerful man involved in criminal activities. y. stated that she later gave birth to a child she had with him (x.) and thereafter their relationship had deteriorated, to the extent that he had also wanted her to prostitute herself. she finally plucked up courage, left him, and returned to malta with x. 13. in particular, he argued that article 100a of the civil code (which referred back to article 70a of the same code) breached his rights under article 8 of the convention, and requested the court to refer the matter to the constitutional jurisdictions. he further questioned why the request had been lodged fifty‑three years after x.’s birth and noted his advanced age, arguing that any intervention could have negative medical implications for him. in his submissions before the constitutional jurisdictions the applicant claimed that none of the aims mentioned in sub‑paragraph two of article 8 applied in his case, and the law in force did not allow for a fair balance of the competing interests at play. furthermore, the age of x. was irrelevant to her quest to discover her genetic parent. in that light the applicant could not claim that his family life would now be in havoc. on 10 november 2014 the applicant appealed. by a judgment of 26 june 2015, the constitutional court rejected the appeal and confirmed the first‑instance judgment. while it had focused mostly on the legal aspects of the case, it did not mean that it had not considered the factual elements pertinent to the case, and indeed its conclusions had specifically referred to the case at issue and were not general. she also wanted to establish a claim over the applicant’s property after his death, according to law. thus, her impelling interest in determining paternity was clear. lastly, the complaint about equality of arms was frivolous in so far as the test was available to both parties, and also because the fact that a piece of evidence was conclusive evidence in favour of one party did not mean that it should be discarded. it appointed an expert to conduct such an examination and requested her to submit a report by 28 january 2016. on 6 october 2016 counsel informed the court that it was likely that the applicant would file an affidavit with his own evidence. however, no such written testimony was submitted. from the minutes of the hearing of 6 april 2017, it appears that the expert could not attend that hearing, so the court authorised her to submit the report, and confirm it on oath, at the court’s registry; the court also solicited the applicant’s details. on the same day a note was filed by the applicant indicating his personal details.
the applicant, who belongs to the german-speaking minority in belgium, was born in 1957. on 1 august 2003 the indictment division of the liège court of appeal upheld that decision. an expert psychiatric report drawn up by dr ri. long-term therapy over several years is required. ... the therapy should therefore begin in a secure institution; treatment might then be possible in the closed unit of a long-stay institution, before envisaging treatment in an open unit. the psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment must take place in german. ...” on 9 june 2006 the cds examined the application. it adjourned examination of the request sine die. no satisfactory follow-up has been given to the requests by the [social protection] board for an end to be put to this unlawful situation for mr rooman, who is deprived of his freedom in order, on the one hand, to protect society from possible dangerous conduct by him, and on the other, to provide him with the treatment necessary for his reinsertion; ...
in the light of the authorities’ failure, the question now before the board is whether there exists, outside the social-protection facility, a unit or persons who could provide home-based therapy for mr rooman; ...” 26. the cds decided, while “remaining open to any proposals”, to leave the applicant’s situation unchanged; in other words, it rejected his application for discharge. it also found that the mere fact that the applicant spoke only german did not mean that the authorities had not taken all the necessary steps to provide him with the treatment required by his condition. on 13 november 2013 the applicant again applied for discharge. it ordered that the case be reopened and scheduled a hearing for 17 october 2014. by a decision of 20 may 2015, the csds dismissed the request for final or conditional discharge, considering that the applicant’s state of health had not improved sufficiently and that the conditions for his reintegration into society were not met. in their respective replies, dated 28 august 2014, the director of the paifve eds and dr b. indicated that the applicant now had access to consultations with a german-speaking psychologist and that the authorities had made contact with a german-speaking psychiatrist who had agreed to meet the applicant. admittedly, he occasionally comes out with a few simple words in french, but, clearly, the years spent in paifve have not persuaded him to learn to use french more fluently so as to communicate more meaningfully with those caring for him. alternatively, as certain examinations seem to indicate, he is so cognitively disadvantaged that he cannot achieve this. however, between 2010 and 2014 [the applicant] received no medico-psychological treatment in his own language. on 24 january 2018 the applicant lodged an application with the brussels court of appeal requesting legal aid in order to appeal against the judgment of the french-language brussels court of first instance. basing its decision on the arguments contained in these two reports, on 29 may 2017 the public prosecutor at the liège post-sentencing court (tap) issued an opinion in favour of maintaining the applicant in compulsory confinement and opposing the request for conditional discharge. it also summoned the director general of prisons to a hearing fixed for november 2017. he has one outing a month, accompanied by a german-speaking nurse. contact with german-speaking psychological and welfare assistants has been organised. a german interpreter will be called upon whenever necessary (cap, disciplinary hearings, expert reports). with regard to the subsidiary request for treatment in german, it added that this had become devoid of purpose. on 20 may 2015 the applicant met with dr v., a german-speaking psychiatrist. this meeting did not give rise to regular meetings. for his part, the applicant stated that he had had no further meetings since march, and submitted that the last meeting had taken place in february 2018. since november 2017, the german-speaking welfare assistant had returned to her post in the paifve eds and continued to meet the applicant several times a month. it appears from other information in the file that the applicant has a brother with whom he has renewed contact in the past few years.
the applicant was born in 1937 and lives in ceira (portugal). he was released at his request, having filled out a release form; 6. went to lisbon to try to renew his driving licence for heavy vehicles. he was taken to the emergency department of coimbra university hospital. was voluntarily admitted to the hsc from the emergency department (this was the last of his stays at the hsc (see paragraph 12 above). who had been his psychiatric doctor since december 1999. the suicide attempt may have been the result of his failure to renew his driving licence. according to her, he had become depressed and thought his life no longer had any value, he felt marginalised and also powerless to achieve any aim in life. for the first week of his stay at the hsc, he was placed under a restrictive regime, even though he was a voluntary inpatient (see paragraph 54 below). at around 10.30 p.m. on tuesday 25 april 2000, the applicant took a.j. to the emergency department of the coimbra university hospital because he had drunk a large amount of alcohol. he received phone calls and a visit from his sister. she was assured that some minutes earlier he had been standing at the door and he looked fine. at around 7 p.m. it was noticed that a.j. the fact that her son had been able to leave the hospital grounds on 27 april 2000 had led the applicant to conclude that the hospital staff had acted negligently in the performance of their duties. because of his suicide attempts and mental condition, her son should have been under medical supervision and the hospital staff should have prevented him from leaving the hospital grounds. ’s clinical history enables us to consider him an ill person with recurring relapses into excessive alcohol consumption ... but also another kind of symptomatology...
he was an individual who was “very violent and aggressive when he was drunk, and even in those moments when he had not been drinking he was a conflictual young man, easily irritable”...
...
there is no detailed reference in his clinical records to his psychopathological condition on 26 april 2000 (after the alcohol intoxication episode which led him to the emergency services on 25 april 2000), 27 or 28? indeed, it must be clarified that ... he may have been suffering from a borderline personality disorder [perturbação de personalidade borderline]...
...
there is reference to a multiplicity of diagnoses, all of them capable of enhancing the risk of the patient’s suicide (and also of suicidal behaviour). she confirmed that voluntary inpatients could have their freedom of movement restricted if it was thought necessary. who had been the emergency doctor on call on 27 april 2000, explained that had the nurses in the pavilion seen a problem with a.j. on 7 january 2010 the court held a hearing at which it adopted a decision concerning the facts. on 25 april 2011 the coimbra administrative court delivered a judgment in which it ruled against the applicant. it found this procedure to be appropriate. ’s medical report, alone, already had references to suicide attempts, one of which had occurred twenty-five days earlier. it rejected the applicant’s argument that counting the inpatients when they were given their meal trays with their meals was “deeply amateurish”. as to the foreseeability of the suicide, the administrative supreme court held that the hsc had not breached any duty of care, as there had been no indication which could have led the hospital staff to suspect that the applicant’s son would try to commit suicide that day, namely by leaving the hospital grounds. inpatients were not allowed to leave the pavilion without informing the relevant nurse in advance. ’s stay in april 2000:
i.  wake-up time: between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m.;
ii. inpatients under a restrictive hospitalisation regime were monitored more closely by the nursing team. under voluntary hospitalisation, an inpatient could abandon treatment at any moment.
the applicant company is a private company that was set up in 2007 and has its registered office in yerevan. on 7 may 2007 the applicant company and company s. concluded a contract, under which the applicant company had to carry out construction work on the premises of company h. 7. on 18 january 2008 the applicant company initiated compensation proceedings against company s. in the yerevan civil court (“the civil court”), arguing that it had completed the construction work as required by the contract of 7 may 2007, but company s. had failed to make full payment for the work. on 21 january 2008 the civil court admitted the applicant company’s claim. the examination was assigned to the bureau of forensic examinations under the ministry of justice (“the bureau”). in particular, the court ordered the experts to measure the surface area of the construction work and assess the quality of the construction work carried out. on 4 april 2008 the civil court resumed the proceedings and summoned company h. to the proceedings as a third party. on 19 february 2009 the civil court granted the applicant company’s claim. on 27 february 2009, due to reorganisation of the judiciary, the civil court decided to transfer the case to the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan. on 4 march 2009 company s. appealed against the judgment of 19 february 2009. on 23 april 2009 the civil court of appeal quashed that judgment and remitted the case, reasoning, inter alia, that in the absence of an expert opinion on the questions posed by the civil court as regards the disputed construction work, that judgment was unfounded. on 29 july 2009 the shengavit district court of yerevan (“the district court”) took over the applicant company’s case. on 26 august 2009 the district court ordered a forensic technical examination of the construction work on the premises of company h., and stayed the proceedings. on 31 may 2010 the expert concluded that, owing to the lack of opportunity to access the premises of company h., it had not been possible to carry out the forensic examination ordered by the district court on 26 august 2009. it is unclear what the outcome of that order was. on 27 june 2012 the district court resumed the proceedings. on 3 october 2012 the applicant company filed additional submissions with the district court. on the same date the district court ordered a forensic technical examination of the construction work on the premises of company h., and stayed the proceedings. on 25 november and 24 december 2014 the applicant company submitted a letter to the bureau, enquiring about the progress of the examination ordered by the district court. on 27 december 2014 the bureau responded by stating that the examination which had been ordered had not been carried out due to the lack of an expert in the relevant field. the bureau also noted that it had already recruited and trained relevant experts, and the examination was expected to be carried out in january 2015. on 28 february 2015 the applicant company submitted another letter to the bureau, reminding it that the examination had not yet been carried out and informing it about the delay that the lack of an expert examination had caused in the civil proceedings. on 20 may 2015 the minister of justice responded by stating that even though it would take one day to carry out the expert examination and approximately five days to complete the report, the examination had not been carried out for reasons such as the lack of an expert in the bureau, the expert’s inability to access the premises of company h., the excessive workload in the bureau, and so on. the minister concluded by stating that the examination could be carried out by the bureau, provided that the expert was granted access to the premises concerned. on 30 june 2015, apparently after performing the technical examination, the bureau sent the relevant expert opinion to the district court. the district court held a number of hearings in 2015 and 2016, and on 9 june and 2 august 2016 it also decided to conduct a new examination of the case. on 10 october 2016 the district court granted the applicant company’s claim in part. on 15 december 2016 company s. appealed against that judgment. on 23 march 2017 the civil court of appeal rejected the appeal and upheld the contested judgment. no appeal on points of law was lodged against the decision of 23 march 2017, which became final.
the facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. in the early morning of 27 december 2001 a group of approximately twenty federal servicemen who had arrived in two armoured personnel carriers (“apcs”) and uaz vehicles surrounded the house where the applicant lived with her son (mr alvi bugayev), his wife (ms z.s.), after mr bugayev had got out of the car near his sister’s house, a vehicle stopped near him, four servicemen with automatic guns got out and shot mr bugayev dead in front of his wife and children. on 13 january 2002 the investigators questioned mr i.a. that her husband had been killed for being a “traitor”. on 19 january 2002 the investigators requested that the vovd provide them with a list of the people who had been detained with alvi bugayev and of the police officers who had questioned him while he had been in detention. in addition, she stated that her daughter-in-law, ms z.s., on 30 january 2007 the investigators questioned mr a.m., who stated that in january 2002 he had participated in the examination of the scene of mr bugayev’s killing and that he had no information concerning the perpetrators’ identities. on 13 february 2007 the applicant was granted victim status in the criminal case. there is no further information on any progress in the proceedings. the brdm turned the turret and, having opened fire, drove through the gates with mr yunusov on its hull. on 7 january 2002 they ordered an expert examination of the bullet taken out of the body of mr yunusov and on 18 january 2002 the forensics bureau of the chechen ministry of the interior reported that it had been fired from a kalashnikov machinegun. tried to stop the vehicle ... yunusov threw his jacket over its slits and got onto the hull. 106 on garazhnaya street with mr yunusov on its hull. he also requested that the applicants be informed of steps taken to establish the whereabouts of officer a.l., the documents submitted show that no such steps were taken, other than the sending of requests for information. 3, where they had gone to visit a mutual friend. the applicants were not informed thereof. on the way, a few minutes later, he had heard gunfire and two explosions. she had run up to their vehicles, but two of the men had stopped her. on 11 june 2005 the investigators again suspended the investigation for failure to identify the perpetrators. on 20 october 2005 the deputy staropromyslovskiy district prosecutor again overruled the suspension as premature and unlawful and ordered that the investigation be resumed in order for a number of steps to be taken, including the establishment of the identities and questioning of mr adlan g. and mr vakha t. it appears that those orders, other than the sending of formal requests for information to various law-enforcement agencies regarding whether they had conducted special operations on the date of the incident, were not complied with by the investigators. on 15 may 2006 the deputy staropromyslovskiy district prosecutor again overruled the suspension as premature and unlawful and ordered that the investigation be resumed in order for a number of steps to be taken, including the establishing of the identities and the questioning of mr adlan g. and mr vakha t. it appears that those orders were not complied with. on 18 january 2007 the deputy staropromyslovskiy district prosecutor again overruled the suspension as premature and unlawful and ordered that the investigation be resumed in order for the previously ordered steps to be taken. on 18 february 2007 the investigation was suspended again. it is unclear whether the applicants were informed thereof. the applicants were informed of that decision on 30 march 2007. on 16 april 2007 the investigators questioned mr s.kh., on 19 november 2008, following the district prosecutor’s criticism, the investigation was resumed in order for the requested steps to be taken. on 13 march 2009 the investigators again suspended the criminal investigation.
the applicants are five russian nationals. their personal details are set out in the appendix. since 1981 the applicants have lived in a flat in an apartment block provided to them under a social tenancy agreement by the ministry of defence of the russian federation. the landlord was under obligation to perform a major overhaul of the apartment block, and the applicants had to make regular payments for the major overhaul. the overhaul had never been performed, allegedly since 1935. on the dates listed in the appendix the orenburgskiy district court of the orenburg region granted their claims, having noted from expert reports that the apartment block was “64%‒dilapidated” and its state was “unsatisfactory”, and that the flat was 64%‒dilapidated. the court found that the applicants’ living premises, as well as the common property of the apartment block required a major overhaul. the court ordered the federal state institution of the privolzhsko-uralskiy military circuit to perform the major overhaul of the applicants’ flat, as well as of the common property of the apartment block and of the “devices situated in the living premises and serving for provision of communal services” in the apartment block, and to pay each applicant 3,000 russian roubles (rub) in respect of non‑pecuniary damage. according to the applicants’ observations, on 9 november 2011 the orenburgskiy district court awarded the claimants rub 490,155.43 (approximately 11.681 euros) of compensation of losses. they did not enclose a copy of the judgment or further details as to either the defendant, or the exact list of claimants, the scope of the judgment or its subsequent challenge on appeal by any of the parties. in 2012 federal state treasury department (управление) of the privolzhsko-uralskiy military circuit became a legal successor of the debtor institution. in 2012 the applicants sued various authorities for penalties for several years of the non-enforcement. by the final judgment of 5 february 2013 the orenburg regional court rejected their claims in full, having found that they were based on an incorrect interpretation of the domestic law and that the applicants had failed to submit a calculation of the penalty. according to the government, in december 2013 the applicant’s house was included in a regional housing overhaul assistance program. the authorities prepared a project and the budget documentation, which were approved by the experts. on 13 april 2015 ms konstantinova privatized the flat and acquired a title to it. according to the government’s latest observations of 31 may 2017, the judgments had remained unenforced at the material time.
the first applicant was born in 1964 and lives in qormi. the second applicant is a limited liability company incorporated in 1996 and registered in marsa, malta. the second applicant is owned by the first applicant. the peugeot was registered in the name of maxkim limited (the second applicant). the court of magistrates sentenced m. to a term of imprisonment and disqualified him from obtaining a driving licence for a period of time. on 24 october 2011, the court of criminal appeal reversed the first‑instance court judgment in part, namely lowering the disqualification period to six months. the authorities eventually took physical possession of the peugeot. however, by this time, the peugeot had been returned to the importer following an agreement between him and the second applicant which provided that the latter would not pay any further instalments in connection with the hire purchase agreement with which the car had been acquired. on 6 january 2012 the court of magistrates as a court of criminal judicature found m. guilty under article 61(1) of the traffic regulations ordinance of driving away, with the intention to use, a vehicle of the make toyota (vitz) with registration number kim324 (hereinafter referred to as “the toyota”). it is not disputed that the toyota was owned by him. despite the above finding, the car was not released by the authorities. it appears that during these appeal proceedings the first applicant requested the court to release the toyota. the court of criminal appeal rejected this request. on 26 march 2014 the court of criminal appeal rejected the ag’s appeal in toto. on 27 march 2014 the toyota was returned to the first applicant. in the meantime, on 28 november 2012, the applicants (mr ciantar in his name and on behalf of maxkim limited) filed proceedings before the civil court (first hall) in its constitutional competence. furthermore, the court of criminal appeal had refused to grant back to the first applicant possession of the toyota in violation of the law. the applicants requested that the two vehicles be released, and that they be awarded just satisfaction for the violations suffered and the lost use of the two vehicles. 1, the court held that the confiscation of the peugeot had been ordered by a final judgment of the court of criminal appeal in the first set of criminal proceedings and therefore there could be no doubt that the confiscation was in compliance with the law (article 3 of the ordinance). it noted that article 3 was aimed at protecting innocent citizens from abuse by people who broke the law by driving vehicles without a licence or without insurance. it followed that it was not in violation of the invoked provisions. regarding the claim for damages, the court concluded that the applicants must demand them from m., since m. was the one who had violated the law leading to the institution of the criminal proceedings with the ensuing consequences. on 7 november 2013 the applicants filed an appeal before the constitutional court. it was argued that in both sets of criminal proceedings the applicants had been unlawfully deprived of their property. on 11 august 2014 the constitutional court rejected the ag’s appeal and declared that the applicants had suffered a violation of their rights as protected under article 1 of protocol no. article 3 of the ordinance was therefore declared null and void in regard to such consequences. the rest of the applicants’ claims were rejected. therefore a violation of article 1 of protocol no. in regard to the alleged violation of article 6 of the convention, the court noted that the fact that measures resulting from an act for which a third party (in this case m.) was prosecuted, affecting in an adverse manner the property rights of the applicants, could not in themselves lead to the conclusion that, during the course of the criminal proceedings complained of, any “criminal charge”, for the purpose of article 6, was brought against the applicants. thus, the claim of a lack of access to court had been unfounded.
the first applicant (mr ryklin) was born in 1958. the second applicant (mr sharov) was born in 1956. both applicants are human rights activists and pro-democracy campaigners. on 21 april 2015 the applicants, with three others, sent written notification to the moscow mayor’s office of their intention to hold a demonstration with some 15,000 participants from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. on 6 may 2015 in bolotnaya square. after the expiry of the statutory period for the authority’s reply, on 28 april 2015 the applicants wrote a letter to the mayor’s office stating that they considered the event of 6 may 2015 to have been approved by the mayor. on 27 april 2015 the regional security and anti-corruption department of moscow telephoned the applicants and suggested that the event be held on marshal vasilevskiy street. on 30 april 2015 the department repeated this proposal in a letter. the event organisers were also warned that if they rejected this proposal they would not be allowed to hold a public event at all. according to the applicants, they informed all possible participants in the demonstration about its cancellation by way of posting information on the internet and via various mass-media outlets. at around 7.05 p.m. both the applicants arrived in bolotnaya square, where they saw a gathering of some fifty people standing quietly, without any banners. according to the applicants, each positioned himself at a distance from other people with a political banner. the applicants considered that each of them was staging a solo demonstration which did not require prior notification of the authorities. a few minutes later the applicants were arrested and taken to a police van. according to the government, on 6 may 2015 the applicants, acting in a group of fifty people, organised and held a public assembly without prior notification being given to the authorities. the applicants called upon others to shout the slogans “freedom to political prisoners”, “death to fascists” and others; the second applicant held a banner stating that all “bolotnaya participants” were innocent. the applicants did not respond to the multiple demands by the police that they cease their actions, and at 7.35 p.m. they were taken to the yakimanka district police station. the second applicant was brought to the police station at 7.25 p.m. and placed under administrative arrest at 7.40 p.m. the records of the transfer contained an indication that both applicants were taken to the police station for an administrative offence record to be drawn up. according to the government, the term of the applicants’ retention in the police station was extended to forty-eight hours. on 6 may 2015 at 10.15 p.m. the first applicant was transported to the police station in zamoskvorechye district of moscow. the second applicant was taken to that same court on 7 may 2015 at 4.10 p.m. 13. in particular, they called upon others to shout political slogans; the second applicant had a banner. on 7 may 2015 the zamoskvoretskiy district court convicted the first applicant under article 20.2 § 2 of the cao and sentenced him to ten days’ detention. the court found that the first applicant, with the second applicant, had organised and held a group public event in the form of a “meeting” with about fifty participants, without notifying the authorities in advance. it dismissed the applicant’s argument that he had staged a solo demonstration, after considering it as a line of defence. on the same day the zamoskvoretskiy district court heard the case against the second applicant. the court dismissed the evidence of two eyewitnesses who stated that the second applicant had been standing alone on the bridge with a banner. it also refused to admit in evidence video recordings and photographs showing the second applicant, because neither of them contained “information about the address”. both the applicants appealed, insisting that they had staged solo demonstrations. on 13 may 2015 the moscow city court upheld the judgments. referring to the statutory definition of a “meeting” (the presence of people in a specific place in order to publicly express their opinions, essentially on social and political issues), the appellate court considered that some fifty people had been present in bolotnaya square, including the applicants, who had called on others to shout political slogans.
the applicant was born in 1971 and lives in rostov-on-don, russia. in early 2012 ms b., headmistress of school no. 118 of rostov‑on‑don and chairwoman of the local electoral committee, removed the applicant from his position as an electoral committee member. on 1 september 2012 festive events were taking place at school no. around 8.15 a.m. on that day the applicant staged a solo demonstration (одиночный пикет) in front of the school. he distributed leaflets to the parents of the pupils expressing his negative opinion about the professional and personal qualities of the headmistress, ms. b. the leaflets read as follows:
“dear parents, you have entrusted your children to the staff of school no. i, eduard nikolayev, have reasons to believe that your child will be taught from hottentot and old testament ethics. see for yourself: on 10 march 2012 i held a demonstration and was handled by the police. i was then sentenced to two days in detention by a justice of the peace, on a fabricated charge of hooliganism. this is now a widespread practice in respect of political matters in russia. as the judicial reprisals were manifestly unlawful (since i had immunity as a member of an electoral committee), they needed to invent some justification. the school staff called police officer o., who was present at the school premises owing to enhanced security measures taken on that day. according to the applicant, within thirty minutes two additional police officers, t. and m., had arrived. he complied with their order to show his identity documents. at some point, while the police officers were carrying out an identity check through the police database, he decided to leave. however, when the applicant saw police officer t. following him, he changed his mind and returned. the applicant tried to escape; the police used force and handcuffs to stop him. then the applicant was taken to the police station. 118 and disturbed passers-by in an insulting manner. he had not reacted to their multiple requests to calm down and to cease this behaviour, had refused to present his identity documents and had tried to escape. officer m. also recorded that the police had used physical force and handcuffs. the applicant stayed on sick leave in connection with these injuries from 1 until 24 september 2012. as a result, it was determined that police officers t. and m. had acted in accordance with the law and internal requirements and had not breached the applicant’s rights. by a judgment of 5 april 2013 the voroshilovskiy district court of rostov-on-don dismissed his claims. it considered that the applicant had attempted to escape during the identity check and had been arrested, and that the use of force and handcuffs had complied with the relevant regulations. however, the police had been reassembling the file at the time of the trial. on the basis of several testimonies, the district court concluded as follows:
“in the present case the police officers intended to put an end to the breach of public order, consisting of [showing] disrespect to society accompanied by the use of foul language in a public place [by the applicant], disturbing citizens in an insulting manner and refusing to obey an order by a public official ... the police officers ... acted within their powers and did not violate the applicant’s rights. the applicant appealed against the judgment. on 17 june 2013 the rostov regional court dismissed the appeal, endorsing the reasoning of the first-instance judgment.
the first applicant (mr grigoryev) was born in 1984 and lives in svetlogorsk. the second applicant (ms igamberdiyeva) was born in 1989 and lives in kaliningrad. on an unknown date the second applicant notified the kaliningrad authorities of her intention to hold a group public event on 12 december 2010 in pobeda square. the authorities replied that preparations for the new year celebrations were planned on that day; they did not suggest an alternative venue. the second applicant did not challenge the authority’s reply before the domestic courts. both applicants decided to stage solo demonstrations near the monument to “mother russia” instead; this did not require prior notification. after he had completed his demonstration and placed himself at a distance of some twenty metres, the second applicant held her own solo demonstration. she was wearing a t-shirt saying “freedom for khodorkovskiy and lebedev!” she completed her demonstration in five minutes. then the first applicant returned to the venue with his banner and remained there for about two minutes, until police officers took him to a police van. he was then taken to a police station and held there for over three hours. according to the government, at 4 p.m. on 12 december 2010 the applicants participated in a group public event in the form of a “picket” (пикетирование) using visual props, namely a banner and a t-shirt. at 4 p.m. the first applicant was taken to the leninskiy district police station. between 5.15 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. a duty officer drew up an administrative offence record in respect of the first applicant. he was accused of taking part in a group public event held without authorisation, an offence under article 20.2 § 1 of the code of administrative offences (hereinafter “the cao”). on 14 december 2012 the second applicant was called to the leninskiy district police station, where she was accused of a similar offence, although it was classified under article 20.2 § 2 of the cao. the cases against the applicants were submitted to a justice of the peace of court circuit no. 2 of the leninskiy district of kaliningrad. the court ordered the police to submit a video recording showing the events of 12 december 2010. by two judgments of 3 march 2011 the justice of the peace found that the applicants had held solo demonstrations and had not breached the public events act (hereinafter “the pea”), including its prior notification requirement applicable to group events. the court relied, inter alia, on the video recording submitted by the police. the administrative cases against the applicants were discontinued for lack of the elements of the offences under article 20.2 §§ 1 and 2 of the cao. on 16 may 2011 the leninskiy district court of kaliningrad upheld the judgments. the appellate court also considered that it had not been confirmed that the applicants had in fact taken part in a group “picket”. the applicants sought compensation of 100,000 roubles (rub)[1] each for unlawful deprivation of liberty and violation of their right to freedom of expression by way of solo demonstration. by a judgment of 15 july 2011 the tsentralniy district court of kaliningrad found that taking the first applicant to the police station had been unlawful, and awarded him rub 10,000 (equivalent to 250 euros (eur) at the time) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. on 25 july 2011 the same court also granted the claims by the second applicant, having found that preventing her from staging a solo demonstration and consequently prosecuting her had been unlawful. the first applicant appealed against the judgment of 15 july 2011, complaining, inter alia, about the amount of the compensation and the first‑instance court’s failure to make specific findings in relation to the violation of his freedom of expression on account of the police intervention in his solo demonstration. the appellate court also considered that the interference with freedom of expression had been acknowledged by the declaration that taking the first applicant to the police station had been unlawful. on 21 september 2011 the kaliningrad regional court upheld the judgment of 25 july 2011.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in orhei. in september 2009 the applicant initiated civil proceedings against a company which was in process of insolvency. on 18 december 2009 the drochia district court found in favour of the applicant and ordered the defendant company to pay him 24,957 moldovan lei (mdl) (the equivalent of 1,413 euros (eur)) for pecuniary damage and mdl 749 (the equivalent of eur 42) for costs and expenses. the representative of the defendant company was not present at the hearing. on 28 december 2009 the secretariat of the drochia district court sent a copy of the reasoned judgment to the defendant company by ordinary mail. on 11 january 2010 an enforcement writ was issued to the applicant by the same court in respect of the judgment of 18 december 2009. on 10 february 2010, in a different set of proceedings concerning the insolvency of the defendant company, the company’s insolvency administrator updated the list of creditors by making express reference to the judgment of 18 december 2009 and to the exact amounts awarded in that judgment. the court which treated the insolvency issued a decision concerning the updated list of creditors on the same date. on 26 april 2010 the insolvency administrator of the defendant company lodged an appeal against the judgment of 18 december 2009. the applicant objected to the appeal by arguing that it had been time-barred. he indicated that the time-limit for lodging the appeal had expired twenty days after the serving of the impugned judgment and that the insolvency administrator of the defendant company had been aware of the judgment of 18 december 2009 since in february 2010 he had informed the court dealing with the insolvency proceedings about the judgment in question. on 28 september 2010 the bălţi court of appeal admitted the appeal lodged by the insolvency administrator of the defendant company and quashed the judgment of 18 december 2009. the court of appeal did respond to the objection raised by the applicant and, after re-examining the merits of the case, dismissed the applicant’s action against the defendant company. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law raising the same arguments as in his appeal. on 26 january 2011 the supreme court of justice dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law and upheld the judgment of the lower court. the supreme court did not make any comment about the applicant’s objection concerning the late appeal.
the first applicant (ms muchnik) was born in 1968 and lives in tomsk. the second applicant (mr mordovin) was born in 1956 and lives in seversk, in the tomsk region. at the end of 2014 the russian television and radio network informed the private regional television company tv-2 that its contract for broadcast services would be cancelled as of 1 january 2015. some other people also staged solo demonstrations on the same dates and at the same time, keeping a 30‑metre distance from each other. these “pickets” were held without prior notification being given to local authorities. on 27 february 2015 an administrative-offence record was compiled in respect of the first applicant. the administrative case file contained a report and an explanatory note from a high-ranking police officer from tomsk police department. it was stated, in particular, that f. had initiated a number of public assemblies in support of tv-2 from 4 january 2015 onwards, by posting calls for support via social networks. the first applicant had picked up those involved in the solo demonstrations and transported them to the event venues; she had also handed out leaflets to them for distribution. the report comprised several screenshots of facebook pages showing calls for people to support tv-2 through protests, including a personal page of the applicant. the administrative case file also contained several reports by police officers who had been present on 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 13 january 2015 at the location where the solo demonstrations had taken place. the police officers pointed out that no breaches of the public events act (hereinafter, “the pea”) had been detected; the demonstrators had kept the minimum 30-metre distance from each other and had not breached public order. on 3 march 2015 the case against the first applicant was submitted to the sovetskiy district court of tomsk. however, the judge gave the applicant an hour to study the file, and when her lawyer appeared some time later he requested only fifteen minutes to study the file. the court relied on the administrative-offence record, reports and an explanatory note by police officers, screenshots of facebook pages, and written statements by different people outlining the applicant’s role in organising the public events. the court dismissed as unreliable the testimony of f. and the applicant’s husband, who had been questioned at her request. by a decision of 13 april 2015 the appellate court excluded the reference to the applicant being the organiser of the events, but upheld the remainder of the trial judgment. on 7 september 2015 and 10 february 2016 the tomsk regional court and the supreme court of russia respectively dismissed applications for review lodged by the first applicant. the officials present at the venue in question did not make any claims during his solo demonstration or after it (see, however, paragraph 17 below). the applicant was not hindered in any way and completed his demonstration. according to the national authorities and according to the government’s submissions before the court, on 6 august 2014 from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. the second applicant, acting together with (seven) other persons, organised and held a public event in the form of “picket” near big city, a shopping centre in tomsk. using visual aids, the applicant and other protestors expressed their opinion about the participants in the events of 6 may 2012 in bolotnaya square in moscow, without giving prior notification to the authorities. on 15 may 2015 the head of the division for the execution of administrative legislation of the tomsk police department (оиаз умвд россии по городу томску) compiled an administrative-offence record in respect of the second applicant and notified him of that record. on 15 may 2015 the case file against the applicant was submitted to the sovetskiy district court of tomsk. the applicant, who had not been deprived of his liberty, attended the trial and pleaded not guilty. the trial court heard several witnesses on behalf of the defence. the applicant was not represented by a lawyer at the trial. the second applicant lodged an appeal against the above judgment. on 19 june 2015 the tomsk regional court held an appeal hearing and heard the applicant and his lawyer. the appellate court noted that the available evidence did not confirm that the applicant had been the event organiser; however, he had still been a participant in the public assembly, an assembly of which the authorities had not been given notice.
the first applicant (ms belan) was born in 1961. the second applicant (ms sviderskaya) was born in 1949. on 3 september 2012 the second applicant and ms t. notified the local authority of their intention to hold a public assembly from 4 to 5 p.m. on 15 september 2012 in sovetov square in rostov-on-don. the first applicant intended to take part in the public event. on 6 september 2012 the event organisers dismissed the suggestion as unsuitable for the purposes of their assembly. ms t. withdrew her request to hold the planned event. she chose the format of a solo “picket” because it did not require her to give prior notification to the authorities. the applicant remained there from 2.30 to 6 p.m. she was then allowed to leave. she approached him to read the banner, which read “i will not give up my freedom of choice, which is granted by god and the constitution!”. she was immediately approached by a police officer, who ordered her to show her own banner but she refused. the administrative-offence records indicated that the first applicant had held a public event at 3.45 p.m. and the second applicant at 3.10 p.m., and that both offences had been committed near the lenin monument at the entrance to gorkiy park. the administrative case files contained handwritten reports by the two police officers who had arrested the applicants. on 4 october 2012 the deputy chief of the city police department replied that the footage from one camera had been “saved” and invited the judge to provide an electronic storage device onto which it could be copied. the trial court summoned police officer a., who had arrested the first applicant, for questioning. at a hearing on 7 november 2012 a. stated that after receiving information from sh., 4 (see paragraph 28 below), he had arrived at gorkiy park where he had seen a group of people, including z., in possession of banners, without having given any prior notification of their public event, and that he also remembered arresting ms belan, though he could not remember her face. 4 containing two clips relating to the events on 15 september 2012. one showed the applicant with a banner, while the other showed her reading a piece of paper and mr z. standing close to her and holding a banner above his head. the trial court later declared those clips inadmissible evidence. the court found it established that on 15 september 2012 a group of people with banners had held a public event in front of the entrance to gorkiy park, without having given prior notification to the authorities, and that the applicant had participated in that event. the applicant lodged an appeal with the leninskiy district court of rostov-on-don, arguing that the public events act (hereinafter “the pea”) conferred on the regional authorities the power to determine the minimum distance between solo demonstrations. it appears that the appellate court heard further evidence from the witness o., who stated that around 3 p.m. on 15 september 2012 she had approached the lenin monument with the intention of expressing her views on the situation in the country; she had seen the applicant standing alone with a banner close to the monument. o. had positioned herself at a distance, closer to the city administration building. it is also unclear whether this was one of the videos sought to be admitted into evidence at the trial. in any event, earlier other people were convicted of the same offence at the same time and place. by a letter of 9 january 2013 the regional prosecutor’s office replied that the decisions of 13 november and 3 december 2012 were not amenable to appeal. on 28 december 2012 the justice of the peace granted permission to the applicant to pay the administrative fine of rub 20,000 in three instalments. the applicant did not apply for a further review of those court decisions before the supreme court of russia. it was not specified whether she had any other income. on 10 january 2014 the supreme court of russia also upheld the judgments.
the applicant was born in 1971 and, at the time of his latest communication with the court, was detained in kirovograd. the first purchase was video-recorded, apparently with a hidden camera (see paragraph 15 below). on 9 march 2007 the applicant was arrested. at the opening of his subsequent trial the applicant admitted that at the time of his arrest he had had a drug-filled syringe in his sleeve and, in trying to get rid of the drug, had ejected the liquid over his sweater and had thrown it on the ground near him. on 15 march 2007 the applicant’s lawyer requested the investigator to order a medical examination for the applicant. the lawyer stated that the applicant had been beaten up by the police while being arrested, and also subsequently at a police station. abrasions on his legs could have been caused by a fall. on 8 may 2007 the prosecutors refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers who had taken part in the applicant’s arrest. the text of his submissions in that respect has not been submitted to the court. those courts (see paragraphs 21, 24 and 26 below) rejected the complaints as unsubstantiated, finding that the police had used force against the applicant during his arrest lawfully, and that the prosecutors had examined the applicant’s complaints in proper fashion. however, the applicant stated that he wished to remain silent. on 20 april 2007 the police investigator, in the presence of two attesting witnesses, watched a videotape and noted in a report that the tape showed the applicant selling drugs to p. as part of the test purchase. the applicant’s lawyer asked to watch the tape. the applicant submitted to the investigating authority that a certain b. had been with the applicant on the day of his arrest and could confirm that he had bought drugs for his own consumption. the applicant asked for b. to be found and examined as a witness. the applicant identified him by his first and last name and stated that b. lived in “one of the neighbouring streets” but that he did not know the exact address. the investigator ordered the police to search for b. the police reported that their search had been unsuccessful. he described how he had purchased drugs from the applicant on three occasions as part of a test purchase operation. the bill of indictment against the applicant, sent to the kirovograd kirov district court as the trial court, identified p. as one of the witnesses to be summoned in the course of the trial. it appears that during the trial the applicant asked the trial court to disclose to the defence the video recording of the first test purchase and to call and examine p. (the undercover agent), b. (see paragraph 16 above), and the forensic expert who had compiled a report stating that the applicant’s clothes and a syringe found on him on the day of the arrest contained traces of an illegal drug. those requests were refused, for unknown reasons. on 26 june 2007 the trial court found the applicant guilty of drug trafficking and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment. the court found that the applicant had sold drugs to p. on three occasions in february and march 2007. the police officer gave largely similar evidence;
(ii) written statements by p. and another police officer involved in the organisation of the test purchase, obtained at the pre-trial stage;
(iii) the fact, documented in a police report, that a banknote used by the police for use in the test purchase had been found on the applicant at the time of arrest. the applicant and his lawyer appealed, challenging the trial court’s factual and legal findings. the parties have not provided a copy of that appeal. the text of the supreme court’s decision on the appeal indicates that the applicant raised arguments largely similar to those raised in his first appeal. on 4 september 2008 a judge of the supreme court found that the applicant’s appeal was unsubstantiated, and refused to order a cassation review of the case. the trial court gave similar responses to the applicant’s new requests on 30 march 2009 and 27 may 2013. on 28 october 2008 the court of appeal also gave a similar response.
in the 1970s a copper-molybdenum deposit (‘teghout’) was discovered about four and six km away from the villages of teghout and shnogh respectively, in the lori region. in 2001 a private company, armenian copper programme cjsc, was granted a mining licence for the exploitation of the teghout copper‑molybdenum deposit for a period of twenty-five years. on 1 november 2007 the government adopted decree no. 1279-n approving the expropriation zones of territories situated within the administrative boundaries of the rural communities of shnogh and teghout in the lori region to be taken for state needs and changing the category of land use. according to the decree, armenian copper programme cjsc or teghout cjsc, founded by the former for the purpose of the implementation of the teghout copper-molybdenum deposit exploitation project, were to acquire the units of land listed in its annexes. the plot of land belonging to the applicant was listed among the units of land falling within these expropriation zones. the applicant lives in shnogh village and earns his living from agriculture. he owned a plot of arable land in the village measuring 0.186 ha. the land was used for growing crops for the family, feeding the livestock and beekeeping. on an unspecified date teghout cjsc addressed a letter to the applicant containing an offer to buy his plot of land. the amount of compensation offered was 134,000 armenian drams (amd, approximately 290 euros (eur)), plus an additional 15% as required by law. the applicant did not reply to the offer, not being satisfied with the amount of compensation. it appears that the applicant tried to obtain an alternative evaluation of his property by other companies but did not succeed. he claims that no other evaluation company was willing to make an independent evaluation of the market value of his land. on 13 may 2008 teghout cjsc lodged a claim against the applicant seeking to oblige him to sign the agreement on taking of his property for state needs. the company based its claim, inter alia, on the evaluation report prepared at its request by oliver group llc, a licensed evaluation company. according to the report, the market value of the applicant’s plot of land was estimated at amd 134,000 (approximately eur 290). in the proceedings before the lori regional court, the applicant argued that the market value of his land had been underestimated. he further submitted that the evaluation of his property had not been carried out correctly since no account had been taken of the number of fruit trees, their profitability and the existence of a fence and a water pipeline on the territory in question. he also claimed to be unable to submit an alternative evaluation of the real market value of his land since other companies refused to perform an evaluation. in the course of the proceedings, teghout cjsc submitted another evaluation report of the applicant’s property stating that, after the institution of the proceedings, oliver group llc had prepared a corrected report according to which the market value of the applicant’s plot of land was estimated at amd 137,000 (approximately eur 298). the final amount of compensation, including the additional 15% required by law, would thus be amd 157,550 (approximately eur 343). on 28 november 2008 the regional court granted teghout cjsc’s claim, awarding the applicant a total of amd 157,550 in compensation. relying, inter alia, on article 1 of protocol no. 1 to the convention, he complained that the regional court had deprived him of his property. on 19 march 2009 the civil court of appeal upheld the regional court’s judgment, finding that the latter had properly determined the market value of the property based on the corrected evaluation report prepared by oliver group cjsc. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law raising similar arguments to those submitted in the previous appeal. on 17 june 2009 the court of cassation declared the applicant’s cassation appeal inadmissible for lack of merit.
in the 1970s a copper-molybdenum deposit (‘teghout’) was discovered about four and six km away from the villages of teghout and shnogh respectively, in the lori region. in 2001 a private company, armenian copper programme cjsc, was granted a mining licence for the exploitation of the teghout copper‑molybdenum deposit for a period of twenty-five years. on 1 november 2007 the government adopted decree no. 1279-n approving the designation of territories situated within the administrative boundaries of the rural communities of shnogh and teghout in the lori region as expropriation zones, to be taken for state needs, thus changing the land use category. according to the decree, armenian copper programme cjsc or teghout cjsc, founded by the former for the purpose of the implementation of the teghout copper-molybdenum deposit exploitation project, were to acquire the units of land listed in its annexes. the plot of land belonging to the applicants was listed among the units of land falling within these expropriation zones. the applicants, a family of five, live in shnogh village and earn their living from agriculture. they jointly owned a plot of arable land in the village measuring 1.622 ha. the land was used for growing crops for the family and feeding their livestock. on an unspecified date teghout cjsc addressed a letter to the applicants containing an offer to buy their plot of land for 818,000 armenian drams (amd, approximately 1,780 euros (eur)) plus an additional 15% as required by law, making the final offer amd 940,700 (approximately eur 2,045). the applicants did not reply to the letter, not being satisfied with the amount of compensation offered. on 12 may 2008 teghout cjsc lodged a claim against the applicants, seeking to oblige them to sign an agreement for their property to be taken for state needs. the company based its claim, inter alia, on a valuation report prepared at its request by oliver group llc, a licensed valuation company. according to the report, the market value of the applicants’ plot of land was estimated at amd 818,000 (approximately eur 1,780). in the proceedings before the lori regional court, the fourth applicant represented the other applicants and argued that the market value of their land had been underestimated. he requested additional time to be able to submit an alternative valuation report. it appears that the applicants were unable to obtain a valuation of their property by another company. they claim that no other valuation company was willing to make an independent assessment of the market value of their land. during the proceedings teghout cjsc submitted another valuation of the applicants’ property, stating that oliver group llc had prepared a corrected report according to which the market value of the property was amd 900,000 (approximately eur 1,960). the final amount of compensation, including the additional 15% required by law, would thus be equal to amd 1,035,000 (approximately eur 2,250). on 26 september 2008 the regional court granted teghout cjsc’s claim, awarding the applicants a total of amd 1,035,000 in compensation. the applicants lodged an appeal complaining, inter alia, that the market value of their land had been seriously underestimated and that the amount of compensation offered to them was inadequate. they further argued that the fact that oliver group llc had submitted two different valuation reports during the proceedings raised doubts as to the credibility of its reports, and that the court should have initiated an independent valuation of their property. on 29 january 2009 the civil court of appeal upheld the regional court’s judgment, finding, inter alia, that the market value of the property to be taken for state needs had been correctly estimated, on the basis of the valuation report contained in the case file. the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law. they argued, inter alia, that the regional court had failed to order an independent valuation of the property, despite having the power to do so under the law. they submitted that they had disagreed with the valuation report submitted by the other party to the proceedings, which was moreover not an expert opinion and therefore could not be admitted as evidence. on 24 june 2009 the court of cassation declared the applicants’ cassation appeal inadmissible for lack of merit.
the applicants were born in 1933, 1940 and 1975 respectively and live in teghout village. in the 1970s a copper-molybdenum deposit (‘teghout’) was discovered about four and six km from the villages of teghout and shnogh respectively, in the lori region. on 1 november 2007 the government adopted decree no. according to the decree, armenian copper programme cjsc or teghout cjsc, founded by the former for the implementation of the teghout copper-molybdenum deposit exploitation project, were to acquire the units of land listed in its annexes. the plot of land belonging to the applicants was listed among the units of land falling within these expropriation zones. the applicants, a family of three, live in teghout village and earn their living from agriculture. they jointly owned a plot of arable land in the village measuring 0.430 ha. the land was used for growing crops for the family, gardening and feeding their livestock. on an unspecified date teghout cjsc addressed a letter to the applicants containing an offer to buy their plot of land for 231,000 armenian drams (amd, approximately 500 euros (eur)) plus an additional 15% as required by law, making the final offer amd 265,650 (approximately eur 578). the applicants did not reply to the offer, not being satisfied with the amount of compensation. it appears that they were unable to obtain a valuation of their property by another company. they claim that no other valuer was willing to make an independent evaluation of the market value of their land. on 3 july 2008 the first hearing at the lori regional court was held. according to the government, the applicants were duly notified of the date of the proceedings, but they did not appear. the final amount of compensation with the additional 15% would thus be equal to amd 301,300 (approximately eur 655). on 29 january 2009 the civil court of appeal quashed the regional court’s judgment and remitted the case for a fresh examination. on 27 february 2009 the case was set for trial in lori regional court. the court hearing was scheduled for 2 april 2009. the government argued that the applicants had been duly notified of the hearing and that the notification letter, as always, had been sent to their addresses. the court examination was adjourned and rescheduled for 22 april 2009. on 27 april 2009 the applicants’ counsel requested the regional court to order a forensic expert examination to determine the market value of the applicants’ plot of land, and to order that this examination was to be performed by experts of the state non-profit organisation “expertise center of the republic of armenia” (“հայաստանի հանրապետության փորձագիտական կենտրոն” պետական ոչ առևտրային կազմակերպություն). in these circumstances, the lori regional court decided to adjourn the examination, taking into consideration the fact that the applicants were not duly notified about the court hearing. the next hearing was scheduled for 20 may 2009, a notification to that effect was sent both to the applicants’ representative and the applicants. he argued that the regional court had accepted the reports submitted by the applicants’ opponent as established proof of the market value of their property, and that it had refused to order a forensic examination without any grounds. on 24 july 2009 the civil court of appeal hearing was held; the applicants and their representative were not present. the court of appeal further found that the amount of compensation had been correctly determined, on the basis of the corrected valuation report prepared by oliver group llc, given that that report was the only lawful and acceptable piece of evidence produced during the proceedings. according to the applicants, the decision of the court of appeal was not served on their counsel. on 9 october 2009 the counsel lodged an appeal on points of law, raising similar complaints to those raised before the court of appeal. on 28 october 2009 the court of cassation declared the cassation appeal inadmissible as lodged out of time. in doing so, it found that the reasons for late submission advanced by counsel were not justified in view of the fact that the applicants had been served with a copy of the decision in due time.
the applicant was born in 1986 and lives in cork. it was asserted on his behalf that his condition was caused by the measles vaccination administered to him in 1988 when he was 15 months old. in november 2002, 14 years after receiving the vaccine, the applicant’s mother instituted proceedings on his behalf against four defendants; the local health authority, the state, the attorney general (collectively described in the domestic proceedings as the state defendants) and the doctor who had administered the vaccination, h. 7. on 5 august 2003, the high court issued a limited order of discovery addressed to the local health authority seeking all relevant records about the applicant in its possession, as well as information about the vaccine used, about any adverse effects noted at the time with this vaccine, about the manner in which the mother’s consent was obtained, and about the health of the other members of the applicant’s family. although the high court set a time-limit of 8 weeks for discovery, the local health authority only complied with the order in june 2008, that is to say with a delay of over four and a half years. the applicant appealed the scope of the order of discovery of 5 august 2003, leading to the grant of a further limited order of discovery by the high court on 30 january 2004, addressed to all four defendants. the applicant brought another appeal against the order of discovery of 30 january 2004, but in july 2006 the supreme court dismissed the appeal, making only a minor amendment to the order granted by the high court. the applicant’s mother died in december 2007. in june 2008 the applicant’s lawyer wrote to the local health authority to complain that the long delays in litigating the case had caused grave prejudice to the case. the applicant’s mother had been a vital witness, and with her death essential evidence had been lost. settlement of the substantive dispute was proposed but not agreed. in may 2008 the applicant’s lawyer sought to have the defence of the state defendants set aside. the high court refused this application on 12 march 2010. no factual evidence was called on behalf of the applicant, but independent medical witnesses gave evidence, having read the applicant’s medical records, and documentary evidence provided by way of discovery was before the court. on the eleventh day of the trial, 19 july 2011, the judge accepted an application by the defendants to strike the case out for failure to establish a prima facie case against them. regarding the doctor, he noted that the applicant accepted there was insufficient evidence to establish any negligence in the administration of the vaccine. the claim against the doctor h was dismissed. in relation to the state defendants, the judge held that no evidence had been produced that could support the various grounds relied on by the applicant. the proceedings in the high court terminated on 19 december 2011. the applicant filed a notice of appeal presenting 30 grounds of appeal. following the establishment of the court of appeal in october 2014, the applicant’s case was transferred to it. outline written submissions were submitted by h in february 2015 and by the state defendants in september 2015. the court of appeal gave its judgment on 10 february 2016, dismissing the appeal. in its conclusions, the court of appeal stated that, by taking the case at its highest, the trial judge had adopted the correct approach on the question of striking the case out. the court of appeal concluded by remarking on the many legal hurdles the applicant would have had to overcome in order to succeed. it found no basis for overturning the decision of the high court. the proceedings ended on 10 may 2016 when the supreme court declined the applicant’s request for leave to appeal.

the applicants were born in 1939 and 1976 respectively and live in shnogh village. in the 1970s a copper-molybdenum deposit (‘teghout’) was discovered about four and six km away from the villages of teghout and shnogh respectively, in the lori region. in 2001 a private company, armenian copper programme cjsc, was granted a mining licence for the exploitation of the teghout copper‑molybdenum deposit for a period of twenty-five years. on 1 november 2007 the government adopted decree no. 1279-n approving the designation of territories situated within the administrative boundaries of the rural communities of shnogh and teghout in the lori region as expropriation zones, to be taken for state needs, thus changing the land use category. according to the decree, armenian copper programme cjsc or teghout cjsc, founded by the former for the purpose of the implementation of the teghout copper-molybdenum deposit exploitation project, were to acquire the units of land listed in its annexes. the plots of land belonging to the applicants were listed among the units of land falling within these expropriation zones. the applicants, father and son, live in shnogh village and earn their living from agriculture. they jointly owned six plots of arable land in the village measuring 0.053 ha, 0.448 ha, 0.075 ha, 0.254 ha, 0.212 ha and 0.799 ha. the land was used for growing crops for the family, gardening and feeding their livestock. on an unspecified date teghout cjsc addressed a letter to the applicants containing an offer to buy their six plots of land for 19,000 armenian drams (amd, approximately 41 euros (eur)), amd 213,000 (approximately eur 463), amd 26,000 (approximately eur 57), amd 87,000 (approximately eur 190), amd 73,000 (approximately eur 160), and amd 339,000 (approximately eur 737) respectively plus an additional 15% on each amount offered as required by law, making the final offer amd 870,550 (approximately eur 1,893) in total. the applicants did not reply to the offer, not being satisfied with the amount of compensation. it appears that they were unable to obtain a valuation of their property by another company. they claim that no other valuation company was willing to make an independent assessment of the market value of their land. on 12 may 2008 teghout cjsc lodged a claim against the applicants and their late mother, h., seeking to oblige them to sign the agreement on the taking of their property for state needs. the company based its claim, inter alia, on valuation reports prepared at its request by oliver group llc, a licensed valuation company. according to the reports, the market value of the applicants’ six plots of land was estimated at amd 757,000 (approximately eur 1,645) in total. in the proceedings before the lori regional court, the second applicant argued that the market value of their land had been underestimated. the final amount of compensation, including the additional 15% required by law, would thus be equal to amd 1,193,700 (approximately eur 2,595). on 28 november 2008 the regional court granted teghout cjsc’s claim, awarding h. and the applicants a total of amd 1,193,700 (approximately eur 2,595) in compensation. the applicants lodged an appeal, complaining, inter alia, that the first applicant had not been duly notified about the proceedings. they further argued that the regional court, although aware that h. had died in 2007, had delivered a judgment that concerned her rights. on 3 april 2009 the civil court of appeal quashed the regional court’s judgment and remitted the case for a fresh examination. on 7 october 2009 the regional court granted teghout cjsc’s claim finding, inter alia, that the valuation reports prepared by oliver group llc should be considered lawful and acceptable evidence to determine the market value of the applicants’ property to be taken for state needs. the regional court stated that the first applicant, as h.’s successor, should be awarded her share in the compensation, and awarded the applicants a total of amd 1,193,700 (approximately eur 2,595) in equal shares as compensation. they argued in particular that, in order to provide them with a reasonable opportunity to present their case, the regional court should have exercised its statutory discretion to order an expert examination, since such a necessity had arisen in the course of the proceedings and they had had no opportunity to provide an alternative valuation themselves. the court of appeal did not address the issue of whether the regional court should have exercised its statutory discretion to order an expert examination to determine the real market value of the applicants’ property, given that there was a dispute on this issue. the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law. they raised similar complaints to those raised before the court of appeal. on 24 march 2010 the court of cassation declared the applicants’ cassation appeal inadmissible for lack of merit.
the applicant company has its seat in rovaniemi. the market court found that the territorial allocation of the markets and the bid-rigging between the companies involved in the cartel had amounted to a single continuous infringement of competition law rules, and that they were not to be regarded as individual unconnected infringements. according to the court, the infringements of competition law rules had lasted for more than seven years. in addition, geographically, the infringements covered the entire country in respect of central government asphalt contracts, and several regions of the country in respect of local government and private sector contracts. between 1996 and 2000, as far as central government asphalt contracts were concerned, it had also agreed with the other cartel companies that none of them would supply asphalt mass to companies outside the cartel. concerning the evidence, the market court noted that evidence in competition law cases could be either direct or indirect, such as economic evidence. as direct evidence was not always available, an assessment was to be made of whether indirect evidence was sufficient to prove the existence of a cartel. the court also found that the existence of a cartel could not be proved on the basis of hearsay evidence. however, to the extent that those testimonies contained hearsay evidence, such evidence was not taken into account. as regards the regions where the applicant company was doing business (northern finland and north karelia), the market court found that the evidence in support of a cartel was not sufficient. in this context, the market court stated, inter alia, that the testimonies of two witnesses who had been heard on this matter had been based solely on what the witnesses had heard from other people, whereas other witnesses had not given evidence that was capable of substantiating the existence of a cartel for local government and private sector contracts in this particular region. on 25 february 2009 the supreme administrative court held a preparatory meeting with the parties for the oral hearing of the case. four of them had been called by the competition authority, and two by one of the asphalt companies. the parties, including the applicant company, did not ask the court to hear any other persons. inter alia, the supreme administrative court concluded that the applicant company had participated in a nationwide cartel between may 1995 and 15 february 2000, and the applicant company was ordered to pay a penalty payment of eur 500,000. the supreme administrative court, citing the case of jussila, considered that while article 6 of the convention under its criminal limb thus applied to proceedings imposing a penalty payment, in such cases the article 6 requirements were not necessarily identical to the requirements which were applicable in the core areas of criminal procedure. this meant, inter alia, that the court was to take into account all evidence adduced before the market court, in addition to the evidence adduced in its own proceedings, while also bearing in mind the finality of the market court’s findings to the extent that it had not been challenged by a party on appeal. furthermore, the court cited case-law of the general court of the eu emphasising that while the competition authority must produce sufficiently precise and consistent evidence to support the firm conviction that the alleged infringement of competition rules took place, it is not necessary for every item of evidence produced to satisfy those criteria in relation to every aspect of the infringement. in this regard, the court also cited case-law of the general court of european union (see bpb plc v. the commission, case t-53/03, ecli:eu:t:2008:254, § 64), according to which a standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt cannot be required in competition cases. it was essential to take a holistic approach to the evidence presented. the court also heard six witnesses in person. on the basis of the evidence before it, the supreme administrative court found that a single nationwide cartel had existed between 1994 and 2002 in respect of central and local government as well as private sector asphalt contracts. the court specifically stated that the economic evidence of the applicant company’s unusual financial performance was not taken into account as evidence of the existence of the cartel. the applicant company had thus participated in a very serious and extensive cartel, which had aimed to eliminate all functioning competition in the finnish asphalt markets and which had been particularly harmful for this sector. those claims amounted to several million euros in total. on 28 november 2013 the helsinki district court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) rejected the finnish state’s claims against all asphalt companies, including the applicant company. the finnish state was ordered to pay the asphalt companies’ litigation costs, some eur 2.6 million. on the other hand, most of the municipalities won their cases against the asphalt companies. the finnish state appealed against the district court judgment. also, in three of the four cases which the municipalities had brought against the applicant company appeals were lodged with the court of appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten).

the applicant was born in 1972 and is currently serving a life sentence in ladyzhynska colony no. on 25 november 2004 the donetsk regional court of appeal convicted the applicant of several crimes and sentenced him to life imprisonment and ordered confiscation of all his property. on 23 february 2006 the supreme court upheld that judgment with certain changes. since 26 august 2003 the applicant has been detained in various detention facilities, initially pending the criminal investigation against him and his trial, and subsequently after sentencing. on 26 august 2003 the applicant was placed in a temporary detention facility in donetsk (sizo no. 5) for the duration of the criminal proceedings against him. on 25 january 2007 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. the case file contains other evidence to indicate that 1 february 2007 was the date of the tuberculosis diagnosis. upon completion of the criminal proceedings, on 16 march 2007 the applicant was transferred to the ladyzhynska colony. on 20 march 2007 a preliminary examination of the applicant was conducted, together with laboratory tests and an x-ray. he was put under medical supervision owing to the residual effects of his tuberculosis. according to the government, the applicant was under medical supervision and received the appropriate medical care for his tuberculosis. in particular, he had been examined on a regular basis by the colony doctors between 20 march 2007 and 26 february 2018 and prescribed treatment. as a result of each course of treatment his health had improved. the government did not specify the frequency of the applicant’s regular examination and treatment during that time. in december 2011 a blood test revealed that the applicant had contracted hepatitis c. according to the applicant, he was denied access to copies of the test results. on 16 may 2012 doctors from the vinnytsya regional centre of control and prevention of hiv-aids diagnosed the applicant with hepatitis c in remission without hepatic impairment. according to the government, the applicant was prescribed with symptomatic treatment and as a result of the treatment his health improved. the government did not specify the nature of that treatment. according to the government, the applicant was supervised by the colony doctors and was prescribed with all necessary medicine and a special diet. the government further submitted that from 23 february to 20 march 2015 the applicant had been under medical treatment in a multi-disciplinary hospital in stryzhavska correctional colony no. the nature of that treatment was not specified. they also added that as of 26 february 2018 the applicant remained under the ongoing supervision of the colony doctors, and his state of health was satisfactory. according to the applicant, during his detention he submitted numerous applications to the domestic authorities, including the donetsk regional court of appeal (“the court of appeal”), seeking to obtain copies of various documents to be submitted to the court in substantiation of his application. his requests were refused on 8 august and 6 september 2006 on the grounds that he had already been provided with a copy of that document in the course of the criminal proceedings against him and that there was no legal requirement to meet his requests. eventually, on 21 july 2008 a copy of that document was sent to the applicant. between april and august 2009 the applicant requested that the court of appeal send him copies of several court records from his criminal case file as well as from that of his accomplice. those requests were initially refused as not having a basis in law. on 21 april 2011 the office of the government agent before the european court of human rights sent copies of the court hearing records to the applicant. the applicant has not been provided with a copy of the requested documents.
the applicant was born in 1952 and died in 2013. on 21 february 2002 p., a businessman, contacted the police complaining that the applicant, who was then the director of a municipal housing management agency, was demanding money from him in exchange for permission to use some premises managed by his agency. later that day p. went into the applicant’s office and then came out saying that he had delivered the money. the police went in to arrest the applicant. in their presence, the luminescent substance was discovered on the applicant’s hand and pocket. the marked banknotes were discovered in one of the rooms adjoining his office. these investigative steps were video recorded. on the same day the applicant wrote and signed a statement confessing to having accepted the money from p. he subsequently retracted the confession, claiming that it had been extracted under “physical and psychological pressure” from the police. the applicant was charged with fraud, apparently because he actually had no statutory authority to let the premises in question. in the course of the pre-trial investigation a certain t.v.s., the attesting witnesses made formal statements to the investigating authority describing the events of 21 february 2002 which they had observed. they stated, in particular, that they had entered the applicant’s office after the police and, when they entered, two police officers were already holding the applicant. in the bill of indictment the victim, the attesting witnesses and t.v.s. were identified as witnesses to be summoned in the course of the trial. the traces of the substance on his hand could come from shaking p.’s hand. according to the government, p. testified in the course of the trial on two occasions in april 2004. it appears that he repeated the substance of his statements to the police (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above). the court records submitted to the court show that the hearings were adjourned and rescheduled on at least thirty-three occasions due to the “witnesses’ failure to appear” (судовий розгляд відкладено у зв’язку з неявкою свідків) and that the trial court repeatedly requested the help of police and of the prosecutor’s office in locating and escorting the witnesses to the hearings. it appears that those measures concerned both the attesting witnesses and t.v.s. however, despite those efforts, those witnesses failed to appear and their pre-trial statements were read out at the trial. in convicting the applicant, the court relied on: the statements of p., the attesting witnesses and t.v.s.; audio and video evidence; police reports documenting the delivery of the marked banknotes to p. and their subsequent discovery, as well as the discovery of the luminescent substance on the applicant’s hand and pocket; statements of the police officers who had organised the investigative actions in question; the results of expert analysis confirming the discovery of the luminescent substance from the same source on the banknotes, on the applicant’s hand and in his pocket; and the applicant’s confession. the court dismissed the applicant’s allegation that his confession had been extracted under duress as unsubstantiated. had not been examined in the course of the trial as they failed to appear at the trial (“которые уклонились от явки в суд первой инстанции”). on 4 february 2010 the kharkiv regional court of appeal upheld the conviction, stating that there was sufficient evidence of the applicant’s guilt. there was no reason to distrust the statements of the victim and the witnesses which were corroborated by the other evidence in the file, including audio and video evidence. the court perceived no reason for the witnesses to falsely testify against the applicant. on 9 june 2010 a supreme court judge denied the applicant leave to appeal on points of law. the criminal-law characterisation of the applicant’s actions was correct and the punishment lawful. there were no grounds to open review proceedings.
the first, second and third applicants were born in 1971, 1947 and 1954 respectively, and live in budapest. the second and third applicants, as well as the legal predecessors of the first and third applicant (ms róbertné hidas and ms miklósné kecskés) and other persons were co-owners of a plot of land of 4,847 sq. they also co‑owned a neighbouring plot of land of 423 sq. on 19 january 1998 the budapest district xxii mayor’s office (hereafter “the local authority”) ordered the partition of plot no. 223591 into two plots measuring 1,519 sq. m. in the same decision, it requisitioned (lejegyzés) the plot of 1,519 sq. m for the purpose of constructing a local public road and awarded compensation of 5,511,000 hungarian forints (huf – approximately 25,000 european currency units (ecu) (the predecessor to the euro) at the material time), to be distributed among the owners in proportion to their ownership shares. at the same time, the local authority also partitioned plot no. 223592 and requisitioned a part of that land with an area of 123 sq. m in exchange for compensation of huf 376,200 (approximately ecu 1,700). the decisions were served on the first applicant’s legal predecessor, the second applicant, the third applicant and the third applicant’s legal predecessor, among other persons. on 6 march 1998 the budapest public administration office (budapest főváros közigazgatási hivatala) upheld the first-instance decisions, which thus became final. on 13 april 1998 some of the above-mentioned owners challenged the administrative decisions in court. the legal predecessor of the first applicant and the second applicant himself were parties to the proceedings, but not the third applicant or his legal predecessor. on 16 march 2005, following two remittals ordered by the budapest court of appeal, the budapest high court delivered a first-instance judgment and dismissed the claim. on 30 november 2005 the budapest court of appeal overturned the first-instance judgment and ordered new administrative proceedings. it held that the local authority’s decision had been tainted by a procedural irregularity, in that the local authority’s notary (who had adopted the decision of 19 january 1998) should have abstained from taking a decision in a case in which the local authority employing him had been one of the interested parties. on 7 february 2008 it adopted a decision identical to that of 19 january 1998 (see paragraph 7 above). on 2 july 2008 the decision was upheld on appeal by the public administration office of budapest, with an amendment that the compensation figures should be increased by accrued interest. on 27 august 2008 the first applicant challenged the new administrative decision in court. the second and third applicants intervened (beavatkozó) in the proceedings in support of the first applicant. on 10 january 2015 the budapest government office (budapest főváros kormányhivatala) adopted a new administrative decision, with the same content as before, but on different legal grounds. on 9 february 2015 the applicants brought court proceedings against that decision. on 19 april 2016 the budapest administrative and labour court delivered its judgment. it dismissed the applicants’ action as far as the requisition’s lawfulness was concerned but quashed the administrative decision as regards the compensation amount. it held that the compensation amount should be set at such sum as reflected by an assessment of the value of the properties as at 2015 and that the assessment should be carried out in accordance with the provisions of government decree no. the government decree in question contained a table for the purposes of calculating social security pensions. in that table, different multiplication factors were associated with different years (from 1950 onwards), making it thus possible to calculate the current value of salaries and incomes received during previous employment. throughout the court proceedings, the land registry has retained a record of the dispute (perfeljegyzés). at the date of the latest information available to the court (2 october 2018), the proceedings concerning the amount of compensation due to the applicants were still pending before the domestic courts.
the applicant was born in 1944 and lives in ljubljana. for the relevant background to the case, see ribać v. slovenia (no. the applicant was a citizen of the republic of serbia in the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia (“the sfry”). following the dissolution of the sfry, he retained citizenship of the then federal republic of yugoslavia. he has had permanent resident status in slovenia since 1977, where he also married and had two children. he was a member of the yugoslav people’s army (hereinafter “the ypa”). on 29 november 1991 the office granted his request. on 25 october 1991 he left slovenia with the ypa and went to kraljevo. the applicant maintained that he had left with the ypa so he could fulfil the retirement conditions. on 21 december 1991 he returned to slovenia, but left again in january 1992, which he maintained was for the purpose of arranging documents for his retirement. on 27 april 1992 the applicant returned to slovenia, holding that it had not been possible for him to return earlier because of the war. on 16 july 1992 the military pension fund for the armed forces of the sfry (hereinafter “the ypa fund”) found the applicant to be entitled to an early retirement pension under sfry military rules as from 1 may 1992. the applicant maintained that he had never received any pension from the ypa fund. by a decision of 7 july 1992 the ministry of the interior refused his application, holding that the applicant had not lived in slovenia between 25 october 1991 and 27 april 1992. the supreme court dismissed his subsequent appeal. the institute also noted that the ministry of defence had opined that there had been no indication of the applicant having participated in aggression against slovenia (section 2(2) of the ordinance; see paragraph 22 below). his subsequent appeal was dismissed and the applicant initiated court proceedings. the court emphasised that there had been nothing to suggest that the applicant had participated in aggression against slovenia as a member of the ypa (section 2(2) of the ordinance). an appeal, an appeal on points of law and a constitutional complaint all lodged by the applicant were dismissed. on 4 november 1998 the applicant applied for an old-age pension under the act on the rights stemming from the pension and disability insurance of former military personnel (hereinafter “the 1998 act”, see paragraph 22 below). on 12 august 1999 the institute dismissed the appeal, holding that the applicant had not fulfilled the statutory requirements under the 1998 act because he had not continuously had permanent resident status in slovenia for the relevant period and had failed to claim his pension rights by 25 june 1991 (section 2(1)(2) of the 1998 act). on 10 january 2003 the ljubljana labour and social court dismissed an application for judicial review lodged by the applicant. it pointed out that the applicant had fulfilled the permanent resident status requirement, but had nevertheless not claimed his pension rights by 25 june 1991. meanwhile, in october 1999 the applicant reapplied for slovenian citizenship. on 15 may 2002 the ministry of interior issued an assurance to the applicant that he would be granted citizenship if he could prove that he had been released from his current citizenship. on 4 february 2003 the applicant acquired citizenship by naturalisation under section 19 of the amended citizenship act (see paragraph 22 below). the applicant appealed, arguing that he should have been granted the pension as from 1 may 1992. an application that he lodged for judicial review and a subsequent appeal were also dismissed by the ljubljana labour and social court and the higher labour and social court respectively, reiterating the institute’s arguments. on 23 march 2009 the supreme court dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant. on 30 march 2010 the constitutional court refused to accept for consideration a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant, finding that it did not concern an important constitutional issue or entail a violation of human rights which had serious consequences for him.

the applicant was born in 1987 and is detained in drogobych. he submitted that the other participants had not been known to him. allegedly named the applicant as an accomplice. on 6 february 2008, in order to verify the applicant’s possible involvement in the aforementioned crime, police officers approached him when he was in the backyard of his house and ordered him to accompany them to a police station. the applicant refused and, according to the police record, attempted to flee. accompanied by his father, he was taken to the sambir police station and spent the following night in detention. they also drew up a report on the applicant’s administrative arrest, which suggested that no physical injuries had been found on him during his apprehension. the applicant refused to sign both reports. on the same date, according to the relevant record, “explanations” were obtained from the applicant in which he confirmed his participation in the burglary and provided further details as to the circumstances of the crime. according to the applicant, he was forced to make such a statement by the head of the police station. he further submitted that no medical assistance had been administered to him for the following five days, despite his complaints of severe pain in the foot. according to the government, the applicant had not suffered any ill‑treatment and had confessed to the burglary of the b. family’s home of his own free will. in this document he confirmed his confession to the burglary. according to the government’s submissions, on the same date the applicant was questioned as a suspect. he admitted his guilt in respect of the burglary and provided the relevant details. the applicant submitted that he had not been questioned on 18 february 2008 and had never waived his right to legal assistance. on 20 and 25 february 2008 the applicant was questioned in the presence of his lawyer. on 21 february 2008 the sambir town court remanded the applicant in custody as a preventive measure pending trial. the examination report was completed on 4 march 2008. on 24 april 2008, during an identification parade, the victim b. pointed to the applicant as having participated in the burglary of her home. on 4 june 2008 the applicant again denied his participation in the burglary. they relied on the bodily injuries which had been discovered on them shortly after their arrest and on the pending criminal proceedings against the police officers. it further relied on the sambir prosecutor’s findings set out in his decision of 7 march 2008, which had not been appealed against by the applicant, according to which on 7 and 12 february 2008 the applicant himself submitted that he had had twisted his foot on the stairs and that he had had no complaints against the officers of sambir police station (see paragraph 37 below). on 14 february 2008 lawyer i., acting upon the instructions of the applicant’s relatives, lodged a criminal complaint with the sambir district prosecutor’s office about the applicant’s ill-treatment and requested that he be given a forensic medical examination. on 27 february and 20 march 2008 the applicant’s mother and father respectively complained to the sambir district prosecutor’s office and the prosecutor general of the applicant’s ill-treatment in police custody and the police’s failure to provide the applicant with timely medical assistance for his foot injury. the prosecutors found the inquiries that had been conducted incomprehensive and of a low professional level and ordered additional investigative steps to be taken. the applicant repeated in detail his account of the events and pointed out the persons who had allegedly ill-treated him. on 17, 18 and 30 september 2008 confrontation interviews between the applicant and the police officers were carried out. he confirmed that the applicant had had a fractured foot when he had been admitted to the hospital, and submitted that the applicant had not replied when asked about the origin of his trauma. on 23 january 2012 an additional forensic medical report was delivered by a panel of experts from the main forensic examination bureau of the ministry of health.
schedule 7 to the terrorism act 2000 (“tact”) empowers police, immigration officers and designated customs officers to stop, examine and search passengers at ports, airports and international rail terminals. however, questioning must be for the purpose of determining whether the person appears to be concerned or to have been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. if someone fails to co-operate he or she is deemed to have committed a criminal offence and could face up to three months in prison, a fine or both. the applicant, a french national, is ordinarily resident in the united kingdom. her husband, who is also a french national, is in custody in france in relation to terrorist offences. she was therefore taken to an examination room with her youngest child. the applicant’s luggage was taken to another room and searched. the applicant asked to consult a lawyer and for an opportunity to pray. at approximately 9.00 p.m., while she was praying, one of the officers spoke with her lawyer and indicated that she would be free to speak to him in fifteen minutes. when she finished praying, she was told that she could telephone her lawyer after she had been searched. in or around 9.30 p.m. the applicant was taken to an examination room and served with a form tact 1 (see paragraph 42 below). in response, she informed the officers that she would only answer questions after her lawyer arrived. she was also told that she was “free to go”. the first and second charges were eventually dismissed. unlike the code of practice relating to the powers exercised under section 44 of tact (the provisions under consideration in gillan and quinton), in the present case the relevant home office code of practice and accompanying practical advice (see paragraphs 42 and 43 below) afforded a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by the executive. not being constrained by the authority of gillan and quinton, the court went on to find that the schedule 7 powers were sufficiently circumscribed and were therefore “in accordance with the law”. thirdly, the schedule 7 powers were applicable only to a limited category of people: namely, travellers in confined geographical areas. for the reasons already given, we are not at all persuaded that these powers render the public vulnerable ‘...to interference by public officials acting on any personal whim, caprice, malice, predilection or purpose other than for which the power was conferred’ – lord bingham’s test for arbitrariness, in gillan (hl), at [34], set out above. equally, we are not persuaded that these are unfettered powers, falling foul of the test applied in gillan (strasbourg), at [76] – [77], also set out above; for our part, the ‘level of precision’ of these powers (ibid) falls and falls comfortably on the right side of the line.” as she had been returning to the united kingdom after visiting her husband, who was imprisoned in france for terrorism offences, she was not stopped and examined on a random basis. moreover, the questions asked of her were rationally connected to the statutory purpose and were in no way disproportionate. finally, the court considered the applicant’s argument under article 6 of the convention. the applicant was granted permission to appeal to the supreme court, which gave judgment on 22 july 2015. with regard to the article 8 complaint, lord hughes (with whom lord hodge agreed) also considered that gillan and quinton (cited above) was distinguishable on its facts since the schedule 7 power was confined to those passing through ports of entry/exit, while the section 44 power was exercisable in relation to any person anywhere in the street. furthermore, it did not follow that the fair balance between the rights of the individual and the interest of the public would fall in the same place. in other words, an unfettered power which might be arbitrarily or capriciously used did not become legal just because people generally did not take exception to its use. furthermore, given that there were 245 million passenger movements through united kingdom ports every year, the fact that the schedule 7 power was used sparingly could have no bearing on its legality. (c)  privilege against self-incrimination 38. lord kerr considered the requirement that a person questioned under schedule 7 must answer on pain of prosecution for failing to do so to be in breach of that person’s common law privilege against self-incrimination and therefore incompatible with article 6 of the convention. if she was asked questions designed to establish whether she appeared to be a terrorist, the potential of her answers to incriminate her if they were of an inculpatory character was indisputable.
the applicants are entrepreneurs who obtained from the local authorities in leova licences (patenta) to offer services such as selling various types of goods at the local marketplace. all the applicants offered their services on the territory of a private marketplace (l.) situated in the centre of leova and which had received its licence in 1996. the local authorities authorised the offering of services on the territory of l. from monday to saturday. another marketplace, owned by the state (u.), was open on sundays, but was situated far from the centre and was inconvenient to many sellers and the population. the applicants and l.’s owners asked the local authorities for a change in work schedule, allowing them to work on sundays and to have their free day on monday, as was the case of many similar marketplaces in other towns. however, the local authorities rejected on a number of occasions such a change, invoking various sanitary, public order and other reasons. according to the applicants, the real reason for the refusal was the protection of u.’s interests, since sunday was the most lucrative day of the week. on 2 march 2005 the leova city council adopted its decision no. the reasons were that work on sunday would cause traffic problems and would disturb the nearby population, including a school and a hospital. the decision was printed a stationery with the heading of the mayor’s office. on 4 april 2005 the general meeting of entrepreneurs (including the applicants) expressed its disagreement with the decision of 2 march 2005. on the same day the 191 entrepreneurs working on the territory of l., including the applicants, declared a strike and decided to submit an official request for a change in their work schedule. accordingly, on 4 april 2005 the entrepreneurs submitted their request to the “leova regional council”. they asked, inter alia, for the annulment of the decision 2.2 adopted by the city council on 2 march 2005 and explained that they had not been offered proper working conditions on the territory of u. 10. on the same date the applicants sent a preliminary request to the mayoralty of leova. in it, the applicants made a similar description to that in their complaint made mentioned in paragraph above. they asked for the annulment of decision no. 2.2 adopted by the city council of the leova mayoralty. on 6 april 2005 the leova city council discussed at its meeting the demands of the entrepreneurs and of l.’s administration, made in their request of 4 april 2005. according to the applicants, l.’s director was allowed to address the councillors and spoke about the applicants’ demands. after discussing the issue, the city council adopted its decision no. 3.1 in which it took note of the applicants’ demands and decided that l. was to work in accordance with the decision of the leova city council no. on 12 may 2005 the mayor of leova replied to the complaint of 4 april 2005. they argued that their rights had been affected by that decision and that its aim was the protection of u.’s interests. they annexed copies of the preliminary request addressed to the mayoralty, of their complaint made on 4 april 2005 to the leova city council, and of the reply of the mayor’s office of 12 may 2005 (see the preceding paragraph). on 5 july 2005 the leova district court found in favour of the entrepreneurs. it also accepted in full the applicants’ request for compensation for their legal costs of 15,000 moldovan lei, a sum which they had paid to the lawyer for representing them in this case. by its final decision of 20 october 2005 the cahul court of appeal quashed the lower court’s judgment and decided to strike out the court action lodged by the entrepreneurs. therefore, article 14 of the law on administrative proceedings (see paragraph 17 below) had not been observed since the complaint had to be submitted first to the authority which had adopted the impugned decision. the court added that the applicants no longer had the right to complain against the decision of 2 march 2005.
the applicant was born in 1938 and lived in budva. on 8 october 2009 the applicant’s brother was murdered in belgrade, serbia. shortly afterwards the applicant publicly offered a reward for any relevant information. on 29 april 2013 x was murdered in an ambush in belgrade by 15 shots. on 18 july 2013 the organised crime prosecution in serbia opened an investigation in respect of the applicant and several other persons in relation to the murder of x. the investigation order implied that the applicant had arranged the murder of x as he had considered x’s brother responsible for the murder of his own brother. on an unspecified date between 18 and 26 july 2013 the applicant was arrested in montenegro. on 29 january 2014 the high court (viši sud) in podgorica refused the request, which decision was upheld by the court of appeals (apelacioni sud). on 4 april 2014 the supreme state prosecution of montenegro authorised the applicant’s prosecution in montenegro. the decision was based on the assessment that he could influence the witnesses and that his release could seriously disturb public peace and order. he submitted, inter alia, that he had neither any reason nor any possibility to influence the other suspects given that they were in detention under a special regime in belgrade. he also submitted that he had been in extradition detention for seven months and that the public had not been disturbed after he had been released. he also maintained that he had not fled, nor did he have any reason to do so, and that his wife and a minor child lived in montenegro, too. no appeal was allowed against the decisions of 7 july, 4 august and 5 september 2014. on 7 october 2014 the high state prosecutor issued an indictment against the applicant for aggravated murder through incitement and for criminal association. on 17 october 2014 the high court extended the applicant’s detention “until a further decision of the court”, on the basis of article 175 § 1(4) of the cpc. on 31 october 2014 the court of appeals dismissed the appeals submitted by the applicant and his representatives against the decision of 17 october 2014 extending his detention. he submitted that his detention had not been reviewed after a 30-day period and that therefore it had been unlawful as of 15 november 2014. the court also considered that detention could not be replaced by any other, less restrictive measure. he submitted, in particular, that the court had failed to review within 30 days whether the reasons for his detention persisted, and when it had done so, it had merely copied the earlier reasoning without really examining what exactly would disturb public peace and order, as nothing had happened when he had been released after the seven-month extradition detention. on 25 december 2014 the court of appeals dismissed the appeals. it was irrelevant that it had been returned and further investigation requested. on an unspecified date, apparently between 25 december 2014 and 8 january 2015, the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal. 207; clooth v. belgium, 12 december 1991, series a no. the applicant’s detention was further extended on 15 january, 30 january, 2 march, 2 april, 4 may, 4 june, 6 july, 6 august, 10 september, 9 october, 9 november and 9 december 2015, 11 january, 11 february, 11 march, 11 april, 11 may, 13 june, 15 july, 25 july, 1 september, 4 october and 4 november 2016. he was hospitalised again on 28 november 2016. there is no information in the case file as to when he was released from hospital. on 19 october 2016 the indictment was returned for further investigation. he invoked, inter alia, articles 5, 6 and 13 of the convention. it would appear that this constitutional appeal is still pending. the court took into account the length of detention thus far, the fact that the indictment had been returned for the third time, and that it was uncertain when and if at all it would come into force, and held that the applicant should not bear the consequences of that.
the applicants were born in 1955 and 1948 respectively. the first applicant died on 29 august 2018. the second applicant lives in st petersburg. on 28 september 2006 o. gave birth to a daughter, m. 10. in may 2008 o. and m. moved in with the applicants in russia. on 3 april 2011 o. died of a serious illness. on 24 october 2012 the kirovskiy district court of st petersburg granted the second applicant’s application and deprived k.o.v.-s. the applicants at that stage supported their decision. from february to april 2013 mr and ms z. underwent training courses for individuals wishing to adopt a child left without parental care. on 19 june 2013 the head of the krasnenkaya rechka municipal entity received a written statement from the second applicant to the effect that he did not object to the adoption of m. by mr and ms z. 20. she further tried, in vain, to deprive the second applicant of his guardianship of m. and have n.b. the child’s place of residence was determined as being with ms z. 23. on 4 july 2013 m. moved in with mr and ms z. 24. from that moment on the first applicant began to lodge applications with the childcare authorities alleging that ms z. prevented her communicating with the child. on 9 december 2013 the first applicant informed the childcare authorities that none of the meetings had taken place. on 16 march 2015 the district court granted the second applicant’s application. it noted that the second applicant had known about the proceedings, had not raised any objections to the adoption and had asked to have the case examined in his absence. as regards the second applicant’s argument to the effect that the child’s adoption had led to the termination of all contact between her and the grandparents, the city court stated, relying on article 67 §§ 1 and 2 of the family code, that the grandfather, grandmother, brothers, sisters and other relatives have a right to contact with the child and that in the event of a refusal by the child’s parents to afford them such contact, they are entitled to apply to a court to have the obstacles to their contact with the child eliminated. meanwhile, on 28 may 2015 the first applicant applied to the district court to have the procedural time-limit for lodging her appeal against the adoption judgment of 26 november 2013 restored. however, on 14 july 2015 the district court dismissed her application. on 10 september 2015 the city court upheld the above decision on appeal. on 18 april 2014 the administration of the municipal entity krasnenkaya rechka submitted that the girl needed a calm psychological atmosphere; that she perceived the situation around her as tense and anxious; and that she did not understand the conflict between the applicants themselves and between the first applicant and the girl’s adoptive parents. on 16 october 2014 in her conversation with a psychologist m. submitted that the applicants “had never been friends”, that they often swore, even in her presence; and that she was not frightened when they swore because she was used to it. on 21 january 2015 an expert of the istina independent expert organisation gave her opinion that the child considered and called mr and ms z. her parents. despite the absence of contact, the girl remembered and loved her grandmother. this was explained by the fact that the adoptive parents, although preventing their communication, were not exercising psychological pressure on the girl and were not denigrating the grandmother. however, since the girl retained the positive image of her grandmother and expressed her wish to communicate with her, it was possible to establish a contact arrangement, which would provide for an obligatory preparatory stage, including reconciliation between the relatives. the city court held that the district court had committed substantial violations of material and procedural law which resulted in wrongful conclusions. on an unspecified date in 2015 the second applicant instituted court proceedings against mr and ms z., seeking to oblige them not to thwart his contact with his granddaughter m. and to have the contact schedule with the latter determined pursuant to article 67 of the family code. consequently, the district court discontinued the proceedings.
on 18 july 2006 a local daily newspaper, the kostroma chronometer (хронометр-кострома) published in issue no. 29 an article by the applicant entitled “an unfunny film” (несмешное кино). the first episode of the series, ‘there is no corruption in the regional administration’ was released in 2002, when a criminal investigation was initiated against d.s., in spite of the serious nature of the criminal charges brought against his deputy, governor v.sh. it is curious that even after the delivery of the verdict finding d.s. persisted and for a long time refused to dismiss from office the civil servant who had tainted his reputation. he was able to part with such a ‘promising’ employee only after the prosecutor of the region had made an official request to this end...” 7. on 28 july 2006 the administration of the kostroma region and v.sh., all these events attracted public attention and drew wide public response in the region, regardless of articles in the press. in view of the foregoing, the court finds no grounds to allow the claims brought by the administration of the kostroma region. the statements published in the newspaper concerning governor v.sh. ’s attempts to shield, at all costs, the actions of his subordinate d.s., who was facing criminal charges, have not been confirmed [as truthful] in the course of the court hearing. the governor requested that the court examine the possible termination of criminal proceedings against d.s., taking into account legal norms in force. ‘at all costs’ [всеми силами] means [according to the dictionary] by all means and in every manner. was trying to prove to the court that [his deputy] d.s. had not been involved in the crimes he had been accused of and that he was trying to help him escape criminal responsibility at all costs. and the information concerning the latter’s personal character. consequently, the information contained in the article in the part impugned by the claimant does not reflect the truth. in the court’s opinion, the statements disseminated concerning the governor are of a damaging nature because they lead a reader to the opinion that he has broken moral and ethical norms, behaved improperly towards society, [and] ignored the requirements of the criminal procedure laws. this expression describes a person who, for the sake of personal or narrowly interpreted institutional interests, does not want to wash his dirty linen in public [and] wishes to maintain decency and a good reputation by any means possible. the governor was pursuing his private interests or those of the administration of the kostroma region. the applicant and the editor-in-chief of the newspaper appealed against the judgment to the kostroma regional court (“the regional court”) referring, inter alia, to the fact that the impugned statements represented value judgments which had a strong factual basis in the form of the governor’s petition to judge m. the administration of the kostroma region also appealed. on 11 december 2006 the regional court rejected the applicant’s appeal and upheld the judgment of 5 october 2006 in full. its reasoning included the following:

the applicant was born in 1969 and is serving a sentence of imprisonment in tavda, sverdlovsk region. on 22 september 2000 criminal proceedings were instituted in connection with a murder and a robbery committed in march 1999. regard was had to the gravity of the charges and the risk that the applicant might obstruct the establishment of the truth. on 23 may 2006 the dzerzhinskiy district court of nizhniy tagil (“the district court”) rejected the applicant’s complaint. on 17 july 2006 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 24 august 2006 on the same grounds. on 24 august 2006 the district court further extended the applicant’s detention until 18 september 2006. under questioning on the same day the applicant confirmed that the substance of the charges was clear to him. on 31 august 2006 the applicant studied the case file, which comprised three volumes. on 5 september 2006 the applicant was served with a bill of indictment and the case was submitted to the regional court for trial. at 11.30 p.m. officers and investigators (nine officers in total) entered the applicant’s flat in order to arrest him. according to them, when they shouted that they were the police the applicant tried to reach for a bag containing a razor blade. according to the applicant, when the officers entered the room where he was sleeping they immediately dragged him on to the floor and started kicking and beating him with their gun stocks. the record of the applicant’s medical examination in the remand prison indicates that the applicant complained of severe pain in the left side of his chest area. a preliminary diagnosis of broken ribs was given. the fractures were bound and the applicant was found fit for detention. the investigator relied mainly on the statements made by those officers. following the communication of the complaint of ill-treatment to the government (see paragraph 4 above), on 5 december 2012 the acting prosecutor of the perm region quashed the decision of 17 april 2006, finding that the pre-investigation inquiry had been incomplete. they suggested that he could have hurt himself when he tried to get hold of a razor blade during the arrest. a forensic medical examination was ordered. at that moment the officers pressed him on to the floor and rolled him on to his abdomen. he noted, in particular, that at the regional hospital the applicant had explained that he had received his injuries when he had fallen in the street on 18 march 2006. in august 2016 his request was dismissed. on 5 april 2006 the applicant was transferred to nizhniy tagil sizo-3. according to the applicant, on numerous occasions between 14 april and 6 september 2006 he was taken from sizo-3 to the dzerzhinskiy police station in nizhniy tagil, where he was threatened in order to make him cooperate with the investigating authority. on 5 june 2006 the applicant was transferred to the medical unit of sizo-3 because of chronic bronchitis. on 18 april 2009 an investigator from the dzerzhinskiy district investigative division of nizhniy tagil of the investigation department of the investigation committee at the russian federation’s prosecutor’s office for the sverdlovsk region (“the dzerzhinskiy district investigation division”) refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of investigator b. in charge of the applicant’s criminal case. on 9 january 2013 a chief investigator of the dzerzhinskiy district investigation division took a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings. on the basis of the available documents and testimonies, the investigator concluded that throughout his stay at nizhniy tagil sizo-3 the applicant had had access to medical assistance and had received treatment for his bronchial asthma. on 24 june 2016 the regional court upheld the above decision on appeal. the envelope was already open and certain pages were missing.
the applicant was born in 1957 and lives in carate urio (como). the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. the applicant is a well-known italian journalist. at the material time, specifically from january 2007 until 15 july 2008, he was the editor-in-chief of libero, a national daily newspaper that sold around 125,000 copies per day. on 17 february 2007 one of the main italian newspapers, la stampa, published an article covering the story of a thirteen-year old girl who had undergone an abortion. the article suggested that the girl had been forced to undergo the abortion by her parents and g.c., the guardianship judge (giudice tutelare) who had authorised the procedure. later that day it was reported that there had been no pressure placed on the teenager, and that she had decided alone to terminate the pregnancy. this clarification was widely disseminated by different sources: in particular, the national press agency (ansa) issued a number of press releases on 17 february 2007 clarifying the events; the television news bulletins broadcast by rai2 and rai3 (italy’s public national television channels) reported that the news concerning the alleged pressure on the teenager was false; the newspapers corriere della sera and la repubblica reported the facts of the case in the same vein. on 18 february 2007 two articles were published in libero concerning the events involving the teenager. the first article, written by an unknown person under the pseudonym “dreyfus”, was entitled “judge orders abortion. the law is stronger than life” (il giudice ordina l’aborto. it was worded as follows:
“a teenager from turin has been forced by her parents to [have an abortion] ... the magistrate has heard the parties and has applied the law – the law! – ordering the compulsory abortion ... she did not want. she struggled ... [n]ow the young mother (you are still considered as a mother even if your son died) is hospitalised as mentally ill. the medicine and the judiciary are accomplices in the [coercive abortion]”. filed a criminal complaint against the applicant and a.m. with the milan district court. in a judgment of 26 january 2009, filed in the relevant registry on 20 march 2009, the district court found the applicant guilty of omesso controllo, as far as the article drafted by a. m. was concerned, and of aggravated defamation since, as head of the newspaper, he was responsible for the article published under the pseudonym “dreyfus”. it concluded: (i) that both articles contained false information, and (ii) that the content of both articles had severely damaged the reputation of the victim, clearly overstepping the boundaries of the applicant’s right to freely impart information. in its judgment of 17 june 2011, filed in the relevant registry on 24 june 2011, the milan court of appeal quashed the first-instance judgment in part. it pointed out that the articles at issue had reported false information, since the thirteen-year old girl had decided alone to terminate the pregnancy. the court of appeal thus increased the penalty to one year and two months’ imprisonment, and upheld the fine of eur 5,000. in addition, the damages were also increased from eur 10,000 to eur 30,000. in particular, the court of cassation sought to justify the imposition of a custodial sentence by arguing that there were exceptional circumstances in the case. in particular, the imposition of the detention measure had been justified by a set of concurrent factors, such as the existence of the aggravating circumstance of “imputing a specific fact”; the applicant’s personality, his criminal record (the applicant being a recidivist) and the fact that the publication of false information had undermined the reputation of g.c., on an unspecified date, relying on article 87 § 11 of the constitution, the applicant filed a request with the president of the italian republic to convert the remainder of the detention period into a fine. by a decree of 21 december 2012 the applicant’s request was granted and his sentence was commuted into the payment of a eur 15,532 fine. in his decision to commute the applicant’s penalty, the president relied on the criticism expressed by the european court of human rights with respect to the imposition of custodial sentences on journalists. he also expressed his concerns about the ongoing review of the legislation on defamation, which was on hold owing to difficulties in striking a balance between the need to set out more lenient sanctions while at the same time ensuring more effective redress measures. the applicant spent twenty-one days under house arrest, starting 30 november 2012 until 21 december 2012, when he was released (see paragraphs 20-22).
the applicant was born in 1992 and is currently serving a prison sentence. the applicant was a student at the azerbaijan state university of economics at the time of the events. he was also a civil society activist and was one of the founders of free youth, a non‑governmental organisation established in 2011. following a number of deaths of soldiers in the azerbaijani army in non-combat situations, from january until march 2013 a number of demonstrations were held in baku in protest against the deaths of soldiers in the army. the demonstrations were organised through social media and the information about them was disseminated through social media and the press. the applicant actively participated in those demonstrations and in their organisation. the nida civic movement, a non-governmental organisation established by a group of young people, played a key role in the organisation and conduct of the above-mentioned demonstrations. although the demonstrations were peaceful, the police dispersed those who had gathered and a number of demonstrators were arrested (see, for example among many other cases, mehtiyev and others v. azerbaijan, nos. 20589/13 and 7 others, 6 april 2017; bayramov v. azerbaijan, nos. a number of video performances of a “harlem shake” dance by different groups of people were prepared in azerbaijan and uploaded to the youtube video-hosting website. the applicant did not dance and just observed those who were dancing. on an unspecified date the video recording of the dance was uploaded to youtube. there is no document in the case file indicating that the video recording in question was uploaded to youtube by the applicant. it represents seven individuals dancing together in a park. in the back of the scene, one person is dancing in a close proximity to a bronze statue, making sexually suggestive movements. 48653/13 and 3 others, §§ 5-16, 7 june 2018). the applicant was questioned twice as a witness within the framework of those criminal proceedings prior to his arrest. since 2013 various criminal proceedings have been instituted against members of nida who have been arrested and detained within the framework of those criminal proceedings. 65583/13, 70106/13, 41105/14, 54846/14, 63571/16, 74143/16 and 14307/17). the description of the charges consisted of a single sentence half a page long. the court cited the risk of his absconding and reoffending, together with the nature of the criminal act, and justified its decision as follows:
“having examined the request with the [aid of the] material in the case file and having heard the submissions of those who have been present at this court hearing, and taking into account the fact that there is a likelihood that the accused, ilkin bakir oglu rustamzade, will abscond from the investigation and reoffend, as well as the nature of the criminal act attributed to him, the court considers that he should be remanded in custody.” the appellate court made no mention of the applicant’s above-mentioned specific complaints. on 27 june 2013 the applicant lodged a request with the nasimi district court, asking to be put under house arrest instead of being held in pre-trial detention. he claimed, in particular, that his pre-trial detention was not justified and that there was no reason for it to continue. on 28 june 2013 the nasimi district court dismissed the request, finding it unfounded. on 4 july 2013 the baku court of appeal upheld the first-instance court’s decision. he also reiterated that there was no evidence that he had committed any criminal offence and that the court, in deciding to extend his pre-trial detention, had not examined any evidence proving that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed a criminal offence. on 22 july 2013 the baku court of appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the nasimi district court’s decision of 15 july 2013. no further extension decisions were included in the case file. on 6 may 2014 the baku court of serious crimes found the applicant guilty on all counts and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment.

in the 1970s a copper-molybdenum deposit (‘teghout’) was discovered about four and six km away from the villages of teghout and shnogh respectively, in the lori region. in 2001 a private company, armenian copper programme cjsc, was granted a mining licence for the exploitation of the teghout copper‑molybdenum deposit for a period of twenty-five years. on 1 november 2007 the government adopted decree no. 1279-n approving the designation of territories situated within the administrative boundaries of the rural communities of shnogh and teghout in the lori region as expropriation zones, to be taken for state needs, thus changing the category of land use. according to the decree, armenian copper programme cjsc or teghout cjsc, founded by the former for the purpose of the implementation of the teghout copper-molybdenum deposit exploitation project, were to acquire the units of land listed in its annexes. the plots of land belonging to the applicants were listed among the units of land falling within these expropriation zones. the applicants, a family of four, live in shnogh village and earn their living from agriculture and apiculture. they jointly owned two plots of arable land in the village measuring 0.373 ha and 0.448 ha. they also owned a beekeeper’s house measuring 69.4 square metres situated on the second plot of land. the land was used for growing crops for the family, feeding their livestock and beekeeping. on an unspecified date teghout cjsc addressed a letter to the applicants containing an offer to buy their plots of land. compensation of 183,000 armenian drams (amd, approximately 398 euros (eur)) and amd 304,000 (approximately eur 661) was offered for the two plots of land respectively, plus an additional 15% as required by law. the applicants did not reply to the offer, not being satisfied with the amount of compensation. it appears that they tried to obtain an alternative valuation of their property by another company, but did not succeed. they claim that no other valuation company was willing to make an independent assessment of the market value of their land. on 12 may 2008 teghout cjsc lodged a claim against the applicants seeking to oblige them to sign an agreement on the taking of their property for state needs. the company based its claim, inter alia, on the valuations prepared at its request by oliver group llc, a licensed valuation company. according to the reports, the market value of the applicants’ plots of land was estimated at amd 183,000 (approximately eur 398) and amd 304,000 (approximately eur 661) respectively. in the proceedings before the lori regional court the applicants argued that the market value of their land had been underestimated. they further submitted that the valuation of their property had not been carried out correctly, since no account had been taken of the number of trees, the beekeeper’s house situated on the second plot of land, and a number of other factors that should have affected the calculation of the amount of compensation. in the course of the proceedings, teghout cjsc submitted new valuations of the applicants’ property, also prepared by oliver group llc. the representative of teghout cjsc stated that a new valuation of the applicant’s second plot of land had been conducted in order to include the building situated on it. according to the new valuations, the market value of the applicants’ second plot of land including the building was estimated to be amd 1,728,000 (approximately eur 3,760). as to the first plot of land, it was stated that oliver group llc had prepared a corrected report according to which the market value of the property was amd 189,000 (approximately eur 410). the final amounts of compensation for the two plots of land, including the additional 15% required by law, would thus be equal to amd 217,350 (approximately eur 473) and amd 1,987,200 (approximately eur 4,320) respectively. on 28 november 2008 the regional court granted teghout cjsc’s claim, awarding the applicants compensation of amd 217,350 for the first plot of land and amd 1,987,200 for the second plot of land. relying, inter alia, on article 1 of protocol no. 1 to the convention, they complained that the regional court had deprived them of their property. the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law, raising similar arguments to those submitted in the previous appeal. on 12 august 2009 the court of cassation declared the applicants’ cassation appeal inadmissible for lack of merit.
the applicant was born in 1946 and currently lives in berlin, germany. in 2005 he was an english teacher in a school in kyiv, ukraine. at that time he entered into private relations with a married woman living in kyiv. her husband was indicated as the father in the child’s birth certificate. in 2007 a dna test was performed proving that the applicant was in fact the father of the child. the applicant was not prevented from having access to the child by her mother, who accepted financial support from him on a monthly basis. the applicant bought a car for the child’s mother. in 2011 he wrote a will bequeathing all his property to the child. the applicant had regular contact with the child until 2015 when the mother informed the applicant that she had divorced her husband and that she had decided to marry a german national and move with the child to germany. as the applicant opposed the decision to emigrate to germany, the mother denied him access to the child and prevented him from communicating with the child. in june 2015 the applicant initiated proceedings before the darnytskyy district court of kyiv (“the district court”) seeking recognition of his paternity and to have the child’s birth certificate amended accordingly. during the hearing the mother of the child admitted that the applicant had provided regular financial support and had taken part in the upbringing and education of the child. however, she submitted that the applicant’s claims were time-barred under article 129 § 2 of the family code, which provided a one-year time-limit for such claims (see paragraph 15 below). the applicant contended that he had delayed his lawsuit because he had not wished to disturb the child’s family situation and he had not been prevented from communicating with the child on a regular basis until 2015. only when the child’s mother had decided to emigrate to another country with the child had he decided to seek formal recognition of his paternity. on 17 november 2015 the district court allowed the applicant’s claims, declaring him the father of the child and ordering the amendment of the child’s birth certificate. the district court considered that the applicant had missed the time-limit for valid reasons. it took into account the applicant’s argument that he had not wished to disturb the family and cause any harm to the child with a lawsuit during the long period when the mother had in fact assisted him in having regular access to the child. on 3 february 2016 the kyiv court of appeal overturned the district court’s decision and dismissed the applicant’s claim as time-barred. the appellate court stated that article 129 § 2 of the family code provided a one-year time-limit, which had started to run from the moment the applicant had found out or should have found out about his paternity. the applicant had become aware of his paternity in 2007 when the dna test had been performed (see paragraph 6 above); however he had applied to the court in 2015 (see paragraph 8 above), which had been too late. the applicant appealed on points of law, arguing that the court of appeal had applied the statute of limitations without duly taking into account the reasons for which he had delayed his action and without examining the child’s interests. on 13 july 2016 the higher specialised civil and criminal court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law, without examining whether the applicant had provided valid reasons which could justify his non-compliance with the time-limit set out in article 129 § 2 of the family code.
the applicant was born in 1988 and lives in beiuş. and had a daughter with him, born in 2011. on 21 may and 5 june 2013 respectively i.t. and the applicant filed for divorce and each sought sole custody of the child. pay her 1,000 romanian lei (ron – approximately 225 euros (eur)) for each day of non-enforcement of the custody order. had not opposed the enforcement and that it had been the child who had refused to go with her mother. on 6 october 2014 the bailiff lodged a criminal complaint against i.t. but the child who had opposed the enforcement. they asked to see the child to verify if she wanted to go with her mother. refused, but eventually he brought the child out. however, i should note that, although the minor did not show an aversion towards her mother, she did not wish to leave with her mother. the social worker reached the same conclusion.” the atmosphere was tense, the parents made reproaches to each other in front of the child and they spoke to each other in a raised voice. after the child sat for a while with the mother, [the bailiff] asked the child if she wished to leave with her mother. although the child did not show an aversion towards her mother, she refused to leave with her.” on 13 november 2014 the applicant complained to the child protection authority that the social worker who had accompanied her and the bailiff on 4 november 2014 had been unfamiliar with the case, had questioned her motives in front of the child and had not known how to facilitate their reunion. it appears that she received no reply to her complaint. on 8 december 2014, at the bailiff’s request and based on the report of the visit of 4 november 2014, the child protection authority applied for mandatory counselling under article 912 of the code of civil procedure, with a view to re-establishing a relationship between the applicant and the child. the psychologist met the parents separately and together and met the child. refused to allow the applicant to participate in the counselling sessions together with the child. on 16 june 2015 the psychologist submitted her report to the court and to the child protection authority. for refusing to comply with a court order and for alleged acts of violence against the child when the applicant had wanted to take her home. on 30 september 2016 the prosecutor decided not to charge i.t. the applicant did not complain about that decision. ’s new wife and the child were interviewed by a court-appointed psychologist who was tasked with assessing the family relations between the parties. she concluded that the child needed time to rebuild her relationship with her mother and recommended that a contact schedule be drawn up between them. she also recommended parental counselling. appealed, but in a final decision of 29 september 2016 the bihor county court upheld the previous decision. the relevant parts read as follows:
“the minor must have a normal relationship with both parents, which presupposes that the current situation, where she is distanced from her mother, is overcome, because otherwise it will be almost impossible for her to re-establish a normal relationship with her mother, and this does not serve the child’s best interests. the parties must understand ... that the minor must be supported in order to adapt to her new environment...
the court is not bound by the wish expressed by the minor to remain with her father, because she is of a young age and because the father has persuaded the minor not to go to her mother’s home. ...
the applicant was born in 1973 and lives in mica. who started walking alongside her and who tried unsuccessfully to engage her in conversation. and asked him if he wanted to accompany him in order to finalise a transaction over a horse. he eventually offered her money and a mobile phone if she agreed to have oral sex with him. continued following her and, as the applicant was telling him that he was wasting his time because she would not accept the proposal, he grabbed her by the right arm and the neck and dragged her close to a nearby cemetery. the applicant alleged that she was threatened by t.f.s. in a state of shock, the applicant obeyed. who had previously been the landlady of a local police officer. that she had been raped by a man wearing black clothes. as no one answered, she went home and showered. later that evening she talked to her mother and to a friend, explaining to them what had happened. in the morning of 21 may 2008 the applicant went to the local police in mica accompanied by her husband and lodged a criminal complaint. she complained that she had been threatened with a knife by an unknown man and forced to have sexual intercourse with him. the same day the police interrogated i.l., he stated that he had not noticed anything special in her behaviour. on 22 may 2008 the applicant went to the târgu-mureş institute of forensic medicine for examination. she concluded that ever since the attack she had been in a constant state of distress and was afraid to leave the house, fearing that the attacker would come and find her because she had dared to complain to the police. on 21 january 2009 the prosecutor’s office attached to the târnăveni district court decided not to open criminal proceedings, as the acts committed by t.f.s. had testified that he had not noticed anything unusual when he had met the applicant and t.f.s. had threatened her that he would use a knife, and had violently grabbed her by the arm and throat, and that that was why she had complied with his orders. she also requested that a psychiatric expert report be made in the case, in view of the fact that she was suffering from oligophrenia and depressive syndrome. to have sexual intercourse with the applicant. the applicant stated that during the events of 20 may t.f.s. had constantly threatened that he would use the knife he had with him. finally, the court advised the prosecution to take into account the fact that t.f.s. lacked the elements defining the crime of rape. more specifically, in the absence of a connection between the injuries to the applicant’s arm and the alleged physical coercion, and in the absence of any injuries specific to the crime of rape in the genital area, the alleged physical coercion had not been proved. the lawyer stressed that the evidence ordered by the târnăveni district court in the decision of 6 may 2009 was extremely important to the case, and that failure to collect this evidence at the relevant time was the prosecution’s fault. the court stated in particular that it was unnecessary to re-interrogate s.i., the court further found that the forensic report did not support the applicant’s allegations, since, on the one hand, it did not reveal injuries specific to rape in the genital area, and, on the other, the injuries to the applicant’s arm were undated.
the applicant was born in 1958 and lives in oslo. she is a well-known lawyer who mainly deals with criminal and child custody cases. she is married to a businessman and was formerly a talk show host and active participant in public debate. there was no editorial content in the forum; all content was user-generated. on 5 november 2010 a forum thread was started in the subforum “theme of the day” under the heading “mona høiness – the case is growing, according to kapital” (“mona høiness – saken vokser, sier kapital”), where the original poster wrote only “what is the status?” (“ leste om denne saken såvidt, for flere uker siden. all the comments were made anonymously and thus the number of possible different posters was unknown. in the letter, it was expressly stated that this was not to be made part of the existing complaint against kapital, so as not to further delay the handling of that complaint by the publisher. he submitted that it could not therefore be taken into account in a complaint against the latter. the applicant’s counsel sent an email at 12.32 p.m. on 17 november 2010 to mr b. and mr h., an editor working for hegnar online, requesting written confirmation that the comments would be deleted immediately and arguing that mr hegnar himself had “declined all responsibility for the matter” (“fraskrev seg alt ansvar for saken”). on 23 november 2010 the press complaints commission examined the applicant’s complaints against kapital and finansavisen (see paragraph 6 above), and found that both publications had breached the code of conduct for journalists (vær varsom-plakaten): kapital for their use of a misleading headline (case no. she smiled knowingly ... [(“smilte lurt”)]”. all the comments in the thread were made anonymously. from that it emerged that comment 3 had by then been read 115 times. on 7 april 2011 the applicant’s counsel sent a letter to hegnar online stating the applicant’s intention to instigate civil proceedings against hegnar online and the editor, mr h., because comments 1 to 3 had been defamatory and contrary to article 246 of the penal code (see paragraph 43 below). the counsel stated that the company hegnar media as, into which hegnar online had by then been incorporated, had a procedure that made it simple to complain about forum comments that anyone might consider inappropriate. next to each post was a link which could be clicked on in order to warn the company (“warning button”). when the company received such complaints, this usually led to deletion of the comment. furthermore, the comments in question had not been defamatory and had been removed as soon as the company had become aware of them. the city court heard the case from 19 to 20 december 2011. no further information about who or what kind of person that might be had been given either in the forum or during the civil case. the city court stated that it was in no doubt as to the result of the case and noted that the applicant had turned down the defendant’s offer of settlement (see paragraph 21 above). lastly, she submitted that the defendants had been awarded an amount of litigation costs exceeding what had been necessary. the statements had been unserious and sexually loaded. instead, the high court proceeded on the basis that the applicant’s claim for compensation could in any event not succeed unless the defendants had acted with sufficient culpability. however, there were a very large number of posts on the forum as a whole, and the high court presumed that only a few discoveries of content to be removed had been made at the relevant time. the editorial staff had been notified of the two comments by email on 17 november 2010, and had responded thirteen minutes later that they had been removed. this had clearly been an adequate reaction. however, the high court discussed whether the letter from the applicant’s counsel to the press complaints commission on 8 november 2010 (see paragraph 10 above) implied that mr hegnar should have initiated a deletion process at that time. on 3 december 2010 staff at radio norge had informed the applicant’s counsel, who had contacted hegnar online on 6 december 2010.
the applicant was born in 1974 and lives in ljubljana. the applicant was a member of the supervisory board of company a from 11 november 2013, with a four-year term. on 12 march 2014, the chairman of the supervisory board of company a resigned: following this the supervisory board had only three members (of the required statutory six members). on 20 march 2014, the ljubljana district court in ljubljana adopted a decision on the initiation of “preventive restructuring” of company a (see paragraph 24 below). on 13 may 2014 a session of the supervisory board of company a was held. allegedly, physical violence occurred between the members of the supervisory board, as some of them did not allow one member to leave the premises, to maintain the required quorum. it would appear that a resolution was passed dismissing the chair of the management board. on 15 may 2014, a claim was brought before the ljubljana district court seeking to establish nullity of the supervisory board’s resolution of 13 may 2014. of their membership, and appoint provisional members. the motion was lodged against the applicant and t.h., who acted as opposing parties (nasprotna udeleženca). referring in particular to the incident that had occurred during a supervisory board meeting on 13 may 2014 (see paragraph 9 above). it requested the court to proceed to a decision without delay, without notifying the opposing parties of the proceedings and without holding a hearing. ’s conduct, had agreed with it, and had fully cooperated with her. the court noted that the decision was effective immediately, and that any appeal would not stay its execution. on 5 june 2014 a journalist asked the applicant to comment on the aforementioned decision. according to the applicant, he received a copy of it only a few days later. on 24 june 2014 the applicant lodged an appeal arguing, inter alia, that he had been unlawfully denied the opportunity to participate in the proceedings. he referred to, inter alia, section 4 of the non-litigious civil procedure act (see paragraph 25 below). he argued that the court’s intervention was not called for and that no grounds had been given for his dismissal. he also emphasised that the protection of his reputation required that he be involved in the proceedings and able to submit evidence. on 5 august 2014 company p informed the court that, on 4 august 2014, company a had held an assembly and appointed two new members to replace the applicant and t.h. it invited the court to reject the appeal, because the applicant could not be considered to have any legal interest in its outcome. the applicant replied to the above pleadings on 25 august 2014. on 21 january 2015 the ljubljana higher court rejected the applicant’s appeal, finding that he could not have had any legal interest in the outcome of the proceedings because in the meantime company a had at its general meeting appointed new members to replace him and t.h. the latter could dismiss supervisory board members any time during their term of office without having to provide any reason for doing so. therefore, in the court’s view, even had the applicant succeeded in the appeal proceedings he could not have obtained reinstatement in his previous position. the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint. relying on, inter alia, articles 6 and 13 of the convention, he complained about being unable to participate in the proceedings. this decision was served on the applicant on 13 november 2015.
the applicant was born in 1938 and lives in galgiai in the vilnius region. in 1991 the applicant applied for restoration of her property rights to land which had been nationalised by the soviet regime. it appears that, even though the decision referred to 2.44 hectares, the applicant was in fact given a plot measuring 2.2859 hectares. on 22 may 2007 the applicant sold the plot of 2.2859 hectares to company s. for 2,500,000 lithuanian litai (ltl  approximately 724,000 euros (eur)). on 1 december 2008 the prosecutor of the vilnius region (hereinafter “the prosecutor”) lodged a claim with the vilnius regional court, seeking to have the applicant’s property rights to 0.38 hectares of the land given to her annulled. since that forest was situated in a city, it was considered a forest of national importance and could therefore only be owned by the state (see beinarovič and others v. lithuania, nos. 70520/10 and 2 others, §§ 86-89, 12 june 2018). the applicant, the vca and company s. disputed the prosecutor’s claim. however, on 14 april 2009 the vilnius regional court allowed the claim. accordingly, the agreements between the applicant, company s. and company v. were null and void ab initio. in accordance with the civil code, company s. was ordered to return the plot of land to the state, and the applicant was ordered to return ltl 2,500,000 (approximately eur 724,000) to company s. (see beinarovič and others, cited above, § 94). the court allowed the request for interim measures. on 24 april 2009 four plots of land and two apartments owned by the applicant were seized. however, on 8 june 2010 the court of appeal dismissed the appeals and upheld the first‑instance court’s decision in its entirety. the court stated that, having found that the vca’s decision had to be annulled, it was not necessary to examine the agreements concluded between the applicant, company s. and company v. however, since the first-instance court had examined them (see paragraph 10 above), the court of appeal did so as well and upheld the findings made by the lower court. it considered that companies s. and v. had deliberately concluded a simulated agreement in order to hide their actual intentions. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, in which she argued that as her land was located in a rural area and the forest on that land was not a forest of national importance, there were no grounds to annul her property rights. however, on 24 august 2010 the supreme court refused to accept it for examination on the grounds that it raised no important legal issues. as for the remaining land, the applicant was informed of the forms of restitution provided for by domestic law (see beinarovič and others, cited above, § 92) and was asked to inform the authorities of her preferred form of restitution. on 9 august 2012 the applicant sent a letter to the nls. she stated that a forest of national importance had only occupied 0.38 hectares of the land which had been given to her (see paragraph 8 above) and thus there should have been no obstacles to returning the remaining 2.06 hectares to her in natura. she also stated that she had been informed by the vilnius land management authorities that two plots of 0.08 and 0.10 hectares would be allocated to her in galgiai (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). it is unclear if the applicant received any response to that letter. the decision stated that the rights to the remaining 0.3959 hectares would be restored later. on an unspecified date the applicant asked the nls to allocate to her the 0.18 hectares of land in galgiai (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above) but the nls refused. the applicant lodged a complaint with a court but on 10 february 2015 the vilnius regional administrative court dismissed it. the court stated that there were several candidates waiting to have their property rights restored in that area and that the applicant could not claim to have priority over them. on 30 june 2017 the nls adopted a decision to restore the applicant’s property rights by giving her 0.3159 hectares of land for the construction of an individual home. in october 2011 the applicant signed an agreement with company s. by which she undertook, in lieu of the monetary payment of ltl 2,500,000 (see paragraph 11 above), to transfer to the company any land which would be given to her during the subsequent restitution process. the government did not comment on that point.
the applicants were born in 1948 and 1963 and live in istanbul and ankara respectively. by a decision dated 21 december 1999 (no. 32.85% by companies belonging to the yaşar group, 2.08% by foundations belonging to the yaşar group, and 0.12% by the yaşar family. lastly, the remaining 16.47% of capital was held by the public, including the applicants. on 21 december 1999 yaşarbank’s shares, which were open to the public, sold on the istanbul stock exchange at a price of 1,950 former turkish liras (trl) each. on 26 january and 18 february 2001 respectively the banking regulation and supervision agency (bankalar düzenleme ve denetleme kurumu - hereinafter “the agency”) decided that yaşarbank would be consolidated under sümerbank and that the former’s banking licence would be revoked. they argued, inter alia, that the conditions set forth by section 14(3) of law no. in that connection, they argued that following its amendment by law no. 4491, section 14(3) provided for more detailed measures which would be implemented gradually. however, the bank had not been invited to take those measures and the authorities had failed to take account of the recovery plan it had submitted which, according to them, could have strengthened the bank’s financial situation had it been implemented. lastly, they raised a plea of unconstitutionality. on 27 february 2002, after examining a number of expert reports, the supreme administrative court dismissed the main shareholders’ action for the annulment of yaşarbank’s transfer to the fund. 4389 did not contravene article 35 of the constitution, which guaranteed the right to property. 4389 the administration had discretion to choose the measures to be adopted according to the severity of the financial problems involved and that the measures provided for by the different paragraphs of section 14 need not be implemented in order. nor had the recovery plan prepared by the bank been sufficient to improve its financial situation. on 8 february 2007 the general assembly rejected an application for rectification by the main shareholders. he maintained that he had bought the shares on the stock market, relying on the financial statements of the bank, which had been supervised by the capital markets board (sermaye piyasası kurulu) and approved by independent auditing agencies. he argued accordingly that no fault could be attributed to him for yaşarbank’s transfer to the fund and that he should have received the same protection as that granted to the creditors of the bank. he concluded therefore that the transfer of his shares to the fund, without any compensation in return, had violated his right to property. referring to its judgment of 27 february 2002 regarding the main shareholders’ action for the annulment of the impugned transfer, the court found that the council of ministers’ decision to transfer the bank to the fund had been lawful. it noted that the applicant should be considered a partner of the bank as he had owned shares in it, and that although the aim of commercial activity was to make profit, one could not remove the risk of loss from such activity. the first applicant appealed, stating that the supreme administrative court had violated his right to a fair trial as it had not addressed his main argument, that is, the transfer of his shares as a minority shareholder. on 29 april 2004 the general assembly upheld the judgment. the final decision was served on the applicant on 20 july 2004. he maintained that he reserved the right to request compensation at a later stage. 4491 did not cover the shares of minority shareholders and its application in yaşarbank’s case had been unlawful as it had resulted in the transfer of all of the bank’s shares, including those of minority shareholders such as himself, who had bought their shares on the stock market, relying on information provided by the authorities. the second applicant also raised a plea of unconstitutionality regarding section 14(3) to (5) of law no. on 8 october 2002 the supreme administrative court rejected the second applicant’s request to refer the matter to the constitutional court. in doing so it repeated the reasoning it had provided in the first applicant’s case. on 3 may 2007 the appellate court rejected a rectification application lodged by the applicant.
he is currently serving a prison sentence in the institution for the execution of criminal sanctions (zavod za izvršenje krivičnih sankcija; hereinafter “the iecs”) in spuž. the same day the court extended the detention of five defendants, including the applicant, without specifying for how long, considering that “the reasons for detention still persisted”. on 9 october 2012 the high court, inter alia, found the applicant guilty of attempted extortion, public endangerment and aggravated murder, all through incitement (sve putem podstrekavanja), and sentenced him to thirty years in prison. notably, the defendants at issue had been found guilty of aggravated murder by the first-instance judgment, which had not been quashed. referring to article 175 § 1(4), the court considered that releasing the defendants could seriously breach public order and peace. on 12 september 2014, during the main hearing before the court of appeal, the applicant applied for release, primarily for health-related reasons. on 13 february 2015 the court dismissed his application. he submitted that the order to extend the detention had been issued for all defendants together, and that the court had failed to provide specific reasons for extending his detention. he invoked the principle of proportionality and submitted that whenever possible the courts were obliged to order a less severe measure instead of detention. m, which, at times, he had shared with five other persons at most. m. he had also been allowed out of his room during family visits (thirty minutes per week) and during the visits of his representatives, which were not time-limited. m, of which the main area measured 5.7 sq. as he did not wish to undergo surgery, he was prescribed medication called vedolizumab (“vdz”) instead. as vdz was not available in montenegro, the applicant had four doses bought for him in germany, the cost of which was 17,222.40 euros (eur). on 20 may 2015 the main distributor of vdz informed the pharmaceutical company that vdz was under special monitoring (pod posebnim praćenjem). they were administered in august and september 2015. between 3 august and 20 december 2018 the applicant had three more specialists’ examinations indicating an inflammatory pseudopolyp and that the ulcerative colitis had reactivated after six months of remission. on 13 january 2014 (during an endoscopic examination at the clinical centre), the applicant was told he must undergo an ophthalmological examination on account of his sudden eyesight problems (zbog naglo nastalih smetnji s vidom). he had undergone surgery to his left leg in 2001, had broken a thighbone in 2003, and both legs were “extremely deformed” (izrazito deformisana) owing to shotgun injuries (prostrelne rane) and a car accident, which would appear to have taken place in 2005. on 21 august 2015 the applicant asked the prison authorities to provide him with transportation to the igalo institute the first week of september. the discharge note from the igalo institute stated that he had received treatment for strengthening his muscles with the aim of preparing him for a possible endoprosthesis. the next check-up recommended for 4 may 2016 took place on 8 july 2016. he prescribed treatment and recommended another check-up in a month. the prison doctor later confirmed that there had indeed been no such disinfectant in the iecs for a considerable time and that it could not provide for the applicant’s special diet, which was why his family was allowed to bring him food. the doctors described the applicant’s cell as a “classic prison cell”, where only the applicant was held at the time, although he sometimes had a cell-mate. there was a toilet, apparently not separated from the rest of the room, and a separate tank of water. the conditions in which the applicant was detained were described as unfavourable for recuperation. such course of illness was harmful and threatened to cause serious complications, some of which could undoubtedly be life-threatening. he received penalties ranging from a six-month suspended sentence to three years of imprisonment. between 27 june 2014 and 20 february 2015 the court of appeal held ten hearings.
the applicant was born in 1949 and lives in novi sad. on 1 june 2004 the applicant instituted civil proceedings seeking reimbursement for income she had lost because of a car accident. on 25 february 2008 the novi sad court of first instance delivered a judgment partly in favour of the applicant and ordered the defendant to pay her a certain amount in that respect. on 30 october 2008 the novi sad district court partly quashed the judgment of 25 february 2008 and remitted the case, upholding the remainder of the judgment. on 2 july 2010 the novi sad court of first instance rejected the applicant’s claim in the remitted part. on 30 january 2012 the novi sad court of appeal partly upheld the judgment of 2 july 2010 and partly reversed it granting certain applicant’s claims. on 5 february 2015 the constitutional court rejected the applicant’s complaint about the length of those proceedings, taking into consideration that the civil courts had rendered four judgments at two instances and that the proceedings had been complex.
on 29 may 2007 he arrived to serve a life sentence at correctional colony no. he had unsuccessfully complained about those issues to the prison governor and to the public prosecution office. the government submitted that from may 2007 until october 2008 the applicant had been held in cell no. 9 had been repaired; the ventilation and heating systems had been operating properly; and the food and soap supply had been in compliance with domestic standards. 10, the floor surface had needed to be repaired, and there had been rats everywhere. 10 had been repaired and rodent-control measures had been carried out. on 20 october 2010 the applicant submitted to the court a handwritten attestation, signed by him and his alleged cellmates, in which he stated that “[on] 19 october 2010 at 6 p.m., in cell no. 61, the ceiling plaster began to fall off. [ 6, 7 and 8, which measured 28, 20 and 21 sq. m respectively and had been shared by four prisoners. during the period from 2008 until 2009 the prison cells had undergone major repairs and in 2010 repair works had been conducted in the corridors and utility rooms. 61 during the same period as the applicant. the applicant furthermore contested the objectiveness of the information provided by the prison governor and stated that the government’s submissions did not exclude the possibility that, before the repair works had been completed at the end of 2010, there had been smaller rooms in the facility in which he could have been held (and which following the reconstruction had been merged to create a bigger room). 39 in may 2007 the applicant underwent a medical examination and was found to be healthy. monitoring tests (sputum, urine and blood tests and x-rays) were performed on a number of occasions. on four occasions (on 9 october 2008, 24 april and 22 december 2009 and 14 april 2010) the administration of prison no. on an unspecified date in 2010 permission was given and on 16 may 2010 the applicant was sent to prison no. after the applicant had lodged various complaints about different health issues that he had experienced during his anti tb-treatment (including vertigo, weakness and diarrhoea), he was examined by a general practitioner and a neuropathologist, who diagnosed him with intestinal indigestion and toxic vestibulopathy and prescribed the appropriate treatment (loperamid and laevomycetin for the indigestion problems; piracetam, ascorbic acid and cinnarizine for the vestibuloparthy). a dentist recommended that the applicant undergo a mouth debridement. the applicant was assigned the status of category 5.1 for three years. the relevant record in the applicant’s medical file suggests that the doctors found that the applicant’s state of health was satisfactory following the treatment provided and that they recommended that he stop smoking and undergo an x-ray examination of his chest once a year by way of preventive measures. in his reply to the government’s observations, he furthermore submitted that his treatment in prison no. 61 hospital and in general had been terminated too early. the applicant furthermore suggested that the authorities had withheld some of the complaints that he had addressed to different bodies, as he had received no reply to them. he also stated that letters from him to the court dated 29 may 2008, 14 december 2009 and 14 june 2011 had likewise not been dispatched by the prison authorities and that on several occasions the prison staff had warned him that his letters would not leave the prison if he continued to complain about the conditions of his detention and had threatened him for having lodged an application with the court. in particular, he had sent a letter to b. containing, inter alia, his claim for just satisfaction. he had also on one occasion been denied the possibility of speaking by telephone with his representative before the court. this correspondence was, under domestic law, exempt from monitoring (see paragraph 31 below). 39 postal service, never arrived at the court. some letters were sent by the applicant via other prisoners whose cases were also pending before the court.

(b)  judicial review of the investigators’ decisions 25. on 16 december 2008 the same court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the refusal of 10 june 2008, holding that it was lawful and well-grounded. on 5 february 2009 the ryazan regional court fully endorsed that decision on appeal. in december 2006 and may 2008 respectively the applicant lodged two more complaints with the prosecutor general’s office and the investigative committee against the police officers, investigators and other state officials, requesting that they be prosecuted for unlawful arrest, detention and abuse of power in connection with the events of 13 to 16 may 2006 and his criminal case. the two earlier refusals were overruled by the higher authority within the investigative committee on an unspecified date and 14 may 2008 respectively, and the investigation authorities were ordered to carry out additional inquiries. the investigation authority was ordered to rectify those deficiencies. it appears that the refusal was subsequently overruled by the investigative committee, and an additional inquiry was ordered. on 7 august 2008 the supreme court of russia upheld that judgment on appeal, finding the conclusions of the trial court duly reasoned.
the applicant was born in 1985 and is currently detained in st petersburg. he was suspected of involvement in large-scale drug dealing. he remained in custody pending the investigation and trial. on 6 october 2011 the sovetskiy district court of kazan (“the district court”) received the case file and set the trial date for 19 october 2011. on 19 march 2012 the district court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to nine and a half years’ imprisonment. during the trial, which consisted of sixteen hearings, the applicant was confined in a metal cage in the courtroom. there was no desk inside the cage, only a wooden bench, which made it impossible for him to take notes during the hearings. armed security guards remained beside the cage dock. the applicant’s lawyer could only approach him with the court’s permission. any conversations between them had to take place in the presence of the guards. on 10 august 2012 the supreme court of the tatarstan republic upheld the applicant’s conviction on appeal. the applicant participated in the hearing by videoconference. he was placed behind a floor-to-ceiling metal partition on the premises of the remand prison sizo-3 of the tatarstan republic where he was detained and communicated with the judges via a video link.

the applicant was born in 1976 and is currently serving a prison sentence. on 14 march 2007 criminal proceedings were initiated into the disappearance of a.s. the applicant was suspected of having committed aggravated murder against a.s. the applicant was arrested in ussuriysk at around 9 a.m. on 8 april 2007 by traffic police officers, taken to the ussuriysk town police station and held in a temporary detention cell overnight. next day he was taken to irkutsk by aeroplane. his account of subsequent events is the following. he was placed in a room on the third floor, where seven police officers were waiting. they placed a gas mask over his head and closed off the air flow. he was kicked in the chest, punched in the ears and given electric shocks. later, during his trial, the applicant claimed that the state-appointed lawyer had not been present during his questioning and had only signed the record of his questioning at the end. on an unspecified date (before 6 june 2007) another lawyer started representing the applicant. on 11 april 2007 the sverdlovskiy district court of irkutsk remanded the applicant in custody. on the same day the applicant was placed in a pre-trial detention facility in irkutsk (iz 38/1/2). the certificate referred to a home accident without any further details. 4046 completed on 11 april 2007 by the irkutsk regional forensic medical bureau, he was examined that day. all injuries had been caused approximately two days before the examination and were classified as injuries not occasioning actual bodily harm. according to records from iz 38/1/2, on arrival on 11 april 2007 the applicant was examined and had (i) a contusion to soft tissues in the area of the right elbow joint; (ii) abrasions on both wrist joints; and (iii) abrasions on the right wrist. the investigator noted the applicant’s statements that he had had injuries from handcuffs because “he had put up resistance” and that he had not been subjected to any violence. he concluded that no criminal proceedings should be initiated pursuant to article 24 § 1 (5) of the ccrp since no such complaint had been lodged by the applicant. on 28 april 2010 the irkutsk regional court received the applicant’s appeal dated 16 april 2010 against the refusal to institute criminal proceedings of 12 march 2008. the former two refusals were annulled on unspecified dates. she pointed out the need to interview the applicant, identify the police officers he had resisted during his arrest, interview those police officers, assess police officers’ alleged misconduct under articles 286 § 3 (a) and 302 of the criminal code (abuse of powers with the use of violence and forced extraction of confession respectively), and carry out other activities in order to ensure a full inquiry. in a letter of 12 october 2011 the irkutsk regional prosecutor’s office informed the applicant that on 22 april 2011 the investigative committee for the sverdlovskiy district of irkutsk had refused to open a criminal case in relation to the applicant’s complaint of ill-treatment by the police officers from the sverdlovskiy district police department of irkutsk pursuant to article 24 § 1 (2) of the ccrp, as none of the elements of the crime under article 286 § 3 (a) of the criminal code were present. it relied, in particular, on the applicant’s self-incriminating statements made during his questioning as a suspect. at his trial, the applicant pleaded guilty in part. he alleged that unlawful investigation techniques and violence had been used to force him to confess to the crimes. according to the applicant, he had been questioned all night long, had lost consciousness, and had been ready to sign any papers. on 11 december 2008 the supreme court of russia partly modified this judgment on appeal and sentenced the applicant to eighteen years’ and six months’ imprisonment. on 24 november 2009 a judge of the supreme court of russia rejected the applicant’s request for supervisory review of his case, stating that the decisions of the courts of both instances to dismiss the applicant’s complaint that he had been coerced by violence to give his self‑incriminating statements were well-founded. on 9 june 2012 the irkutsk regional court ordered that the term of the applicant’s imprisonment should run from 8 april 2007, the day when he had actually been arrested.
the first applicant (ms makarova) was born in 1989 and lived in moscow. the second applicant (ms astakhova) was born in 1985 and lives in mytishchi, moscow region. the third applicant (ms fokht‑babushkina) was born in 1994 and lives in moscow. on 14 december 2012 the state duma, the lower house of the federal assembly of russia, adopted at first reading a draft law which, in particular, prohibited the adoption of children of russian nationality by citizens of the united states of america. on 17 december 2012 the official daily newspaper rossiyskaya gazeta announced that the second reading of the draft law was scheduled for 19 december 2012. according to the first applicant, she had read on various online social networks that many people intended to stage solo demonstrations (одиночные пикеты) on 19 december 2012 in front of the state duma to express their opposition to the draft law. the format of solo demonstrations was chosen because there was no longer time to observe the minimum statutory three‑day notification period for other types of (group) events. all of the applicants decided to hold solo demonstrations on 19 december 2012. 57818/09 and 14 others, §§ 206-15, 7 february 2017). according to the first applicant, she was arrested by the police several minutes later and taken to a police van. there were no orders from police officers to stop the demonstration and leave the area. according to the second and third applicants, after their solo demonstrations they left the area, showing their posters to journalists at their request. at that point, they were arrested by the police and taken to the tverskoy district police station. according to the government, at 10 a.m. on 19 december 2012 all of the applicants took part in a group “picket” (пикет) held without prior notification of the authorities. the first applicant had a poster reading “i am looking for an american who will adopt me”, the second and the third applicants had posters reading “orphans are guilty for the death of mr magnitskiy? at 10.30 a.m. they were arrested and taken to the tverskoy district police station for the purpose of compiling an administrative-offence record. at 1.20 p.m. on that day the applicants were released. on 15 january 2013 the justice of the peace of circuit no. 369 of the tverskoy district of moscow found the first applicant guilty under article 20.2 § 2 of the cao and sentenced her to a fine of 20,000 russian roubles (rub; about 495 euros (eur) at the time). the court found it established, on the basis of the administrative-offence record, the police officers’ reports and oral testimony by a police officer who had arrested the applicant that the latter had taken part in a public event (“picket”) which had involved fifty people and had been held without prior notification of the authorities. on 14 february 2013 the tverskoy district court of moscow upheld the judgment on appeal. the applicant did not attend the appeal hearing, even though she had been duly summoned to it. the court relied on the administrative offence records, the police officers’ reports and oral testimony by a police officer who had arrested the applicants. on 21 february and 21 march 2013 the tverskoy district court of moscow upheld the judgments in respect of the third and second applicants respectively. both applicants were absent from the appeal hearings, though the third applicant’s lawyer did participate. in the third applicant’s case the appellate court examined some documents and interviewed a police officer in a detailed manner before affording the defence counsel an opportunity to cross-examine him; the appeal judge then asked a number of follow-up questions. in its appeal decision the appellate court considered that the third applicant’s guilt had been proved by the adverse evidence, such as the administrative-offence record, the escort procedure record and testimonies. on 1 and 5 july 2013 the moscow city court examined supervisory review complaints lodged by the second and third applicants. the court reclassified the charges against the applicants as falling under article 20.2 § 5 of the cao, namely breach of the established procedure for the conduct of public events committed by a participant. their fines were reduced to rub 10,000 (about eur 232 at the time) each.
the applicant was born in 1983 and is detained in rzekuń. the applicant was detained in płock prison from 26 march to 29 august 2009 (five months and four days). the applicant submitted that during his detention in płock prison he had been held in overcrowded cells. 400 and 402 between 26 march and 29 august 2009. the ventilation and the sanitary conditions in these cells were inadequate. the applicant had one shower per week and one hour’s outdoor exercise per day. on 17 january 2011 the applicant brought an action for infringement of his personal rights on account of inadequate conditions in płock prison. he claimed 10,000 polish zlotys (pln) in compensation (approximately eur 2,500). he applied to be exempted from court fees. on 18 february 2011 the court allowed this application. the applicant did not apply for legal aid at this stage of the proceedings. between 21 january and 31 march 2011 the applicant submitted several requests for evidence and asked to attend the court’s hearings. on 11 march 2011 the płock district court informed the applicant that he would not be transported to the hearing, and instructed him about the formal requirements in respect of requests for evidence, among other things that such requests should be lodged with the court in two copies. the applicant was not present at the court hearing on 23 march 2011. on 2 february 2012 he applied for legal aid. on 14 february 2012 the płock district court refused the request, finding that the applicant was able to represent himself. on 28 may 2012 the płock district court dismissed the applicant’s action. lastly, the remainder of the applicant’s allegations about the material conditions in his cells were considered unsubstantiated in the light of the material gathered in the case. sending the appeal by post is equivalent to submitting it to the court.” on 22 june 2012 the applicant lodged an appeal against the first‑instance judgment. on 29 june 2012 the court issued an order and instructed the applicant to submit two additional copies of his appeal. on 17 july 2012 the court rejected the applicant’s appeal. the court pointed out that a copy of a pleading meant a handwritten copy of an original or a photocopy containing exactly the same submissions and arguments. on 2 august 2012 the applicant appealed against the rejection of his earlier appeal. consequently, on 13 september 2012 his interlocutory appeal was rejected. on 20 september 2012 the applicant submitted an interlocutory appeal against the decision of 13 september 2012, arguing as follows:
“i should have been informed in advance that the court would require me to provide copies of pleadings. i am a simple man without legal knowledge and my application for a legal-aid lawyer was dismissed by the court. if i had had a legal-aid lawyer i would have known that the court might require copies of appeals or interlocutory appeals. if the court had sent me the original pleading i could have copied it and sent it back. for the above reasons i ask the court to accept my appeal and interlocutory appeals.”
the applicant was born in 1975 and, as can be seen from the case materials, is currently serving a sentence in a penal institution (see paragraph 20 below). on 24 may 1996 the applicant was convicted of aggravated double murder and other offences. he was sentenced to the death penalty, which was subsequently commuted to twenty years’ imprisonment in 1997 (“the first conviction”). on 29 march 2002 the applicant attempted to escape. he was sentenced to four years and six months’ imprisonment (“the second conviction”). the first-instance court added the applicant’s outstanding sentence for the first conviction to the subsequent sentence, resulting in a total cumulative sentence of thirteen years and six months. it was due to expire on 29 september 2015. on 29 december 2006 the provision of the criminal code regulating the imposition of cumulative sentences was amended. the amended legislation did not explicitly address the question of its retroactive effect (see paragraph 21 below). when doing so, the supreme court did not refer either to the starting date of the sentence or the applicant’s second conviction. on 20 february 2008 the supreme court rectified its decision of 20 april 2007 based on the applicant’s request to that end, stating that the outstanding sentence for the applicant’s first conviction and the sentence for the second conviction were to be cumulative, and that the cumulative sentence of eight years and six months had to start running from 29 march 2002, namely the date of commission of the second offence rather than the date of the imposition of the later sentence, which was 12 april 2006. appellate proceedings concerning the second conviction were still pending when the supreme court adopted the two decisions. that sentence would have expired on 29 september 2015. the case file and the applicant’s appeal on points of law were sent to the supreme court on 21 january 2009. on 3 april 2009, while the applicant’s appeal on points of law was pending before the supreme court, the tbilisi court of appeal adopted, by means of a written procedure and without the parties’ involvement, a decision rectifying an error in its judgment of 3 december 2008 (“the rectified appellate decision”). based on that new starting date, the applicant’s sentence was due to expire on 12 october 2019. as shown by the case files, the decision of 3 april 2009 was served on the applicant on 16 april 2009. the supreme court further reduced the sentence for the applicant’s second conviction to three years. that term was due to expire on 12 april 2013. he noted that it was only by means of the supreme court’s final decision that he had learned about the rectified appellate decision of 3 april 2009. he submitted that the rectified appellate decision had been contrary to the final decision of the supreme court dated 20 february 2008 which had set a different starting date for his cumulative sentence, and would have resulted in a release date of 29 september 2010. he further submitted that the rectification had lacked any legal basis and had gone beyond the scope of article 615 of the ccp, as it had substantially affected the duration of his sentence. on 24 april 2009 the head of the registry of the chamber of criminal cases of the supreme court replied to the applicant, stating that the rectified appellate decision of 3 april 2009 had constituted an integral part of the appellate judgment of 3 december 2008. therefore, the supreme court was not in a position to address the applicant’s complaint. on 11 may 2009, relying on article 553 of the ccp (see paragraph 22 below), the applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal on points of law against the rectified appellate decision. it was further noted that, in its decision of 7 april 2009, the supreme court had accepted the rectification of the inaccuracy by the appellate court regarding the starting date of the sentence and that the rectified appellate decision had therefore been left unchanged. the applicant was released from prison on 27 january 2013 – earlier than the anticipated release date of 12 april 2013 – based on an amnesty act. as the applicant’s submissions before the court show, on 6 february 2017 he was arrested on charges of aggravated fraud and repeated forgery of official documents. on 18 october 2017 the applicant was sentenced, at first instance, to eight years’ imprisonment. this set of proceedings against the applicant is not the subject of the present application.
the applicant was born in 1978 and was at the time of the introduction of the application detained at the safi detention centre. on 10 september 2016 the applicant, a refugee from ivory coast who claimed to have previously obtained asylum in armenia, left russia and arrived in malta by plane. upon arrival he presented his documents (including a national passport) to the immigration authorities. according to the applicant he immediately informed the authorities that he was a refugee from ivory coast and that he had fled the war in his country many years before. he claimed that he had reached malta from armenia, where he had lived as a refugee prior to his arrival in malta. he also promptly confirmed his intention to seek asylum in malta, due to his fear that armenia would return him to ivory coast. the applicant was denied entry since according to the immigration authorities he was not in possession of the required documentation. on the same day he was taken to police headquarters were he was questioned. on the same day, the police (immigration branch) issued a detention order in terms of the immigration act (chapter 217 of the laws of malta) and subsidiary legislation 420.06 “reception of asylum seekers regulations” (hereinafter “the reception regulations” – see relevant domestic law below) on the grounds that the elements on which the applicant’s application for international protection had been based could not be determined in the absence of detention, in particular due to the risk of absconding. he was informed that he had the right to appeal this decision before the immigration appeals board (hereinafter “the board”) within three days. he was informed that he was entitled to free legal assistance. the applicant was accompanied to safi barracks detention centre, where he was detained. on 20 september 2016 the applicant applied for international protection and was formally registered as an asylum‑seeker. he however claims that even if it did occur his legal aid lawyer was not present as required by law. the applicant was present with his legal representatives and was provided with an interpreter. furthermore, the board stressed that since its members were merely part-time employees meeting once a week and lacking administrative support while being responsible for a vast array of immigration related appeals, it was simply unable to meets its legal obligation and determine the lawfulness of his detention on time. during the hearing the applicant’s representative repeatedly requested the malta police force’s representative and the chairperson of the board to specify the grounds on which he was being detained. the applicant’s representative made written and oral submissions to the board. he had not made any attempt to conceal any information and had acted with honesty, openness and transparency towards the authorities. the applicant also claimed that his detention had been neither necessary nor proportionate. on the same day the board dismissed the applicant’s complaints and confirmed the legality of his detention. the board specified that: (i) the elements in question referred to the application for refugee status, which had not yet been determined; (ii) if the applicant left malta he would be unable to provide the information (elements) required by the commissioner for refugees (refcom); (iii) the fact that the applicant had been found in possession of a ticket to go to italy showed that his intention was not to remain in malta; (iv) “with the fact that he was inadmissible in the first place because he had forged a document, there is no reason to believe that appellant will not abscond”. 420.06, as such detention would then no longer be reasonable. he argued that there had been no individual assessment of the applicant’s situation, and that it was not clear what elements were still required. 420.06 could not be interpreted as meaning that detention could be prolonged throughout the entire proceedings. it appears that the immigration police argued that the one fundamental element they expected the applicant to provide was a document confirming the statement that he was recognised as a refugee in armenia. the applicant was released from immigrant detention on 8 november 2016, subject to reporting at the police station daily. by a judgment of 19 january 2017, in accordance with his guilty plea, the applicant was found guilty of using a false passport. although he was liable to imprisonment for a period of six months to two years, the court, in application of section 22 of the probation act (chapter 446 of the laws of malta) conditionally discharged the applicant for three years. the applicant appealed, which appeal reached the secretary of the refugee appeal’s board on 21 march 2017.
the applicant was born in 1973 and lives in wrocław. the applicant was detained in wrocław remand centre during various periods between 1991 and 2014, including from 24 june 2009 to 2 october 2010. he was released from detention on 8 july 2017. the applicant submitted that during his detention in wrocław remand centre he had been held in overcrowded cells in which the space per person had been below the polish statutory minimum standard of 3 sq. according to documents from the domestic proceedings and the government’s submissions, the applicant was held in overcrowded cells between 29 july and 26 august 2009 (a period of approximately one month). on 5 april 2011 the applicant brought a civil claim before the wrocław regional court against the state treasury for infringement of his personal rights and for compensation on account of his detention in overcrowded cells in wrocław remand centre. he claimed 20,000 polish zlotys (pln) in compensation. his case was transferred to the wrocław‑śródmieście district court in wrocław (hereinafter “the court”) and registered under the reference number ix c 295/11. on 6 may 2011 the court exempted the applicant from the court fees and dismissed his application for legal aid. the court held that the applicant was able to formulate his claims in a clear and understandable manner. the applicant did not challenge that decision. in the course of the judicial proceedings the applicant lodged several applications and requests with the court, including a letter of 8 august 2012. the court, by an order of 28 august 2012, instructed the applicant that to comply with formal requirements he should submit an additional copy of that letter. the order further stated:
“at the same time the court informs [you] that all pleadings (pisma) should be submitted in two copies.” on 5 october 2012 the wrocław‑śródmieście district court dismissed the applicant’s civil claim. on 10 october 2012 the applicant lodged with the court a letter entitled “application: refers to an appeal against the judgment of the wrocław‑śródmieście district court of 5 october 2012” which the court treated as an appeal. on an unspecified date the applicant applied for legal aid. on 26 october 2012 the wrocław‑śródmieście district court rejected the applicant’s request on the same grounds as previously (see paragraph 10 above). on 29 october 2012 the applicant was served with the judgment and information about the time and manner of the right to appeal, in the following terms:
“a party who disagrees with the judgment has a right to request the written reasoning of the judgment within seven days of the service of that judgment and later to appeal to the second-instance court via the court that issued the judgment, within two weeks, calculated from the service of the reasoned judgment. if the party does not ask for the reasoned judgment, the appeal is to be submitted directly within 21 days of the service of the judgment. article 369 § 1: the appeal shall be submitted to the court that issued the judgment within two weeks, calculated from the service of the reasoned judgment.” on 12 november 2012 the applicant received the reasoning of the court’s judgment of 5 october 2012. the court underlined that the applicant’s appeal of 10 october 2012 did not comply with the formal requirements. the order was served on 14 february 2013. he added that he had not been aware that he should have submitted his appeal in two copies. on 19 march 2013 the court rejected the applicant’s appeal for failure to submit an exact copy thereof. on 30 march 2013 the applicant appealed against that decision. when ordered, he rectified the formal requirements of his interlocutory appeal by submitting a copy of it and stating the amount of his claim. on 21 june 2013 the wrocław regional court dismissed the applicant’s interlocutory appeal, holding that the applicant, who had started a civil action and knew that he was deprived of his liberty, could justifiably be expected to keep copies of all letters he sent to the court, especially since he had been informed on 28 august 2012 that all letters to the court should be submitted in two copies. additionally, after the judgment had been issued the applicant was informed about the means and procedure of submitting appeals.
on 30 may 2012 the applicant was arrested and detained in connection with a suspicion of making two threats by telephone against certain m.s. on 28 june 2012 the psychiatric expert, e.s., submitted her report, which stated that the applicant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. she found that he was incapable of understanding and controlling his actions and that he posed a danger to others, which warranted his psychiatric internment. produced a supplement to her report, which she prepared with a psychologist. she explained that she had obtained the applicant’s medical record from his general practitioner, v.p., this indictment was confirmed and accepted on 3 october 2012 and the case was sent to trial. meanwhile, on 30 august 2012, the applicant was released from pre‑trial detention because the maximum period had expired (see paragraph 31 below). and several other witnesses, including his neighbours, be heard. he said they could all give evidence as to his mental state. he also argued that he had had previous conflicts with the victims and asked that the police be requested to submit relevant information about those incidents. reiterated the findings and opinion she had previously given. she also argued that the evidence concerning the applicant’s mental state at the moment of the commission of the offence could not be given by his general practitioner or his psychiatrist. according to which he suffered from chronic stress and maladaptation to the environment. this was a behavioural disorder which needed further psychological treatment. at a hearing on 18 december 2012, the zagreb municipal criminal court heard further witnesses for the prosecution. in particular, the trial court held that the general practitioner v.p. at a hearing on 23 january 2013 the parties gave their closing arguments. at the same time, her opinion was contrary to the findings of his psychiatrist v.g. on the same day the zagreb municipal criminal court found that the applicant had committed the offence of making serious threats while lacking mental capacity. ’s report, it decided that he should be placed in a psychiatric hospital for a period of six months. and that they had been produced by a doctor whom the applicant had paid privately. he pointed out that his psychiatrist v.g., who had treated him for six years, had not been consulted in the course of the proceedings. the zagreb municipal criminal court judgment thereby became final. on 27 november 2013 the constitutional court declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. it considered that the applicant was simply repeating his arguments from the proceedings before the lower courts challenging their decisions although those decisions did not disclose any arbitrariness or unfairness. they also stated that he was fully conscious of his acts and could adopt a critical attitude towards his own conduct. the applicant appealed against that decision to a three-judge panel of the zagreb county court, referring, inter alia, to the expert report drafted on 10 august 2013 (see paragraph 26 above). on 7 november 2013 a three-judge panel of the zagreb county court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on the grounds that there had been nothing in his arguments to raise any doubts about the necessity for his committal to the hospital as established by the zagreb municipal criminal court.
the applicant was born in 1951 and is currently detained in sofia prison. on 17 december 2016 the applicant took a flight from kutaisi, georgia, to sofia, bulgaria. when trying to pass through the passport control at sofia airport, he was arrested pursuant to a red notice issued by the national central bureau of interpol for iran on 14 september 2016. the next day, 18 december 2016, the national central bureau of interpol for iran confirmed that the applicant was still being sought and sent to the bulgarian authorities a copy, in persian, of the warrant for his arrest. the same day the bulgarian prosecuting authorities detained the applicant for seventy-two hours. on 21 december 2016 they asked the sofia city court to place him in detention for up to forty days pending receipt of a formal extradition request by the iranian authorities. in his closing statement, the applicant said:
“[s]ending me to iran would be unfair, because they have no laws, they decide as they please, they will ascribe this to me and i will not make it home. they have no laws and judges, but decide as they please. having deliberated immediately after the hearing, the sofia city court allowed the prosecuting authorities’ request. it noted, inter alia, that at that stage it was not yet deciding whether to extradite the applicant but simply whether to keep him in custody in the meantime. the applicant’s court-appointed counsel appealed against that decision. in view of the applicant’s statement, the court discontinued the appeal proceedings. in january 2017 the iranian authorities submitted to the bulgarian authorities an extradition request in respect of the applicant. the request stated that the act allegedly committed by him constituted an offence under article 656 § 4 of the iranian penal code (see paragraphs 38-40 below), and specified that according to the text of that provision the punishment envisaged under it was six months’ to three years’ imprisonment. they also expressed their willingness to honour extradition requests by bulgaria. extradition proceedings against the applicant were opened in the sofia city court on 29 january 2017. he had counsel of his own choice and was given an interpreter into russian, a language that he apparently speaks. the same day the prosecuting authorities presented to the applicant and his counsel the extradition request and the documents enclosed with it (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). the prosecution also asked the court to keep the applicant in detention until the conclusion of the extradition proceedings. the court allowed that request the same day, 29 january 2017. the court heard the extradition case on 6 and 28 february, 23 march and 12 april 2017. the court did so, in the exercise of its powers under section 17(3) of the extradition and european arrest warrant act 2005 (see paragraph 34 below), and in a diplomatic note of 5 april 2017 the iranian authorities said that the applicant had committed the offence at 1.40 p.m. on 23 june 2016. in his closing statement on 12 april 2017 counsel for the applicant argued that the extradition request, even as supplemented later, failed in various ways to comply with the formal requirements. he also pointed out that although bulgaria had extradition agreements with many states, iran was not among them. it found, inter alia, that the extradition request met all formal requirements, and that it was permissible to proceed on the basis of the de facto reciprocity between bulgaria and iran. in particular, iranian law only envisaged imprisonment in respect of the alleged offence. it was not for the extradition court to delve into the merits of the criminal case. counsel for the applicant appealed to the sofia court of appeal. he reiterated that the applicant had already left tehran at the time when the alleged offence had been committed. the appeal hearing took place on 9 may 2017.
the russian federal prison service (“the fsin”) transports prisoners across its network of nearly 300 remand prisons and equivalent facilities, eight prisons for convicted offenders, and more than 800 correctional facilities and penal settlements (колония-поселение). all have five large compartments and, in addition, four (models nos. a large compartment is the same size as a standard russian passenger compartment designed for four people. it is two metres deep and one and a half metres wide. six bunks, 60 centimetres wide by 2 metres long, are placed three on each side. neither mattresses nor bedding is provided. prison vans are used to transport prisoners to and from train stations and also between remand prisons, courts and police wards. they have a van chassis, on which a solid metal body is mounted. the most common brands are gaz-3307 and 3309 vans with many variants featuring a different number of single- and multi-prisoner cells. their measurements are set out in vehicle type approval certificates, which were examined in the domestic proceedings (see paragraph 69 below), appended to the government’s submissions in application no. a central aisle opens onto a guards’ area with cushioned seats for convoy officers and a heating unit. multi-prisoner cells are 1.15 to 1.20 metres deep. mr aleksey gennadyevich tomov was born in 1966 and lives in the village of vylgort in the komi republic. prisoners were allowed to visit the toilet two or three times a day. using the toilet during stops was prohibited. the trips in january lasted three minutes each way, those in february thirty minutes. each time ms kostromina was placed in a single-prisoner cubicle in a gaz prison van, together with another detainee, n., who was also in transit from kineshma to syktyvkar. at about 4 p.m. on 21 february 2011 mr rakov, together with twelve other prisoners, was taken to the nakhodka railway station and placed in a large compartment of a railway carriage. upon arriving at ussuriysk station, the railway carriage was left overnight on a siding with the prisoners locked inside the compartment without access to water or a toilet. no water or toilet access was authorised during the wait. toilet visits had been authorised from 9.10 p.m. to 10.40 p.m. on 21 february and from 10.10 a.m. to 11.00 a.m. on 22 february. in his statement of claim to the sovetskiy district court in vladivostok, mr rakov designated mr shevchenko as his representative. the court informed him that the personal attendance of incarcerated litigants was not provided for by law and invited him to issue a power of attorney for mr shevchenko, which mr rakov did. mr dmitriy lvovich vasilyev was born in 1958 and lives in pechora. at about midnight mr vasilyev was transferred to a railway carriage, coupled to a passenger train bound for yekaterinburg. during the eight-hour journey to yekaterinburg, a two-hour wait in a siding at yekaterinburg station and a two-hour wait for a police escort, mr vasilyev was kept together with between nine and thirteen other people in a large compartment. they were held in a multi-prisoner cell during the two‑hour trip. from 3.30 p.m. to 5 p.m. on 18 december 2015 the three applicants and five other people were placed in a multi-prisoner cell of a kamaz prison van and taken to syktyvkar railway station. from 10 a.m. until 7.30 a.m. the following day, ten prisoners, including the applicants, travelled in a large compartment of a railway carriage from ukhta to vologda. on 27 december 2011 the appeals panel of the supreme court rejected the appeal in a summary fashion.
the first applicant has been or is a guardian (a foster parent) of the second to eighth applicants. at birth r. was diagnosed with several serious health conditions. on 23 november 2001 the trusovskiy district council in astrakhan appointed the first applicant to act as r.’s guardian. the first applicant refused to return the boy. the boy would need a lengthy adaptation period to get used to his natural parents. they complained that she had been obstructing their contact with r. and requested that the court grant them access to the boy, and determine the manner in which they could exercise their contact rights. on 10 june 2009 the regional court upheld the first-instance judgment on appeal. on an unspecified date r.’s parents brought another claim against the first applicant and the childcare authority before the district court. in the ensuing proceedings both parties were represented by lawyers. in the context of those proceedings, two reports were drawn up by psychologists of the childcare authority. the report furthermore stated that, in view of r.’s special condition and the considerable delay in his physical and psychological development, his interaction with the adults was very limited; however, the parents managed to establish tactile and emotional contact with him. overall, in so far as his conditions made it possible to ascertain, the child felt psychologically comfortable and calm in the presence of his parents. the second report dated 4 may 2010 described two contact sessions that had taken place on 29 and 30 april 2010. in the proceedings before the court, the childcare authority expressed a generally favourable opinion regarding r.’s return to his biological parents, but pointed out that, in view of r.’s state of health, his integration into his family should be gradual. they submitted that they had not abandoned their child. the district court further referred to statements of various witnesses. however, in the court’s view, those statements did not show that r.’s parents were unable to take good care of the boy, nor that in view of r.’s physical and psychological condition he should continue living with the first applicant. the court also referred to statements of ms z., a paediatrician, who submitted that she had known and been treating r. since he had been eight months old when he had been given into the first applicant’s care. the child had suffered from a serious congenital illness and had spent considerable time in hospital. the child needed constant appropriate care and supervision rather than mere medical treatment. however, he could not take care of himself. ms z. also added that she had accompanied the first applicant when she had taken r. to austria for medical treatment. they successfully established psychological contact with him. they understood adequately his psychological particularities, emotional state, needs and capabilities. when with his parents, [r.] felt calm and comfortable. they are well-to-do and make an adequate living. they do not have a history of psychiatric diseases or criminal records. the court also pointed out that the childcare authority had admitted that the reunification of r. with his family ultimately served his interest. on 19 april 2011 the sovetskiy district court of astrakhan (“the district court”) dismissed the applicants’ claim. the district court further noted that r.’s parents as well as the childcare authority objected to the applicants’ communication with r. it also observed that it was impossible to find out r.’s opinion on the matter in view of his medical conditions.
the applicants are eight russian nationals whose particulars are listed in the appendix. they are related (three adult siblings: two brothers and a sister; and the wife and three minor children of one brother). since the 1990s mr ali t. has been suspected of participating in, and then leading, illegal armed groups operating in ingushetia and masterminding a number of crimes and terrorist attacks. on 26 november 2004 the nazran district court revoked the pronouncement in view of new information. the criminal investigation into his activities continued until december 2012. according to the evidence, his wife had resided at the said address since 2004, a fact which the relatives must have been aware of. no copies of the documents in question have been provided by the government. the document did not list the third applicant among the residents at that address. on 22 february 2011 the lefortovskiy district court of moscow granted the request, pursuant to articles 165 and 182 of the code of criminal procedure (“ccrp”). therefore, there are sufficient grounds to believe that at the address where a.m.[t.] the second and third applicants were ordered into a minibus, where they were questioned about their brother, mr ali t. other applicants, their neighbours and vehicles were moved a safe distance from the house. at 3.35 p.m. a senior investigator from the federal security service of russia (“the fsb”) drew up a search report. the deactivation had failed and the ied had exploded, causing destruction of the dwelling. the report ran to six pages and was complete with a plan of the premises; photographs were also taken. they had also been forced to sign several documents. during the interrogation of the second and third applicants, the armed men had ordered the inhabitants of the neighbouring houses to move as far away as possible because the servicemen had been planning to blow up the house. later, the applicants had witnessed an explosion. the second ied had not been recorded in the search record because the security forces had found only one explosive device; they had presumed that the first explosion had detonated the second device. on 3 march 2011 the third applicant was questioned by an investigator from nazran police station, and a report was drawn up. she and her relatives had been escorted to a vehicle, where she had been questioned. she complained of the unlawful search, of intimidation during the interrogation, and the theft and destruction of their property. 68799, located in the republic of ingushetia. the third applicant was informed of that decision by letters of 8 and 18 april, and 5 may 2011, indicating a possibility to appeal. a five-page summary of the decision, forwarded to the third applicant on the same day, indicated that the following procedural measures had been taken: on 14 november 2011 a military investigator had questioned the bomb-disposal expert and the fsb investigator who had conducted the search of the premises. no pressure had been put on her or any other members of her family. no one was hurt, due to the security measures taken. ... the decision of 22 november 2011 was communicated to the third applicant on the same day. the applicants never appealed against it. on 27 june 2011 the magas district court held a hearing. at the time of submission of the observations, the criminal investigation was still ongoing, and the documents and witness statements collected within it could not be disclosed, in the interests of justice.
the applicant was born in 1956 and was convicted of attempting to undermine the constitutional order and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. since his imprisonment the applicant has been represented by his lawyer in respect of several applications, including the present application, before the court. on an unspecified date, the applicant’s lawyer sent a package by post to the applicant. the prison administration believed the contents of the package to be suspect and therefore lodged a request on 12 august 2005 with the public prosecutor for a decision to be taken by an enforcement court to determine whether the material sent to the applicant concerned defence-related documents or whether they concerned any objectionable content so as to prevent them from being handed over to the applicant. the court held that the material in question did not relate to the rights of the defence and that therefore they should not be handed over to the applicant pursuant to section 5 of law no. he submitted that he had asked his lawyer to bring those books and magazines in question simply because he had wanted to read them. he submitted that it had been the prison administration which had told his lawyer that they could not be brought in person and had therefore to be sent by post. he further argued that while it was correct that they had not been related to his rights of defence, they were not illegal publications and there had been no basis for the prison administration to withhold them from him simply because they had been sent by post by his lawyer. on 30 september 2005, the edirne assize court dismissed the applicant’s objections on the basis of the case file, holding that the decision of the edirne enforcement court had been in accordance with law and procedure. in the meantime, that is to say on 16 september 2005, the prison administration lodged another request with the public prosecutor in relation to the package sent by the applicant’s lawyer. 5351, which provides for an official to be present during consultations between a prisoner and his or her lawyer, be applied to the applicant. the decision did not specify how long the restriction was to remain in force. on 24 october 2005 the applicant objected to the decision of 23 september 2005 before the edirne assize court. he submitted that the impugned decision did not explain why it was necessary to restrict the privacy of his consultations with his lawyer. he argued in that connection that a provision which provided for such a restriction could only be applied if it had emerged from documents and other evidence that visits by lawyers to a person convicted of organised crime had been serving as a means of communication within the criminal organisation in question. he argued that no such element had been present in his situation and the court had not conducted any examination in that connection. lastly, he maintained that there were no legal provisions prohibiting the exchange of legal books and magazines between a prisoner and his lawyer. the applicant did not request that the examination of his case be carried out by holding a hearing. on 27 october 2005 the edirne assize court dismissed the case on the basis of the case file and without holding a hearing. without responding to the applicant’s arguments, it held that the edirne enforcement court’s decision of 23 september 2005 had been in accordance with the law and procedure. on 29 may 2008 the applicant lodged an application with the edirne enforcement court for the restriction on the conversations between him and his lawyer to be lifted. the court held that the decision of 23 september 2005 had become final and that there was no need for a further examination. it further dismissed the applicant’s application for the restriction to be lifted, holding that the decision of 23 september 2005 had been final. an appeal against that decision by the applicant was dismissed on 24 august 2011. the court dismissed that application on 11 april 2013, holding that there had not been any change in the circumstances of the applicant and the decision relating to the restriction on the consultations with the applicant’s lawyer. an appeal by the applicant against that decision was rejected on 10 june 2013. on 8 december 2015 the court delivered an inadmissibility decision on account of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and held that the applicant had to make use of the new domestic remedy established by law no. 6384 (see altay and others v. turkey (dec.), on 1 november 2016 the compensation commission held that the edirne enforcement court’s decision not to hand over the book and the periodicals sent to the applicant by his lawyer had infringed the applicant’s right to receive information within the meaning of article 10 of the convention. they held in that connection that the impugned decision had constituted an interference which had not been based on relevant and sufficient reasons, notably because the domestic court had not explained in its decision in what respect the books and magazines in question had jeopardised the security of the institution.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in moscow. he is a political activist, opposition leader, anti-corruption campaigner and popular blogger. 46632/13 and 28671/14, § 15, 23 february 2016). 74568/12, §§ 7-65, echr 2016 (extracts)). on 25 april 2012 the investigation committee, on the direct order of mr bastrykin, instituted criminal proceedings for embezzlement against the applicant (see navalnyy and ofitserov, cited above, hereinafter “the kirovles case”). on 5 july 2012 mr bastrykin made a public statement expressing his determination to have the applicant prosecuted. on the same day the investigation committee cancelled his permit to travel to moscow region and ordered him to seek prior authorisation from the investigator for such travel. the applicant also received a warning for travelling to moscow region without proper authorisation from the investigator. on 14 january 2014 the investigation committee rejected a new request from the applicant for permission to travel to moscow region. on 31 january 2014 the applicant complained to the basmannyy district court of moscow under article 125 of the code of criminal procedure about the travel ban. he was accused of a breach of regulations for holding a demonstration and of an alleged failure to obey the lawful orders of the police and was found liable for those administrative offences under articles 20.2 and 19.3 of the code of administrative offences. on 26 february 2014 the investigation committee asked the basmannyy district court to place the applicant under house arrest pending the completion of the criminal investigation. the applicant objected and referred to his complaint of 31 january 2014. he asked that the residence order be maintained or, in the alternative, that he pay bail of 500,000 roubles (rub). on 3 march 2014 the applicant was placed under the supervision of the department for the execution of sentences. on 14 april 2014 the applicant’s criminal case was submitted to the zamoskvoretskiy district court of moscow. the applicant appealed against that decision. the applicant did not appeal against the extension. on 28 april 2014 the zamoskvoretskiy district court remitted the applicant’s case for further investigation, a decision which was upheld by the moscow city court on 18 june 2014. it rejected a request from the applicant to be allowed daily walks. at the same time it specified radio and television as being among the banned means of communication. it refused to allow the applicant to go to work, take walks or receive correspondence. the court ordered that the applicant should remain under house arrest. on that day the court delivered only the introductory and operative parts of the judgment. the applicant appealed against the extension of his house arrest on 31 december 2014. on 5 january 2015 the applicant issued a public statement that he refused to comply with the terms of his house arrest, citing in particular the fact that he had not been served with a written extension order, even though five days had elapsed since the court’s decision. the applicant illustrated his statement with a photograph of his tracking bracelet having been cut open. no one stopped him or sanctioned him when he left his flat to go to his office. on 27 april 2015 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal. on 26 june 2015 the moscow city court refused leave to lodge a cassation appeal.
the applicant was born in 1961 and lives in ljubljana. he and m. have three children, triplets born on 28 october 1996. the centre in its opinion noted that both parents should join individual therapy. they found the contact unpleasant and refused it. dr t. also opined that in order to improve the relationship between the applicant and his children, the parents would benefit from counselling. it also determined that m. was to ensure that the children went to the centre. relying on the opinion of dr t. (see paragraph 16 above), the court held that the children had refused contact with the applicant and that this was not the result of the manipulation of m. but originated in their negative experiences with the contact sessions in the past. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, which the supreme court rejected as inadmissible on 18 february 2010. on 20 november 2008 the applicant and m. were invited to a meeting at the centre to discuss and reach an agreement on how the contact sessions would work and be organised under the centre’s supervision. after one of the children left the session, the caseworker told the other two children that they could leave if they so wished, but that it was their opportunity to listen to what their father had to say. according to the centre’s records, on 24 december 2008 the applicant arrived early to prepare for the third contact session. on 28 april 2009, after conducting an interview with the children, the centre informed the applicant that a contact session scheduled for 29 april 2009 had been cancelled on the basis of section 119 of the marriage and family relations act (see paragraph 45 below) because it would be a serious psychological burden for the children. after every session the centre’s caseworkers talked to the children and conducted a review (evalvacija) of contact with the parents. the applicant also suggested that the school psychologist (whom the children trusted) join the process at the centre. it held in this connection that a parent refusing to attend the therapy would be responsible for the absence of contact between the applicant and his children. the activities of the centre had been aimed at suspending contact instead of actively establishing it with the help of an expert. the children, represented in the proceedings by m., appealed against the decision. on 16 april 2009 the ljubljana higher court allowed the appeal and remitted the case to the first-instance court. dr t. conducted interviews with each child and the parents. their resentment was also the main reason for the difficult implementation of supervised contact. she also noted that m. should obtain some advice on appropriate communication with the children regarding the importance of their contact with their father and communication with the applicant and submitted that if m. refused to attend counselling, this would call into question her motivation to help the children. while the centre’s representative agreed, noting that this would be in the children’s best interests, m. refused to participate in any kind of family therapy. it noted in this connection that m. had not agreed to it and that the children had clearly refused any cooperation with their father during the contact sessions and were seriously distressed. the latter was crucial for deciding that they should not be forced in any further proceedings for the establishment of contact. on 11 january 2012 the ljubljana higher court upheld the kranj district court’s decision (see paragraph 35 above). other evidence, namely the expert’s opinion, the centre’s report and the hearing of m. and the applicant, confirmed that contact was not beneficial to the children, who continued to refuse any contact with the applicant. on 20 may 2009 the inspector to whom the case had been allocated (hereinafter “the inspector”) asked the centre to submit a written report and copies of the applicant’s family files. however, shortly thereafter the inspector had been absent from work for almost a year and had been unable to conclude the audit until 31 august 2011. consequently, the centre could not be held responsible for the absence of contact. on 3 april 2012 the inspectorate issued a final report on the extraordinary inspection, noting that the centre had implemented all the imposed measures properly.
the applicant, mr aleksey alekseyevich malyy, is a ukrainian national who was born in 1972 and is currently serving a sentence of life imprisonment. he was detained for over three months and confessed to having killed his parents. however, eventually he retracted that confession as made under duress. on 18 january 2005, shortly before an identification parade in which the security guard of one of the jewellery stores was to recognise the perpetrators, the applicant changed his mind and submitted that he did not need legal representation. accordingly, he was not assisted by a lawyer during that investigative measure. it appears from the case-file materials that no investigative measures were conducted on that date. on the same day he was transferred to the dnipropetrovsk temporary detention facility (“the dnipropetrovsk itt”). before the beginning of that investigative measure, he had stated that he did not need legal assistance given that he maintained his confession and wanted to show his remorse. later the same day k., too, wrote “a statement of surrender to the police” in respect of the robbery and murder of mr and ms s., in which he confirmed to the same investigator the account of the events given in the applicant’s related confession (see paragraph 20 above). subsequently, in the course of the trial, k. would submit that the investigator had forced him to incriminate the applicant (see paragraphs 31 and 35 below). k. recognised one of them as that worn by the applicant at the time of the murder on 12 october 2004. a brown spot measuring about one square centimetre was discovered on the right sleeve. a copy of the identification report of 12 may 2005 in the case file is illegible. it can only be seen that its text is limited to one brief paragraph. that had concerned, in particular, the identification parade of 12 may 2005, of which the lawyer had not been informed in due time. lastly, the lawyer observed that the trial court had relied on the statements of k. incriminating the applicant even though k. had stated that he had made them under duress. he submitted that he had been coerced into incriminating the applicant. the applicant also alleged that on 28 january 2005 he had been taken to the dnipropetrovsk region criminal investigation department, where the police had ill-treated him with a view to extracting his confession to the aggravated murder of mr and ms s. the applicant provided the following account. according to the applicant, in the morning of 29 january 2005 he told the itt doctor that he had been beaten up and that he was suffering from a headache, but his complaints were disregarded. furthermore, none of them had raised any complaints of ill‑treatment. in sum, their allegations were dismissed as being without basis. her complaint was dismissed as unsubstantiated. there were tight metal screens on the windows preventing access to daylight. for most of the time he was detained in a basement cell measuring 1.9 m by 3.7 m, which he shared with another inmate. the cell lacked basic furniture and items such as a cupboard, a mirror or a rubbish bin. the premises were infested with rats and had never been disinfested. the food was meagre and consisted mostly of bread and wheat-based cereal. in his further correspondence with the court he indicated the reference numbers assigned by the administration to those first two letters. the first letter from the applicant to have reached the court was dated 11 december 2006; it had been sent to the court by his mother on 14 march 2007 (the date on the postage stamp). on 27 july and 23 august 2007 the court requested the applicant to submit a copy of his cassation appeal against the judgment of the dnipropetrovsk court of 19 january 2006.
the applicant was born in 1964 and lives in munich. he and mr w. founded the t.ag, a directory enquiries service. the t.ag received, for a fee, the required subscriber information from dtag. in 2005 the applicant brought an action against dtag, claiming that as a result of the excessive prices paid by the t.ag, he and mr w. had had to reduce their shares in the company before its stock market launch. for that reason, as well as on account of a lower valuation of the company on the day of the launch, he had sustained damage. on 28 may 2013 the regional court dismissed the claim. the applicant appealed against the regional court’s decision. in the reasons for the appeal, he made comments on, inter alia, eu law and the respective interpretation by the cjeu and the federal court of justice. he did not request a referral of a particular question to the cjeu. in the same hearing the applicant called for the proceedings to be suspended and a preliminary ruling from the cjeu to be obtained. on 2 july 2014 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. it also referred to the relevant case-law of the federal court of justice. there is no need to clarify the legal question raised, since there are no doubts concerning the scope and interpretation of those legal provisions. the applicant filed a complaint against the refusal of leave to appeal on points of law. on 18 may 2015 the federal court of justice rejected the applicant’s complaint, stating that it had examined his submissions but had not considered them sufficiently convincing and that a decision by a court of last resort had not required more detailed reasoning. on 25 february 2016 the federal constitutional court declined to consider a constitutional complaint (1 bvr 1410/16) lodged by the applicant, without providing reasons. (2) an appeal on points of law shall be admitted if: 2. further development of the law or the interests in ensuring uniform adjudication require a decision to be issued by the court hearing the appeal on points of law. the decision regarding the complaint is to be served upon the parties. it had relied on established case-law of the federal financial court. in case 1 bvr 1320/14, however, the constitutional court found a violation of the right to a decision by the legally competent court (recht auf den gesetzlichen richter) because the federal court of justice had rejected a complaint against the refusal of leave to appeal on points of law and had not provided any reasoning. interpreting this provision, the cjeu held in the case of s.r.l. v. ministry of health (c‑283/81, judgment of 6 october 1982, ecli:eu:c:1982:335, § 21) that:
“... a court or tribunal against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law is required, where a question of community law is raised before it, to comply with its obligation to bring the matter before the court [of justice], unless it has established that the question raised is irrelevant or that the community provision in question has already been interpreted by the court or that the correct application of community law is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt. thus, uncertainty as to the interpretation of the law applicable, including community law, may give rise to review, at last instance, by the supreme court. if a question arises as to the interpretation or validity of a rule of community law, the supreme court will be under an obligation, pursuant to the third paragraph of article [267], to refer a question to the court of justice for a preliminary ruling either at the stage of the examination of admissibility or at a later stage.” this judgment was referred to in a later judgment of the cjeu (cartesio oktató és szolgáltató bt, c-210/06, 16 december 2008, ecli:eu:c:2008:723), in which it held:
“76. the court has already held that decisions of a national appellate court which can be challenged by the parties before a supreme court are not decisions of ‘a court or tribunal of a member state against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law’ within the meaning of the third paragraph of article 267. as regards the initiation of preliminary ruling proceedings, the cjeu stated in the case of györgy katz v. istván roland sós (c-404/07, 9 october 2008, ecli:eu:c:2008:553):

the applicant was born in 1978 and lives in druskininkai. he was held in other facilities between 21 june and 5 july 2011; 30 august and 6 september 2011; 27 september and 11 october 2011; 25 october and 8 november 2011; 15 and 17 november 2011; and 6 and 18 january 2012. between those breaks, the periods he had to spend in overcrowded cells were fourteen, fifty‑five, twenty and a half, thirteen, six and a half, forty‑eight and ninety‑five and a half days respectively. on 5 january 2011 there was a fire in lukiškės remand prison. the applicant suffered acute poisoning caused by smoke inhalation and fell into a coma for a few hours. after that, he was hospitalised between 7 and 18 january 2012. on 5 january 2012 a prie‑trial investigation was opened regarding destruction of property and serious health impairment caused by negligence. on 9 january 2012 a commission was set up to establish the circumstances surrounding the fire and the actions of the officers of lukiškės remand prison during the fire. on 14 august 2012 the experts received a task to answer two questions: where did the fire start and what was the reason of the fire. on 13 september 2012 an expert report stated that the fire had been caused by an electrical fault, causing short circuits and the electrothermal heating in the utility premises to break down. it also noted that eight persons had been taken to a hospital and 217 persons had been evacuated. they had started shouting for help, the applicant had started choking, and he had not been able to breathe. he and other inmates had wet towels and put them on their faces. he remembered only that a firefighter had opened the doors of the cell and taken him by his hand, but then the applicant had fainted and later woken up in the hospital (see paragraph 13 below). on the same day he asked to be granted victim status. the following investigative actions had been performed: the scene of the accident had been examined; the electrics had been inspected; various reports had been received; several witnesses had been questioned; and medical examinations of the victims had been carried out. the transcripts of the surveillance cameras show that one of the officers smelled smoke at 7.01 a.m. at 7.25 a.m. the officers poured water down the ventilation chamber. he also confirmed that he had fainted when he had been taken to the ground floor. the prison officers had also been given instructions on what actions to take. the medical staff distributed the inmates according to their condition and the ones who had been severely injured had been transferred to the hospital. as regards proper separation between the sanitary facilities and the cell and alleged lack of ventilation, the court found no violation. the applicant had been referred to a psychiatrist later and had received medication. the authorities had not indicated within what period of time the applicant had received medical help and what that help had entailed. the applicant had stated that he had spent approximately ninety minutes in a cell full of smoke. the court held that the fact that the applicant had been taken to hospital in a coma had proven that the authorities had failed to evacuate him on time. however, it had not been proved that the officers had acted in a manner prescribed by the law in order to avoid negative consequences to the applicant’s health. the applicant and the authorities appealed. on 5 august 2013 the supreme administrative court allowed the authorities’ appeal in part. the court further held that the prison staff had been active in their response and thus no unlawful actions by the authorities had taken place. the court thus amended the first-instance decision and awarded the applicant ltl 2,000 (approximately eur 579) in respect of non‑pecuniary damage for overcrowding only.
the applicant, editorial board of grivna newspaper, is a ukrainian single shareholder company which has its registered offices in kherson. in 2006 the newspaper published two articles containing negative statements about mr i., who from 1996 to 2012 was president of the kherson regional court of appeal. the passages which were the subject of the domestic proceedings are underlined and numbered for reference. prior to the parliament’s session, on 5 january 2006 another regional newspaper, vgoru, published an article alerting the readers that the matter of i.’s permanent appointment would be examined by parliament and urging readers to send comments on i.’s candidature to the relevant parliamentary committee. however, the fact that the mps have ‘rejected the advances’ of the president of the kherson court of appeal, mr i. (получил от народных депутатов «гарбуза») [a1] speaks volumes. we will provide our readers with a brief reminder about mr i. based only on our own publications which, by the way, have not been challenged. [ so i. has been ‘duly punished’ at the very dawn of his career. new laws provide for lifetime appointment by a majority vote in parliament. and here our president ‘has made himself famous’ nationwide (‘прославился’ на всю страну). [ a brief discussion followed concerning judge o., from one of the district courts of the kherson region, who had presented her resignation to parliament. the newspaper’s reproduction of the transcript was followed by the following conclusion:
“as you can see, dear readers, representatives of the kherson justice system have ‘distinguished themselves’ twice. he was shown in formal attire, with a neutral facial expression, apparently sitting at a desk. under the photograph the following caption appeared:
“i will recompense them according to their deeds (old testament)[1]
mr i. is shown in the photo” 16. the applicant company challenged the trial judge on the grounds that he had rejected its request to suspend the proceedings. (iv) the defendant had failed to prove the truth of the factual statement a6 or to point to the source of that information. the plaintiff was not contesting that fact. (iii) the court of appeal found unconvincing the applicant company’s argument that it had pursued the legitimate aim of informing the public, as opposed to damaging i.’s reputation as president of the regional court. the letter was addressed to a certain mr b. and contained a detailed response to his complaints against i. the council stated, in particular, that the fact that d. was the father of i.’s daughter-in-law did not mean that i. had abused his position. it held, in particular, that the trial judge’s failure to suspend proceedings pending examination of the reassignment application by the supreme court did not constitute grounds for quashing its judgment. however, the impugned article had not discussed those issues. the court of cassation stated that the fact that that judge had refused to suspend the proceedings and had rejected the challenge against himself (see paragraph 23 above) did not constitute grounds for quashing the lower courts’ decisions. while in other regions pensioners get the money to which they are entitled by law, in our region only several dozen pensioners managed to get their money. after this meeting the officer’s hope of establishing a dialogue with the judge and of clarifying the situation collapsed. he has not been informed about the results of the investigation. [ the claim will be examined by the same judge st. he is asking that damages be paid to [an orphanage]. according to the applicant company, in the course of the trial it produced as proof of the factual grounds for the impugned statements twenty-four articles published in the local newspapers from 1997 to 2006. (i) referring to article 10 of the convention the court stated that the public status of the subjects of publications did not deprive them of the right to protection of their reputation. (iii) the impugned statements were insulting. on 2 november 2006 i. was appointed to the position of judge on a permanent basis and continued to hold the position of president of the kherson regional court of appeal until 2012.
the applicant is a media company with its registered office in ankara. on 5 november 1998 kamoy araştırma siyasi danışmanlık ve yayıncılık a.ş. ( on 5 november 1998 the trademark was registered in the name of the company for a period of ten years. in february and march 1999 kamoy araştırma published a newspaper entitled özlenen gazete vatan. in march 1999 it halted the publication of the newspaper owing to financial reasons. on 22 october 2002, kamoy araştırma brought a case against bağımsız gazetecilik before the istanbul intellectual property court, requesting the suspension of the latter’s use of its registered trademark, which according to it constituted unfair competition. it argued, inter alia, that the other party was using the same name for the same product, namely a newspaper, without having obtained any prior permission, despite the fact that it had the rights to the registered trademark which needed to be protected pursuant to legislative decree no. during the course of the proceedings the trademark was transferred to the applicant company, which subsequently became a party to the proceedings. it noted that while the applicant company had indeed registered the name “vatan”, which was common to both newspapers, bağımsız gazetecilik had the “declaration of intention to publish a periodical” (mevkute beyannamesi – hereinafter “declaration of a periodical”) dated 1974, which allowed it to publish with that name. the report pointed out that the newspaper vatan had been published since 1975 and that the name had become recognisable long before the applicant company had applied for registration. in that connection, the report noted that in view of the last paragraph of article 7 of legislative decree no. 556, which made reference to the recognisability of a trademark, it should be accepted that it was bağımsız gazetecilik that had actually made the name a recognised brand. on 27 january 2004 the istanbul intellectual property court dismissed the applicant company’s claim. the court noted that the newspaper vatan, the rights to which had been transferred to bağımsız gazetecilik in 2002, had been published since 1975. 5000 on the establishment and duties of the turkish patent institute), which had come into force on 6 november 2003 during the course of the proceedings and set forth that those who publish periodicals could not be prevented from doing so on the basis of legislative decree no. the applicant company appealed against the judgment. it argued that the “declaration of a periodical” mentioned in the expert report was simply an official recognition of an application to publish a periodical and did not have any priority over a registered trademark. noting that its rights to the trademark at issue were still valid, it argued that turkish law provided for the absolute protection of a registered trademark. it argued that the provision did not have a legitimate aim and paved the way for everyone to publish newspapers with the same name. on 6 may 2005 the court of cassation upheld the judgment on the basis of the second reasoning relied on by the intellectual property court. it found that despite that provision, since the applicant company had already registered the trademark, it would have priority over an unregistered trademark, albeit a recognisable one. it noted, however, that the case should in any event be dismissed pursuant to section 31(2) of the turkish patent institute act. the applicant company applied for rectification of that judgment, arguing that the retrospective application of section 31(2) of the turkish patent institute act put the other party in a privileged position. in that connection, it maintained that had the intellectual property court ruled on its case within one year of it having been lodged, it would have been able to prevent the unlawful use of its trademark. after having established that a trademark constituted a possession, the constitutional court stated that legislative decree no. 556 was aimed at protecting registered trademarks from unlawful interferences and that the provision at issue made it impossible to exercise that protection as regards unlawful interferences which had already started by its entry into force. on an unspecified date bağımsız gazetecilik objected to the decision of the patent institute. on 8 december 2003 the patent institute imposed a provisional measure on the trademark, restricting its transfer to third parties. that judgment became final by a decision of the court of cassation on 12 june 2006. on 9 november 2006 the applicant company’s trademark registration was removed from the register of the patent institute.
the applicant was born in 1992 and lives in voronezhskaya, krasnodar region. in summer 2014 ms f., the head of the ust-labinskiy district and of the non-governmental organisation “human rights defender”, spoke at a television talk show on the situation in the eastern region of ukraine and relations between russia and ukraine. on 28 july 2015 the applicant published on youtube a video with the title “kolkhoz tv on ukrainian crisis” (колхозное телевидение об украинском кризисе) where he made comments on ms f.’s speech as follows:
“ms f.: nobody in the whole world has ever thought that russia would become such a strong country and ... that russia would reach new horizons...
the applicant (mr r.): nodding ironically, showing the brochure “life of a galley slave”. ms f.: ... would organise worldwide renowned olympic games...
mr r.: nodding ironically, showing brochure “winter olympic games in subtropics”. ms f.: ...there is a war against russia, which has become a first-rate power and everybody is annoyed by this fact...they want us to die of drug and alcohol abuse and poverty etc. mr r.: but it is not true that we die of alcohol, drugs and poverty... poverty? ms f.: ... ukraine is, so to say, our russian belly...
mr r.: i am afraid of asking what the far east is. ms f.: and that’s why we must, certainly, help these people who have found themselves in a horrible situation because kyiv, to be honest, does not need these people. mr r.: but who is ‘the leading leader among gases’? ms f.: so, slavyansk means gas...
mr r.: slavyansk means gas. this proves that slavyansk belongs to us on lawful grounds. ms f.: ... we must not get involved in a war...
mr r.: wait! you have said that a war has been declared on us. how can we not get involved in the war if we have been drawn into the war, as everybody knows, by bulgarians? ms f.: ... we may not interfere [with what is happening in ukraine]. yes, we are sorry, yes, people die there. as has previously been said, what if our people go there and die? ms f.: and if now the economic situation in the country worsens and russian people seek to rebel? we are already under pressure from various religious conventions (конвенций) which have infiltrated the country. even in krasnodar region there are many such protestant, so to say, religious cults, as i call them, which influence people’s minds. mr r.: what, [beep] you are talking about?! i believe that we must not take the bait! mr r.: ... because this breaks with long traditions and principles: to stay in a horsebox and eat all this sh** coming from the television. ms f.: we all, including all human rights defenders, need to work together as a team...
mr r.: a person who claims to be a human rights defender must know what human rights are... now you have an idea of what is happening inside the heads of those who watch television! on 11 january 2016 ms f. brought an action against the applicant, stating that he had offended her and had harmed her reputation. ... ms f., the head of the ust-labinsk district, has sustained damage of a non‑pecuniary nature due to emotional distress caused by the defendant’s defamatory and discrediting statements and allusions to her unethical conduct. on 24 february 2016 the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of 28 january 2016. however this word had been an interjection rather than an offence, and had been bleeped out. the applicant emphasised that the first-instance court had established that ms f. was a public person who should tolerate critics, but had still issued a decision violating freedom of political speech. on 1 august and 1 november 2016 the krasnodar regional court and the supreme court of russia dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeals.
the applicant was born in 1988 and lives in szigetvár-becefa. according to the police record, he waived his right to counsel and immediately admitted to his involvement in the offence in question. as a result, from 12.12 p.m. onwards, he was further questioned, this time as a suspect, and disclosed the identity of his accomplices. at 4 p.m. he was released after having signed a document stating that he had not suffered any injuries while in custody and had no complaints about the questioning. at 4.56 p.m. the applicant was examined by a general practitioner in sellye and was diagnosed with hyperaemia (redness) measuring 8 cm in diameter on his left cheek and a minor wound in his mouth. no fracture was found, but a bruise was noted at rib cage level. on 6 february 2013 the applicant initiated proceedings on account of ill-treatment inflicted by the police in order to extort a confession. he indicated his willingness to undergo a polygraph test in order to prove the veracity of his allegations. on 28 march 2013 the applicant was examined by the pécs investigating prosecutor. he contended that, on the morning of 4 february 2013, he had been questioned by five police officers. when he had denied his involvement in the offence, one of them (wearing gloves) had slapped him on both cheeks several times. another officer had then ordered him to stand up and when he had done so, the officer had kicked him in the chest so that he had fallen back onto the chair. the third officer had slapped him in the face once or twice, and had punched him in the stomach once. the applicant could name two of the officers whom he knew from previous police visits to his village: one of them – who had been in charge of his questioning on 4 february 2013 – had not hit him, while the other one had only “dropped by” but had allegedly taken part in his beating. he gave a description of the two unknown officers who he alleged had beaten him. on 16 october 2013 the prosecutor questioned the police officer who had been in charge of questioning the applicant on 4 february 2013. the police officer firmly denied any kind of ill-treatment and said that, after his release, the applicant had met someone who he had alleged had participated in the crime. the police officer suggested that the applicant’s injuries might well have resulted from that encounter. the accomplice also alleged that he had seen wounds inside the applicant’s mouth. the expert indicated that the sensitiveness of the chest, without any perceivable external symptoms, was a subjective complaint and it could not therefore be considered as an injury for the purposes of criminal law. on 15 november 2013 the prosecutor discontinued the investigation. the applicant lodged a complaint against the prosecutor’s decision, arguing, among other things, that the authorities had failed to organise a confrontation between him and the police officer in charge in order to resolve the discrepancies in their statements, or an identification parade in order for the applicant to identify the police officers involved. moreover, the prosecutor’s decision had not given any reasons for disregarding the statements of the two witnesses (the applicant’s aunt and her son) who had seen the applicant with a bleeding mouth immediately after his release (see paragraph 11 above). on 5 december 2013 the baranya county chief prosecutor’s office rejected the complaint as ill-founded. it stressed that further investigative steps (a confrontation or an identification parade) would have been necessary only if the medical expert had substantiated the applicant’s allegations, which he had not. since the fact of ill-treatment by the police as such was not sufficiently proven, there was no need for further investigation into the identity of the alleged perpetrators. it also noted that the witnesses had not seen the alleged ill-treatment taking place. this final decision was allegedly served on the applicant on 17 december 2013. on 13 december 2013 the investigation against the applicant on account of the alleged timber theft was discontinued for want of sufficient evidence. the decision took account of the fact that the applicant had withdrawn his confession and that his brother had provided him with an alibi.
the applicant company is registered in vilnius. it provides heating, cooling, ventilation and air conditioning equipment in lithuania. during that period the applicant company bought some goods and declared them as air conditioning equipment, comprising of one unit and its parts. in addition, invoices provided by the applicant company had not contained any information on payment for the goods. moreover, the customs office stated that the applicant company and seller company were related because two of the latter’s logistics managers were also employed by the applicant company. as a result, the applicant company was ordered to pay 618,083 euros (eur) in total as customs tax, value added tax, late payment interest and a fine. the applicant company complained about the customs office’s report to the customs department. in june 2014 the latter annulled part of the report and ordered the customs office to carry out an additional investigation. 2454/93 of 2 july 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of the community customs code (hereinafter “regulation no. in december 2013 the customs office carried out an additional investigation. the customs office also refused to approve twenty‑three import declarations provided by the applicant company and calculated the value of the imported goods in accordance with council regulation (eec) no. moreover, the applicant company disagreed with the late payment interest because it had increased due to the protractedness of the investigation of the customs office. in march 2014 the customs department approved the customs office’s report of december 2013 (see paragraph 9 above) and dismissed the applicant company’s complaint. in july 2014 the tax disputes commission held that because the applicant company had provided incomplete data, it had been unable to determine the exact circumstances of the purchase agreement concluded with the seller company. nevertheless, the tax disputes commission decided to exempt the applicant company from paying ltl 27,118.40 (approximately eur 7,854) of late payment interest. the applicant company complained to the vilnius regional administrative court. the mere fact that the applicant company and seller company had been involved in the purchase agreements was not sufficient to conclude that they were business partners. on 22 january 2015 the vilnius regional administrative court rejected the applicant company’s complaint as unfounded. the applicant company appealed against that decision. moreover, the decision of the first‑instance court had lacked reasoning. - (3) if the seller authorises the buyer’s employees to perform certain actions related to the transportation and the customs procedures of the goods, can this be considered a relationship between buyer and seller, within the meaning of article 29 § 1 (d) of the community customs code, and can it be grounds not to apply the transaction value method? can cases of export from other states (for example, malaysia) be assessed and can this data be considered comparative? - (5) is the provision of domestic law that the customs office use data existing in the customs department database when applying the transaction value method of similar and identical goods in accordance with article 31 § 1 of the community customs code, which provides that where the customs value of imported goods cannot be determined under articles 29 or 30, it must be determined on the basis of data available in the community? this was why the question of whether a court had failed to fulfil the obligation to state reasons, deriving from article 6 of the convention, could only be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case. the supreme administrative court relied on the following authorities: hiro balani v. spain, 9 december 1994, § 27, series a no. 303‑b; ruiz torija v. spain, 9 december 1994, § 29, series a no. 37801/97, § 34, 1 july 2003, series a no. it held that the first‑instance decision had been adequately reasoned. also, the mere fact that a party to the proceedings did not agree with the interpretation of the law provided by the first‑instance court did not mean that the substance of the european union law was not clear and that there was a necessity to refer the question to the cjeu (pastebėtina, kad vien faktinė aplinkybė, jog ginčo šalis nesutinka su pirmosios instancijos teismo pateiktu teisės aiškinimu, savaime nereiškia, jog nėra aiškus europos sąjungos teisės turinys, ir, atitinkamai, kad yra pagrindas kreiptis į estt prejudicinio sprendimo). in april 2017 the supreme administrative court dismissed a request lodged by the applicant company to reopen the proceedings.

the applicants are all roma who live in vâlcele. the police officers also wore balaclavas. they dragged him onto the ground, kicked him and shouted abuse. the fourth applicant was not allowed to approach them or take them clothes. on 12 december 2011 a forest ranger informed the araci police that on 7 december 2011 the first applicant had taken home timber which had been illegally cut from the forest. out of a total population of 4,300 inhabitants, 2,902 are of roma ethnicity. as a result of the preventive activity carried out by the [ipj] in araci village, six criminal groups have been identified, made up of members of roma families r., b., c., g., l., and n. [nb: the applicants’ family is not mentioned among them]” 14. they had thirteen cars at their disposal. when two women (the second and fourth applicants) exited the house, the police asked them to call the third applicant, who was wanted for questioning regarding several criminal acts. for safety reasons, they handcuffed him and took him to the same police car where the third applicant was waiting. subsequently, they also underwent a forensic examination. the forensic report delivered on 15 december 2011 states that the second applicant had dried blood on her lips and left cheek, but no bruises or dental pain. the conclusion of the report was that she did not present any traumatic lesions but that a trauma caused by an act of aggression could not be excluded. it stated that he had complained of chest pain and had two bruises on his chest. an x‑ray examination performed on the same day had not revealed any further damage. it was concluded that the trauma could have been caused by being hit with a hard object and that on account of the injuries, the first applicant needed one to two days of medical care. on 21 december 2011 a forensic medical report was drawn up for the fourth applicant. it was concluded that her injuries could have been caused by being hit with a hard object and that she needed one to two days of medical care. the applicants had proposed that they be questioned. on 6 july 2012 the investigators examined the applicants’ front door. they argued mainly that the prosecutor, without justification, had given preference to the statements made by the police to the detriment of those made by the applicants. it mainly considered that the authorities had to provide justification for the injuries sustained by the applicants. it further noted that the second and fourth applicants had not even been arrested. a new investigation was carried out under the supervision of the same prosecutor from the prosecutor’s office attached to the braşov court of appeal. the prosecutor explained, in particular, that because of the problems with the roma community in vâlcele, the police and gendarmes had had to combine forces. likewise, on 15 july 2013 another police officer had had to open fire in self-defence against an individual who had broken the windscreen of a police car during a police intervention triggered by a distress call. the second and fourth applicants had been injured when they had attacked the police officers in order to prevent them from immobilising their family members. additional witnesses who did not belong to the police or gendarmerie had been heard. according to the court of appeal, the explanations offered by the prosecutor as to the cause of injuries were plausible and the police officers had not used excessive force. lastly, the court noted that the investigations had not been influenced by the fact that the applicants were roma.

the applicant was born in 1960 and died in 2012. on 6 august 2003 he was formally arrested on suspicion of the murder. in view of his allegations the next day the investigator requested a forensic medical opinion concerning his injuries. the expert noted that the applicant was alleging that he had been tortured. on 15 august 2003 a district court judge rejected the investigator’s request to remand the applicant in custody and released him, holding that there was no evidence in the file to show that there was a reasonable suspicion against him and noting his allegation that his confession had been coerced. on 16 august 2003 the applicant was released. on 5 february 2004 ms g., ms k. and mr n. made videotaped statements to the investigator to the effect that, in october 2003, the applicant had confessed to them all (on the same occasion) that he had committed the murder. on an unspecified date in 2004 the investigation into the murder was suspended because the perpetrator could not be identified. on 8 february 2007 she repeated her statement to mr s., an investigator of the nemyriv district prosecutor’s office. on 20 february 2007, based in part on o.’s new evidence, the applicant was again arrested on suspicion of the murder. the applicant stood trial for murder before the vinnytsya regional court of appeal, sitting as the trial court. o. was examined and cross-examined by the defence in court on 10 october 2007. she confirmed her testimony incriminating the applicant. at a hearing on 12 november 2007 the trial court examined a letter dated 11 october 2007 which o. had sent to the trial court. she also asked to be examined again in court. the investigation was conducted by the nemyriv district prosecutor. o., who was still in prison at the time, was questioned. on 6 december 2007 the prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings against s. for lack of constituent elements of a crime in his actions. on 11 january 2008 the trial court received another letter from o., in which she retracted her previous letter. the defence again asked that she be called. the trial court refused to recall her as a witness. on 25 february 2008 the trial court convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to thirteen years’ imprisonment. g. and k. had also reiterated their statements in confrontations with the applicant. as to o.’s evidence, the trial court stated that she had reiterated her pre-trial statement in the course of the trial in the applicant’s presence and that there had been no reason to distrust that testimony. certain details she had provided coincided with those provided by i. and discovered in the course of a crime scene investigation. he argued primarily that the trial court had erred in its assessment of the evidence. the judges argued, in particular: (i) that there was medical evidence in the file which indicated that the applicant had been seriously ill-treated in 2003, in particular by being hung by his elbows, (ii) that the investigation into his allegations in this regard had been superficial, and (iii) that the trial court had failed to comment on this. in the application, lodged by his initial representative on his behalf on 9 january 2009, the applicant described, in the “statement of the facts” section of the form, the ill-treatment he had allegedly suffered in august 2003 (see paragraph 11 above). in the “statement of alleged violation(s) of the convention and/or protocols and relevant arguments” part of the form he complained under article 6 § 2 that his right to be presumed innocent had been breached in that the domestic authorities had relied on evidence obtained unlawfully and under article 6 § 3 (d) that the domestic courts had failed to re-examine o. after she had retracted her initial testimony. on 1 april 2013 mr levytskyy wrote to the court on behalf of the applicant’s mother concerning the applicant’s death and expressed the mother’s wish to pursue the application in his stead.
the applicant was born in 1950 and lives in sofia. a popular figure of bulgarian politics, has for many years been the leader of a trade union. the names of a number of persons were listed after that, including the “pseudo trade unionist” k.t. the list ended with a reference to a footnote which quoted a 2002 article by another author published in a news magazine. brought a tort action against the applicant, stating that the allegations contained in the book, namely that he was a freemason, a communist connected with the former secret services and a “pseudo trade unionist”, were untrue and defamatory. he stated that he was a fervent christian, which meant that he could not be a freemason, as the church had condemned freemasonry, that he had never been a member of the bulgarian communist party or the youth communist organisation, and that he had not been connected with the communist secret services, but had, on the contrary, all his life fought for human rights and democracy. had himself stated in a newspaper interview that he was a member of the maltese order. had been connected with the communist secret services, the applicant intended to prove this through witness testimony. had himself bragged about being related to leading figures of the communist regime. had not shown that he had indeed suffered non-pecuniary damage as a result. the applicant was legally represented throughout the proceedings that ensued. it analysed the allegations made by him and concluded that they had been untrue. as a freemason, this had been refuted by the fact that k.t. felt offended by the applicant’s allegations, that sufficed. had in addition aggravated his health problems, leading to his hospitalisation. was a public figure justified a higher award of damages such as the one made by the city court. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. in a final decision of 17 august 2010 the supreme court of cassation refused to accept the appeal for examination. instituted subsequently enforcement proceedings. abandoned his attempts to obtain payment, with the sum seized from the applicant amounting to merely bgn 4.55 (eur 2.32). after the communication of the present application, on 23 may 2018 the government submitted their observations, which were forwarded to the applicant. on 30 june 2018 the applicant published a comment on these observations on his personal blog. stigmatizing, pointing an accusing finger, uttering insults and putting labels are completely different things. “instead of [commenting on the case], the governmental agent discusses many other things. “it is a pity and i have lost much of my time having to deal with so many and such rough and rude lies and perversions. what is sadder is that they come from the government of a country which is a member of the european union. he also wrote:
“you will ask me why i have addressed this court of yours. to walk this road to the end and to drain the bitter cup. and to show convincingly one more time that the world is communist. i do not suppose even for a moment that those bolshevized mass idiots with their washed brains in which they still hear the unfired volleys of the aurora cruiser, and their imbecile heirs, can ever understand this.”
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in vodnjan. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. on 9 july 2010 the applicant was indicted before the pula-pola municipal court (općinski sud u puli-pola) on charges of indecent behaviour. he was tried in summary proceedings (skraćeni postupak). during the proceedings before the first- and the second-instance courts he was represented by a lawyer, m.k. on 11 october 2011 the pula-pola municipal court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment. on 7 november 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal with the pula‑pola county court (županijski sud u puli-pola), challenging the factual and legal grounds for his conviction and sentence. he did not ask that he or his lawyer be invited to the session of the appeal panel. on an unspecified date in 2011, the pula-pola county court, acting as the court of appeal, forwarded the applicant’s appeal and the pula-pola municipal court’s case file to the pula‑pola county state attorney’s office (županijsko državno odvjetništvo u puli-pola) for their examination and opinion. on 7 december 2011 the pula-pola county state attorney’s office returned the case file to pula-pola county court accompanied by a submission which read as follows:
“in the criminal case against slobodan kliba, accused of the criminal offence referred to in article 193 § 2 in conjunction with article 192 § 1 of the criminal code, the defence lodged an appeal against the judgment of the pula municipal court no. k-344/10 of 11 october 2011 complaining about errors of facts, alleging that the criminal code had been violated and challenging the sanction as well as the decision concerning costs and expenses. i consider the appeal unfounded, therefore i propose that it be dismissed as in my opinion the facts in the criminal proceedings in question were duly established. the criminal code was not violated and the sanction inflicted is appropriate, considering the type and seriousness of the criminal offence of which the accused was found guilty. the costs of proceedings were properly estimated and can be borne by the accused, regard being had to his financial status.” the submission in question was not forwarded to the defence. on 20 january 2012 the pula-pola county court held a session which the parties did not attend. on the same day it dismissed the appeal as unfounded and upheld the first-instance judgment. on 13 march 2012 the applicant, represented by lawyer v.d.l., lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) complaining, inter alia, that his right to a fair trial had been violated because the submission of the pula-pola county state attorney’s office had not been communicated to the defence. on 14 january 2016 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as unfounded. it held that the fact that the pula-pola county state attorney’s office submission of 12 july 2013 had not been forwarded to the applicant had not breached his constitutional rights, having regard to the content of the submission, the fact that he had been tried in summary proceedings and that he had not asked that he or his lawyer be invited to the session of the appeal panel. the decision of the constitutional court was served on the applicant’s representative on 2 february 2016.
the applicants were born in 1975 and live in târgu-mureş. they had held those positions since 29 june 2000. 137/2000 on preventing and punishing all forms of discrimination) and of article 14 of the convention and article 1 of protocol no. 12 to the convention, the applicants brought an action in the mureş county court seeking compensation equivalent to the “loyalty bonus” (spor de fidelitate) to which they felt they had been entitled in respect of their salary since december 2004. the action was brought against the applicants’ employer and against the ministry of justice and the ministry of the economy and finance. in a judgment of 14 february 2008 the county court allowed the claim. it found that the relevant law created a difference in treatment between the applicants and the rest of the judicial and non-judicial court staff and that there was no justification for that different treatment. the court ordered that the applicants be paid compensation for the discrimination suffered, representing 5% of their monthly salary for the period running from december 2004 until 31 march 2006 and 15% for the period running from 1 april 2006 until the day the discrimination ended. the judgment was immediately enforceable. on this point, they argued that the anti-discrimination ordinance did not apply to the manner in which social relations were regulated by law; it only concerned the applicability in practice of those laws. it considered firstly that the anti‑discrimination ordinance applied to the applicants’ situation and on this point it dismissed the defendant party’s allegations of a breach of the principles of the separation of powers by the courts. in the court’s view, the protected right at stake was the principle of equality of treatment in the system of remuneration for work. on the merits of the case, the court relied on the laws regulating “confidentiality bonus[es]” (spor de confidenţialitate), noting that the applicants had to respect the confidentiality of the information to which they had access and for this reason concluded that they should be entitled to a “confidentiality bonus”, like other members of the judiciary and ancillary staff. it therefore awarded the applicants such a “confidentiality bonus”. meanwhile, on 14 october 2008 the authorities paid each of the applicants 30% of the amount they were entitled to receive as compensation for the period from december 2004 to july 2008. on 27 november 2008 the applicants lodged an application for correction of material errors in the final decision adopted by the court of appeal in their case. they asked in particular that the word “confidentiality” be replaced with the word “loyalty” throughout the whole decision. in an interlocutory judgment of 4 december 2008 the same bench – sitting in camera – of the court of appeal allowed the application, without notifying the parties. on 20 november 2008 the ministry of justice lodged an extraordinary appeal against the final decision of 30 may 2008, claiming that the court of appeal had failed to examine the grounds of appeal as stated by the defendants. on 7 january 2009 the applicants, who had received a copy of the defendant party’s submissions, added their observations to the file. they also raised an objection of unconstitutionality of articles 318 and 319 of the ccp, which in their view, by allowing for an open-ended possibility of lodging the extraordinary appeal, contradicted the right of access to court guaranteed by article 21 of the constitution and by article 6 § 1 of the convention, the latter having been incorporated into domestic law by article 20 of the constitution. the court of appeal sitting in a different formation held a hearing on 14 october 2009. the applicants were not present, but requested that the extraordinary appeal be decided in their absence. the court of appeal referred to a completely different legal matter, which had not been brought before it by the parties, and thus dismissed as unfounded the appeal lodged by the ministry of justice without examining the arguments put before it by [the ministry of justice] by mistakenly copying the reasoning from a different decision, in which it had examined the issue of awarding a confidentiality bonus.” 818 and 821 of 2008; see paragraph 24 below). it concluded that there were no longer any legal grounds to support the applicants’ action. the provisions of articles 27 § 1 as well as those of article 1 and 2 of the [anti‑discrimination ordinance] were declared unconstitutional by decision no. 821 of 3 july 2008, as well as by decision no. this means that the provisions of article 27 § 1 of the [anti-discrimination ordinance] can no longer be applied. therefore, ... the decision lacks legal basis.
the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in uxbridge. the applicant claims to have entered the united kingdom illegally on 18 november 2003. she pleaded guilty to offences of cruelty towards her son and was sentenced to twelve months’ imprisonment with a recommendation that she be deported. on 5 august 2008 the home secretary served her with notice of intention to make a deportation order. the present application is the second one made to this court by the applicant. in her first application the applicant complained about her detention from 8 august 2008 to 28 april 2010. the court did not examine the period of detention after 22 july 2010 in that judgment noting that this was the subject of separate litigation proceedings (see v.m. the present case concerns that later period of her detention from 22 july 2010 to 6 july 2011 (11 months, 14 days). on 25 november 2010 a deportation order was served on the applicant. on 14 january 2011 an immigration judge refused bail after an oral hearing. on 10 february 2011 dr a-d, a clinical psychologist, prepared a psychological report on the instruction of the applicant’s representatives. she concluded that the applicant had given a plausible history of suffering physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her uncle; that she suffered from particularly severe post-traumatic stress disorder; that she was not receiving appropriate treatment for her mental health problems in detention; that release would benefit her mental health; and that her deportation was likely to precipitate further suicide attempts. on 16 february 2011 the representatives submitted this report to the secretary of state. on 7 march 2011 and 17 june 2011 a tribunal judge refused to grant bail to the applicant. v. the united kingdom cited above, §§ 20-35) also wrote a further report indicating he now agreed with dr a-d. the tribunal judge granted bail on 1 july 2011 and the applicant was released on 6 july 2011. brief reference was made to the report of dr a-d. v. the united kingdom, cited above, § 33). in each case the senior officers endorsed the conclusion that the risk of the applicant’s reoffending and absconding outweighed the presumption in favour of release. the applicant initiated judicial review proceedings of the period of her detention from 22 july 2010 to 6 july 2011. the high court refused her permission to bring judicial review proceedings on 3 april 2012. lady justice arden gave the lead opinion:
“conclusion 68. accordingly, i would dismiss this appeal. she could still be held in an acceptable stable mental condition in detention under the existing treatment. in any event, there was a risk of reoffending and absconding. the court of appeal refused the applicant permission to appeal its decision but permission was subsequently granted by the supreme court. lord wilson giving the lead judgment in the supreme court summarised the failings in the applicant’s six detention reviews between 4 march 2011 and 4 july 2011:
“25. ... this conclusion the home secretary now accepts. he went on to comment:
“34... realistically [the applicant] accepts that the proper application of the home secretary’s policy to her case in the light of the report of dr [a-d] would not have led to her immediate release in march 2011. she correctly contends that the report should have led the home secretary to make inquiries, most of which, judging by the contents of the reviews, seem never to have been made ... at least however, the limited period between march and her release on bail on 6 july 2011 makes one thing clear: even on the dubious assumption that proper application of her policy should in due course have led the home secretary to direct [the applicant]’s release, it is unrealistic to consider that the conditions necessary for her release would have been in place prior to 6 july 2011.
the applicant was born in 1945 and lives in yerevan. he was the president of armenia between 1991 and 1998. it appears that the rallies at freedom square, held during the daytime and late into the night, attracted at times tens of thousands of people, while several hundred demonstrators stayed in that area around the clock, having set up a camp. the applicant participated in the rallies in his capacity as opposition leader and presidential candidate, giving speeches two to three times a day on issues of political and public interest and regularly calling on his supporters to continue the mass protests. the applicant alleged that, following those meetings, persecution had begun against many of his supporters. various political and public figures who had expressed their support for his candidacy, members of his election campaign and other supporters were arrested and charged on various grounds. his telephone conversations and those of his supporters were tapped and various party premises searched. on the same date the applicant applied to the constitutional court, contesting the election results and seeking to annul them. at that time he had been asleep in his car parked at the square. please, do not have any contact with them and do not touch them. if they have something to tell us, we are ready to listen. in a matter of minutes the demonstrators were pushed out of freedom square. they tried to save themselves by fleeing from the police officers who chased, beat and kicked them brutally, regardless of their age and gender. in the meantime, the applicant, who was on the platform, was approached by the head of the state protection department (spd) of the national security service, who was also the chief of the armenian president’s bodyguard team, and other spd officers. after further attempts to make the applicant leave the square failed, the head of the spd forced the applicant into a car and took him to his house in yerevan. block posts were set up and all vehicles heading to and from his house were checked and searched. the special forces, after carrying out a search of visitors and their vehicles, reported their identity and the purpose of their visit to an unidentified superior and allowed visitors to go in and out only after receiving instructions from that person. after the assembly was terminated, the applicant, who was still sitting on the bench, was advised by the head of the spd to go home, but he refused. during that time a journalist freely approached the applicant, interviewed him and left. while being taken home, the applicant did not express any wish to go elsewhere. the applicant expressed the wish to leave the house and to join the demonstrators near the french embassy only once, on 1 march. the applicant did not wish to leave the house without state protection. on 1 march 2008 the secretary general of the council of europe issued the following press release:
“i am very concerned about reports of injuries during the security forces’ operation to disperse protesters in yerevan this morning. if these reports are confirmed, all allegations of excessive force should be properly investigated. it is also vital to prevent any further violence. i am also alarmed by the reports that the runner-up in the recent presidential elections, former president [levon ter-petrosyan], has been put under house arrest. on 4 march 2008 the applicant’s representative filed a request at the hearing before the constitutional court, submitting that the applicant was under de facto house arrest and unable to attend, and requesting that the constitutional court take measures to ensure his attendance. however, if the applicant also wished to attend but was unable for whatever reason, the request would be examined and an appropriate decision would be taken. otherwise, his house arrest lasted without interruption until at least 20 march 2008. on 8 march 2008 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s application of 29 february 2008.
the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, and as they appear from the documents submitted by them may be summarised as follows. the applicants and/or their relatives were owners of apartments in yalova. the permits for the building of those apartments were issued on 23 march 1987. on 17 august 1999 an earthquake of a magnitude of 7.4 on the richter scale hit the city of yalova, causing the collapse of the applicants’ apartments (see m. özel and others v. turkey, no. 14350/05 and 2 others, 17 november 2015, and hayati çelebi and others v. turkey, no. 582/05, 9 february 2016, for further details about the earthquake). 818) in force at the material time (“the former code of obligations”) (see paragraph 21 below). the applicants claimed pecuniary damages with interest starting from the date of the earthquake and reserved their right to further compensation. by decisions dated 19 july 2001, the yalova civil court dismissed the claims, without an examination on the merits, and held that they had been introduced out of time. the relevant parts of the court’s decision read as follows:
“(...) as a result of the earthquake of 17 august 1999 the apartment that the claimant bought from the defendants was damaged and collapsed. the representatives of the claimant filed the present lawsuit to claim the value of the damaged apartment. it is a known phenomenon that turkey is located in an earthquake zone. therefore, earthquake-resistant buildings must be built. the public conscience has been hurt because of the earthquake. due to the pain, suffering and losses caused by such an incident it is expected that justice be served. and the judge must be conscious of his responsibility towards society in his or her actions. however, when justice is being served, objective and subjective elements in the laws are taken into account. doing the opposite would be against the law. thus, the judgment of the 2nd criminal chamber of the court of cassation no. it is observed that the building use permit for the building of the claimant’s apartment was obtained on 23 march 1987. the ten-year limitation period for filing a lawsuit has elapsed a long time ago. for the purposes of the economy of the procedure and to the extent that there would be no impact on the result, an on-site survey was not ordered. the unfounded objections of the claimant’s representatives [against this decision] were [thus] inadmissible. in their petition of appeal, they firstly argued that even if the dates of the building use permit were to be taken as the starting period of the ten-year limitation period, because the permit issued for their apartments had been renewed in the 1990s, they had introduced their actions within time. on different dates in 2004 and 2005 (see appended table) the 13th civil chamber of the court of cassation upheld the yalova civil court’s decisions of 19 july 2001. the 13th civil chamber ruled that, having regard to the documents and evidence in the case file, which were relied on by the first-instance court, and in particular to the expiry of the limitation period prescribed by section 125 of the former code of obligations, which started running from the date of the transfer of ownership of the properties in question, the applicants’ grounds for appeal had been unfounded. meanwhile, on 1 july 2004, the 4th civil chamber of the court of cassation, in a similar case lodged by the applicants’ representative on behalf of other claimants, held that the limitation periods for claiming damages started running from the date of the earthquake, since at the time the unlawful act was committed by the defendants, that is, when the construction of the defective buildings was completed, the claimants had not suffered any actual loss. on that basis, it quashed the first-instance court’s judgment which had found, applying section 125 of the former code of obligations, that the lawsuit had been introduced following the expiry of a period of ten years from the issuance of the building use permit (see hayati çelebi and others, cited above, § 37, for the relevant parts of a similar decision by the 4th civil chamber of the court of cassation dated 11 december 2001). they also asked the 13th civil chamber to wait for the outcome of their application to the first presidency of the court of cassation for harmonisation of the case-law. on unspecified dates in 2005 the 13th civil chamber dismissed the applicants’ request for rectification.
the applicant was born in 1976 and lives in syktyvkar. all of them were arrested on the same day. on 21 september 2015 the applicant, together with ms s., notified the syktyvkar town administration of their intention to hold a “picket” (пикетирование) from 5 to 6 p.m. on 25 september 2015 at the crossroads of lenin and kommunisticheskaya streets behind the lenin monument, which fifty people were expected to attend. on the same day the applicant published a copy of his notification of 21 september 2015 on his internet blog. he said that the aim of the “picket” was to let the people express their thoughts about the arrests of members of the komi republic government. any opinions – from approval to criticism of the arrests – were welcome. he hoped that the “picket” would be approved. he asked why mr gaizer had been appointed governor of the komi republic in 2010 if, according to the investigators, he had been a member of a criminal gang since 2006. in his opinion, mr putin was trying to frighten other governors into submission. in any event, appointed governors always served the interests of those who had appointed them. 91-rz of 20 november 2012 [sic] prohibited the holding of public events in stefanovskaya square (see paragraph 34 below). unlike a “picket”, it was not possible to use placards during a “people’s assembly”. 57818/09 and 14 others, § 249, 7 february 2017). in any event, it would not have caused any disturbance or inconvenience. the special designated locations proposed by the town administration would have been unsuitable. after citing article 11 of the convention, the applicable domestic provisions and the constitutional court’s decision of 2 april 2009 (see a summary of the domestic law provisions in lashmankin and others, cited above, §§ 255-59), the court held:
“the complainant’s argument that the event would lose its purpose if held at the locations proposed by [the town administration] is unsubstantiated. in substance the law requires organisers to make reasonable and sufficient efforts to reach a compromise on the basis of a balance of interests in order to enjoy the right to freedom of assembly. in a situation where there is no ban on holding a public event but rather an alternative location is proposed, the organisers may not reject without valid reasons the conditions proposed by the authorities for holding the event. the [town administration’s] decision of 21 september 2015 mentioned those locations, de facto proposing them as an alternative [to the location chosen by the applicant]. 9/3483 of 4 september 2013 amended [its] decree no. the choice of a location for an event and its approval by the municipal authorities does not restrict the participants’ right to freedom of opinion and expression. the law does not guarantee the organiser of a public event an unconditional right to hold a public event at the location which he considers the most relevant to its political and social significance. the locations proposed were an adequate alternative to the chosen location and were in keeping with its purposes. the [district] court therefore correctly rejected the complaint. these arguments are based on an incorrect assessment of the facts of the case and an incorrect interpretation of the applicable legal provisions. on 19 july 2016 a judge of the supreme court of the komi republic refused to refer the applicant’s cassation appeal to the presidium of that court for examination, having found no significant violations of substantive or procedural law which had influenced the outcome of the proceedings. he claimed that he had suffered non-pecuniary damage. on 5 april 2016 the syktyvkar town court dismissed the applicant’s claim. on 7 july 2016 the supreme court of the komi republic upheld that judgment on appeal, finding that it had been lawful, well reasoned and justified. it held, in particular, that calls for participation in public events held in breach of the established procedure were incompatible with public order.
the applicant was born in 1979 and lives in kazan. he called on his supporters to protest on 26 march 2017. in the majority of cases the local authorities refused to allow the assemblies. the applicant challenged that refusal before the vakhitovskiy district court of kazan. she proposed four alternative sites for the town administration to choose from. it proposed another venue for the “picket”. on 22 march 2017 the applicant accepted the venue proposed by the town administration for the “picket”. on 23 march 2017 the applicant published a message on vkontakte, criticising the town administration for its decision not to allow the meeting. she further claimed that the town administration could not refuse to allow the meeting in krylya sovetov park because it was a specially designated location for public events. if another event was scheduled at that location, the town administration had to propose another time for the meeting. she also said that the decision of 16 march 2017 had been challenged before a court and that the proceedings were still pending. she stated that people were entitled to assemble peacefully and that it had therefore been decided to hold a meeting in krylya sovetov park at 2 p.m. on 26 march 2017 to protest against corruption. we demand answers in the streets of kazan! no such proposals had been made, however. according to the government, during the meeting the police used loudspeakers to order the participants to disperse. a police officer had approached her and demanded that she stop the unlawful public event. referring to the vakhitovskiy district court’s decision of 24 march 2017, she had replied that the meeting was lawful. the applicant was arrested on her way home after the meeting at about 4.20 p.m., and taken to a nearby police station. the police immediately drew up a report stating that she had been escorted to the police station so that a report on an administrative offence could be drawn up. an arrest record, drawn up at the same time, stated that she had been arrested “in connection with an administrative offence [sic.] the court noted that the applicant had notified the town administration of her intention to hold a meeting in krylya sovetov park but that the town administration had refused to allow the meeting; it had proposed that she hold a “picket” at another location. 57818/09 and 14 others, § 293, 7 february 2017). the applicant also argued that the public event had not created any risk to people’s lives or health or to the property of persons or legal entities. there had therefore been no lawful grounds to stop the public event. furthermore, the judicial decision finding [the town administration’s] failure to act unlawful did not amount to an unconditional approval of the location and time of the public event and did not exempt the organiser from fulfilling the obligations imposed by [the public events act]. the court noted that the applicant had given oral submissions and had pleaded not guilty. it then found that on 23 march 2017 she had published a message on vkontakte calling for participation in a meeting to be held on 26 march 2017 in krylya sovetov park, despite the fact that the town administration had refused to approve that meeting and had suggested that the applicant should hold a “picket” at another location. she had therefore campaigned for participation in the public event before it had been approved by the competent regional or municipal authorities. on 9 august 2017 the supreme court of the tatarstan republic upheld the judgment of 12 july 2017 on appeal, finding that it had been lawful, well reasoned and justified. the applicant attended the hearing and made oral submissions.
the applicant is registered under hungarian law as a cooperative based in aranyosgadány. the applicant’s aim is to support its members in their agricultural activity, in particular by purchasing expensive machines and lending them to its members free of charge. the members pay a regular “contribution fee” to the cooperative. the applicant considered that the lending of machines constituted the very essence of its economic activities. it therefore deducted the value-added tax paid in respect of the machines from the tax which it was liable to pay. the applicant challenged the decision of the tax authority before the administrative courts. on 17 february 2009 the baranya county court upheld the administrative decision. the supreme court, in review proceedings, upheld that judgment on 26 november 2009. it alleged that the supreme court had violated european union law on account of its failure to apply, of its own motion, article 17 of the sixth council directive 77/388/eec (see paragraph 30 below) in its 2009 judgment and on account of the wrongful qualification of the applicant’s activity for the purposes of the value-added tax deduction. it was the latter that should have been directly applicable in the case before the supreme court. on 31 may 2011 the budapest regional court rejected the applicant’s claim against the supreme court. the regional court was of the view that in that respect the supreme court had duly examined the relevant european union law of its own motion. on 28 august 2012 the budapest court of appeal upheld the first-instance judgment, without requesting a preliminary ruling. arguing that european union law was to be applied proprio motu, even without an explicit reference from the plaintiff, the applicant requested a review of the final judgment by the kúria (the historical appellation by which the supreme court was renamed in 2012, see the first sentence of point 36 of the constitutional court’s decision cited in baka v. hungary [gc], no. the questions thus proposed by the applicant for the purposes of a preliminary ruling read as follows:
“1. or should the domestic court enforce of its own motion the directly applicable provision of european law (in this case, article 17(2)(a) of the sixth directive)? is the infringement sufficiently serious if the supreme court of a member state denies, in administrative proceedings, an individual’s right to tax deduction without analysing the underlying provision of european law directly or referring the case for a preliminary ruling, in circumstances where the reasoning of the refusal to refer the case [to the cjeu] is based on the supreme court’s reliance on a judgment of the [cjeu] adopted on a different subject and where this latter court has not yet adopted a ruling on the issue at hand?” it further held that in the framework of the action in damages, assessment of the consequences of the applicant’s failure, in the first set of proceedings, to make explicit allegations of an infringement of european union law (see question 3 quoted in paragraph 18 above) was the task of the national courts, and that it did not raise any question of interpretation that would fall under the jurisdiction of the cjeu. the applicant complained to the kúria about the above refusal but in vain; on 4 december 2013 it held, in a procedural order (végzés), that no appeal lay against such a decision. therefore, the supreme court could not bear responsibility for the infringement of european union law alleged by the applicant. the judgment of the kúria was served on the applicant on 7 february 2014. [i]n the light of the above, the kúria failed to comply with its obligation to refer [a question to the cjeu for a preliminary ruling] and that in an arbitrary, grossly unprofessional manner ...” 24. it held that the question whether a request for reference to the cjeu should be made or not was to be decided by the judges hearing the case in the ordinary courts, and that the constitutional court lacked jurisdiction to review such decisions. consequently, no request for a preliminary ruling was possible under that law, and the applicant’s request to that effect had to be rejected. (2)  provisions of acts that contain regulations in respect of court proceedings shall be applied to the procedural consequence of a constitutional court decision that quashes a judicial decision. the provisions of the old code of civil procedure (act no. iii of 1952) pertaining to the reference for a preliminary ruling, as in force at the material time, were set out in somorjai, cited above, §§ 28 and 36. everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal previously established by law. everyone shall have the possibility of being advised, defended and represented. ...” in order to determine whether the infringement is sufficiently serious when the infringement at issue stems from such a decision, the competent national court, taking into account the specific nature of the judicial function, must determine whether that infringement is manifest.
the applicant was born in 1948 and lives in san marino. a fiduciary company operating in san marino. in his own name but on behalf of the former. by a contract of 20 march 1990, signed in the context of the above‑mentioned fiduciary mandate (on behalf of b.), company s.m.i. recorded that sum in the statement related to the fiduciary account. to give evidence of the operations carried out in execution of a mandate in order to demonstrate that it had fulfilled its reporting obligation (obbligo di rendiconto). according to the judge, the only evidence that company s.m.i. however, b. had demonstrated that the statement was incomplete and therefore unreliable. had claimed to have used in execution of the fiduciary mandate). on 30 june 2008, b. took the above-mentioned “supplementary oath” as set out by the judge. appealed against the interlocutory judgment of 4 june 2007. had a remaining debt to b. of lit 9,028,398,950 (eur 4,662,778.93), and ordered it to pay him that sum of money together with default interest and currency revaluation. the judge specified that the judgment (against which s.m.i. the investigating judge (commissario della legge inquirente) joined the two investigations. by a decision of 31 july 2015, judge l.f., but also in the archives of the court in milan (where other proceedings were ongoing). and b. had decided, by mutual consent and on purpose, not to record all the operations carried out in execution of the fiduciary mandate. thus, the statement that b. had not authorised any other money withdrawals (except for the ones he had expressly acknowledged) had been false since he had at least authorised company s.m.i. to pay off the debt of lit 9,900,000,000 owed to bank s., in execution of the obligations arising from the contract for the purchase of company a.n. with the proceeds deriving from the sale of the shares of company a.n., therefore, on the basis of the latter value and the applicable rules, the president calculated the amount of court fees as being eur 6,000 and the variable part of the judge’s remuneration (la parte variabile del compenso spettante al giudice) as being eur 23,000 (eur 20,000 – in accordance with the relevant table – increased by 15%, given that the case had been referred to two judges) as well as eur 500 in reimbursement of judicial expenses. although he was regularly notified of the reopening of the proceedings, b. did not respond. was also added to the case file, amongst other things. on 10 june 2015 the applicant filed written submissions as requested by the court. on 30 june 2015 the court, having considered the applicant’s submissions incomplete, heard the applicant again. on 14 july 2015 the applicant submitted further written submissions. in any case, having examined all the evidence, in the court’s view, the declaration of falsity of the first part of the statement made by b. under oath did not necessarily impact upon the quantification of the debt since (i) all the parties to the contract of 20 march 1990 had acted under the instructions of the same mastermind (b.), (ii) company p.a. ( according to the applicant, his “jactitation suit” had aimed at ascertaining the existence of actual damage arising from the falsity of the “supplementary oath” and such damage had arisen from the second part of the “supplementary oath” (the one in which b. had claimed the return of a quantified sum) and not the first part. on 19 october 2015 the president dismissed the application for leave to appeal on the grounds that: (i) most of the applicant’s grounds of appeal concerned the merits of the case (which, under the relevant law, cannot constitute a ground of appeal against judgments of the court for trusts, see paragraph 57 below), (ii) in the first-instance proceedings before the court for trusts, the applicant had not given evidence of any payments made by company s.m.i. 128 of 30 september 2013 (see paragraph 57 below).
the applicant was born in 1934 and lives in vienna. on 23 july 2009 a letter signed by the applicant was sent to the sofia municipality. in that letter the applicant complained of construction works undertaken by his nephew, a.k., which had significantly altered the house which had been owned by his parents and where he had been born. the applicant had become aware of that during his stay in sofia in may 2009. had been the beneficiary under both of them. the applicant indicated an intention to challenge these deeds in court. initiated a private criminal prosecution of the applicant. in his complaint he stated that he had become aware of the applicant’s letter “by chance”, and claimed that the applicant had defamed him, in particular by stating that he had an “illegal notarial deed ... acquired on the basis of a forged notarial deed”. had committed a criminal offence, namely using a forged document. in a decision of the sofia district court of 18 october 2012, the criminal prosecution of the applicant was discontinued as time-barred, and the examination of the case continued only as regards a.k. the domestic court stated expressly in that judgment that it did not have to establish the elements of the criminal offence of defamation. had become the owner of part of the property at issue after his mother had donated to him a share in 1983 and he had purchased another share from a co-owner in 1995. both transactions had been attested in notarial deeds. had been recognised as the owner of part of the property. in 2006 he had obtained a permit to enlarge the existing house. the construction works had been carried out in 2006 and 2007. an additional check had been carried out on 26 november 2009, after one of the co-owners of the property (not the applicant) had complained. that check had showed that part of the construction works undertaken by a.k. did not correspond to the construction permit. had not been ordered to demolish the unlawfully constructed parts. had been sent to the municipality on 13 may 2010. had become nervous and had had unspecified problems with the authorities. ’s professional reputation, since he was working in construction. the applicant had had resort to his constitutional right to petition the authorities, but the exercise of that right did not have to involve causing damage to others. bgn 5,000 (the equivalent of eur 2,557) in non-pecuniary damage, plus default interest. it considered such an award to be just, pointing out that a.k. ’s professional reputation, and that the allegations had been made before a municipal body and not in private correspondence. the applicant has not submitted documents showing that he actually paid the amount awarded to a.k., nor has he claimed to have made any such payment.
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in charlotte, north carolina (the united states of america). the case concerns “non-contentious” proceedings for the return of the child instituted on 13 october 2011 in which the domestic courts refused to order the return of the applicant’s son to the united states after the child’s mother (a croatian national and the applicant’s former wife) had in august 2011 “wrongfully retained” him in croatia within the meaning of the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction (“the hague convention”). specifically, on 15 march 2012 the zagreb municipal civil court (općinski građanski sud u zagrebu), without holding a single hearing, dismissed the applicant’s request for the return of the child. following an appeal by the applicant, on 2 july 2012 the zagreb county court (županijski sud u zagrebu) quashed the municipal court’s decision and remitted the case. in so deciding it, inter alia, instructed the municipal court to hold a hearing. in the fresh proceedings the municipal court obtained an opinion from a forensic expert in psychiatry on whether returning the child to the united states would expose him to psychological harm – that is, to a risk envisaged in article 13 paragraph 1 (b) of the hague convention (see paragraph 27 below with further references). on 21 may 2014 that court, without holding a hearing, again dismissed the applicant’s request for his son to be returned to the united states. this decision was upheld on appeal by the zagreb county court on 22 october 2014. those return proceedings (see paragraphs 6-8 above) were already subject to the examination by the court. in the first adžić case the court in the judgment of 12 march 2015 held that the domestic authorities had failed to act expeditiously in the proceedings in question. the court had accordingly found a violation of the state’s positive obligations under article 8 of the convention (see adžić v. croatia, no. at the time the court adopted its judgment, i.e. 17 february 2015, the proceedings were still pending before the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske) upon a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant. in his constitutional complaint the applicant complained of a violation of his right to fair procedure, in particular of a breach of his right to an oral hearing and a breach of the principle of equality of arms and the adversarial principle. more specifically, the applicant submitted that the ordinary courts had not held a single hearing in the case and that the first‑instance court had not informed him of its decision to obtain an opinion from a forensic expert in psychiatry, thus preventing him from objecting to the choice of expert. he further complained that he had not been involved in the expert’s assessment, even though he had previously expressed his willingness to make himself available for such an assessment. the applicant also complained that the domestic court’s refusal to order the return of his son constituted a violation of his right to respect for family life. by a decision of 28 october 2015 the constitutional court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint. it served its decision on his representative on 4 december 2015. the constitutional court examined only the alleged violation of the applicant’s right to fair procedure, because it considered that the alleged violation of his right to family life had been addressed by the court in the first adžić case (see paragraph 9 above). the other relevant facts of the case are set out in detail in the court’s judgment in the first adžić case (see adžić, cited above, §§ 6-57).
the applicants were born in 1971 and 1976 respectively and are detained in kharp. the applicants were co-defendants in domestic criminal proceedings. he was ordered not to leave his town of residence. he was subsequently detained on an unspecified date. on 29 january 2004 the syktyvkar town court extended his detention until 19 february 2004. on 13 september 2004 the district court scheduled a preliminary hearing in the criminal case and also held that the applicant should remain in detention, pending trial (article 228 of the ccrp). it appears that, in the meantime, in february 2006 the court again returned the case to the prosecutor. apparently, the case was resubmitted to the court in or around august 2006. on 14 june 2007 the regional court upheld the judgment. in addition, this court takes into account the decision of 21 april 2004 in the part concerning the dismissal of the application for release and the decision to maintain detention on remand. on an unspecified date mr mityanin was formally charged with this criminal offence. ...
officially, they are all businessmen, sports benefactors or organisers of various sports events. on 12 january 2008 the investigating unit of the regional department of the fsb initiated criminal proceedings against the gang leaders and active members. lawyers say that this article of the criminal code is rarely used because it is exceedingly difficult to prove the running of a criminal community. in december 2006 the ivanovo [district court] convicted them of robbery. [ according to the applicant, it was stated in the article that he had been an active member of the so-called “loginovskaya gang”, which had lived off income from the extortion and “protection” of businesses, with recourse to violence against, and the destruction of the property of, business people who refused to cooperate. by a judgment of 17 october 2011, the syktyvkar town court of the komi republic dismissed mr mityanin’s claims. on 8 december 2011 the komi regional court upheld the judgment, referring to the fact that the newspaper had acquired the contested information from an official source, had referred to this source in the article, and had merely recounted this information. it appears that this judgment was not appealed against, and thus became final. on 29 january 2004 his detention was extended until 19 february 2004. on an unspecified date, the prosecutor completed the investigation and submitted the case for trial. on 29 april 2004 the ukhtinskiy town court of the komi republic authorised the applicant’s detention pending investigation in relation to this robbery. on 24 june 2004 his detention was extended until 5 august 2004; on 3 august 2004 his detention was extended until 5 october 2004. on 7 september 2004 the case was submitted to the oktyabrskiy district court of the ivanovo region. on 13 september 2004 the district court ordered that the applicant’s detention pending trial be continued. it was resubmitted to the judge on an unspecified date. on 21 december 2006 the applicant was convicted of a number of criminal offences. he was then transferred to a prison in the komi republic. he challenged it under chapter 25 of the code of civil procedure (hereinafter “the ccp” – see paragraph 53 below) and asked to be taken to a court hearing from the detention facility. having listed the relevant provisions of article 5 of the convention, the ccrp and the code of civil procedure as well as the procedural history of the criminal case (see paragraphs 33-34 above), the court concluded that the applicant’s detention during the impugned period had been in compliance with the legislation in force at the time in question; that the head of the remand centre had had no legal basis for releasing the applicant, having information that the criminal case had been pending before a trial court.
the applicant was born in 1947 and lives in vratsa. in 1991, following the adoption of the agricultural land act which provided, inter alia, for the restitution of formerly collectivised land, the applicant applied for the restitution of land previously owned by her father. in a decision of 20 may 1996 the competent body, the oryahovo land commission, held that the heirs of the applicant’s father (the applicant and her sister) were entitled to the restitution of, inter alia, a plot of land of 11,800 square metres enlisted as “forest”. the decision indicated that the heirs of the applicant’s father had established his property title with a notarial deed. it stated additionally that the plot of land was “situated in an area under section 4”. that provision (section 4 of the transitional provisions of the agricultural land act, hereinafter “section 4”) concerns plots of land which were offered by the communist authorities for use of private persons, and stipulates that those persons’ right of use is to be discontinued. under further conditions, those plots are subject to restitution in favour of the pre‑collectivisation owners. such restitution is to be carried out after the elaboration of a detailed cadastral plan of the respective area and, on its basis, a so-called plan of the newly-created plots. during the years after 1996 the applicant kept sending letters to different bodies, seeking the completion of the restitution procedure. she was informed that she had to await the elaboration of the above-mentioned plans. such plans for the territory of the oryahovo municipality were prepared and approved by the relevant authorities in 2010. in 2012, responding to a letter from the applicant, the ministry of agriculture and forests informed her that the completion of the restitution procedure as concerns plots under section 4 was within the competence of the municipality. the applicant contacted the municipality, which informed her in a letter of 23 april 2013 that her plot was not situated within the boundaries of the area concerned by section 4 and not covered by the plan of the newly‑created plots. thus, the municipality was not competent to take any decision to finalise the restitution procedure. it informed the applicant that the plot claimed by her was considered state property and was held and managed by the ministry of agriculture and forests. after the applicant contacted once again the ministry, it informed her, in an undated letter, that she was to address its local branch, the oryahovo agriculture department (former land commission). the applicant wrote to the oryahovo agriculture department, requesting it to finalise the restitution procedure and transfer to her possession of her father’s plot. in a letter dated 21 august 2013 the department, while confirming that the municipality had no competence as concerns this plot, explained that the applicant had had to do one of the following: either have the exact borders of her plot identified in a different procedure, which had already been completed, concerning land which is not covered by section 4; or apply for the restitution of the land under the forests restitution act, for which the relevant time-limits had already expired (see paragraph 22 below). in another letter dated 11 april 2017, replying to a further request by the applicant to finalise the restitution procedure, the oryahovo agriculture department stated that its decision of 20 may 1996, indicating that the applicant’s plot was covered by section 4 and was to be restituted under the procedure concerning such plots, was final, and that the time-limit for seeking its revocation or rectification had expired. in a further undated letter, replying to a fresh complaint by the applicant, the ministry of agriculture and forests instructed her to submit a written request under section 45d of the regulations on the application of the agricultural land act (hereinafter “section 45d”, see paragraph 21 below). on 5 june 2017 the vratsa regional directorate of agriculture (superior body of the oryahovo agriculture department) instructed the applicant to submit to the agriculture department the relevant documents concerning the plot of land. the same was reiterated by the ministry of agriculture and forests on 30 august 2017, after it was once again contacted by the applicant. on 8 september 2017 the oryahovo agriculture department sent a letter to the applicant, listing the documents she needed to submit to enable the completion of the restitution procedure. these were: a written request under section 45d; an inheritance certificate; notarial deeds, court decisions and any other documents establishing the title to property; documents sent to the applicant by the oryahovo municipality concerning the procedure under section 4;

the applicant was born in 1959 and lives in štip. on 21 september 2012 a vacancy notice was published in respect of five posts on the state judicial council (“the sjc”) to be filled by sitting judges elected from among their peers. ethnicity was not among the stated requirements for the posts (see paragraph 20 below). on 28 september 2012 the applicant lodged a request with the ministry of justice for his ethnicity entry in the electoral roll to be changed from that of bulgarian to macedonian. on 15 october 2012 the electoral roll was made available to the štip court of appeal for inspection. since the applicant’s ethnic designation had not been changed, on the same date he lodged a fresh request for it to be rectified (from bulgarian to macedonian), relying on section 17 of the state judicial act (“the act”) (see paragraph 23 below). by a decision of 18 october 2012, the ministry of justice refused the applicant’s request. a change of ethnicity entry [sought exclusively for the attainment of another right] after the announcement for the election of members of the sjc [would put other judges] ... , in a disadvantageous position ...” 10. the applicant lodged an appeal with the administrative court challenging that decision and arguing that the ministry’s decision had not been based on any statutory grounds. in particular there had been no provision preventing him from changing his ethnicity entry in the electoral roll while the election of members to the sjc had been ongoing. the conclusion that his request would have put other judges in a disadvantageous position had been unreasonable and unsubstantiated. on 25 october 2012 the ministry submitted its observations in reply, to which it appended, inter alia, extracts from the electoral rolls of 2006, 2008 and 2010. the applicant’s] request for the rectification post-dated the announcement of the election of [new] members to [the sjc]. he enjoyed rights as [an individual] of bulgarian ethnicity concerning the election of members to [the sjc]. in these three electoral rolls [the applicant was] declared [to be] bulgarian. this means that there has been no violation of his right to declare his own ethnicity.” it was unclear how and by what means those judges would have been put in such a position, or indeed which judges would have been affected. furthermore, he contested as irrelevant the findings that his requests had been lodged after the publication of the announcement. he also reiterated his arguments that declaring his own ethnic identity was his personal right. in that connection it was irrelevant which ethnicity had been ascribed to him in 2006, 2008 and 2010 and what electoral rights he had attempted to attain in the past as a bulgarian. on 2 november 2012 the ministry’s observations in reply were communicated to the applicant. on 5 november 2012 the higher administrative court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. the applicant], as a bulgarian, enjoyed rights related to the election of members to the sjc [given the fact that] he had declared himself in the electoral rolls of [2006, 2008 and 2010] as bulgarian ...
... [the ministry’s] decision is based on the state judicial council act and the general administrative procedure act ...
... [t]he court examined and rejected as ill-founded [the applicant’s] allegations that the impugned decision had restricted his right to assert his own ethnic identity. in the present case, [the applicant] requested a rectification – that is to say the modification of his ethnicity entry in the electoral roll. [ on 5 october 2012 the applicant submitted himself for election as a member of the sjc. on an unspecified date, he submitted a written statement affirming that he was of macedonian ethnicity and that his application for election to the sjc had been made with regard to the general list of judges of the courts within the territorial jurisdiction of the štip court of appeal (see paragraph 21 below). it had decided to do so in the light of the fact that his declared ethnicity (macedonian) had not corresponded with the official records, according to which since 1995 he had been registered as being of bulgarian ethnicity. it also acknowledged the outcome of the “rectification proceedings” described above. the sjc furthermore stated that it was not required under the act to take any decision related to entries in the electoral roll. section 17 of the act specified the procedural rules and the relevant body in respect of their rectification.
the applicant was born in 1969 and lives in romny. in september 2009 criminal proceedings in respect of fraud and bribery were instituted against the applicant. on 12 january 2010 the romny court convicted the applicant of both charges and sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment. by the same decision the court remanded him in custody pending the execution of its judgment. on 23 march 2010, upon an appeal by the applicant, the sumy regional court of appeal (“the regional court”) quashed the judgment of 12 january 2010 and remitted the case for retrial. by the same decision it also ordered his continued pre-trial detention, without providing any reasons or indicating a time-limit for it. on 27 april 2010 the applicant asked the romny court to order his release from custody, subject to an undertaking not to abscond. he noted, in particular, that his conviction having been quashed, an undertaking not to abscond would constitute a sufficient measure for ensuring the proper conduct of proceedings. in that regard he submitted that he had no prior criminal record and that the crimes imputed to him were not serious. in addition, he had a permanent residence and had obtained positive character references. he also needed to support a family, including a child, and was suffering from several chronic illnesses which required regular medical supervision and which might deteriorate if he remained in detention. the applicant also submitted that, having been bound by an undertaking not to abscond throughout the first round of the proceedings, he had never attempted to abscond or to obstruct the investigation and had dutifully complied with all his procedural obligations. on an unknown date in may 2010 the romny court refused the applicant’s request for release, having found that the crimes imputed to him were sufficiently serious as to potentially warrant a prison sentence of three years or more. it also ruled, without providing any details, that there was sufficient evidence that the applicant might obstruct the proceedings if he were to be released. on several further occasions (in particular, on 13 july, 29 september and 7 december 2010) the applicant lodged similar requests for release; the court rejected each such application on the date on which it was lodged, referring to the seriousness of the offences imputed to the applicant and to the lack of any valid reasons justifying his release. on 10 february 2011 the applicant again asked to be released from custody pending the proceedings against him, reiterating his previous arguments and emphasising that it was very difficult while in detention to keep to his special diet and secure the necessary medical supervision for his chronic medical conditions. on 23 february 2011 the romny court allowed that request and released the applicant, subject to an undertaking not to abscond. referring to article 5 of the convention, the court noted that, regard being had to the applicant’s character (in particular, his age, health, family and social status, the absence of a prior criminal record and his positive character references), there was no reason to consider that he would abscond, obstruct the investigation or engage in criminal activity if released pending trial. subsequently, the case was remitted to the prosecutor’s office for further investigation. the charge of bribery was dropped by the prosecutor’s office, and the applicant was committed to stand trial on the charge of fraud alone. on 23 november 2012 the romny court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to a fine. however, it released him from any liability to pay the fine levied for the crime for which he had been tried as the time-limit for implementing that sanction had expired. accordingly, the court also terminated the proceedings as time-barred. the applicant did not appeal against this ruling and it became final.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in yerevan. on 1 august 2002 the government adopted decree no. 1151-n by which it approved as an alienation zone real estate situated within the administrative boundaries of the kentron district of yerevan, containing land to be taken for state needs with a total area of 345,000 square metres. a special body, the “yerevan construction and investment project implementation agency” (hereinafter “the agency”), was set up to manage the implementation of the project. this property was included in the alienation zone of real estate to be taken for state needs. on 7 september 2004 the applicant signed an agreement with the agency by which she gave up her property for 265,020 us dollars (usd). the contract also provided for a financial incentive of usd 78,006 to be paid to the applicant. on 13 january 2006 the anti-corruption department of the prosecutor general’s office instituted criminal proceedings against agency officials for deliberately overestimating the market value of the applicant’s property and overpaying her. the applicant testified as a witness in the course of the investigation of the criminal case. as a result of the investigation of the criminal case it has not been established that the officials of [the agency] have failed to perform properly their official duties or have used their official capacity to the detriment of the interests of their service...” 13. the applicant subsequently demanded that the agency return the amd 75,820,000 paid to its account. on 2 april 2007 she received a reply from the head of the agency, stating that she had transferred the amount in question to the agency’s account without any documentary proof. according to the applicant, she contacted the agency on two occasions thereafter, demanding the return of money transferred to its account, but received no response. on 30 october 2007 the applicant lodged a claim with the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan, seeking to recover the money paid back to the agency, the amount of income tax collected from her, and damages for unlawfully retention of her assets. in its reply the agency claimed that, by paying back the amount in question, the applicant had in fact accepted that she had been overpaid and for that reason the criminal proceedings had been terminated. on 27 may 2008 the applicant withdrew her claim for damages. the decision also stated that the ministry of finance should have been involved in the proceedings since the applicant’s claims could have implications for the state budget. on 4 august 2009 the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan delivered its judgment by which it rejected the applicant’s claims. on 4 may 2010 the civil court of appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal. the relevant part of the judgment read as follows:
“article 1099 § 4 provides that monetary assets and other property given in fulfilment of non-existent obligations are not subject to return as unjust enrichment if the acquirer proves that the person demanding return of the property had knowledge of the absence of an obligation ...
as a result of the examination of the materials of the civil case it has been revealed that the claimant returned the amount in question on the basis of [the agency’s] demand which was not based either on the law or ... on a contract. ... [the applicant] had no financial obligation towards [the agency]. in view of the foregoing, it can be concluded that paragraph 4 of article 1099 of the civil code is fully applicable in the present ... civil case. the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. she argued that in the course of the proceedings it had not been substantiated that, when making the payment, she had been aware of the fact that she did not have any obligations towards the agency, since she had been informed to the contrary, namely that she had been overpaid and that she could be held criminally liable if she did not return the money. on 21 july 2010 the court of cassation declared the appeal inadmissible for lack of merit. according to article 31, everyone shall have the right to dispose of, use, manage, and bequeath his property in the way he sees fit. no one can be deprived of his property, save by a court in cases prescribed by law. property can be expropriated for the needs of society and the state only in exceptional cases of paramount public interest, in a procedure prescribed by law, and with prior equivalent compensation. according to article 132 § 1, monetary assets are objects of the civil law. according to article 274, the owner has the right to demand the return of his property from the unlawful possession of another person.
the applicant was born in 1982 and lives in st petersburg. in 1972 the applicant’s grandmother m. was provided with a flat under a social tenancy agreement. her son, the applicant’s uncle, lived in the flat until his death in november 1998. in november 1998 the applicant’s uncle died. in october 2004 the applicant and her grandmother brought court proceedings against g., as she was the legal representative of a., who was a minor. m. acknowledged his paternity in respect of his son a., and registered him as living in our dwelling. a., a minor, never moved into our flat, since his mother, the defendant in the present case, lives in a neighbouring apartment building in a three-room flat, together with her parents. ... moshkin yuriy, the father of a., a minor, died in november 1998. the charges for the flat increase every year. we, the claimants, have an income which is below the minimum wage. in accordance with article 20 of the civil code, the place of residence of minors under the age of 14 is the place of residence of their legal representatives – their parents. a., born in 1995, has acquired a right to the living premises where his mother [g.] lives...” 11. later, they submitted additional claims, seeking to recover from g. the amounts they had paid for communal charges. in particular, they submitted that g. had started paying charges in april 2005, after they had brought court proceedings against her. following her death, the applicant amended her claims. the applicant submitted the following arguments in support of her claims. (a)  she had been living in the flat with her grandmother since 1984 and since 1998 had been registered there as m.’s granddaughter. they had lived as a family in a shared household, and she had taken care of her grandmother. on several occasions the authorities had acknowledged that she and her grandmother were a low-income family, and had awarded them a housing allowance. he had always lived with g. in the three-room flat which she owned. this time, g. submitted that the applicant had never moved into the flat and had never lived there. the district court found, with reference to articles 53 and 54 of the housing code of the russian soviet federative socialist republic (see “relevant domestic law” below) that both the applicant and g.’s son were registered as living in the flat as the grandchildren of m., the previous tenant. the court considered that g. had proved that her son had moved into the flat and had lived there for some time, but had not been able to move back because the applicant had not let him in. the applicant appealed against that judgment. on 19 june 2008 the city court upheld that judgment. the city court held in particular that in taking its decision in the case, the court of first instance had assessed all the evidence in the case, including the witness testimony, and had reasonably indicated that a. had acquired the right to use the disputed living premises because he had been moved into the flat as a tenant’s family member in accordance with the procedure provided for by law. the city court agreed with the conclusion of the court of first instance that the applicant’s claims had to be dismissed because the applicant had not proved that she had moved into the disputed flat and had shared the same household as the tenant, m., her grandmother. her registration as living in that flat had been of an administrative nature and had not provided her with any right to live there. in such circumstances, the judgment of the court of first instance had been lawful and duly reasoned. on 30 december 2009 the flat from which the applicant had been evicted was transferred to a. by way of privatisation.
the applicant was born in 1966 and lives in morozivka. on 20 september 2007 the applicant, who was head of the brusyliv district state administration of zhytomyr region at the time, was arrested on charges of bribery. on 21 september 2007 the investigator applied to the court for the applicant’s pre-trial detention as a preventive measure pending trial. no further details were provided in that regard. on 19 may, 17 june, 26 june, 29 july and 7 august 2008 the courts further extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention, basing their decisions, in addition to the previously mentioned grounds (see paragraph 7 above), on the need for him to familiarise himself with the case file. in the course of reviewing the extension of his detention on 24 september 2007, 8 january, 19 march and 7 august 2008, the applicant raised objections arguing, in particular, that his state of health had been unsatisfactory, that he had a stable family relationship, and that he had not absconded from justice. it appears from the relevant decisions that his arguments were not addressed by the courts. on 3 october 2008 the malyn district court of zhytomyr region (“the trial court”) committed the applicant for trial. the trial court maintained the custodial preventive measure, providing no reasons for that decision and setting no time-limit. the trial court rejected those requests, giving similar reasons to those given at the initial stage (see paragraph 6 above). the court further stated that the applicant had been provided with the necessary medical treatment in detention and that his state of health did not warrant his release. on 16 july 2010 the court found the applicant guilty of bribery and sentenced him to nine years’ imprisonment, confiscated half of his property and banned him from occupying posts in state bodies and local authorities for three years. on 1 december 2010 and 19 may 2011 respectively the zhytomyr regional court of appeal and the higher specialised court for civil and criminal matters upheld that judgment with minor amendments. according to the material in the case file, the applicant has suffered from varicose dilatation (варикозне розширення вен) since 1980. on 18 october 2007 the applicant was placed in the kyiv pre-trial detention centre (“the sizo”). in the course of the criminal proceedings the applicant was transferred between different detention facilities. it was concluded in a forensic examination carried out on 16 january 2008 at the request of the investigator that the applicant had a number of endocrine, heart, venous, neurologic, and digestive conditions. in particular, he was diagnosed with varicose dilatation of the lower limbs and chronic venous insufficiency of the lower limbs with trophic disorders. the forensic experts concluded that the applicant required elective surgery in respect of the varicose dilatation, and outpatient treatment in respect of the other conditions. overall, in the course of his detention the applicant was recommended surgery six times in respect of the varicose dilatation, on 16 january 2008, 5 may 2008, 23 october 2008, 18 march 2009, 22 july 2009 and 18 march 2010. on 8 april 2009 the applicant was recognised as falling into the “third category” (the mildest category) of disability (третя група інвалідності). on 22 april 2009 the sizo informed the applicant’s lawyer that he had been diagnosed with varicose dilatation of the lower limbs, third degree chronic venous insufficiency of the lower left limb, second degree chronic venous insufficiency of the lower right limb, hypothalamic dysfunction, impaired glucose tolerance, first degree diffuse non-toxic goiter (an enlarged thyroid) and a chronic trophic ulcer on the left shin. on 12 october and 19 november 2009 the sizo issued another reply to the applicant’s lawyer, stating that it had been recommended that the applicant undergo surgical treatment in respect of his progressing varicose dilatation. on 18 february 2013 the applicant refused that offer, insisting that he needed highly qualified medical assistance in specialist civilian medical institutions. there is no information in the case file regarding whether the applicant received any medical care after the above-mentioned refusal. on 18 november 2013 the applicant was dispensed from serving the remainder of his sentence pursuant to a decision of the local court of 8 november 2013 altering his imprisonment to correctional labour. on 28 november 2013 the applicant underwent surgery on his lower limbs. according to the available information, from november 2007 to february 2013 the applicant consulted a surgeon thirteen times in respect of the varicose dilatation. outpatient medical treatment was prescribed to him. from 21 march to 5 may and from 23 october to 17 november 2008 he underwent outpatient medical treatment both within the sizo and at a civilian hospital.

the applicant was born in 1970 and is currently detained in alytus correctional facility. the applicant was arrested on 3 june 2012 and transferred to kaunas remand prison on 4 june 2012. on 5 june 2012 he was examined by a doctor (see paragraph 15 below). during that examination, the applicant did not indicate that he needed any special devices. on 26 november 2012 the applicant consulted a doctor and indicated that he had sleep apnoea and he wished to acquire a continuous positive airway pressure (hereinafter “cpap”) device for its treatment. on 15 march 2013 a report was issued by a medical expert, indicating that the use of a cpap device was the most effective way to treat sleep apnoea and that the applicant’s condition was deteriorating because he had not been using a cpap device. it also indicated that there was a risk of complications if the sleep apnoea was not treated properly. between 12 and 17 september 2013 the applicant was hospitalised in the prison hospital. a doctor recommended that he continue using a cpap device following his discharge from the hospital. on 19 september the applicant asked the prison administration to allow him to use a cpap device. on 3 october 2013 the administration of kaunas remand prison responded that under domestic law such a device was not among the items that could be given to detainees by their spouses or close relatives (see paragraph 14 below), but indicated that such an item could be purchased from the prison shop. the applicant then asked the kaunas remand prison administration to allow his relatives to give him the device. on 29 october 2013, this request was also refused, on the grounds that there were no indications in the applicant’s medical history or in the document issued by the prison hospital that the applicant needed the device (see paragraph 16 below). on 20 october 2014 the applicant lodged a complaint before the domestic courts, which he specified on 19 february 2015. he asked the court to award him 86,800 euros (eur) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage suffered in the period between 4 june 2012 and 20 october 2014. the applicant stated that while he had been detained in kaunas remand prison, he had asked the prison administration to allow him to have a cpap device to treat his sleep apnoea, as recommended to him by a doctor in the prison hospital (see paragraph 8 above). the applicant stated that the prison administration had refused to allow him to have such a device, and he had been experiencing serious health issues. on 12 october 2015 the kaunas regional administrative court allowed the applicant’s complaint in part and awarded him eur 1,100 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. the court stated that the prison administration had failed to provide the applicant with the same level of healthcare available to persons who were not detained. it was clear from the case file that the applicant had twice asked the prison administration to allow him to purchase and use a cpap device. the refusal of permission by the kaunas remand prison administration had been unfounded because there had been a recommendation issued by a doctor. the court held that the applicant had a right to compensation in respect of non‑pecuniary damage suffered from 3 october 2013 (when his request was refused by the prison administration – see paragraph 9 below) until 20 october 2014 and thus decided to award the applicant eur 1,100 in this regard. the court also noted that there was no information in the case file to indicate that the applicant had not received appropriate healthcare in kaunas remand prison. it stated that although the recommendation issued by the specialist contained a reference to possible complications, there was no information in the applicant’s case file to show that the inability to use a cpap device had had any negative consequences for his health. the applicant appealed against the decision of the kaunas regional administrative court. on 4 october 2016 the supreme administrative court upheld the first-instance decision in its entirety. on 12 july 2017 the applicant asked the prison department for a transfer to alytus correctional facility from vilnius correctional facility, where he had been transferred on 20 march 2015. the applicant submitted that he had been serving his sentence in premises for disabled persons but that he could be transferred to the standard dormitory-type premises. on 2 august 2017 the applicant’s request was allowed and he was transferred to alytus correctional facility on 21 august 2017 where he was able to continue using his cpap device.
the couple lived together in italy, where o.c.i. gave birth to their children: the second applicant, p.a.r., in 2008, and the third applicant, n.a.r., on 12 june 2015 the family went to romania for the summer holidays. on 25 june 2015 the first applicant informed her husband that she and the children would no longer return to italy. she said that she saw no future for them there. that he was a bad father who mistreated his children. in his view, the mother had unilaterally changed the children’s residence which, he argued, constituted wrongful retention. would beat up the children, bruising their faces and giving them nose bleeds. he would pull them by the ears, slap their faces and hit their bottoms. sometimes he would undress them and beat their bodies with hard objects. the violence had worsened in recent years and the first applicant had become a target as well. she had tried to intervene but to no avail. eventually, the first applicant had decided to find refuge with the children in romania. during their common life in italy, showing episodes similar to those described above. the first applicant further explained that the children had become integrated in their new environment. they participated in after-school activities that they had always wanted to try but had in the past been denied by their father. they feared going back to italy and being again subject to abuse. the county court heard evidence from the parents (hearing of 27 september 2015) and interviewed the children in the presence of a psychologist (on 16 november 2015). it found that there was nothing to oppose the children’s return to italy. it also considered that her decision to leave italy had been made because of marital problems and because of her own dissatisfaction. confirmed this in his statement before the court. in fact, the court reasoned, in accordance with the european arrest warrant procedure, a criminal sentence would have the same effect regardless of whether the first applicant lived in romania or italy. it is also reasonable to suppose that if after the decision is rendered the children are exposed to a risk, [the italian authorities] would take such requisite measures, if the risk was brought to their attention and supported by evidence.” on 28 september 2017 the bailiff together with p.l.r. and a psychologist from the bucharest directorate general for social welfare and child protection (“the child-protection authority”) spoke with the children, with their mother’s permission. on 7 december 2017 the tulcea district court granted the request. the enforcement proceedings were stayed during that period. therapy for the children was recommended. sought enforcement in romania of a parma district court order granting him sole parental authority.
the applicant, who is an uzbek national, was born in 1989. on an unspecified date in june 2012 he arrived in russia from uzbekistan. on 13 june 2013 the applicant was indicted for religious and politically motivated crimes in uzbekistan, namely for the participation in an extremist religious organisation islamic movement of turkistan. a search warrant in respect of him was issued and his pre-trial detention was ordered in absentia. on 24 november 2014 the moscow regional court convicted the applicant of participating in an extremist organisation, forging official documents, and attempting an illegal crossing of the state border. he was transferred to a penal colony to serve his sentence, and his release date was set for 30 june 2016. at the same time they informed him of the possibility to apply for temporary asylum. there is no information in the case file on whether the applicant lodged such a request or whether he appealed against the decision of 27 may 2016. the applicant was notified of the decision on 13 november 2015. on 16 may 2016 the migration authorities in the arkhangelsk region ordered the applicant’s deportation, referring to the above decision on the undesirability of his stay in russia. the applicant lodged an objection to a higher administrative authority, without success. the applicant also challenged the decision of 16 may 2016 in court. in his submissions, he stated that he belonged to a vulnerable group and ran a real risk of treatment contrary to article 3 by the uzbek authorities and he also requested an interim measure that the removal be stayed. on 4 july 2016 the oktyabrskiy district court of arkhangelsk upheld the deportation decision. the court referred to: the applicant’s conviction in russia, negative character references from the penal colony, the charges against him in uzbekistan, the international search warrant, the fact that the applicant had arrived in russia in 2007 seeking employment, and the absence of any history of persecution or ill-treatment in uzbekistan. it concluded that the claims concerning the above risks were speculative. on 13 october 2016 the above judgment was upheld on appeal by the arkhangelsk regional court. the russian government were immediately informed about the measure. they were also informed that failure by a contracting state to comply with a measure indicated under rule 39 might entail a breach of article 34 of the convention. on 30 june 2016, the day the applicant finished serving his sentence and was released from the penal colony in the arkhangelsk region, he was immediately arrested by the authorities without having had the chance to contact his lawyer, who was present outside the penal colony at that time. on the same day the applicant was taken to arkhangelsk airport, and he arrived at moscow domodedovo airport on the morning of 1 july 2016. on 22 july and 7 october 2016 the investigative committee informed the applicant’s representative that the request fell outside of its competence, and it was transferred to the prosecutor general’s office. on 26 july and 2 september 2016 the prosecutor general’s office informed the applicant’s representative that no extradition decision had been issued because the prosecution in respect of the charges in uzbekistan was time-barred; and that they had been informed about the interim measure indicated by the court only on 1 july 2016, after the deportation had taken place. on 27 october 2017 the district court dismissed the complaints once again. the applicant’s representative appealed on 7 november 2017. the court has not been informed about the outcome of those proceedings. upon his arrival in uzbekistan on 1 july 2016 the applicant was immediately arrested. on 7 january 2017 he was convicted and sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment by the qashqardarya region criminal court. he is currently serving his sentence in penal colony 64/6 in chirchiq. on 5 september 2017 the court asked the applicant’s representatives to provide information on whether they were still in contact with him and whether he wished to maintain his application.
the applicant was born in 1985 and lives in gdańsk. ap v ds 27/11) into the kidnapping of j.r. part of the ransom was paid on 15 june 2011. an x-ray examination did not reveal any fractures. he complained of pain in the left side of his face and the right wrist. he was then taken to a police detention facility in gdynia. the prosecutor noted that owing to a technical error it had not been possible to examine the cctv footage dated 17 june 2011 from the gdańsk appellate prosecutor’s office, where the applicant had been questioned. the prosecutor heard evidence from other individuals arrested with the applicant. she had been taken to a police station, where she had been threatened with the edw. she requested that the forensic expert establish, inter alia, what injuries the applicant had sustained in connection with his arrest. the forensic opinion was prepared on 26 june 2012. the forensic expert stated that the bruising could have been caused by the impact of a blunt object or a fall onto such an object. the expert further stated that the angular abrasions on the applicant’s back could have resulted from the use of an edw. officer r. had been sitting on the applicant. the officer had ordered the applicant to lift his arms so he could be handcuffed. officer r. stated that each discharge had released direct current for a few seconds. the prosecutor found that officers of the special squad had explained in detail what had happened during the arrest and the manner in which coercive measures were used. with regard to the edw, the prosecutor stated:
“the electroshock weapon was used in accordance with procedure, and only in respect of [the applicant], in the circumstances described by the police officer arresting him and owing to his non-compliance with the orders.” the prosecutor noted that the applicant had not recorded any objections to the manner of his arrest in the record of arrest, despite the allegedly drastic actions of the police officers. in conclusion, the prosecutor accepted that the applicant had sustained the injuries as described in the forensic opinion. the applicant appealed against the prosecutor’s decision. in this context, it found that those conflicting versions did not permit a clear determination of the relevant facts. accordingly, the actions of the police officers could not be considered to amount to a criminal offence. section 8 of the ordinance regulates the use of electrical discharge weapons (paralizator elektryczny). in a letter to the commander in chief of the police (komendant główny policji) dated 28 june 2017, the ombudsman (rzecznik praw obywatelskich) expressed his concerns about the use of edws by the police. clearly, the resort to edw in such situations must be strictly circumscribed. the cpt has strong reservations concerning this latter mode of use. this internal procedure should be accompanied by an external monitoring element. this could consist of systematically informing, at regular intervals, an independent body responsible for supervising law enforcement agencies of all cases of resort to edw. the committee also recommends that particular attention be paid to reiterating to all police officers instructions regarding the proper conduct as concerns the use of electric discharge weapons (tasers) and to enforcing those rules.
the applicant was born in 1985 and is currently serving a life sentence for murder in mountjoy prison, dublin. the fourth interview began at 3.00 p.m. and had a duration of one hour and thirty-nine minutes. the final interview of the day took place between 10 p.m. and 11.42 p.m., a duration of one hour and forty-two minutes. the applicant, who did not request or have any further contact with his solicitor that day, did not make any admissions to police. the following day, 25 february 2009, the police continued to question the applicant. questioning stopped while the police made contact with the solicitor. the next interview, the fourteenth, commenced at 5.32 p.m. in the first minutes, the police asked the applicant about text messages sent to ms g. around the time of the murder. according to a memo written by a police officer some hours afterwards, the solicitor then approached the officers conducting the interviews and told them, on an off‑the‑record basis, that the applicant was prepared to admit to the murder provided that ms g. was released. with regard to the questioning by [the police officers], the court finds that the interviews were conducted in a careful, patient and structured way in which some of the results of the [police] investigation were gradually revealed to barry doyle. the first thing to be said is that these remarks must be viewed in the overall context of all that had taken place, which included the various responses of barry doyle regarding the death of his brother, the responses regarding his own family, his children by a previous relationship to his relationship with [g], as well as read or taken in the context of the limited answers he had given about living in limerick and the fact that he had conceded ... that being in custody on suspicion of the murder of [s.g.] it agreed with the position taken by the trial judge that the fact that the applicant had consulted with his lawyer immediately before admitting the crime in the fifteenth interview represented a significant interruption in the process of police questioning. the court of appeal rejected this recalling that “118. all of their extensive submissions were fully ventilated and carefully considered by the trial judge. in the first judgment, the chief justice limited her remarks to the first issue above. as a matter of constitutional law, the concept of basic fairness of process applied from the time of arrest, as the supreme court had recently affirmed in a judgment that took into account the relevant convention jurisprudence – dpp v. gormley and dpp v. white, [2014] iesc 17 (“gormley”). the second judgment was given by o’donnell j, who also confined his analysis to the first issue. referring to relevant convention case-law he observed:
“8. in the present case, the voluntary nature of the confession was not in doubt, and the admission of the applicant’s statement had not been held to be unfair. the conviction was supported by independent testimony from ms. [ i cannot see that it should be interpreted as a decision to incriminate himself - he committed himself to nothing, and certainly not to admitting guilt. there is no evidence that his will was overborne to any extent, still less to the extent that a consultation could not assist him. reality, as it now stands, must be faced up to.” 62880/11 and 2 others, 24 october 2013; a.t. 71407/10, 28 august 2012; and brusco v. france, no. he then summarised the position in the different jurisdictions of the united kingdom, noting that in each of them provision was made for solicitors to be present during questioning. in the case the people (dpp) v pringle (1981) 2 frewen 57, it was held by o’higgins cj that, in the absence of an express guarantee against self‑incrimination in the irish constitution, it was not possible to infer a right to have a solicitor present during questioning. it is clear that the ecthr takes such a view. it seems to me to follow that the requirement that persons only be tried in due course of law, therefore, requires that the basic fairness of process identified as an essential ingredient of that concept by this court in state (healy) v. donoghue applies from the time of arrest of a suspect. gormley has not asserted that right to its full extent but has asserted only a right to have a lawyer to advise him, in custody, before the questioning starts. manifestly, however, it will not be long before some person or other asserts a right to legal advice in custody on a broader basis.
the applicant was born in 1954 and lives in marmarashen village. on 8 november 2006 he was assigned to military unit no. on the same date the military unit doctor temporarily discharged gegham sergoyan from his duties until 16 april 2007. because of the surgery, he was allowed to wear slippers instead of army boots. was the duty officer in charge of the military unit. according to the personal report provided by the military unit command, h.g. had been a weak officer from the first day of service. verbally abused him and violently pushed him against the wall. upon admission to stepanakert military hospital, the diagnosis of ballistic trauma of the cervical vertebrae with axis (second cervical vertebra) fracture and mandibular fracture with displacement of the right side was noted in gegham sergoyan’s medical records. on the same day gegham sergoyan was transferred to the central military hospital of the ministry of defence of armenia (the cmh) in yerevan pursuant to the transfer certificate issued by doctor h.e. on 17 april 2007 gegham sergoyan was admitted to the cmh in yerevan. was questioned and fully admitted his guilt. he submitted, in particular, that he had been on duty on 15 april 2007 when at 9.40 p.m. he had seen his assistant, j.g., he had shot gegham sergoyan with the gun attributed to him. on the same day the investigator of the askeran no. 1 garrison military prosecutor’s office ordered a post-mortem examination of gegham sergoyan’s body to be conducted in yerevan by forensic medical expert a.l.d. of the republican centre of forensic medicine. on 1 june 2007 the post-mortem examination, including an autopsy, was completed. on 14 september 2007 the charges against h.g. thereafter the case was transmitted to the syunik regional court for reasons of territorial jurisdiction. on the same date the military prosecutor filed a civil claim against h.g. seeking to recover amd 2,789,153 (approximately eur 6,200 at the relevant time) from the latter. the applicant relied, in particular, on article 18 of the civil code of armenia and articles 2 and 13 of the convention. guilty as charged and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment. it further stated that, although the accused had committed the crime while in military service, the crime had been committed on a personal level and therefore any damage incurred should be compensated by the person liable for it. on 1 october 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal. had committed the crime during his service while assigned to duty in the military unit on 15 april 2007. article 104 § 2 (10) provides that murder committed out of hooliganism shall be punishable by imprisonment from eight to fifteen years or life imprisonment. article 1077 § 2 provides that damage caused to the life or the health of a person while performing, inter alia, military service is compensated in accordance with the rules prescribed by the civil code, if stricter liability is not provided for by statute or contract. the civil code was supplemented by new articles 162.1 and 1087.2 which regulate the procedure for claiming compensation for non-pecuniary damage.
the applicant was born in 1949 and lives in belgrade. on 9 may 2005 the applicant lodged a claim seeking ownership of 265 shares of the company tri grozda a.d. on 14 september 2007 the belgrade court of first instance delivered a judgment in favour of the applicant. on 13 december 2011 the belgrade court of appeal reversed the judgment of 14 september 2007, and rejected the applicant’s claim. on 3 april 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal, complaining of a violation of his right to a trial within a reasonable time and requesting compensation in that regard. on 23 september 2014 the constitutional court found a violation of the applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time. it held that the finding of a violation had constituted sufficient just satisfaction in the particular circumstances of the present case for the following reasons. first, the nominal value of the impugned shares was only slightly higher than 200 euros. the case was thus of minor importance for the applicant. secondly, it considered that the applicant had contributed to the length of the civil proceedings by failing to lodge a constitutional appeal earlier.
the applicant was born in 1990 and lives in alphen aan den rijn. on 19 august 2009 the applicant, who was then nineteen years of age, was arrested on suspicion of distribution of child pornography (three pictures of a 16-year-old girl) in april of that year. he was informed that he had the right to consult a lawyer. he told the officers, inter alia, that he had a brain disorder: he had cavernous hemangiomas (clusters of abnormal blood vessels) in his brain and spinal cord. this did not affect his functioning other than that it might have a bearing on his trust in others; moreover, while he was allowed to play football he could not head the ball. when the applicant’s lawyer became available the police officers suspended the interview to give the applicant the opportunity to consult his lawyer by telephone. after that conversation, the applicant stated that his lawyer would come to see him at the end of the afternoon and that, on the advice of his lawyer, he would not answer any more questions. the applicant met with his lawyer later that day. the following day, 20 august 2009, the applicant was interviewed twice, including concerning distribution of child pornography, of which he was suspected. at the beginning of the interview, the applicant stated that he would prefer to have his lawyer present. he was told that this was not possible and the interview was started. the applicant replied to the questions put to him. in the course of the interview the police officers questioning the applicant noted that he made a spasm-like movement with his arm. they asked him whether he was having an epileptic fit. the police officers then decided to interrupt the interview and call a doctor. a final interview was held with the applicant on 21 august 2009. audio recordings were made of all the interviews. the applicant was released from police custody on 21 august 2009. however, it did not appear from the subsequent interviews that they had been conducted without the applicant having been able to consult his lawyer. given, moreover, that the contents of the interviews that had been conducted after the applicant had received legal assistance had not substantially differed from the content of the interview that had taken place without legal assistance, the regional court considered that the finding that a procedural requirement had not been complied with (vormverzuim) sufficed. the applicant lodged an appeal (hoger beroep). on 3 july 2013 the court of appeal (gerechtshof) of the hague quashed the decision of the regional court, convicted the applicant of the same offence and sentenced him to forty hours’ community service. as regards the claim that the applicant ought to have been assisted by a lawyer during the police interviews, the court of appeal held as follows:
“at the hearing on appeal counsel submitted that at the time of the police interviews the suspect had the mental age of a 15 or 16-year old, and also that he was suffering from a brain disorder which may have caused him to have epileptic seizures. counsel did not submit (medical) data to substantiate that claim. after the suspect had, in the eyes of the interviewing officers, made ‘a kind of spastic’ movement, they had consulted a physician before resuming the interview. the court of appeal considers that this was the correct course of action. the court of appeal does not agree with counsel that the interviewing officers ought reasonably to have considered the suspect as vulnerable or underage. this means in the light of the salduz case-law that the suspect, who was an adult at the time, was not entitled to have a lawyer present at his interview.” on 18 november 2014 the supreme court dismissed the appeal with summary reasoning, in accordance with section 81 of the judiciary (organisation) act (wet op de rechterlijke organisatie). under that provision, the supreme court may limit its reasoning in a decision to a finding that a complaint does not provide grounds to overturn the judgment appealed against or does not require answers to questions of law in the interests of the uniform application or development of the law.

details concerning the applicants can be found in the appendix. from 2 september 2004 until 2 january 2005 secret surveillance activities were carried out with respect to the third applicant in the context of ongoing criminal proceedings. the proceedings were later terminated without the applicant being prosecuted. the code of criminal procedure allows for evidence to be gathered by means of secret surveillance. between 3 october 2006 and 12 november 2007, 202 persons (witnesses and suspects) were interviewed, some of them repeatedly. the applicants’ representatives submitted different applications concerning the time they needed to inspect the files, ranging between six and ten months. by an order of the office of the prosecutor general of 13 may 2008, the applicants were given until 3 november 2008 to inspect the criminal file. their representatives (except the first applicant’s counsel) submitted requests to the office of the prosecutor general, asking it to remove the material which the prosecution did not intend to rely on from the criminal file, and to specify which evidence was intended to prove which facts. the office of the prosecutor general dismissed those requests, explaining that the applicants had been presented with all the material gathered during the pre-trial proceedings so that they could assess which material was relevant from the perspective of defence rights. as two of the accused – the fourth applicant and e.t. – altogether, the pre-trial proceedings lasted three and a half years and ended on 31 march 2009 when the statement of charges against the applicants was submitted to the trial court. in may 2009 dates for hearings in november and december 2009 and january, february, april, may and june 2010 were scheduled. further dates were scheduled in february 2010 (for dates in september and october 2010), in june 2010 (for dates in december 2010 and february and april 2011), in april 2011 (for dates in october, november and december 2011), in november 2011 (for dates in december 2011 and january, february, april and may 2012), in december 2011 (for dates in january and february 2012), and in february 2012 (for dates in march 2012). at the request of some representatives, hearings were not scheduled to take place more than three days a week. at the end of each hearing day, considering the evidence that was to be examined the following day, the court determined which of the accused and their representatives should appear at court the following day. as no dates suitable for everyone could be found out of the dates proposed by the applicants’ representatives, the court invited them to propose new dates for 2013. on 17 december 2013 the supreme court granted the applicants leave to appeal. on 22 january 2014 it gave the parties a deadline of 19 march 2014 to submit their observations. this meant that the criminal proceedings had lasted: eight years, nine months and five days with respect to the second applicant; seven years, eight months and twenty-eight days with respect to the first applicant, the second applicant company and the third applicant (in relation to certain criminal incidents); six years, nine months and eleven days with respect to the first applicant company and the third applicant (in relation to other criminal incidents); and six years, eight months and twenty-one days with respect to the fourth applicant. complex schemes had been used to commit the offences in question, and the activities of the accused had involved a high level of conspiracy. this had made the collection of evidence concerning the offences difficult and the analysis of the (circumstancial) evidence time-consuming. numerous witnesses had been heard during the pre-trial proceedings and in court (see paragraphs 13 and 17 above). the presentation of the statement of charges had not hindered defence rights either. as for separating the criminal case of e.t. from the rest of the proceedings could not be considered justified. in conclusion, the supreme court found that although some time might have been lost owing to the above-mentioned issues, the overall loss of time had been relatively insignificant in the context of the total duration of the proceedings. this was so because the investigating authority was not competent to assess the adequacy of reasoning. with regard to the reasoning in the prosecutors’ decisions to authorise surveillance activities, the supreme court observed that, despite the requirement – deriving from article 145 of the ccrp – that such decisions also had to be reasoned, they contained only an operative part and no reasoning at all. it found that the relevant regulation was constitutional. judge kergandberg addressed the requirement to provide reasons for decisions authorising secret surveillance.
the applicants are russian nationals who at the material time lived either in the chechen republic or the republic of ingushetia, a region neighbouring chechnya. 42575/07 and 11 others, §§ 40-80, 9 october 2014). the abduction took place in the presence of several witnesses. the investigation into the abduction was suspended and resumed on numerous occasions. the applicant was the wife of mr ibragim idrisov, who was born in 1951. on the morning of 3 february 2002, when the applicant came to visit her husband in the vovd as usual, she was informed that mr ibragim idrisov had been released the day before, on 2 february 2002. it appears that the investigation is still pending. on 31 december 2003 the nazran town prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. the investigators sent several requests for information to the law‑enforcement authorities. on 23 january 2014 a lawyer retained by the applicant sent a request to the head of the nazran investigative committee asking him to provide him with copies of certain case-file documents. on 29 october 2005 a police officer from zavodskoy district police station interviewed ms s., the sister of mr rizvan bashayev. on 31 december 2005 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators. at about 11 p.m. on 17 may 2005 mr khizir galtakov and his friend mr k. were in the village of znamenskoye, chechnya, at the intersection of shosseynaya street and the road between ken‑yurt and bratskoye, when a group of about six armed men in camouflage uniforms and balaclavas arrived in a grey uaz vehicle without registration plates. the men forced mr khizir galtakov into the vehicle and drove off to an unknown destination. the whereabouts of mr khizir galtakov remain unknown. on 18 may 2005 the first applicant informed the authorities of the abduction of her husband and requested assistance in the search for him. the third applicant was his brother; he died on 28 may 2011. most of the responses contained statements to the effect that no information about mr sharudi obrugov was available. it was resumed on 8 may 2003 and suspended again on 8 june 2003. on 21 may 2010 the second applicant requested the investigators to grant her full access to the criminal case file. on 8 december 2010 the chechnya supreme court upheld the above decision on appeal. 78009 under article 126 of the criminal code (abduction). on 28 april 2004 the first applicant lodged a complaint with the argun town prosecutor, asking that the investigation be resumed. the second and the third applicants are his brother and sister. on 29 september 2003 the investigation was suspended for failure to establish the identity of the perpetrators. on 20 july 2010 the first applicant was granted victim status and questioned. on 22 july 2010 the investigators questioned the third applicant. at the material time, ms tumisha sadykova worked at a car wash on subbotnikov street in grozny. she affirmed the account of the abduction given above. on 24 february 2012 the investigation was suspended.
the applicant was born in 1955 and lives in dmitrovgrad. between 2012 and 2014 the applicant lodged numerous complaints with the local police department concerning the allegedly unauthorised use of the plot of land near the block of flats where her family resided. she also alleged that there had been a number of assassination attempts planned against her. on 15 january 2014 the head of the inter-municipal police department forwarded the following letter to the psychiatric and narcological service:
“following receipt of numerous complaints, the [police department] asks you to examine (check) [the applicant] ... at her place of residence. she constantly talks about conspiracies against her. complaints lodged by residents and entrepreneurs about her aggressive behaviour have grown in number. [ the applicant] might cause harm to others.” on 28 and 29 january 2014 a psychiatrist, sav., questioned the applicant’s neighbours, asking them if they had observed any strange behaviour on the applicant’s part. on 30 january 2014 a psychiatrist visited the applicant at her place of residence. on 31 january 2014 the psychiatrist informed the police that the applicant did not have any psychiatric disorders. on 12 march 2014, in response to the applicant’s complaint, the dimitrovgrad town court found the psychiatrist’s actions unlawful. the court established that, contrary to the applicable legislation, the psychiatrist had failed to obtain the applicant’s consent to a psychiatric examination and that the applicant had objected to such an examination. on 17 march 2014 the applicant asked the court to find the police’s decision to have her assessed by the psychiatrist unlawful. she considered that the decision had been arbitrary and that it had amounted to an unjustified interference with her private life. on 29 april 2014 the town court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. the court found that the actions of the police had had a basis in law. the court interpreted the letter of 15 january 2014 issued by the police department as a request for information from the psychiatrist as to whether the applicant suffered from any mental illness. it further reasoned that the police had not asked the psychiatric service to examine the applicant. in 2012 the police had received numerous complaints from the applicant, who had alleged that she had been persecuted by unknown persons, and complaints from owners and employees of concession stands alleging that the applicant had destroyed their property and had disrupted their activities by making scenes. the police had conducted an inquiry, which did not confirm the applicant’s allegations. accordingly, the police had decided to obtain information about the applicant’s mental condition. lastly, the court reasoned that the fact that, in response to the police’s request for information, the psychiatric service had examined the applicant unlawfully had no bearing on the lawfulness of the police’s actions. on 22 july 2014 the ulyanovsk regional court upheld the judgment of 29 april 2014 on appeal. on 17 december 2014 the regional court refused to grant the applicant leave to lodge a cassation appeal. on 26 march 2015 the supreme court of the russian federation issued a similar decision in response to the applicant’s application to lodge a cassation appeal.

the applicant company is a limited liability company incorporated under moldovan law. on 24 december 2012 and 21 june 2013 respectively the applicant company initiated two sets of civil proceedings challenging two decisions issued by the state tax inspectorate of străşeni (inspectoratul fiscal de stat străşeni – “the inspectorate”) under which it had been fined for non‑compliance with the vat reporting regulations. on 5 september 2013 these two sets of proceedings were joined. on 26 december 2013 the străşeni district court upheld the applicant company’s claims and overturned the impugned decisions. the representative of the inspectorate was not present when the judgment was delivered, despite having been duly informed of the date and the time of the hearing. on 5 february 2014 the inspectorate lodged an appeal against the judgment of the străşeni district court. no request for an extension of the legal time-limit for lodging an appeal was made. the applicant company objected to the appeal and argued that it had been lodged outside the thirty‑day time-limit and that the inspectorate had not requested an extension of the legal time-limit for lodging it. in a decision of 3 september 2014 the chişinău court of appeal calculated the applicable time-limit and found that it had expired on 27 january 2014 and, accordingly, that the inspectorate had been late in lodging its appeal. it therefore decided to strike the appeal out of its list of cases as time-barred. the inspectorate lodged an appeal on points of law against that decision. it argued that the chişinău court of appeal could not strike out the appeal after having commenced its examination of the merits of the case. on 8 october 2014 the supreme court of justice quashed the chişinău court of appeal’s strike-out decision of 3 september 2014. without contesting the court of appeal’s calculation of the time-limit for lodging the appeal, the supreme court of justice accepted the argument put forward by the inspectorate and found that the court of appeal had breached the rules of procedure by adopting a strike-out decision after having started an examination of the merits of the case. ultimately, the case was referred back to the chişinău court of appeal for re-examination. on 28 january 2015, after rehearing the case, the chişinău court of appeal upheld the inspectorate’s appeal, quashed the judgment of the străşeni district court of 26 december 2013 and rendered a new judgment whereby the applicant company’s action was rejected as ill-founded. on 10 june 2015 the supreme court of justice declared an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant company inadmissible.
the applicant was born in 1958 and lives in tolyatti. on the same day the law-enforcement bodies of the nenetskiy autonomous region were informed of z.’s death. the post-mortem examination (in a report of 1 june 2007) established that z. had died as a result of mechanical asphyxia caused by deliberate self‑harm by means of hanging. in may to june 2007 the applicant lodged complaints with the nenetskiy regional prosecutor’s office, seeking to have criminal proceedings instituted against her son-in-law, ch., between 18 may 2007 and 14 october 2009 nineteen decisions were taken by an investigator refusing to institute a formal criminal investigation into z.’s death. had committed suicide by hanging herself. on each occasion it was noted that the instructions, given to the investigator by the prosecutor and the head of the criminal investigations department, to carry out procedural measures aimed at establishing the existence of the circumstances mentioned in the applicant’s complaint and the circumstances surrounding z.’s death, had not been complied with. subsequently, on 15 december 2009 the investigator took another decision refusing to institute a criminal investigation into z.’s death. had regularly subjected z. to beatings and humiliation. on 19 september 2011 criminal proceedings were instituted against ch. under article 110 of the criminal code (incitement to commit suicide). on 20 september 2011, however, the deputy prosecutor of the nenetskiy autonomous region set aside the above decision. amounting to inhuman or degrading treatment. z. had been in a state of severe alcohol intoxication and could not have fully understood her actions when taking the decision to take her own life. the bruises and abrasions on z.’s face and body could have originated during a heated altercation with ch. no direct evidence in support of the theory that ch. in 2005 and 2007) had indeed taken place, they would have been one-off unrelated events occurring under unspecified circumstances and could not have been connected to z.’s decision to take her own life. furthermore, z. had not been fully dependent on ch. according to z.’s relatives, she could have left ch. at any time, divorced him, taken the children and changed her place of residence. she could also have sought medical assistance, and/or complained about ch. at the same time she had told her relatives that she loved her husband and did not want to divorce him. the case file further contained information indicating that ch. had inflicted beatings on z. in june 2006, of which z. had complained to the police. however, z.’s submissions had been inconsistent and she had eventually refused to pursue those proceedings. had staged the suicide had been checked and found to be unsupported by the material in the case file. under article 117 § 1 of the criminal code, all of which were subsequently set aside by the supervising prosecutor as unlawful and unsubstantiated. under article 117 § 1 of the criminal code. on 7 july 2010 the applicant was granted victim status in the proceedings. on 5 june 2009 the naryan-mar town court dismissed the applicant’s claim.
the applicant was born in 1958 and lives in moscow. from 1995 until his retirement on 21 august 2006 he was a prosecutor of the north-western district of moscow. on 29 may 2007 the moscow city public prosecutor’s office opened a criminal investigation into the recent activities of a group of former and acting law-enforcement officers and officials. on 24 april 2008 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody pending investigation and trial (see valeriy samoylov v. russia, no. on 5 august the city court held a preliminary hearing and decided not to allow access to the public for hearings of the criminal case. in particular, the court held as follows:
“[the court] will examine the present case in camera. on 24 may 2010 the jury delivered a guilty verdict in the applicant’s case. the applicant appealed, complaining in particular about the lack of a public hearing. on 16 november 2010 the supreme court of the russian federation held an appeal hearing. the court heard the prosecutor, the civil party, the defendants, including the applicant, and their counsel. the court upheld, in substance, and reduced the applicant’s sentence to eight years’ imprisonment. the case file contains documents constituting state secrets and the disclosure of such information might entail a serious violation of the [interests] of society and the state.” on 10 september 2009 the main national television channel broadcast a programme on the circumstances of the criminal case against the applicant. the presenter stated that the applicant, a former district prosecutor, lived on unearned income and that the value of his assets significantly exceeded his revenues. he further claimed that the value of the applicant’s house was 2 million united states dollars (usd). the programme featured footage of the applicant’s two-storey house and its interior and the tax declarations of the applicant and the members of his family. a photograph of the applicant in his prosecutor’s uniform was also shown. on 18 may 2010 the ostankinskiy district court dismissed the applicant’s claims in full. in particular, the court ruled:
“the mass media have repeatedly reported, and continue to report, on the financial situation and revenues of high-ranking officials. the court referred to prager and oberschlick v. austria (26 april 1995, series a no. regard being had to the above, the court accepts that the exact value of the house owned by the plaintiffs, the exact amount of their incomes and the exact amount of their real property, in the circumstances of the case, are immaterial. the most important issue is that the value of their house does not correspond to their income. ... according to the investment agreement ... the value of the house was estimated at ... usd 60,000 ..., which did not include the cost of the interior, including the installation of a winding staircase and a jacuzzi ... [one of the plaintiffs’ witnesses] submitted that [the applicant] had been offered a reduced price for the house because of his friendship with the management of the construction company ... [the court] finds it incompatible with the standing of the prosecutor. [ this is justified by the public interest. the question raised in the programme about the public servant’s income and the value of his property is a matter of public interest. the court considers that [the applicant’s] claims that the respondent party should retract the information presented in the tv show that [the applicant] was involved in criminal activities and had received unlawfully from an entrepreneur usd 500,000 should also be dismissed. the journalist obtained those materials lawfully, with the investigator’s approval. the veracity of his assessment cannot be subject to verification given that such verification should be carried out [in the course of the criminal investigation]. ... according to ms samoylova (the applicant’s wife and a plaintiff), the moscow city court is examining a criminal case against [the applicant] ... [the court considers] that the journalist presented to the public his opinion that there is evidence confirming that [the applicant] is implicated in the commission of the offences he is charged with; [the journalist] commented on the criminal investigation, showed evidence collected and assessed it. on 20 december 2010 the city court upheld the judgment of 18 may 2010 on appeal.
the details of the applicants are available in the annex. the applicants are owners of a property situated at 8, flat 1, old prison street, senglea, (hereinafter “the property”) which they inherited from their ancestors. the property had been conceded to third parties by a title of temporary emphyteusis for a period of seventeen years, at an established ground rent of 40 maltese liras (mtl - approximately eur 98) per year, which was to expire in 1990. on 1 september 1986 the government issued a requisition order on the property. in october 1988 the government derequisitioned the property and returned the keys to the applicants. by means of a president’s declaration of 27 october 1989, that is after the property was demolished, the commissioner of land formally took over the property under title of possession and use (see relevant domestic law). the sum was based on an estimate of the land valuation office in line with their policies, but did not take account other factors, and was significantly lower than the rent at which the property had been leased prior to its demolition. by means of a judicial letter of 12 april 1999 the owners refused the offer. on 22 may 2000 the commissioner of land instituted proceedings before the lab requesting them to order the transfer of the property and set the relevant compensation. during these proceedings, the technical experts, appointed before the lab, considered that in 1986 the property had been valued at mtl 1,000 (approximately eur 2,320). by a decision of 7 march 2012, acknowledging that the property had been demolished prior to the formal taking by the government, the lab considered that it was inconceivable that rent be paid for a property which had been demolished in order to be built anew, and that the right course of action would have been to acquire the property by outright purchase. on 27 march 2012 the commissioner of land appealed against the amount of rent established. on 16 april 2012 the applicants filed constitutional redress proceedings. the report noted that the property had been demolished and was replaced by new residential apartments. it rejected the remainder of the claims, and left the liquidation of damage to be established in the final judgment. in particular the court was of the view that ‑ despite the applicants’ claim that the property had been demolished prior to it having been taken under possession and use ‑ the period in which the property had allegedly been taken and demolished must have been the same as that when it had been taken under title of possession and use, and thus the latter taking could not be considered illegal. the demolition was thus lawful pursuant to article 19 of chapter 88 of the laws of malta. as to the impugned law, this could not be found to be incompatible with the constitution since it had been in force before 1962. however, the recognition rent established in line with lab policies, which was not subject to any future increases, was too low and thus disproportionate. the defendants declared that they did not object to this valuation. costs were to be shared equally between the parties. the defendants appealed and the applicants cross‑appealed. however, even if this were not so, and that it had been demolished when it was under title of possession and use, the demolition would still have been unlawful, since according to law it was not possible to demolish a property under a title of possession and use the rights attached to which were limited. the measure thus became lawful, and pursued the general interest of slum clearance. moreover, the applicants were entitled to recognition rent for the property and, more importantly, for the land at issue. thus, given the small size of the property, the area in which it was in, the fact that it had been demolished at the expense of the government and the fact that the recognition rent was adequate, the constitutional court considered that eur 1,500 was an adequate amount of compensation to be shared by the applicants jointly. it further considered that it needed not examine the convention compatibility of the relevant law in abstracto, it having already determined that its application in the present case constituted a breach. costs of the first‑instance proceedings were to remain shared by the parties, as were those of the main appeal; and costs of the cross appeal were to be paid by the applicants. the property has been rebuilt as apartments for social housing. section 13 regarding compensation read, in so far as relevant, as follows:
“(1) the amount of compensation to be paid for any land required by a competent authority may be determined at any time by agreement between the competent authority and the owner, saving the provisions contained in subarticle (2).
mr mammadov is an azerbaijani national who has been involved in various political organisations and local and international non-governmental organisations for a number of years. it was claimed that after being involved in a car accident, v.a. on 25 january 2013 he described his impressions from the trip on his blog. on 28 january 2013 mr mammadov posted more information on his blog concerning the events, citing the official websites of the ministry of culture and tourism and the ministry of taxes and publishing screenshots of those sites. the trial, during which he remained detained, spanned approximately thirty hearings (ibid., § in november 2014 mr mammadov lodged a cassation appeal with the supreme court. as regards sentencing the court of appeal stated as follows:
“the court also notes that, during the conditional sentence, the convict is not released from criminal responsibility; when a sentence imposed by the judgment is not enforced, it is served in the special form defined by the law. ’s statements, which were only subsequently produced before the court, have not been shown to constitute such facts or information. expressed concern about the repetitive nature of the breach of the principle of presumption of innocence by the prosecutor general’s office and members of the government, despite several judgments of the court which, since 2010, have indicated the precise requirements of the convention in this regard, and insisted on the necessity of rapid and decisive action in order to prevent similar violations in the future;
...” 46. the committee of ministers then examined the case at its 1294th human rights meeting (19-21 september 2017). in respect of individual measures they confirmed payment of the just satisfaction awarded by the court. in the second mammadov judgment, cited above, the court found a violation of article 6 § 1 in connection with his trial and conviction; events also examined by the committee of ministers in the execution proceedings for the first mammadov judgment (see paragraphs 45 to 48 above). then, concluding in respect of article 6, it found:
“237. the evidence favourable to the applicant was systematically dismissed in an inadequately reasoned or manifestly unreasonable manner. the court recalls that it has already held in [the first] ilgar mammadov judgment (cited above, §§ 142-43) that the restriction of the applicant’s liberty prior to the conviction which is the focus of the present application had been applied for purposes other than bringing him before a competent legal authority on a reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence. it is rather that a failure to mitigate by the injured party may preclude recovery to that extent ...” 87. in its simplest form, this involves such conduct as the release of persons wrongly detained or the return of property wrongly seized. when, in a judgment transmitted to the committee of ministers in accordance with article 46, paragraph 2, of the convention, the court has decided that there has been a violation of the convention or its protocols and/or has awarded just satisfaction to the injured party under article 41 of the convention, the committee shall invite the high contracting party concerned to inform it of the measures which the high contracting party has taken or intends to take in consequence of the judgment, having regard to its obligation to abide by it under article 46, paragraph 1, of the convention. general measures2 have been adopted, preventing new violations similar to that or those found or putting an end to continuing violations. for instance, the striking out of an unjustified criminal conviction from the criminal records, the granting of a residence permit or the reopening of impugned domestic proceedings (see on this latter point recommendation rec(2000)2 of the committee of ministers to member states on the re-examination or reopening of certain cases at domestic level following judgments of the european court of human rights, adopted on 19 january 2000 at the 694th meeting of the ministers’ deputies). rule 9 allows information to be submitted to the committee of ministers by individual applicants, non-governmental organisations and other bodies on the execution of a judgment. if there has been no response within this time limit, the communication shall be transmitted to the committee of ministers but shall not be made public. this resolution shall be adopted by a majority vote of two-thirds of the representatives entitled to sit on the committee. the procedures were based on two principles. 6492/11, 3 july 2012, and tymoshenko v. ukraine, no. (b)  cases pending supervision before the committee of ministers where the court found a violation of article 18 in conjunction with article 5
(i)  individual measures 106. notwithstanding his pardon, as a result of his conviction the applicant was prevented from standing for any elections in azerbaijan until 2021, and from admission to the bar association also until 2021. in the third case, gusinsky, the secretariat’s analysis prepared at the 1243rd meeting (8-9 december 2015) advised the committee in relation to the violation of article 18 in conjunction with article 5 that:
“... it appears that this violation was closely linked to the vagueness of the law at the time and the absence of effective judicial review of detention of suspects. accordingly, the kind of abuse of power by the executive and the prosecutor services at issue in the gusinskiy case would today be subjected to effective judicial review. none the less, it appeared necessary to give the committee of ministers, as the competent organ for supervising execution of the court’s judgments, a wider range of means of pressure to secure execution of judgments.
the applicant was born in 1968 and lives in bor. the proceedings began on 30 march 1992 when the applicant brought a lawsuit against third persons concerning the execution of a contract. on 19 june 1997 the first-instance court accepted the applicant’s claim. on 30 october 1997 the appeal court quashed the decision on legal costs, remitted that issue to the first-instance court for a retrial and upheld the remainder of the first-instance judgment. the first-instance court subsequently rendered three decisions on the costs of the proceedings on 23 july 1998, 19 february 1999 and 3 march 2000. all of these decisions were quashed on appeal. on 5 february 2013 the first-instance court rendered a fourth decision on the issue of legal costs awarding the applicant approximately 2,000 euros (eur). according to the information on the file, the proceedings are currently pending before the second-instance court. on 13 march 2013 the constitutional court found a violation of the applicant’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time and awarded him eur 300 for the non-pecuniary damage suffered in this regard. furthermore, the constitutional court ordered the applicant’s proceedings to be expedited.
she lives in vilnius and has three children. the first time she gave birth was in 2009 in a public hospital in vilnius. that birth passed without complications and without the need for medical intervention. see paragraphs 31‑35 below), on 9 may 2012 the first applicant asked two public hospitals – one in vilnius and one in kaunas – to provide her with medical assistance during the home birth that she was planning. she indicated that she would give birth on 4-5 july 2012. similarly, to shift the legal and financial liability onto the healthcare specialist or healthcare institution in question would likewise not be acceptable. accordingly, the ministry had no plans to initiate changes to secondary legislation that would regulate the provision of midwifery services at home. the second applicant submitted that after she had fallen pregnant for a fourth time, and “not being able to safely give birth at home” owing to criminal charges having been brought in respect of the above-mentioned doula, j.i.š. ( both births had been “without complications [and] successful, and the children [were] growing up and developing healthily”. all the hospitals refused, on the grounds that in lithuania there was no legal basis on which to provide medical assistance during a home birth. the head of the maternity and obstetrics clinics at the vilnius university hospital (vilniaus universiteto akušerijos ir ginekologijos klinika) also indicated that she did not have the right to oblige medical personnel to provide medical services outside the hospital. on 21 september 2012 the third applicant then asked the ministry of health to either guarantee medical assistance at her home during the birth of her third child or to amend the relevant secondary legislation so that the healthcare professionals were permitted to provide such assistance. she also argued that if the two relevant pieces of secondary legislation were annulled by the minister of health (see paragraphs 42 and 44 below), there would remain no obstacles to women receiving medical assistance during home births. nonetheless, the court had acknowledged that, as concerned the provision of healthcare services, the states had a wide margin of appreciation, and regulation had to ensure a proper balance between societal interests and the right at stake. similarly, a healthcare institution or a specialist had no obligation to provide such services, even if a pregnant woman so wished. on 8 april 2013 the vilnius regional administrative court rejected the third applicant’s complaint. there was no information in the file to the effect that the third applicant had ever approached any of the maternity wards or that she had faced obstacles in choosing how to make use of that right to privacy (for example, by requesting certain services, such as a private room) and then instituted court proceedings. one also had to bear in mind the fact that privacy in respect of the third applicant’s personal life (which she had sought by demanding to be provided with medical assistance during her home birth) could not be seen as having a greater value than the health of her and the newborn child, for the purpose of which the state had established a system of personal healthcare and qualified medical assistance. the fourth applicant stated that she had given birth at home in 2001, 2003 and 2011, with the assistance of doula j.i.š. the third and fourth applicants were among those who initiated that ngo and were its active participants. he pointed out that it was precisely owing to those criminal investigations that various requests concerning assistance for home births had started reaching the ministry. the scope of her actions at those home births had varied between merely examining newborn babies to performing certain childbirth-related actions. by a judgment of 23 december 2016, the vilnius city district court acquitted j.i.š., holding that she had revived the old profession of doula, which although not regulated in lithuania, was also not forbidden by law. on 19 july 2017 the vilnius regional court overturned the lower court’s judgment and convicted j.i.š. under article 202 § 2 of the criminal code. had neither a medical education nor a licence to provide such services. had been engaged in prohibited medical activities. she was sentenced to six months of deprivation of liberty, suspended for one year. ’s activity, although it had not been prohibited (jos vykdyta veikla nėra uždrausta), had been unlawful (neteisėta).
a list of applicants is set out in the appendix. and a first floor of a little more than 100 sq.m., with roof terraces, located in the primary town centre. the applicants became owners either through inheritance or donation from their parents on various dates between 1991 and 2011. in 1947 the rent was increased to twenty‑four pounds sterling annually (around eur 28.62). on 14 august 1978 the applicants’ ascendants entered into a new lease agreement with the band club, whereby they willingly rented property a and part of the garden of property b (hereinafter, jointly referred to as “the rented property”) to the band club for 120 maltese liras annually ((mtl) – approximately eur 279.52), to be paid six months in advance. these amounts did not correspond to those agreed upon within the rent agreement of 14 august 1978. on 28 october 1980 and again on 10 january 1983 l.g. complained with the band club about its use of the rented property as a discotheque and as a restaurant. in 2004 and 2005 the band club had requested that it be able to rent a further part of the garden of property b and for it to purchase the part of the property that was being utilized as the seat of the club. on 8 august 2009 the applicants appointed an architect who estimated that the rented property ought to at least attract a rental income of eur 36,700 yearly. they claimed, inter alia, that their right to peaceful enjoyment of their property, as protected under article 1 of protocol no. on 15 july 2015 the civil court (first hall), in its constitutional competence, inter alia, found that the owners had suffered a violation of their rights as protected under article 1 of protocol no. the court noted that, in 1923, when the owners had entered into the first rental agreement with the band club, the laws enacting the special dispositions concerning renting a property as a club had not yet come into force. the court considered that the rental agreement of 14 august 1978 was an extension of the first rental agreement - the first agreement having been entered into before the special dispositions had come into force. therefore, the court rejected the attorney general’s arguments. the court accepted that clubs play a social role in maltese society, even to date. with this social interest the state was permitted a level of interference. the legality of such interference had not been contested. however, when comparing the circumstances in which the rent agreement had originally been entered into, to the present day circumstances, the element of proportionality had not been respected and thus the applicant’s rights had been breached. thus, it was not competent to give the remedy requested by the applicants. however, some form of compensation was due. 1 to the convention and therefore no compensation was due. the costs of proceedings at both instances were to be paid by the owners. unlike the first-instance court, the constitutional court concluded that the agreement of 14 august 1978 amounted to novation (see relevant domestic law). it was a new rent agreement concerning a larger property and a higher annual rent payable. the intentions of the parties in the original agreement were set aside, and were now regulated by means of a new agreement. therefore the owners could not allege a violation of their rights. the principle volenti non fit injuria applied. from the evidence presented before it, the constitutional court concluded that the agreement of 14 august 1978 established clearly that the owners wanted to enter into a rental agreement for a larger property, with a higher rent to be paid by the band club, and had done so.
the applicants are russian nationals who at the material time lived in the neighbouring regions of the chechen republic and the republic of ingushetia. in every case the investigations, after being suspended and resumed on several occasions, have been pending for several years without attaining any tangible results. further to such requests, the authorities generally reported that service personnel’s involvement in the abduction had not been established and that no special operations had been carried out at the relevant time. the perpetrators have never been established by the investigating bodies. the whereabouts of mr shamil amirkhadzhiyev have remained unknown ever since. the responses contained statements that no information about mr amirkhadzhiyev was available. it appears that the investigation is still pending. the applicants are close relatives of mr said-magomed vatsayev, who was born in 1979. the first applicant is his mother, the second applicant is his brother and the third applicant is his sister. on their way to belgatoy mr said-magomed vatsayev and mr m.z. the service personnel picked up the injured man and took him away to an unknown destination. they confirmed the circumstances of the abduction as described above. according to the applicants, on several occasions between 2002 and 2005 they complained of the police’s failure to take necessary investigative steps to the grozny district prosecutor’s office. on 30 january 2006 the first applicant was granted victim status. on 24 march 2006 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators. the service personnel, who spoke unaccented russian, asked for the identity documents of mr khamzat chapsurkayev. on 24 october 2002 the first applicant lodged an official complaint in respect of her husband’s abduction with the authorities and requested assistance in the search for him. 59267 under article 126 of the criminal code (abduction). the first applicant was informed thereof. on 30 november 2006 the first applicant again complained to the shali district prosecutor in respect of the abduction. on 22 and 26 july 2010 the investigators questioned the applicants’ neighbour, mr a.d., on 6 may 2012 the first applicant requested that the investigators inform her of the progress in the investigation. out of the uaz vehicle and proceeded to an unknown destination. on 24 july 2002 the grozny prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. on 24 september 2002 the investigation was suspended. it is unclear whether any reply was given to this request. complained of the abduction to authorities. it was resumed on 18 february 2008 and suspended again on 18 march 2008. on 17 september 2012 the court terminated the proceedings, having found that on 11 september 2012 the investigation had been resumed. on 31 october 2012 the supreme court of chechnya upheld that decision on appeal.

the applicant was born in 1960 and lives in zgornja korena. the applicant was given a suspended prison sentence. the judgment became final on 17 june 2011. on 9 april 2004 the applicant was granted a licence to work as a liquidator in insolvency proceedings under the compulsory composition, bankruptcy and liquidation act (hereinafter “the bankruptcy act”) then in force. his name was entered in the register of liquidators maintained by the ministry of justice. on 21 june 2011 the maribor local court informed the ministry of justice that the applicant’s conviction for the criminal offences committed in 2003 and 2004 had become final (see paragraph 6 above). three days following the decision the applicant’s name was removed from the registry of liquidators. on 25 july 2011 the applicant lodged an administrative action against the decision revoking his licence. accordingly, he could not have been expected to anticipate that such legal consequences would have arisen from his actions which, furthermore, had no bearing on the performance of his duties as a liquidator. he argued that over the years in this profession, he had gained extensive experience and had built up his reputation. he further alleged that the administrative court had failed to address that key argument and to provide a reasoned response to his complaints. moreover, the applicant was of the view that, assuming that the administrative court had correctly interpreted the relevant provisions of the financial operations act, those provisions were inconsistent with the constitution. the relevant provision of section 109 of the financial operations act was unambiguous and did not require any particular interpretation; it was clear from its wording that it applied equally to those liquidators who had acquired their licence prior to the enactment of the financial operations act as well as to those who had acquired it after the new act had come into force. moreover, the act did not specifically provide that the measure in question applied only to convictions for criminal offences committed after it had entered into force. on 6 november 2013 the constitutional court decided not to consider the applicant’s constitutional complaint, relying on the second paragraph of section 55(b) of the constitutional court act (see paragraph 36 below). from november 2014 to november 2015, he was employed through a programme for older workers. on 8 april 2013 the applicant applied for a new liquidator’s licence. on 29 may 2013 the ministry of justice rejected his application, citing the financial operations act’s provision, pursuant to which a licence could not be granted once it had been revoked (point 2, paragraph 4 of section 108 of the financial operations act – see paragraph 30 below) and noting that the applicant’s licence had been revoked on 27 june 2011. on 27 june 2013 the applicant lodged an administrative action against the above decision. he argued that the sanction of permanent revocation was absolutely disproportionate and that neither judges nor lawyers were subject to such strict conditions as both were able to reapply for office after they had been dismissed. the applicant further submitted that he had lost his job virtually overnight and that the companies which had provided support services to him, such as accounting, had also been seriously affected by the measure. he also explained that he was unemployed and found it difficult to provide for his children who were in his sole custody. on 5 january 2014 the applicant lodged pleadings referring to a judgment issued in criminal proceedings unconnected with the present case. it found that the refusal to grant a licence was based on a valid law, which prohibited granting of a licence to an applicant whose previous licence had been revoked. subsequently, the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. on 27 may 2015 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal, relying on several provisions of the constitution including equal protection of rights, the right to judicial protection, freedom of work, as well as articles 6, 7 and 14 of the convention. he argued that his case was an important one and that if the current position of the courts remained in effect, he would never be able to work as a liquidator again. the applicant disputed the supreme court’s decision, which had required him to show that there had been inconsistencies in the case-law. the applicant furthermore argued that the interpretation of the relevant legislation had not yet been settled. the decision was served on the applicant on 4 january 2016.
the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in paola. he also stated that he accepted to help the applicant move a photocopier (which had been found overturned on the floor) and that he had seen the applicant put the server of a computer network system under the sofa of a room on the second floor, and the video recorder and the safe-deposit box in other places. the applicant repeatedly stated that he had no difficulty reiterating his version of events, if and when it was needed, should they go to court. he was then moved to another room at 7.50 pm to record his detailed statement of events (a 38 page transcript). and in particular how he was paid his monthly salary, ensued. on the same day i.e. 2 february 2002 the applicant was brought before the court of magistrates, as a court of criminal inquiry, together with his employee a.f. in order for them to be judged separately. gave evidence in the criminal proceedings against the applicant. he could not confirm whether the video recorder was the same one which had been included in the system but he considered that the second tape inside was surely not the one he was recording on, on 29 january 2002. he did not know how many videos of the brand gyyr he had. he confirmed that he did not know where the things where and, in his view, this had been a frame up against him or against his company, by someone close to him or someone who had worked for him, or a competitor. ’s testimony was enough to conclude that the applicant was guilty of simulation of offence. it was true that the applicant had repeatedly and categorically denied any wrongdoing; however, he was not reliable in the light of the evasive and hesitant way in which he replied to police questions concerning his business, profitability, rents, and profits of the previous year. on 15 june 2011, the applicant filed an application before the civil court (first hall), in its constitutional competence, complaining about a violation of article 6 of the convention on the basis that, inter alia, the court of criminal appeal’s judgment was based on statements given by the applicant to the police without the assistance of a lawyer. by a judgment of 29 october 2012, the court rejected the applicant’s complaints. he had never alleged that the statement was taken abusively. moreover, he had not even raised this complaint when filing the constitutional application on 15 june 2011. 60908/11 and 4 others, §§ 23-26, 24 july 2014) and dimech v. malta (no. by way of example:
(i)  cases brought before the constitutional jurisdictions while the criminal proceedings were pending against the complainant
charles stephen muscat vs the attorney general, constitutional court judgment of 8 october 2012 45. it thus ordered that his statements be expunged from the acts of the criminal proceedings. on appeal, by a judgment of 8 october 2012 the constitutional court reversed the first-instance judgment. as to the merits it considered that its role was to determine whether the statement given in the absence of legal assistance amounted to a breach of the applicant’s right given the trial as a whole, and whether there was a risk that the applicant be found guilty when he was in reality innocent. in the absence of such risk no breach would occur. mr muscat had been informed of his right to remain silent. the same applied in respect of his other statement under oath before the magistrate, if made while under arrest. accepting that the case was not premature, and in the light of the criminal courts’ referral pending criminal proceedings against mr fenech, it found that the mr fenech’s right to a fair trial had been breached only in relation to the statement given to the police, but not the statement given before the magistrate, which could thus be admitted as evidence in the criminal proceedings against him. the republic of malta vs carmel camilleri constitutional court judgment of 22 february 2013 57. it noted, inter alia, that it was true that it was still open to the applicant to raise his complaint despite the passage of time. subsequently, on 14 october 2011, he filed an application before the civil court (first hall) in its constitutional competence claiming that his case was based on the incriminating statements he had given to the police at a time when he was not yet being legally assisted. by means of another application lodged in 2011, whilst the criminal proceedings against him were still pending, he once again brought the same complaint before the constitutional jurisdictions.
the applicant sigurður einarsson was born in 1960 and lives in reykjavík. the applicant ólafur ólafsson was born in 1957 and lives in pully, switzerland. in december 2008 the office of the special prosecutor was established to investigate potential criminal conduct in connection with the financial crisis and, where appropriate, to prosecute those concerned. the special prosecutor had police authority to investigate criminal cases as well as prosecutorial authority. on 22 september 2008 kaupþing issued a press release stating that q, a company owned indirectly by sheik mohammed bin khalifa al thani (hereafter “al thani”), a member of qatar’s royal family and a wealthy businessman, had bought 5.01% of the share capital of kaupþing for 25,599,000,000 iceland krónur (isk). the loan transactions and the payment for the shares had all been made on 29 september 2008. on 9 december 2008 the fme was informed of possible suspicious transactions in kaupþing’s operations shortly before the bank collapsed. having made inquiries, the fme submitted a complaint to the special prosecutor on 13 march 2009. 108/2007 on securities transactions for giving a misleading picture of the transactions in question. the case was submitted to the reykjavík district court on 7 march 2012 and the main hearing took place from 4 to 14 november 2013. forty witnesses gave evidence, including the applicants. on 26 january 2016 the petitions were rejected. magnús guðmundsson did not lodge a petition for reopening. in order to conduct a search of the electronic data, the special prosecutor used an e-discovery system named “clearwell”. however, transcripts of all recorded depositions were made and handed over to the applicants, albeit with some delay on account of the volume of the material. on 4 may 2012 the district court dismissed the request, noting that the prosecution had stated that the data in question was accessible in the premises of the special prosecutor, where the defence could review it and, if appropriate, request that documents be submitted to the court as evidence. in a ruling of 29 may 2012 the district court reiterated that the documentation was accessible to the accused. it then observed in relation to the request dismissed by the district court on 29 may 2012 that it could not be overlooked that the collection of data seized by the police was enormous in scope and that among the data were e-mail communications that by their nature had to concern the financial affairs of a great many customers of kaupþing and which had to be kept confidential, as well as personal messages concerning the private lives of employees. in neither of the district court’s rulings had the applicants been denied access to specific documents; rather, they had been refused copies of an extensive collection of documents, which they had however been invited to access on the police premises. the applicants’ phones were tapped in the period from 9 to 27 march 2010. the special prosecutor informed the applicants by letter of 28 december 2011 that the tapping had taken place and informed them that the records from the phone tapping would be deleted in accordance with section 85 § 1 of the of criminal procedures act. the special prosecutor replied to hreiðar már sigurðsson’s lawyer, stating that a mistake had been made as the phone calls in question had not been deleted immediately pursuant to section 85 of the criminal procedures act, but that they had since been deleted. the calls had been recorded with help from the computer forensics division of the rejkjavík metropolitan police; they had been scanned by the investigators, who had at the same time made brief notes about what they regarded as relevant to the investigation of the case; the investigators had been instructed to stop listening to phone calls when it became clear that a defendant was speaking to his defence lawyer and not to record what had been revealed in the conversation up until that point. however, an employee responsible for documenting the phone calls had made the mistake of not mentioning the phone calls in question when writing a memorandum, and as a result they had been omitted from a list of phone calls that should be deleted. the special prosecutor emphasised that the phone calls had not been listened to and that confidentiality had been respected. moreover, he had been in contact with two of them while head of the legal department. the relevant provisions of the criminal procedures act (law no. denial of access may be referred to a judge. the police are to take into account any suggestions the defence attorney may submit as regards individual investigative actions, unless the police consider such suggestions prohibited or irrelevant.” if the witness is located far from the court or if attending the court would otherwise cause him significant inconvenience, the judge may decide that testimony is to be given during the court session by telephone ot other telecommunications methods, provided that the testimony is given in such a manner that everyone present during the session is able to hear the testimony.

the applicant was born in 1951 and lives in kičevo. on 2 february 2010 the applicant submitted a written statement in which he denied that he had collaborated with the state security bodies after 1944. such a statement was to be submitted to the fact verification commission (“the lustration commission”) by public officials and was required under the additional requirement for public office act of 2008 (“the 2008 lustration act”). by a decision of 12 september 2011, the lustration commission confirmed that the applicant satisfied the additional condition for the performance of the office of a judge, having confirmed that he had not collaborated with the security bodies of the past regime. the commission’s decision, which referred to submissions made by a third person (namely a certain z.t., from which it established that the applicant – referred to in those files as an “operational liaison” (оперативна врска) – had provided relevant information to the state security bodies in the 1970s. the relevant parts of those notes read as follows:
“... i [the handler] met with [the applicant], a law student [at the time], on two occasions on which he expressed a wish to collaborate with the state security office (служба за државна безбедност) ...
... the relationship (пријателската врска) – [the applicant] informed me that [code name] had exchanged letters with ...
... the conversation with [the applicant] was on my [the handler’s] initiative ... the source [the applicant] was used occasionally, during his stay in skopje. the lustration commission found that, under the law on determining conditions limiting the exercise of public office, access to documents and the publication of information about cooperation with state security bodies (“the 2012 lustration act”, which had replaced the 2008 lustration act), the applicant had collaborated with the state security bodies. the documents were not signed by the applicant or the handler. in a written statement of 27 november 2012, certified by a notary public, p.k., on 30 november 2012 the applicant challenged the commission’s decision before the administrative court. he complained that, inter alia, the lustration commission had not held an oral hearing and it had not provided sufficient reasoning for its findings, in particular to show that his alleged collaboration had satisfied the criteria specified in section 18 of the 2012 lustration act. in that connection, he subsequently submitted a letter from the intelligence service (управа за безбедност и контраразузнавање) dated 2013, in which it was confirmed that the applicant had not been registered in its records and that the documents used in the impugned proceedings had not been from its archives. in that regard he requested that the court hear oral evidence from p.k. a university professor and former intelligence officer, regarding the reliability of the documentary evidence against the applicant and whether he could be regarded as a collaborator within the meaning of the 2012 lustration act. in this respect, he submitted a copy of a statement made by v.p. had underlined the qualitative criteria of such collaboration and the difference between “an informant” and “a collaborator”. at a hearing held in private, and in the absence of the parties, on 20 december 2013, the administrative court dismissed the applicant’s claim. referring to the information in the relevant documents (see paragraph 6 above), which it found truthful (having compared the copy documents in the applicant’s case file with the originals), the court confirmed the lustration commission’s findings that the applicant had collaborated with the security services in a conscious, secret, organised and continuous manner as a secret informant, notably as an operational liaison. ... [the applicant] had agreed to cooperate with the state security office. for these reasons, the court does not accept (не ја прифати) the certified statement appended to the claim. on 24 january 2014 the applicant requested that the lustration commission grant him access to the original documents in his case file. in reply, the commission informed him that the originals had been returned to the state archives. the reasoning provided by the lower bodies in that respect had not been sufficient. furthermore, they had been admitted into evidence as copy documents, without having their authenticity confirmed by the security bodies. it held that, owing to the applicant’s conduct, the human rights and freedoms of others had been violated. on 13 november 2015 the applicant submitted audio recordings and a transcript of taped telephone conversations which allegedly involved the then chairman of the lustration commission and a member of parliament from the ruling political party. the material concerned conversations in which that member of parliament informed the chairman of the lustration commission that certain material regarding the applicant had been submitted before the commission by z.t. and asked that the proceedings be conducted as quickly as possible. the applicant contended that on 6 april 2015 the audio material was made public by the then political opposition in the respondent state and was also made available online.
on 5 and 20 march 2007 the zagreb county state attorney’s office (županijsko državno odvjetništvo u zagrebu) asked an investigating judge of the zagreb county court (županijski sud u zagrebu) to authorise the use of secret surveillance measures in respect of m.m., on the grounds that he was suspected of drug trafficking. the fourth applicant’s telephone number was noted in that respect. following an application lodged on 3 may 2007 by the zagreb county state attorney’s office, on 4 may 2007 the investigating judge of the zagreb county court authorised the use of secret surveillance measures in respect of the fourth applicant and three other persons, on the grounds that they were suspected of drug trafficking proscribed by article 173 §§ 1 and 2 of the criminal code. the application refers to the police report ... of 3 may 2007 concerning the use of secret surveillance measures in respect of m.m., in addition to the [information stated] above, it appears that a.j. is obviously not satisfied with cocaine leaving those places in an uncontrolled manner. ...
the enclosed document delivered with the oscoc’s application ... of 31 may 2007 and the conversations monitored so far indicate that a.j., and the fourth applicant continuously communicated regarding perpetrating the criminal offence proscribed by article 173 § 3 of the criminal code. in may 2007 in zagreb, after acquiring that drug from the first applicant. on 25 march 2008 the trial court dismissed the applicants’ complaints concerning the alleged unlawfulness of the secret surveillance orders as unfounded, and proceeded with the examination of the case. therefore, the content of the cited provisions of the oscoc act, to which the appellants refer in their appeals, does not exclude the application of special measures under article 180 § 1 of the code of criminal procedure, but such measures are extended in respect of some criminal offences by the measures provided for under section 41 of the oscoc act. at a hearing held on 15 december 2008 the trial court heard m.s., a witness called by the fourth applicant. stated that he had been friends with the fourth applicant, whom he had asked to watch over his son, b.s., had gone to zagreb to purchase an air-conditioning device. had subsequently told him that in zagreb he had purchased drugs from some people. who he said would testify about the circumstances in which b.s. in convicting them, the zagreb county court relied on the recordings obtained by secret surveillance, finding them lawful and credible. had purchased the cocaine from the fourth applicant. moreover, they contended that the procedure for supervising the execution of the secret surveillance orders, which in the case at hand had been based on the code of criminal procedure, should have been based on special legislation concerning organised crime (the oscoc act). statement that he had not purchased cocaine from the fourth applicant, but from s.h. that opinion was not forwarded to the defence. on 13 january 2010 the supreme court informed the parties that a session of the appeal panel would be held on 9 march 2010. it held that all the secret surveillance orders had essentially provided sufficient reasoning. section 41 and section 42(1) of the oscoc act provided for the possibility of ordering such measures. the secret surveillance orders had been lawfully issued in respect of several people in croatia whom the second and third applicants – who had lived in the netherlands at the time – had contacted. the applicants challenged those findings by lodging constitutional complaints with the constitutional court (ustavni sud republike hrvatske). the applicants’ lawyers had attended the session and had therefore had the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on those submissions. as to the fourth applicant’s complaint that the trial court had refused to hear two witnesses whom he had wished to call, the constitutional court noted that the trial court had given reasons for doing so.
the applicant was born in 1970 and lives in czarnowo. the zus based its decision on a medical opinion which had found the applicant fit to work. the expert opinions were submitted to the court on 12 july 2010. according to the opinions the applicant was fit to work. on 16 july 2010 the court dismissed an application by the applicant to appoint a legal aid lawyer to represent her. on 31 may 2011 the court ordered that the applicant be examined by doctors again. although at first she refused the examination, it did take place. in july 2011 a further expert opinion was prepared. it did not differ in its conclusions from the earlier ones. the court ordered the preparation of such an opinion. it appears that the applicant refused to undergo an examination at a psychiatric hospital. on 19 october 2011 the applicant’s representative was punished for contempt of court in connection with his insulting letter to the court. the applicant’s representative appealed and his appeal was initially rejected for formal reasons but was ultimately admitted for examination on its merits. she also repeated her application for a legal aid lawyer to be appointed. on 24 june 2013 the court sent the case file to another expert. the applicant also challenged the judges again; the presiding judge was changed following a decision of the president of the court on 20 may 2015. on 22 may 2015 the szczecin regional court gave a judgment in which it dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the zus decision of 29 january 2010. on 27 april 2016 the applicant submitted an application challenging all the judges of the court of appeal. in july 2016 the court granted her request for a legal aid lawyer and one was appointed to represent the applicant before the supreme court. the case file was returned to the szczecin court of appeal for examination. the applicant refused to undergo a medical examination. a legal aid lawyer was appointed to represent her; however, the applicant requested the appointment of another lawyer. the applicant’s lawyer was asked to remedy some formal shortcomings in her cassation appeal and to pay a fee. the applicant lodged several complaints under the law of 17 june 2004 on complaints about breaches of the right to have a case examined, in an investigation conducted or supervised by a prosecutor and in judicial proceedings, without undue delay (ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu przygotowawczym prowadzonym lub nadzorowanym przez prokuratora i postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki - “the 2004 act”). in particular, in the second of the above-mentioned decisions, the court agreed that the proceedings in the case had concentrated on the examination of the applicant’s applications for legal aid and her applications challenging the experts and judges. the large number of those applications had made it virtually impossible to deal with the merits of the case. her appeal and a further request to reopen the proceedings were rejected by the szczecin court of appeal in may 2014. on 26 february 2018 the szczecin court of appeal rejected the applicant’s most recent complaint about the length of the proceedings before the court of appeal as it had not been lodged by a lawyer. 61444/00, §§ 34-46, echr 2005-v (extracts)) and rutkowski and others v. poland (nos. 72287/10 and 2 others, §§ 75-107, 7 july 2015).
on 30 november 2004 the applicant company signed a contract (“the contract”) with the ministry of finance (“the ministry”) for an investment loan, expressed in the equivalent of the national currency, with the repayments calculated in euros (во денарска противвредност пресметана во евра). clause 11 of the contract stipulated that a statutory default interest rate (затезна камата по стапка yтврдена со закон) was to be paid on all overdue repayments, which, according to an annex forming part of the contract, were expressed in euros. on 4 september 2012 a bailiff issued an enforcement order under the terms of the contract. the applicant company’s protest and appeal against the enforcement order were dismissed by both the president of the ohrid court of first instance (основен суд охрид) and by the bitola court of appeal (апелационен суд битола), with the final decision being dated 3 april 2013. on 17 may 2013 the applicant company lodged a civil claim against the ministry seeking an annulment of clause 11 of the contract, claiming that, in accordance with domestic law, interest on the repayment of loans in foreign currencies should be calculated on the basis of that foreign currency’s domestic rate (домицилна камата) instead of the statutory default interest rate. in that respect it relied on a judgment by the supreme court in which the same provision, contained in an identical contract regarding a state-granted loan to another person, had been annulled (рев1. the applicant company’s claim was dismissed by the ohrid court of first instance and the bitola court of appeal on 7 october and 13 january 2014 respectively, each holding that the loan had been approved in the national currency and therefore the statutory default interest rate applied. neither court commented as to the supreme court’s case-law. the final judgment was served on the applicant company’s representative on 31 march 2014. on 27 may 2015 insolvency proceedings were opened in respect of the applicant company. 168/2011 of 8 february 2012, рев.1 бр.74/2012 of 6 december 2012 and рев. 202/2012 of 24 october 2013, the supreme court held that interest on state-granted loans which were to be repaid in amounts expressed in a foreign currency should be calculated on the basis of that currency’s domestic interest rate. the supreme court took the stance that the loan repayment instalments were the determinative factor in the cases, and since, in those cases, the instalments had been expressed in a foreign currency, the statutory default interest rate was not applicable. the same stance was taken in two appeal court judgments (тсж бр. 828/08 of 21 may 2008 and тсж 1527/09 of 11 november 2009).
the applicant was born in 1967 and is currently detained in the kyiv pre-trial detention centre (“the sizo”). the court agreed with the reasons for the applicant’s detention which had been advanced by the investigator, but did not mention them in its decision. the decision merely stated that the reasons advanced by the investigator were sufficient for the court to conclude that the applicant might try to abscond from justice, obstruct the investigation, and influence the other suspect or witnesses in the proceedings. on 3 august 2017 the decision was upheld by the court of appeal. on 6 june 2017 the applicant was placed in the kyiv sizo. no further details were provided by the courts. on 13 december 2017 the kagarlyk court of kyiv region (“the trial court”) committed the applicant for trial. during the trial the applicant’s detention was again extended a number of times, including on 9 february, 28 march, 24 april, 13 june, 11 september, 7 november 2018 and 11 february 2019. the reasons for extending his detention were similar to those mentioned in paragraphs 8, 10 and 11 above. it appears from the relevant decisions that the courts did not address the above-mentioned arguments. according to the available information, between september and november 2017 an ambulance was called ten times to provide the applicant with urgent treatment or to take him outside the sizo. on 8 september 2017 the applicant was discharged from the hospital and returned to the sizo with medical prescriptions and recommendations for further treatment. his medical condition was assessed as being of medium gravity. in a further recommendation of 2 october 2017 the neurologist stated that a lack of adequate medical treatment could result in another intracerebral hemorrhage and disability. the neurologist also stated that by 13 september 2017 the applicant had needed further examinations and treatment at a medical facility specialising in neurology, in order to specify the further treatment to be prescribed. in the course of the court hearing on 21 september 2017 the applicant felt unwell. he was recommended further supervision by a neurologist and sent back to the sizo. on the same day the district court ordered the kyiv sizo administration to ensure that the applicant underwent an urgent forensic examination. the parties did not inform the court whether that order had been implemented. on 29 september and 10 october 2017 the applicant consulted a neurologist, who prescribed him medication and massage of the limbs of the left side of the body. on 29 december 2017 the sizo administration informed the applicant’s defence lawyer that the sizo had no cardiologist or rehabilitation physician on its staff. medical treatment for those suffering from cardiac diseases was provided by a therapist. in their opinion of 2 february 2018 the forensic experts concluded that the applicant was suffering from cerebrovascular disease, acute stroke (3 september 2017), discirculatory encephalopathy, and third-degree hypertension. on the same day the trial court allowed that application and ordered the applicant’s transfer to a relevant medical facility of the applicant’s choice and at his or his relatives’ expense. on 11 may 2018 the sizo authorities informed the applicant’s defence lawyer that his client’s transfer for treatment would be possible if he presented relevant documentation confirming the readiness of the medical facility in question to admit the applicant for treatment. the lawyer was further informed that the applicant was being provided with symptomatic treatment at the sizo. a number of tests and examinations were carried out and medication was prescribed. on 5 july 2018 the applicant was recognised as a person suffering from a category 2 disability. the second category is the intermediary one, the first constituting the severest level of disability and the third the least severe. the applicant was also recommended rehabilitation treatment.
the first, second and third applicants were born in 1981, 1973 and 1984 respectively. since 2004 they have been serving life sentences in correctional colonies in ukraine. on 11 july 2003 the ukrainian parliament adopted the code on the execution of sentences of ukraine (“the code”). article 150 of the code (“place of serving life imprisonment”) provided that life prisoners were to serve their sentences in maximum-security correctional colonies. article 151 (“procedure for, and conditions of, the execution and serving of life sentences”) further provided, inter alia, that life prisoners were entitled to one short visit every six months. no reference to prisoners’ gender was made in those articles. at the same time, article 18 (“correctional colonies”) provided that female life prisoners were to serve their sentences in medium-security colonies. in turn, article 139 (“medium-security correctional colonies”) provided that prisoners serving their sentences in such colonies were entitled, inter alia, to have one short visit every month and one long visit every three months. article 110 specified that a short visit from relatives or other persons could last for up to four hours and a long visit from close relatives could last for up to three days. by a letter of 27 june 2007 the state department of ukraine for the execution of sentences informed the second applicant, in reply to a letter sent by him on an earlier date, that female life prisoners were entitled to have one long visit every three months, as provided by article 139 of the code, given that they served their sentences in medium-security colonies, as provided by article 18 of the code. referring, in particular, to article 151 of the code, the department further stated that male life prisoners were entitled to have one short visit every six months and that they were not entitled to have long visits. on 21 january 2010 the code was amended (“the 2010 amendments”). article 150, as amended, stated that persons sentenced to life imprisonment were to serve their sentences as follows: male prisoners ‑ either in maximum-security sectors of medium-security correctional colonies or in maximum-security correctional colonies; and female prisoners – either in medium-security sectors of minimum-security correctional colonies with general conditions of detention or in medium-security correctional colonies. article 151, as amended, stated that life prisoners were entitled to one short visit every three months. a newly introduced article 151² (“specifics regarding the serving of sentences by female life prisoners”) provided that female life prisoners were to be placed, as a rule, in medium-security sectors of minimum-security colonies with general conditions of detention. it also provided that female life prisoners were to be subject to the regime laid down for prisoners held in medium‑security colonies (that is, the regime provided for in article 139 of the code). by the law of 8 april 2014 on the introduction of amendments to the code relating to the adaptation of status of convicted persons to european standards the code was amended again (“the 2014 amendments”). article 151 was amended to entitle all life prisoners to one short visit every month and one long visit every three months regardless of the type of correctional colony in which they were detained or the security regime to which they were subject. further amendments to article 151 of the code, which were passed by parliament on 7 september 2016, entitled all life prisoners to one long visit every two months. the first applicant stated that he and his family had wished to maintain their relationships, but as the result of the absence of the right to long visits until 2014 he had had to divorce his wife. his father, grandfather and grandmother had died in 2008, 2009 and 2014 respectively and he had not been able to see them while serving his sentence. the government submitted that while serving his sentence the first applicant had received twenty-eight short visits on unspecified dates and fifteen long visits (between 17 march 2015 and 6 july 2018) from his new wife, mother and his other grandmother. the second applicant stated that, because of the lack of the opportunity to have long visits until 2014, he had lost contact with his family. his relatives had died – in particular he referred to his father having died in 2012 – and when the 2014 amendments entitled him to long visits, there had no longer been anyone to visit him. the government submitted that while serving his sentence the second applicant had had one short visit in 2005 (from his sister) and had not requested any long visits. the third applicant stated that, in the absence of the right to long visits until 2014, his right to found a family had been more declaratory than effective as, in particular, he had not been able to have any physical contact in order to conceive children. the government submitted that while serving his sentence the third applicant had had twelve short visits (between 25 july 2012 and 26 december 2017) and fourteen long visits (between 5 august 2014 and 6 february 2018) from his wife, mother, father and friends.
the applicant was born in 1980 and lives in skopje. an albanian national who had been in the passenger seat, was injured. was taken to hospital, where he was interviewed by the police. with photographs of potential suspects, from which he identified the applicant as the person who had fired at him and f.n. subsequent to the search, the applicant was arrested. identified the applicant as the perpetrator. according to the record of the examination, the applicant’s lawyer had agreed to the interview taking place in his absence. stated that he had been asked to work on f.n. on 30 september 2005 the trial court requested that the ministry of justice (“the ministry”) summon j.t. via diplomatic means, as he had returned to albania. at a hearing held on 22 november 2005 the applicant testified. he was disoriented and claimed to have no knowledge of the murder. given the severity of his condition, the expert expressed concerns about how the applicant could have arrived at the place of the crime, which was located some 8-9 kilometres from his house (не би можела да тврдам како се случило да се оддалечи). at the same hearing two of the applicant’s neighbours testified. on 23 november 2005 the trial court sent another summons to j.t. there was no information as to whether he had received the summons. on the same day the trial court requested information regarding the summons of 23 november 2005. the ministry responded that it had forwarded the summons to the albanian authorities and that the trial court should allow more time between hearings to ensure a timely delivery of the summons. a hearing scheduled for 14 march 2006 was postponed owing to the absence of j.t., the trial judge sent another summons to j.t. in the period between june 2006 and december 2007. one summons was not delivered to him until after the hearing had taken place. he was properly summoned for another hearing, but he did not appear. on a hearing dated 29 january 2008, the trial court admitted into evidence the statement that j.t. had given before the investigating judge, stating that it had made numerous attempts to secure his attendance. had been properly served with several summonses, but had failed to appear. in view of the above, it ruled that there were justified reasons to admit his statement into evidence. failing that, a judgment could not be based merely on his statement. the identification parade and the fact that j.t. had identified the applicant from the photographs.
on 7 july 2000 the applicant company and the ukrvuglegeologiya state company (“the uvg”), an administrative entity of the ministry of fuel and energy of ukraine represented by its own administrative entity, the sevastopol‑based izumrud recreation centre (“the irc”), concluded a ten‑year rental agreement, under which the applicant company rented bedroom block no. subsequently, the applicant company and the irc concluded an additional agreement under which the former undertook to repair block no. in turn, the latter sought approval from the ministry, which in a letter of 6 august 2003 stated that it did not object. by a decision of 8 december 2003 the fund included block no. 3 in the list of property to be subjected to privatisation. on 26 december 2003 the fund’s sevastopol office adopted a decision to privatise block no. this sum represented the block’s market value minus the value of the repairs made to it by the applicant company (uah 375,295), as established in an expert report prepared on 30 november 2003 by the i. company at the office’s request. according to the applicant company, despite the above-mentioned contract, the uvg retained block no. moreover, in 2005 the block was disconnected from the irc’s electricity and water supplies. 3 from its books and to reconnect it to the irc’s networks. in turn, the uvg lodged a counterclaim against the applicant company and the fund’s sevastopol office, seeking the invalidation of the contract of 26 december 2003, alleging that the irc and block no. 3 had not been eligible for privatisation. 3, having obtained title to it following its privatisation, which had not been declared invalid. 3 was privatised not as an “integral property complex” (цілісний майновий комплекс) but as an “individually determined immovable property” (індивідуально визначене майно – об’єкт нерухомості) which, in accordance with the law, could be privatised; and that (3) the uvg had failed to prove that block no. on 23 august 2006 the supreme court refused to allow an appeal by the uvg against the decision of 21 june 2006. they sent a letter to the donetsk regional commercial court, asking it to clarify how the judgment of 1 february 2006 was to be enforced. it appears that they did not receive any reply and accordingly stayed the enforcement proceedings. on 24 april 2007 the irc state enterprise lodged a request with the donetsk regional commercial court for a review of the judgment of 1 february 2006 under a procedure relating to newly discovered circumstances. referring to findings made in the judgment of 13 october 2006, it considered that the judgment of 1 february 2006 had lost its legal effect and asked the court to quash it. in september 2006 the irc state enterprise lodged a claim with the sevastopol city commercial court against the fund’s sevastopol office and the applicant company, seeking the invalidation of the contract of 26 december 2003. by a judgment of 13 october 2006, the court partly allowed the claim. it stated that the uvg, a geological-service enterprise, was a company of national importance. it thus belonged to the category of state property that had not been eligible for privatisation. at the moment of conclusion of the contract of 26 december 2003, block no. 3 had been part of the uvg’s integral property complex. the irc was a structural unit of the uvg and its property could not be privatised. therefore, the fund’s inclusion of block no. the court thus invalidated the contract of 26 december 2003, ordered the applicant company to return block no. on 10 november 2006 the sevastopol commercial court of appeal upheld the above judgment. as to the applicant company’s objections, it stated that it was the irc state enterprise, and not the uvg, which should have been the proper respondent (counterclaimant) in the case when the judgment of 1 february 2006 was adopted, and that the applicant company had failed to prove that the same dispute with the irc state enterprise had already been decided by the courts.
the present case concerns criminal proceedings against the applicant, who was minister of defence in the period between july 2000 and may 2001, and three other defendants (k.gj., in february 2001, the company was bought by lj.p. the applicant’s father-in-law and brother-in-law respectively. in spring 2001 an armed conflict broke out in the respondent state. on an unspecified date in 2001, an investigating judge of the skopje court of first instance (основен суд скопје – “the trial court”) opened an investigation in respect of the applicant, k.gj., because of a reasonable suspicion of abuse of office. several witnesses were examined and a forensic accounting report was commissioned. on 11 june 2001 the investigating judge heard evidence from k.k., on 18 june 2001 the investigating judge heard evidence from the applicant, who denied the charges against him. solely in the presence of the public prosecutor. he denied any personal acquaintance with the applicant and stated that lj.p. had asked him to make a bid to supply food to the ministry. had signed the contracts on behalf of the company, although he had not authorised him to represent the company. were indicted on charges of abuse of office and lj.p. were charged with inciting them to commit the offence. throughout these proceedings he maintained his innocence. he maintained that the procurement process had been conducted through the ministry’s administration (стручни служби) and the undersecretary, that he had not been informed of the details of individual contracts and that the two contracts had been lawfully concluded. he insisted that had been unaware that his relatives had owned the company. maintained that the two contracts had been concluded in accordance with the law as they had been exempt from the regular process under the public procurement act for the following reasons: the food contract had concerned urgent procurement; and the construction contract had concerned issues of security and defence. maintained that the takeover of the company had been mutually agreed. at a hearing held on 11 september 2003 the trial court, despite the objections of the defence, read out z.s. lastly, all relevant facts needed to be established regarding the execution of the two contracts, including the existence of any objective difficulties in this regard. ’s authorisation to represent the company and z.s. ’s address abroad had been known and the trial court could have summoned him through diplomatic channels. at the same hearing, the court admitted documentary evidence, including: financial and other documents related to the company; official documents from the ministry related to the procurement process and the two contracts; and several letters from the ministry sent in reply to enquiries made by the trial court. they proposed that further documentary evidence be taken into evidence, including the full case file from the ministry regarding the contracts. as to the construction contract, the court found that there had been neither a legal framework governing the construction of military housing on the site of the base, nor a clear decision or plan for the particular location, which suggested that the defendants’ choice of location had been aimed at circumventing the public-procurement rules. who confirmed his involvement with the impugned contracts (see paragraphs 8 and 14 above). it found that all relevant facts had been correctly established and that the trial court had complied with its instructions. it considered that the refused evidence, which had mostly concerned the inability to execute the construction contract, had been irrelevant for the case.
the applicant was born in 1938 and lives in yalta, the autonomous republic of crimea. the flat had one room and measured 37.5 sq. on 22 september 2005 the executive committee of the yalta city council (“the executive committee”) approved a report on the examination of the pushkinska building issued by an interdepartmental commission set up by the executive committee. the report suggested that the building was in poor technical condition with its carrying walls unsafe. the council and the executive committee further undertook to take measures to evict the applicant from the dangerous building, to authorise the company to demolish the pushkinska building, and to grant a construction permit. the agreement was approved by the council during its 19 october 2005 session. according to the applicant she was not aware of the agreement at the time. no copy of the plan has been made available to the court. m, had two rooms and was located away from yalta city centre. the council and the executive committee refused to take the apartment into municipal ownership. on 31 may 2007 the executive committee passed a decision by which it, inter alia, offered the sosnova flat to the applicant. on 17 july 2007 the executive committee applied to the yalta city court to have the applicant evicted and her title to the pushkinska flat terminated, her moved to the sosnova flat and her property rights over the latter flat established. it relied on articles 109, 110 and 112 of the housing code and articles 321 § 2 of the civil code as the legal grounds for the claim (see paragraphs 31 and 32 below). on 4 october 2007 the yalta city court allowed the executive committee’s application. on 4 april 2008 the council joined the proceedings as a co-plaintiff and supported the executive committee’s claims. it annulled the applicant’s title to the pushkinska flat, ordered her eviction and rehousing in the sosnova flat and vested her with the title to the latter flat. it had more rooms and space than the pushkinska flat and was in an appropriate condition and in the same city. the applicant appealed, stating, inter alia, that the deprivation of her property was unlawful. article 346 § 2 of the civil code was a reference provision which specified that a property right could be terminated in “other cases provided for by the law” but the court had failed to specify any legal provision providing for this “other case”. even assuming that the building was in poor structural condition, no proper decision existed suggesting that it would be subject to demolition. she argued that her property thus would remain extant. the applicant further alleged that she, as the owner of the pushkinska flat, had not been involved in any way in choosing the form of the compensation for her flat. the offered flat had not been of the same value as the pushkinska flat and had not compensated her in full for her losses. she referred to the location of the sosnova flat, the impossibility to profit from renting it out, and its poor general condition. in support, she provided an expert report, which stated that the building at no. the applicant also disputed the fairness of the calculations used by the first-instance court, referring to the fact that, just before the pushkinska building had been declared dangerous, the company had bought several flats from the applicant’s neighbours, which had been in poor condition, for very high prices – much higher than the building price referred to by the council. lastly, she argued that she could not have property rights over the sosnova flat imposed on her against her will. on 17 june 2008 the court of appeal upheld the judgment of 9 april 2008. the applicant was unsuccessful in her attempts to reopen the proceedings under newly discovered and exceptional circumstances. in 2018, in her comments on the government’s observations, the applicant informed the court that the building at 1 pushkinska street had not been demolished but renovated, with an additional floor added on top, and had been converted into a privately owned hotel.
the applicants were born in 1976, 1972, 1976, 1970 and 1976 respectively. the applicants were secondary school teachers in a private chain of schools in moldova called orizont, which has been in operation since 1993. mr yasin ozdil had lived in moldova since 2015 with his wife and their two minor children. mr riza dogan had lived in moldova since 1993 with his wife and their two minor children, who are moldovan citizens. mr sedat hasan karacaoglu had lived in moldova since 1998 with his wife. all the applicants had valid residence permits for moldova. during the night of 15 to 16 july 2016 a group of members of the turkish armed forces calling themselves the “peace at home council” attempted to carry out a military coup aimed at overthrowing the democratically elected parliament, government and president of turkey. several criminal investigations were subsequently initiated by the appropriate prosecuting authorities in relation to suspected members of that organisation. in may 2017 the turkish prime minister visited moldova and requested from his moldovan counterpart the shutdown of the orizont schools. on 10 april 2018 the charges against the principal of the chişinău orizont secondary school were dropped and the investigation was discontinued. on 5 may 2018 the applicants wrote to the competent authorities in moldova and asked for information on whether there were any pending criminal investigations concerning them. in a letter dated 13 june 2018 the prosecutor’s office specialising in organised crime wrote to the applicants, stating that there were no pending criminal investigations involving them. on 6 september 2018 in the morning, seven teachers from the orizont schools – among them the applicants – were arrested in their homes or on their way to work by individuals wearing plain clothes and taken to an unknown destination. on the same day the turkish media reported that the turkish secret service had conducted a successful operation in moldova, during which seven members of the fethullah gülen movement had been arrested. they expected the applicants to be taken to turkey by the scheduled flight leaving later in the day. the fate of the applicants, and even whether they were still in moldova, remained unknown to their families for several weeks. the moldovan authorities refrained from communicating any information about them either to their families or to the press. on 7 september 2018, the head of the bma, o.p., stated in an interview that the authority had not been involved in the case of the seven orizont teachers and that the procedure for declaring them undesirable and removing them from moldova had not been carried out by the bma. the decisions contained a thorough analysis of the manner in which the gülen movement followers had been treated in turkey and concluded that the applicants’ fear of reprisals at the hands of the turkish authorities were justified. the bma concluded that the applicants fulfilled the legal requirements to be granted asylum in moldova. the applicants were given fifteen days to leave the country and they were entitled to challenge the decisions within thirty days. the letters accompanying the decisions were posted on 7 and 10 september 2018 and were signed by the head of the bma, o.p. several days after the applicants’ arrest and transfer to turkey their families also received from the bma decisions dated 5 september 2018, banning the applicants from entering moldovan territory for a period of five years and ordering their expulsion under supervision from moldova by the bma in accordance with section 58 of the status of aliens act (see paragraph 27 below). however, their actions were dismissed on the grounds that the powers of attorney had not been signed by the applicants themselves. the court decisions were challenged before the hierarchically superior court but without any success. on 15 october 2018 the european parliament made public a report on the implementation of the eu association agreement with moldova (2017/2281(ini)). in its report, the european parliament issued a statement in which it expressed itself in the following terms on the manner in which the applicants had been transferred from turkey:
“29. amnesty international also made a statement in relation to the deportation of the seven orizont teachers to turkey. forcible return of those seeking protection in moldova is a flagrant violation of moldova’s international human rights obligations.
the applicant was born in 1963 and lives in elbasan, albania. to four years’ imprisonment for attempted murder. on 2 december 2010 the shkodër court of appeal upheld the shkodër district court’s decision. on 3 february 2011 the latter decision was executed and sh.p. was sent to serve his prison sentence in the lezhë detention facility. it appears that on 22 february 2011 sh.p. died in the intensive care unit of tirana university hospital. on the same day, the judicial police officer seized sh.p’s medical file (sekuestroi kartelën klinike) kept at tirana university hospital centre. and put the following questions to the forensic medical experts:
“1. on 22 february 2011 the applicant was questioned as a person with knowledge of the event. he stated that his family members had informed him that his brother was being sent to lezhë detention facility. on 17 february 2011 his mother had told him that his brother had fallen ill and was being transferred to the hospital in tirana. when he had arrived at the hospital he had found his brother unconscious and tied to the bed with the sheets. he had noticed that the mattress and the blankets were wet and that the area around the bed was very dirty. he added that he wanted to know the cause of his brother’s death. had been transferred to that facility on 9 february 2011. ’s file from the lezhë detention facility. on 10 march 2011, the prosecutor in charge of the case ordered a series of investigative actions to be carried out by a judicial police officer:
“(1)  to contact forensic experts who would carry out a forensic examination to find out the cause of death of the deceased; (2)  to seize the criminal and medical files of sh.p. and (5)  to carry out any other action which might be deemed necessary before 29 march 2011.” had been diagnosed with multi-organ insufficiency and morbid obesity. had been transferred to tirana prison hospital from lezhë prison hospital. he had been treated like any other patient and the treatment prescribed had been administered in accordance with the rules. on 30 march 2011 a group of forensic experts carried out an examination of sh.p. two ecchymoses were noticed on both forearms. was a result of acute cardio-respiratory insufficiency due to complications of the generalised metabolic illness of the deceased ... 5. with regard to the question whether sh.p. had been the result of acute respiratory and cardiac insufficiency and other diseases. on 17 may 2011, the applicant lodged a complaint with the tirana district court against the decision of the tirana prosecutor’s office. on 23 january 2014 the supreme court rejected an appeal lodged by the applicant. on an unspecified date the applicant lodged a complaint with the tirana district court about the above-mentioned decision.
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in piaski. it stipulated that she was to pay to the claimant, a certain d.k., the sum of 156,000 polish zlotys (pln), equivalent to 36,000 euros (eur). she challenged that basis for the payment order and considered it illegal and unfounded. she further applied for exemption from the court fees. on 13 july 2011 a court officer from the koszalin regional court (referendarz sądowy) decided to partly exempt her from the fees. the court examined in detail the financial situation of the applicant. in particular it noted that in 2010 her company had generated a gross income of pln 213,000; however, the expenses exceeded this sum by approximately pln 50,000. the court agreed that her financial situation had been difficult and that she had not initiated the current proceedings. moreover, the applicant had declared a net income for the first four months of 2011. in an extensively reasoned decision the domestic court concluded that the applicant should be expected to pay one third of the fees due for lodging an appeal against the payment order. she reiterated that her business had generated losses and that she had been financially dependent on her family. the applicant stressed that she had not instituted the civil proceedings, so could not prepare for their costs or limit the sum claimed. on 3 august 2011 the koszalin regional court upheld the decision of the court officer. the applicant was ordered to pay pln 1,928 (eur 500) within seven days. on 22 august 2011 the applicant’s lawyer lodged a second request for exemption from the court fees. having examined all the arguments relied on by the applicant, the court considered that the situation did not justify a total exemption from the court fees. the applicant did not appeal against this decision. on 29 september 2011 the applicant lodged a third request for exemption from the court fees. she submitted that her financial situation had not improved and that she had no income whatsoever. moreover her car broke down which generated further costs. on 26 october 2011 the koszalin regional court rejected the applicant’s appeal against the payment order of 2 may 2011 and rejected her third application for full exemption from the court fees as it had been substantially the same as the one lodged before and examined on 26 august 2011. on 10 november 2011 the applicant appealed against the decision of 26 october 2011. she was ordered to pay a court fee of pln 1,500 for pursuing her appeal. she requested the court to exempt her from that fee. on 22 december 2011 the court partly granted her request. the applicant was ordered to pay a court fee in the amount of pln 1,000. the decision was delivered to the applicant on 10 april 2012. it appears that around that time the applicant took up employment. during that period the applicant unsuccessfully attempted to have the proceedings stayed.
the applicant was born in 1990 and lives in stalowa wola. part of the group, including the applicant, moved on to a different spot. found those members of the group and proceeded to arrest them. according to the applicant, he was also punched in the face by one of the police officers during the arrest. according to the government, this allegation was not confirmed during the investigation. he was subsequently beaten by another officer with a truncheon. according to the government, the applicant was taken to a separate room without cctv in order for a body search to be carried out. however, he continued to resist, and was aggressive and vulgar towards the officers. were charged with resisting lawful arrest and insulting police officers in the performance of their duty. on 22 november 2013 an act of indictment was lodged with the stalowa wola district court. on 28 may 2014 the stalowa wola district court gave its judgment. the applicant was convicted of insulting and using violence against the two police officers, k.p and d.z. from the proceedings described in paragraphs 15-17 above. while, in his opinion, the injury had occurred earlier than the applicant had alleged, there was no medical documentation in this respect. on 31 october 2013 a visual technology expert prepared a report. there was no footage of him limping before entering the room. on 12 november 2013 the prosecutor questioned dr m.b., one of the doctors who had treated the applicant in stalowa wola district hospital on 26 june 2013. the joint had not been swollen and there had been no accumulation of fluid. he had not had any visible injuries on his face or hands. he had resisted the officers while leaving his cell and had continued to behave aggressively towards them. had been detained on charges of resisting lawful arrest and insulting police officers. the prosecutor also established that on 26 june 2013 the applicant had been admitted to stalowa wola district hospital, where he had complained of bruising to his thigh and a knee sprain. he had been discharged on the following day. the prosecutor acknowledged that the police officers had used force against the applicant as he had been aggressive during the arrest, but he had not been beaten by the police officers whilst at stalowa wola district police station. he concluded that the use of force against the applicant had been necessary, in view of his aggressive behaviour. he further relied on the report prepared by the visual technology expert who had analysed the cctv footage and noted that his injury could have occurred in the room without cctv (while he had been searched). although they all agreed that the applicant had been beaten by police officers in the car and at the police station, they had not been able to give a consistent version of events. in so far as the applicant had referred to the visual technology expert’s report, the court noted that, even if the applicant had begun limping after leaving the room where the body search had taken place, the possibility that his knee injury had occurred earlier on and that he had only begun to feel pain in that leg at a later stage could not be excluded. also, the medical opinion had not been explicit in this respect, since the applicant suffered from chronic instability of the knee, and the swelling might have resulted from the resistance he had demonstrated while getting into the police car.
the applicant was born in 1973 and lives in vinkovci. on 19 september 1998 the applicant married d.m., she submitted, inter alia, that their marital union had de facto ended in march 2007 when the applicant had moved to vukovar. the applicant requested that he be granted temporary custody. on 3 july 2008 the sesvete municipal court issued a first interim custody and contact order, awarding temporary custody to the mother and contact rights to the applicant. on 15 october 2009 the municipal court issued a third interim contact order, awarding the applicant contact rights to be exercised two hours every wednesday, every second weekend and every second public holiday. in january 2011, at the request of the sesvete social welfare centre, the court ordered an expert assessment of the parties, taking into account the growing resistance of the child to contacts with his father. and the child refused to undertake the court-ordered assessment. on 12 october 2012 the sesvete municipal court rendered a judgment awarding custody rights to the mother and contact rights to the applicant. the relevant part of that judgment reads as follows:
“the child is eleven and a half years old and, notwithstanding the significance of the mother’s influence on his development (concerning the father’s allegations of manipulation), he leaves the impression of a boy standing firmly behind his beliefs and attitudes, who expresses his will openly and clearly ...
the child wishes to live with his mother and to spend a maximum of two hours on saturdays with his father, without supervision, as his weekly schedule is full of school and music assignments. he uses the court to ask his parents to do everything they can in order to bring the court proceedings to an end. he refused to talk to the father or to her, and showed resistance towards them.

the applicant company, virprod-lux s.r.l., on 13 april 2000 the tax authority seized a building from a state‑owned company, company v., on account of taxes which were due. on 1 october 2000, at the request of the tax authority, the building was valued by an estate agency at 352,000 moldovan lei (mdl). on 29 january 2001 the department of privatisation and administration of state property sold the building in question to company b. for mdl 360,500 (approximately 29,678 euros (eur), following a public auction. on 25 april 2003 the applicant company bought the building from company b. for mdl 628,000 (approximately eur 22,053). on 29 march 2007 the prosecutor general’s office initiated court proceedings in which it sought the annulment of both the sale of the building on 29 january 2001 and the subsequent transaction between company b. and the applicant company. it also sought the return of the building to its initial owner, company v. the reason relied upon by the prosecutor’s general’s office was that the valuation of the building conducted by the estate agency had not been carried out in accordance with the provisions of the law. the applicant company opposed the prosecutor general’s action and argued, among other things, that it was time-barred. on 21 august 2007 the economic court of appeal dismissed the prosecutor general’s action as time-barred. the court held, inter alia, that in accordance with the statute of limitations, the prosecutor general’s action could not be initiated more than three years after the events in dispute had taken place. on 11 october 2007 the supreme court of justice upheld an appeal by the prosecutor general, reversed the judgment of the economic court of appeal, and upheld the action in its entirety. the supreme court considered that the prosecutor general’s action concerned a declaration of the absolute nullity of the contracts in question and that therefore, in accordance with article 217 of the civil code, enacted on 12 june 2003, it could not be limited in time. following this judgment, the transactions of 29 january 2001 and 25 april 2003 were annulled and each party involved was ordered to return to the other parties whatever they received by virtue of those transactions. on 7 december 2007 the applicant company lodged a revision request against the above judgment in which it indicated that it had carried out an expert evaluation of the disputed building by an independent expert who determined its value at mdl 8,550,000 (approximately eur 511,440) after the improvements made by the applicant company to it. in the meantime, the applicant company did not leave the disputed building because it had its production line there and it needed time and resources to find another suitable building and to move its production line. since company v. did not need the disputed building, the applicant company proposed to it and the latter accepted to conclude a friendly settlement agreement in accordance with which company v. agreed that the applicant company would retain ownership of the building in exchange for mdl 325,092 (approximately eur 19,328). on 20 march 2008, within the framework of the review proceedings, the supreme court of justice upheld the parties’ request to settle the case. it confirmed the friendly settlement agreement between the applicant company and company v., and on that basis it quashed its previous judgment and rejected the prosecutor general’s action. it is unclear from the materials of the case and the parties’ submissions whether after the adoption of the judgment of 11 october 2007 by the supreme court of justice, company b. returned to the applicant company the amount received as a result of the transaction of 25 april 2003.
the applicants, who were born in 1980 and 1977, respectively, live in slobozia and parcani, in the self-proclaimed “moldovan republic of transdniestria” (“mrt”). in view of the fact that, in the applicants’ submission, it was impossible for them to apply to the court directly, the application was lodged by their mothers. on 2 march 2005 the applicants were arrested by the “mrt” authorities and placed in detention on remand on suspicion of murder. on 1 june 2009 they were convicted by an “mrt” court and sentenced to terms of fourteen years and a half, and fourteen years’ imprisonment, respectively. on 4 august 2009 the supreme court of the “mrt” upheld the above judgment, but reduced the sentence of the first applicant to fourteen years’ imprisonment. it does not appear from the material in the case file and from the parties’ submissions that the applicants informed the authorities of the republic of moldova about the proceedings against them and the conviction and detention in the “mrt”. in december 2014 the applicants challenged their conviction by way of an extraordinary appeal before the supreme court of the republic of moldova which, on 14 february 2015, upheld their appeal and quashed the judgments of the “mrt” courts on the ground that they had been issued by unconstitutional tribunals. the applicants were released from detention on 20 july and 20 august 2015, respectively, for reasons which were not related to the supreme court of moldova’s decision of 14 february 2015.
according to the applicants, in the period from 20 may to 6 july 2010 they participated in obstructive protest activities against a road-construction project, in particular tree-felling, in gorky park (парк ім. on 10 september 2008 the city council allocated land for the road construction to the municipal construction department. on 27 april 2010 a commission of municipal officials examined the trees which had to be felled in order to allow the road construction and drew up a detailed list of the trees, including their varieties, ages, diameters and state of health. on 19 may 2010 the executive committee of the kharkiv city council (the municipality’s executive authority, “the executive committee”) authorised the felling of 503 trees in gorky park. on 29 may it asked the chief of police of the then dzerzhinsky (presently shevchenkivsky) district, where gorky park is located (hereinafter “the district”), to ensure public order on the construction site, referring to an incident the previous day in which, according to the company, unidentified people had interfered with the construction work, shouted profanities at the workers and tried to provoke a fight. according to the applicants, there were “hundreds” of protesters. three individuals are surrounding a tree and facing the police. the following alleged incidents are of particular note. they appear to be pulling some protesters away from an area they are attempting to protect. in the course of that action, the third applicant was closely approached by two loggers, subsequently identified as a. and k., employees of one of the subcontractors. one of them nearly injured the third applicant. by the time the police have arrived, the protesters have been moved away from the crossing and are surrounded by the people with badges, in a tight circle, but are still within the marked-off area. several are seen dragging their feet and arguing. eventually, the area previously occupied by the protesters is cleared and an excavator moves through it. he had not heard any warnings to leave the site. on 28 may 2010 the cases against the first and second applicants were sent to court. the second version states that the applicant had been present at the construction site in gorky park, had refused to leave despite repeated warnings from police officers, and had struggled when police officers had attempted to escort him out of the area. he had seen many people in the place where trees were being felled and had gone closer. the court of appeal found that the case-file material showed that the police officers had acted lawfully in directing the applicants to leave the construction site. on 8 june and 12 july 2010 the district court discontinued proceedings against the eight and tenth applicants. concerning the tenth applicant, the court likewise pointed to inconsistencies between various police reports in the case file and the lack of evidence that the officers had duly instructed him to leave. on 6 july 2010 the sixth applicant was arrested and charged with malicious insubordination in the face of orders given by police officers to leave the construction site. at the hearing the police officers supported the charges. on 2 july 2010 the regional environmental protection department issued a positive environmental impact assessment (висновок державної екологічної експертизи) of the road construction project. on 28 may 2010, after having being rebuked by mr kl., those individuals had taken the badges off. following an additional round of pre-investigation enquiries, on 9 august 2010 the prosecutor’s office decided not to institute criminal proceedings against loggers a. and k., managers of the main contractor and subcontractor companies, mg, the city council or its executive authorities, including the municipal construction department, for lack of constituent elements of a crime in their actions. on 25 october 2011 the applicants appealed against the decision of 9 august 2010. on 9 december 2011 the kharkiv administrative court of appeal upheld that decision. on 26 june 2014 the high administrative court allowed an appeal lodged by the applicants and remitted the case to the first-instance court for re-examination on the grounds that the lower courts’ examination of the facts had been incomplete.
the applicant was born in 1961 and lives in corjova. he had his car registered with the authorities of the republic of moldova and had moldovan registration plates installed on it. on 16 december 2006 a customs officer of the self-proclaimed “moldovan republic of transdniestria” (“mrt”) stopped the applicant at a check‑point and seized his car on the ground that upon entry on the territory of transdniestria he had failed to stop at the border. he was later obliged to pay a fine of 58 united states dollars in order to recover the car. on 19 december 2006 the applicant’s driving licence was seized on the ground that he had failed to comply with traffic rules. his car was also seized, on the ground of his failure to comply with customs regulations, but the seizure report was destroyed and he was able to recover his car five hours later after the intervention of a group of russian peacekeepers. his driving licence was not returned and he was issued a temporary driving licence. according to the applicant, he complained to the authorities of moldova, but they informed him that there was nothing they could help him with. the moldovan government disputed the fact that the applicant had informed them about the circumstances of the present case. reports by inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations, the relevant domestic law and practice of the republic of moldova, and other pertinent documents were summarised in mozer v. the republic of moldova and russia ([gc], no.
the applicant was born in 1977 and lives in vantaa, finland. in 2009 the applicant married a russian national, ms i.k., had a temporary residence permit (expired in summer 2015). gave birth to a daughter, v. the parents exercised joint custody in respect of the child, in accordance with finnish law. she had not, however, fully recovered mobility in one hand and one leg. apparently deteriorated, and in june 2013 i.k. travelled to russia, accompanied by her father, for further medical treatment and physiotherapy. should have joint custody of v. and that the latter should reside with the applicant. in taking that decision the district court took into account i.k. the judgment was enforceable pending a decision in appeal proceedings. on 26 february 2016 the supreme court refused i.k. took v. to russia without the applicant’s consent. since the finnish court had determined that the parties should have joint custody of the child and had set out a detailed schedule of i.k. however, on 3 february 2016 the st petersburg city court (“the city court”) quashed the above judgment on appeal and rejected the applicant’s request for v.’s return to finland. ’s consent; and finally that v. did not speak finnish and since february 2015 had been attending various medical facilities and nursery school in russia. lastly, the city court noted that the report of the ombudsman for children in st petersburg stated that both parents had parental authority in respect of v., that the applicant’s rights were not diminished on the territory of the russian federation, and that the removal of the child from her mother in russia to her father in finland for the purposes of permanent residence in finland could, on account of her numerous medical conditions, cause her physical harm. on 12 may 2016 a judge of the st petersburg city court refused to refer the case for consideration by the presidium of that court. in st petersburg and ordered the applicant to pay child maintenance starting from 8 june 2015. on 5 october 2016 enforcement proceedings were instituted against the applicant. as of 13 february 2018 the applicant’s child maintenance arrears amounted to 494,644 russian roubles (rub)[1]. the applicant has not seen his daughter since she left finland. however ... it has to be admitted that the removal of the child can sometimes be justified by objective reasons which have to do either with its person, or with the environment with which it is most closely connected. therefore the convention recognizes the need for certain exceptions to the general obligations assumed by states to secure the prompt return of children who have been unlawfully removed or retained.” ... from the convention’s standpoint, the removal of a child by one of the joint holders without the consent of the other, is equally wrongful, and this wrongfulness derives in this particular case, not from some action in breach of a particular law, but from the fact that such action has disregarded the rights of the other parent which are also protected by law, and has interfered with their normal exercise. ... the exceptions [in articles 13 and 20] do not apply automatically, in that they do not invariably result in the child’s retention; nevertheless, the very nature of these exceptions gives judges a discretion – and does not impose upon them a duty – to refuse to return a child in certain circumstances. the exceptions contained in [article 13] (b) deal with situations where international child abduction has indeed occurred, but where the return of the child would be contrary to its interests ... each of the terms used in this provision, is the result of a fragile compromise reached during the deliberations of the special commission and has been kept unaltered. in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. the child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth ... to know and be cared for by his or her parents. states parties shall ensure that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will. the best interests of the child will be their basic concern.
the applicant was born in 1965 and lives in ștefan-vodă. in 2007 the applicant was charged with trafficking in human beings, together with another co-accused, b. in particular, he was charged with the attempt to organise the transfer of s. to a foreign country for the purpose of sexual exploitation. b. admitted her guilt and declared that she had had an arrangement with the applicant to transfer s. to turkey for the purpose of sexual exploitation. she said that s.’s passport had been kept by the applicant so that he could prepare the documents necessary for s.’s transfer. she said the applicant had promised her money for this and that she had received an advance payment. had informed her about b.’s intention to transfer her to cyprus for the purpose of sexual exploitation. it had been upon learning this that she had gone to the police. stated that she had been the landlord who had rented her apartment to b. and that s. and c.t. she said that b. had told her about her arrangement with the applicant to transfer s. to turkey, that the applicant had intended to take care of all the formalities and that he had promised a reward for each woman she had found who could be moved to turkey for the purpose of prostitution. a witness, declared that she had shared the apartment with b. and that the latter had not told her about any intention to transfer s. to turkey, but that she had intended to find employment for s. in russia or ukraine. during the court proceedings, she denied having told s. about b.’s criminal intentions. the court noted that c. had changed her depositions given during criminal investigation, in which she had stated that b. had revealed her criminal intentions, and had chosen to rely on those initial depositions. the district court convicted both b. and the applicant on all counts, sentencing b. to seven years’ imprisonment, but absolving her from the execution of the sentence because she was infected with hiv, and sentencing the applicant to eight years’ imprisonment. the prosecutor and the applicant appealed against this judgment. on 6 december 2007 after having heard the prosecutor, the applicant and the victim, the bender court of appeal concluded that the prosecution had failed to provide reliable evidence in support of the contention that the applicant had indeed acted together with b. and that the first-instance court had based its findings essentially on b.’s statements. the court of appeal noted that b.’s statements alone had been unreliable if unsupported by other witness statements and evidence. the court therefore allowed the applicant’s appeal, acquitted him of all charges and released him. the court upheld b.’s conviction and ordered that she serve her sentence only after her child had turned eight years of age. the prosecutor appealed against this judgment. on 1 april 2008 the supreme court of justice held a hearing at which the applicant and his lawyer were absent. during the proceedings the applicant was represented by a pro bono lawyer and no witnesses gave evidence. according to the applicant, his chosen representative never received a summons for this hearing. the court quashed the judgment of the bender court of appeal, upheld the applicant’s conviction by the first-instance court and ordered a fresh examination of the case in respect of b. it did not examine directly any evidence and based its findings on the case file as established by the lower courts. the supreme court concluded that the court of appeal had reached incorrect conclusions on the basis of the file. on 20 october 2008 the chișinău court of appeal held a hearing in the absence of the applicant and of his representative. the court re‑examined and dismissed as ill-founded the applicant’s appeal against the judgment of ștefan-vodă district court of 8 june 2007. it allowed the prosecutor’s appeal and sentenced b. to seven years’ imprisonment in a closed-type detention facility, without allowing any adjournment for serving the sentence. on 27 november 2008 the applicant was arrested at his place of work and only then was he informed of the judgments of the supreme court of justice of 1 april 2008 and of the chișinău court of appeal of 20 october 2008. the applicant appealed against the latter, arguing, inter alia, that he had not been legally summonsed and that in his absence the court had adopted a decision relying on assumptions rather than on factual evidence. s., a victim, also submitted an extraordinary appeal, arguing that the proceedings had been unfair because she had also not been summoned and that because the applicant had been convicted unfairly because he was not guilty.
the applicant was born in 1975 and lives in chişinău. the applicant had a dispute with h. over ownership of a house. he brought a claim against h. seeking acknowledgement of his property rights, as his father’s heir, and h.’s eviction from the house. h. lodged a counterclaim, seeking acknowledgement of her property rights to the house as she had built it. on 20 december 2007 the buiucani district court dismissed h.’s counterclaim and allowed the applicant’s claim in full. on 20 may 2008 the chișinău court of appeal upheld the earlier judgment and dismissed h.’s appeal. h. did not attend the appellate hearing, even though the summons had been repeatedly sent to the address she had provided in her appeal. a registered letter was returned with a note stating that h. did not live at the address indicated by her. the judgment became final after the expiry of the two-month time-limit for lodging an appeal on points of law. on 11 may 2009 h. lodged an appeal on points of law with the supreme court of justice, stating that she had only learned of the judgment of 20 may 2008 on 23 april 2009. in her application, she indicated the same address as in the proceedings before the court of appeal. the applicant asked the supreme court of justice to dismiss the appeal as being lodged outside the legal time-limit. he submitted that since it had been h. who had lodged the appeal with the chişinău court of appeal, it had been her duty to enquire about the progress of the proceedings and not to wait for a year before doing so. on 16 october 2009 the supreme court of justice allowed h.’s appeal on points of law, quashed the previous judgments and delivered a new judgment on the merits of the case dividing the disputed house into equal shares between the applicant and h. the court argued that the appeal had not been lodged outside the time-limit because h. had not attended the hearing before the court of appeal and there was nothing in the file to suggest that that court had informed her of the availability of the full judgment. the court concluded that without any evidence of the date when h. had learned of the judgment, her appeal was considered to have been submitted on time.
the first applicant was born in 1984 and the second applicant in 2009. a had a relationship with c and in 2009 their daughter, b, was born. the following day a called the polyclinic and scheduled an appointment for b for 20 june 2014. the relevant parts of that report read as follows:
“assessment and opinion of the social worker
the girl came to the [interview with] the social worker accompanied by her parents ... during the interview with the parents, the girl entered the [interview] room several times. ...
it is recommended that the girl receives supportive supervision over her further development. [ on 5 september 2014 the y welfare centre sent its report on a, b and c to the y municipal court. on 6 october 2014 the y police interviewed b’s babysitter, who described incidents of sexual behaviour by b. on the same day, the police provided the z state attorney’s office with another special report on the actions taken following a’s criminal complaint. she says that she has not had similar experiences with anyone else. ...
during examination the girl attempted to make inappropriate contact with the doctor writing the report. she stopped playing with toys and approached him from behind, tried to hold his upper arm and leant her head against it. on the basis of her playing and drawings and the information given by both parents, it could be concluded that the child expresses a premature interest in sexuality which is repeated constantly, so it cannot be seen as behaviour appropriate for [the child’s] age, but as behaviour which indicates [the existence of] trauma. although the child shows erotic behaviour inappropriate for her age, her inducement by the mother is so obvious as well as her taking of the child to various institutions and psychiatrists, that no credibility can any longer be given to the child’s statements. when experts point out her failures, she becomes verbally aggressive. i consider both parents responsible for such a state of the girl. the decision describes in detail all the evidence gathered. polyclinic’s report ... shows that the child was exposed to inappropriate content and/or conduct by an adult with sexual connotations, the fact is that none of the four institutions which had previously treated the child, including the a.b.r. on 7 may 2018 a municipal court awarded c custody of b, finding it in the child’s best interest to live with her father.

the applicant company has its registered office in istanbul. blasco is the successor of a soviet state-owned company which until the late 1980s was one the largest shipping companies in the world and operated hundreds of commercial vessels. in august 1997 the applicant company also entered into a bareboat charter agreement with blasco for one of its ships. on 25 december 1998 bankruptcy proceedings were initiated in respect of blasco. it appears that they were then reinitiated and discontinued at some point in 2001. on 29 september 2003 the applicant company lodged an application with the commercial court seeking recognition of the debt owed to it by blasco in the amount stipulated in the agreement of 20 june 2001 (see paragraph 12 above). in order to show the latter, the applicant company would need to provide the original documents showing the basis on which the debts had arisen. the case was remitted to the commercial court. on 24 february 2006 the commercial court rejected the applicant company’s claims as insufficiently substantiated. on the same day the court ordered the initiation of a financial rehabilitation procedure in respect of blasco under a court-appointed receiver. the applicant company appealed against the rejection of its claim. on 12 august 2008 the court of appeal upheld the commercial court’s ruling of 24 february 2006 concerning the applicant company’s claims. among other arguments the applicant company further submitted that the courts dealing with its case lacked impartiality. in that letter the court president pointed out that the president’s earlier instruction to the cabinet of ministers concerning the need to take steps to improve the blasco situation had not been complied with and that the court had been unable to obtain information from the authorities about the debtor’s assets for more than seven years. on 21 january 2009 the hcc allowed the applicant company’s appeal in part, quashed the court of appeal’s decision of 12 august 2008, and remitted the case to the court of appeal on the grounds that the latter had essentially required the applicant company to comply with the requirements of domestic ukrainian law concerning record-keeping and submit documentary proof to prove its claims, whereas it should have determined the applicable law and evaluated the claims in that light. however, at the same time it refused to include them in the register of creditors’ claims, holding that the latter had to be done in separate proceedings. the ministry of transport appealed, but on 10 november 2010 its appeal was dismissed by the hcc. the ruling of 27 october 2009 then became final. on 8 august 2012 the court of appeal dismissed an appeal by the receiver and upheld that ruling. on 22 february 2013 the applicant company requested the withdrawal of judge b., who was presiding over the bankruptcy proceedings at the time, and all the judges of the commercial court. it referred to a newspaper article published in 2001. on 29 march 2013 the court of appeal’s registry received blasco’s application requesting the court to set aside its ruling of 27 october 2009 to recognise the applicant company’s claims (see paragraph 30 above) in the light of “newly discovered circumstances”. the court of appeal found that charterers had presented unsubstantiated bills to blasco for vessel operating costs which were the charterers’ responsibility to bear. on 17 june 2013 the applicant company appealed. on 8 october 2013 the hcc dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of 30 may 2013. the applicant company was served with the earlier decision on 12 november 2013. there were, therefore, no grounds to examine the petition by the supreme court (see paragraph 47 below for the relevant provisions of the domestic law). in may 2005 the commercial court and the court of appeal moved into an office building at 29 shevchenko boulevard in odessa. according to the applicant company, that building used to belong to blasco and remained on blasco’s balance sheet. according to a clipping from an odessa newspaper submitted by the application company, at a press conference in 2001 blasco’s then ceo stated that, while the bankruptcy proceedings were pending against blasco, the commercial court was looking for new premises.
the applicant was born in 1980 and lives in tbilisi. the report, which stated that he had been arrested after being questioned as a witness, also noted that he had bruises in the tailbone area, buttocks and left thigh, and haemorrhages on his left eye, right cheek and his nose. by a decision of 28 may 2011 a judge, acting at the request of the prosecution, remanded the applicant in custody for fifty-five days. at the detention hearing, the applicant challenged the official report of his arrest and stated that he had been apprehended on 26 may in kintsvisi, rather than on 27 may 2011 in tbilisi. he had then been transferred to tbilisi police headquarters, where after having been physically assaulted again, he had been questioned for about six hours. the applicant maintained that the actual time of his arrest was different from the time of the arrest indicated in the official record. the decision was served on the applicant on 9 june 2011. on 21 july 2011 the applicant’s trial started. in tbilisi he had been subjected to further abuse and psyshological pressure with the prupose of extracting a confession from him. by a decision of 12 march 2012 the supreme court of georgia rejected an appeal by the applicant on points of law as inadmissible. on admission he underwent a visual examination which confirmed bruises and haemorrhages on his body and face (see paragraphs 9-10 above). on 1 june 2011 the prison administration sent a copy of the above report together with the applicant’s complaint about his alleged ill-treatment to the chief prosecutor’s office of georgia and requested the initiation of proceedings. in support of his allegations he submitted a photo, allegedly taken during his initial questioning, showing injuries on his face. he reiterated his version of events concerning his arrest and subsequent ill‑treatment. he claimed that he had been punched in the face by one of the officers of the special forces in kintsvisi. one of them, according to the applicant, had been wearing a mask. in tbilisi two police officers had further subjected him to physical and psychological abuse. the applicant subsequently filed several complaints criticising the lack of progress in the investigation and particularly the fact that his detailed statement had not given rise to a number of further procedural measures. during 2012 the office of the public defender of georgia, acting at the request of the applicant, sent three requests for information to the office of the chief prosecutor of georgia concerning the investigation into the alleged ill-treatment of the applicant. on 18 december 2012 the applicant was questioned again. the applicant also provided a physical description of the officers allegedly implicated in his ill-treatment and claimed that he could identify at least two of them. they also had, as the applicant could remember, damaged ears, an identifiable feature of wrestlers. according to the record, the applicant claimed to have sustained those injuries prior to his arrest. in june 2017 the investigator questioned two former high officials of the kareli police. on 19 july 2017 the offence under the investigation was reclassified into an offence of exceeding power by using violence, an offence under article 333 § 3 (b) of the criminal code. they provided detailed description of their individual experience of the ill-treatment focusing in addition on the physical description of the officers involved. the applicant’s letter has apparently gone unanswered. 8 prison, and of clerics from the kintsvisi monastery. they also claimed hearing the officers speak megrelian. according to the case-file the proceedings are still pending.
the applicants purchased licences for gambling operations for the periods indicated in the appendix. they (except the third applicant; see paragraphs 43-47 below) operated gambling businesses. on 26 december 2008 parliament adopted the bill at its first reading. the incident attracted considerable public attention. on 8 may 2009 the ministry of finance issued an order by which it suspended all gambling licences until 7 june 2009 with immediate effect. he pointed out, in particular, that:
(i) the licensing law did not provide for such grounds for the revocation of licences as the banning of a particular activity;
(ii) the proposed law was contrary to the constitutional provisions protecting property (see paragraph 58 below);
(iii) the proposed law was silent regarding the matter of expenses already committed by businesses for the acquisition of licences and for rent; and
(iv) businesses would sue the state for the funds they had paid for licences and permits and for any other damage they would incur if the bill became law. it relied on various provisions of domestic law. that law had not been declared unconstitutional by the constitutional court. therefore, there was no indication of unlawful action on the part of the state. neither the prohibition law nor the budget provided for any compensation. it raised essentially the same arguments. the applicant company lodged an appeal on points of law. it repeated the other arguments it had raised in the first appeal. in that context she pointed out that, in accordance with the court’s judgment in tre traktörer ab (cited above), licences constituted “possessions” for the purposes of article 1 of protocol no. she relied on the provisions of domestic law incorporating the convention and the court’s case-law and the primacy of the former (see paragraphs 74 and 76 below) and argued that the prohibition law, by revoking her licence, had terminated her property rights within the meaning of the legislative takings clause. on 15 december 2011 the kyiv commercial court rejected her claim on the grounds that the prohibition law did not provide for the reimbursement of the licence fees paid for licences revoked by operation of that law. in the second set of proceedings (application form submitted on 4 november 2013), the applicant sought to have the acts of the cabinet of ministers and of the ministry of finance regarding the one-month suspension of her licence declared unlawful and quashed (see paragraph 11 above). one of the other claimant companies lodged an appeal on points of law, which the applicant joined. on 28 may 2013 the high administrative court upheld the court of appeal’s decision, having largely repeated its reasoning. on 10 november 2008 the applicant company paid the full price for a five-year licence to the state treasury and on 14 november 2008 it obtained its licence, valid from 28 october 2008 to 27 october 2013. it relied on the provisions concerning reimbursement of erroneous or excess payments to the treasury and the provisions of the code of administrative justice that required the courts to give judgment even in the absence of relevant legislation (see paragraphs 76 and 77 below). it argued that, because the prohibition law had revoked its licence in the absence of any grounds for doing so under the licensing law and, indeed, in the absence of any wrongdoing on its part, the domestic law did not meet the requirement of “foreseeability” under the convention. article 8 of the constitution provides that the provisions of the constitution have direct effect and guarantees the right to apply to the courts relying directly on the constitution. article 41 guarantees the right to property. the right of private property is inviolable. the law did not contain any provisions on the revocation of licences in the event of the prohibition of a previously lawful licensed activity. it also provides that a person can be held liable for lawful acts where the code and other laws so provide. article 1173 of the code requires the public authorities to compensate for damage caused by unlawful decisions, actions or inaction of such authorities. there is no need to show that the authority acted with intent or negligence. m for others); (iv) special certification for gambling equipment and software.
the applicants were born in 1976 and 1982 and live in khust and kharkiv respectively. the first applicant lodged a claim against a social security authority, seeking an increase in the amount of child allowance she was receiving. a first-instance court allowed her claim in part. that judgment was upheld on appeal but the social security authority lodged a further appeal on points of law. on 6 november 2012 the higher administrative court (“the hac”), having examined the appeal, quashed the lower courts’ judgments and dismissed the applicant’s claim. the second applicant moved from the territory of the republic of moldova controlled by the so‑called “moldavian republic of transdniestria” (“mrt”) (see ilaşcu and others v. moldova and russia [gc], no. 48787/99, echr 2004‑vii) to ukraine to take up permanent residence. under domestic law, repatriating ukrainians were entitled to the tax-free and duty-free import of their foreign-registered vehicles. however, the customs office refused to apply this tax exemption in the applicant’s case on the grounds that the car had not been registered by the appropriate authorities of the republic of moldova. she challenged this refusal before the administrative courts. a first-instance court allowed her claim and ordered the customs office to clear her car through customs. that judgment was upheld on appeal but the customs office lodged a further appeal on points of law. on 4 april 2013 the hac allowed the appeal, quashed the lower courts’ decisions and dismissed the applicant’s claim. both applicants alleged that the hac, contrary to domestic law (see paragraph 11 below), had not sent them copies of the appeals lodged in their cases or informed them of the pending appeals by any other means, thus depriving them of an opportunity to respond. they alleged that they had only learned of the appeal proceedings when they had been served with the hac’s final decisions quashing the lower courts’ decisions in their favour. as worded at the relevant time, articles 214 and 215 of the 2005 code of administrative justice provided that a hac judge-rapporteur would decide, having considered an appeal, whether to initiate proceedings to review the lower courts’ decisions on points of law. if the judge decided to initiate such proceedings, he or she was required to inform the parties of that decision and serve a copy of the appeal on the opposing party with a time-limit for responding. the relevant provisions of the code concerning the procedure for serving court documents are summarised in lazarenko and others v. ukraine (nos. 70329/12 and 5 others, § 15, 27 june 2017).
the applicant company, an editorial and publishing house registered in moscow, edits and publishes a national newspaper with a circulation of 500,000, the novaya gazeta (“the newspaper”). most of the crew died within minutes of the explosions. it is not known for certain how long the men remained alive after the explosions. on 4 january 2003 his complaint was dismissed. on 21 april 2004 the military court of the moscow garrison confirmed the decision of 22 july 2002. between 2000 and 2005 the applicant company published in the newspaper a number of articles written by the second applicant covering the kursk catastrophe and the investigation into it. it was timed to commemorate the third anniversary of the kursk catastrophe. against the decision to discontinue the investigation. ’s arguments and reconsider their decision not to prosecute the senior naval officers. of making a reputation for himself out of the kursk catastrophe. presided over the panel of medical experts (which means that he was responsible for collating all the medical expert opinions in the case file). ... the expert examination performed by v.k. ...

“in the court’s opinion, the analysis of the impugned statements reveals that they contain allegations that v.k. performed an expert examination with the intention of receiving a predetermined result, that is, he was biased and had a personal interest in the proceedings. and tarnish his honour, dignity and business reputation. in the statement of appeal, the respondent [company] claims that the journalist expressed her opinion, which was based on the criminal case material, and that civil law does not hold a journalist liable for the expression of a subjective opinion. on 23 march 2006 the applicant company transferred to the bailiffs’ bank account rub 50,009 to be paid to v.k. it is not clear whether the second applicant paid the amount which the district court ordered her to pay to v.k.
the applicant was born in 1937 and lives in orhei. the facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. on 16 january 1997 the orhei mayor’s office attested the property right of a number of private individuals over plots of land in the town. after his death the applicant took possession of the land and used continuously for her own needs. on 10 september 1999 the territorial cadastre office registered the plot of land as belonging to c. 9. on 31 january 2000 the orhei mayor’s office amended the annex to its decision of 16 january 1997. c. continued to be mentioned as the owner of the relevant plot of land. it claimed that the title had been issued in error since c. had moved to an apartment provided by the town and was no longer eligible to obtain such land. following this relocation, the cadastre office was supposed to remove c.’s title from the list, which it had failed to do. in the meantime, on an unspecified date the applicant initiated a court action aimed at extending the time-limit for accepting her brother’s inheritance. the two court actions were joined by the court on 6 november 2006. on 15 february 2017 the orhei district court rejected the court action lodged by the mayor’s office and accepted that of the applicant. it noted, inter alia, that the applicant had raised the issue of expiry of the three-year limitation period and added that under article 78 of the old civil code (see paragraph 15 below), the court had to apply the rules concerning the limitation period regardless of the parties’ arguments. it found that the mayor’s office had missed the three-year limitation period. however, in the operative part the court omitted to refer to the expiry of the limitation period and found that the court action had been groundless. the court also accepted the applicant’s action, extending the time-limit for accepting her brother’s inheritance since she had taken possession of the relevant land immediately after his death. on 4 october 2007 the chișinău court of appeal overturned that judgment, accepting the appeal lodged by the mayor’s office. it annulled c.’s title to the relevant land, finding that he had obtained it in error and that under the applicable law he could not be the owner of that land. on 12 march 2008 the supreme court of justice upheld the judgment of the chișinău court of appeal. the applicant submitted documents showing that she had paid various taxes for the land in question over the years. the relevant provisions of the civil code (1964, in force before 12 june 2003) reads as follows:
“article 74. the general limitation period for defending, by a court action, against the breach of a person’s rights (prescripția) is of three years ...”
“article 78. mandatory application of the limitation period. the competent court ... shall apply the limitation period regardless of the parties’ request.” in order to inherit, the heir must accept the inheritance. ... it shall be considered that the heir has accepted the inheritance if he/she took actual possession or administration of inheritance assets ...” 16. (1)  the civil law has no retroactive effect. it does not modify and does not annul the conditions of creation of a legal situation which previously appeared, nor the conditions of ending of a legal situation which previously ended. ...
(6)  the provisions of the new law concerning limitation periods ... shall apply to limitation periods which started before the date of entry into force of the new law, but did not end before that date. ... the start, the suspension and the interruption of the limitation period shall be determined under the old law for the period before the entry into force of the new law.
following judicial proceedings which ended with a final judgment of the bălţi court of appeal of 8 december 2009, the applicant company obtained a final ruling obliging the cadastral authority to register immovable property privatised by it in 1999 and in 2004 in its name. on an unspecified date the defendant in the proceedings lodged a request for a review of the judgment of 8 december 2009, seeking its annulment on the grounds that in a technical report dated 25 may 2009 it had been stated that the immovable property in question did not qualify as immovable property (“the review request”). on 24 august 2010 the bălţi court of appeal dismissed the review request on the grounds that the information contained in the technical report of 25 may 2009 did not qualify as new and relevant information which could not have been obtained before the delivery of the final judgment in the case. on 22 december 2010 the supreme court quashed the above judgment and ordered a re-examination of the review request. on 16 november 2011 the chişinău court of appeal re-examined the review request and allowed it. the court relied on grounds other than those relied upon by the defendant in framing the request. in particular, the court relied on a government decision from 2005, in accordance with which the disputed goods had been transferred to the defendant’s control. the court quashed the final judgment of 8 december 2009 and ordered a fresh examination of the case. on 16 august 2012, after examining the merits of the case, the edineţ district court again found in favour of the applicant company and required the cadastral authority to register some of the immovable property privatised by the applicant company in 1999 and in 2004 in its name. the cadastral authority challenged that judgment by lodging an appeal and the proceedings are still pending.

the applicant was born in 1980 and lives in püspökladány. the incident was reported to püspökladány police station. according to the file produced in the subsequent criminal proceedings, the applicant refused to take a breathalyser test for alcohol. at the police station the applicant started to insult the police officers and was handcuffed again. according to the applicant, he was also placed in leg restraints, during which time he suffered injuries. the applicant told a doctor that he was unable to urinate. according to the police reports, the applicant was under the influence of alcohol, “uncooperative, making the insertion of a catheter necessary”; he was also “violent and resisted the procedure”. afterwards, the doctor cut the applicant’s shirt and took a blood sample. on 22 april 2010 the applicant was fined 50,000 hungarian forints (huf – approximately 180 euros (eur)) for the minor offence of failing to comply with lawful police measures. furthermore, in a judgment of 15 november 2011 the püspökladány district court found the applicant guilty of disorderly conduct, drink-driving and violence against a representative of a public authority. he was sentenced to two years and three months’ imprisonment. the applicant challenged the evidence obtained through the urine test, and the court found it established that he had consented to the use of the catheter, as evidenced by five or six witness testimonies, and he had only withdrawn his consent upon realising that the intervention was painful. on appeal, the applicant’s sentence was reduced to one year and nine months’ imprisonment suspended for five years by the debrecen regional court. in a parallel procedure, on 16 march 2010 the applicant lodged a complaint with the independent police complaints board (“the board”), the body responsible for inquiring into alleged violations of fundamental rights committed by the police, challenging the use of handcuffs and leg restraints, the fact that he had been held for questioning, his ill-treatment at the hands of the police officers, and the forcible taking of urine and blood samples. according to the doctor, the applicant had been cooperative and had only turned violent at a later stage. in any event, according to professional guidelines, if a urine test could not be carried out, a blood test was sufficient. in an opinion of 4 august 2010 the board found that the use of handcuffs had been legitimate and that the ill-treatment alleged could not be established. it forwarded its opinion to the commander of the national police service. the decision established that the applicant had informed the doctor on duty that he had been unable to produce a urine sample and that he would not drink water in order to be able to do it later. he had behaved aggressively and had been uncooperative, but had nonetheless agreed to the catheterisation before witnesses by loudly screaming “do the catheterisation”, and had undressed voluntarily. he had only been restrained to prevent him from causing injuries to himself or the doctor, once the procedure had started. he disputed the finding that he had voluntarily undressed for his catheterisation. on 7 february 2012 the budapest regional administrative and labour court dismissed his action. if an examination was considered invasive, oral consent was not sufficient. in any case, the procedure could always be stopped. the medical expert also stated that, in comparison to a blood test, a urine test was not a precise method to establish whether a person was under the influence of drugs. furthermore, catheterisation was a procedure that could be interrupted at any time. it had been up to the doctor and not the police officers to decide on the method by which to take a sample. the applicant lodged a petition for review with the kúria, arguing that the commander of the national police service had failed to establish the facts of the case. the kúria upheld the first-instance judgment on 25 march 2014, endorsing its reasoning.

the applicants were born in 1965, 1977 and 1976 respectively. the third applicant lives in shilka in the zabaykalskiy region. the judgment was upheld on appeal by the supreme court of russia on 19 june 2003. the first applicant did not allege in his appeal arguments that the composition of the first-instance court had been unlawful. on 22 september 2004 the eniseyskiy district court of the krasnoyarsk region brought the first applicant’s conviction in line with newly introduced amendments to the russian criminal code, having made minor corrections to the legal characterisation of his acts. his sentence was left essentially unchanged. that decision was upheld following a supervisory review by the krasnoyarsk regional court on 30 may 2006. in 2007 the first applicant made some enquiries to check the lawfulness of the composition of the first-instance court in his case. eventually, he found out that two lay assessors who had sat in his case at the first level of jurisdiction had not had authority to take part in the proceedings. by a judgment of 5 december 2003 the leninskiy district court of krasnoyarsk convicted the second applicant of murder and destruction of property and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment to be served in a correctional colony with a strict regime. the details of the third applicant’s criminal history are unknown. the first applicant was placed in up-288/t prison in minusinsk, where it appears he remains to date. the first applicant submitted a copy of a judgment in the case of another inmate, which stated that the prison guard who monitored the cells in that prison was a woman. the screenshots show that in both cells there was a cctv camera installed above the door, at ceiling level, in such a manner that the entire cell was clearly visible, including the bed. between 22 may 2007 and 24 may 2010 the second applicant also served a sentence in up-288/t prison. according to him, his cell was under constant surveillance by prison guards by a cctv camera installed inside the cell. the applicant submitted that the prison guard who monitored his cell was a woman, as at times he could hear her giving him orders via loudspeaker. whilst serving a prison sentence in ik-2 (special-regime correctional colony) in the zabaykalskiy region, on 22 june 2013 the third applicant was transferred to iz-1 (pre-trial detention centre) in the same region with a view to ensuring his participation in court proceedings unrelated to this case. the third applicant was placed in cell no. 465, where he remained until 22 february 2014. according to him, the cell was designed for two inmates, but most of the time he was there alone. the cell was under permanent surveillance by a cctv camera operated by female guards. he argued that permanent video surveillance of his cell by female operators was humiliating as, in particular, he had to undress in plain view of them, which breached his rights. at a hearing a representative of the detention centre authorities conceded that the duty officers who performed video surveillance were women, but argued that they were merely performing their professional duties. in a judgment of 5 july 2013 the district court dismissed the third applicant’s complaint. 204-dsp of 3 november 2005 (see paragraph 36 below). in that connection, the court noted that no evidence had been submitted to it to show that the officers of pre-trial detention centre iz-1 had breached or acted outside the scope of their professional duties. the district court also pointed out that decision no. 1393-o-o of the constitutional court of russia dated 19 october 2010 (see paragraphs 42-43 below) stated that use by the authorities of various pre-trial detention centres and penal institutions of technical means of surveillance and control was part of the mechanism that ensured detainees’ personal safety and respect for their rights, as well as performance by them of their obligations. in the district court’s view, such use thus pursued constitutional aims and could not be regarded as a disproportionate restriction of the third applicant’s rights.
